Press, 1995), about which the reviewer in Foreign Affairs wrote, "Woodward's argument is big and bold, challenging almost every major interpretation, from capitalist assumptions misapplied in a reform socialist context by outside analysis, to explanations of the sources of Yugoslavia's particular dilemmas and failures, to the meaning of Tito's death in the ungluing of the country. It is intellectual discourse at a high level."Previously she was a senior research fellow at the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, University of London, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution (1990–99). During her time in Washington DC she taught graduate seminars at Georgetown, George Washington, and Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
