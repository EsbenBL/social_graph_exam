=== Areas of Research ===
He has published on: the role of the service sector in trade, growth and development; regional economic integration; the WTO; and the social and environmental effects (sustainability impacts) of globalization. His research on the economics of services has emphasized linkages between rising complexity in production and the rising share of producer services with growth, a distinct mechanism from the consumption-side productivity trap with consumer services known as Baumol's cost disease. His research also includes computational economics (including quantitative trade policy modeling) as well as the role of regional agreements and the multilateral system in reducing economic policy uncertainty   He also writes on current international economic policy.
