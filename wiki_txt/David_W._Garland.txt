From 1979 until 1997 he taught at the University of Edinburgh's Department of Criminology (which later became the Centre for Law and Society) where he was first a Lecturer, then a Reader, and finally the holder of a Personal Chair in Penology. He has held visiting positions at Leuven University, Belgium and the University of California, Berkeley. He was a Shelby Cullom Davis Fellow in Princeton University's history department, the 2012/2013 Douglas McK.

He is the author of an award-winning series of books on punishment and social control – Punishment and Welfare: A History of Penal Strategies (1985), Punishment and Modern Society: A Study in Social Theory (1990); The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society (2001) and Peculiar Institution: America's Death Penalty in an Age of Abolition (2010) – as well as a number of articles on the history and character of criminology. In addition, he has written on such topics as postmodernism, governmentality, risk, moral panics, the concept of culture, and the welfare state.
He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the British Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Society of Criminology, and a fellow-designate of the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford.
