== Political activity ==
Jega is a former president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and was an opponent of the Babangida military government in the early 1990s.
Politically leaning towards the left, as ASUU President he was closely associated with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), and continued that connection throughout his career. On 29 April 2010, he was invited as a guest lecturer for the NLC May Day celebration where he presented a paper on 50 Years of Nationhood: Challenges of Good Democratic Governance, Credible Election and the Working Class.
He is widely seen as an astute intellectual with a strong sense of ethics and morality.Jega was appointed a member of the Justice Mohammed Uwais Electoral Reform Committee, which submitted a report on 11th of December 2008 with recommendations that included establishing commissions to deal with Electoral Offences, Constituency Delimitation and Political Parties Registration and Regulation.
The committee also recommended proportional representation and that the INEC head should be appointed by the judiciary rather than the President.
On the 28 of March 2015, under his leadership, elections were conducted in what Nigerians and the World see as free, fair and credible which declared the APC Presidential candidate General Muhammadu Buhari as winner defeating the Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan. Jega, ahead of the 2023 Nigerian general elections formed a political opposition named Rescue Nigeria Project (RNP) alongside other past and present political stakeholders. 


== INEC nomination ==
Jega's nomination as INEC chairman was approved at a meeting of the National Council of State called by President Jonathan and attended by former heads of state Yakubu Gowon, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Abdulsalami Abubakar, Ernest Shonekan, Olusegun Obasanjo and Shehu Shagari.
The Senate President David Mark, Speaker of the House of Representatives Oladimeji Bankole, and most of the state Governors were also in attendance.
Unanimous approval by the council of the nominee for this critical appointment avoided controversy about whether or not the President should appoint the chairman of the INEC.
Reactions to the announcement from a broad spectrum of political leaders and organisations were positive, although some voiced concern that it could be too late to implement real reforms before the 2011 elections.During the campaigning for the 2015 Nigerian general election, Attahiru Jega "faced fierce criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party."  Nonetheless, a 23 March 2015 article in Vanguard asserted that "most experts believe Jega will seek to declare an accurate result as quickly as possible, regardless of any political interference he may face."
