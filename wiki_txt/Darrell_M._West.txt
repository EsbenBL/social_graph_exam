== Career ==
His book Digital Government is the winner of the Don K. Price award for best book on technology and his co-authored book Cross Talk won the Doris Graber Award for best book on political communications.His book Billionaires: Reflections on the Upper Crust (Brookings Institution Press, 2014) looks at the 1,645 billionaires in the world today and how "wealthification" is affecting politics and society. It goes inside the world of the ultra-wealthy and examines the role of Sheldon Adelson, Michael Bloomberg, David and Charles Koch, George Soros, Tom Steyer, and Donald Trump, as well as international billionaires around the globe. He argues that the growing political engagement of the supra-wealthy raises important questions about influence, transparency, and government performance. It was named by the Washington Post as one of the best political books of 2014 and was the winner of the Foreword Review Book of the Year Silver Award for Political Science.
He was honored by Public Administration Review for having written one of the 75 most influential articles since 1940. This was for his 2004 article "E-Government and the Transformation of Service Delivery and Citizen Attitudes".In 2015, his project on financial inclusion was named by philanthropist Bill Gates as one of the top five "good news stories" of the year. Writing on December 18, 2015 at his personal blog, Gates said that "mobile banking exceeds our optimistic projections" and is "one of the best tools we've ever seen for helping people lift themselves out of poverty".In 2018, The Washington Post reported that West has spoken at various events hosted by Huawei since 2012 and that Huawei has financially supported West's research. At a 2014 conference, West stated, "the way that Huawei has been singled out by the US government has been unfair and counterproductive".
