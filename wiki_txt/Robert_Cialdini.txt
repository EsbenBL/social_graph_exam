He is best known for his 1984 book on persuasion and marketing,  Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.  It was based on three "undercover" years applying for and training at used car dealerships, fund-raising organizations, and telemarketing firms to observe real-life situations of persuasion. He found that influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity. In 2016 he proposed a seventh principle. He called it the unity principle. The more we identify ourselves with others, the more we are influenced by these others.The book has sold over three million copies and has been translated into thirty languages.
