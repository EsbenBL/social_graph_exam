== Nine Mayan Women ==
Elmendorf's best-known work, Nine Mayan Women, illustrates her case studies in the village of Chan Kom of Mayan women in the Yucatán Peninsula. The book studies nine women who are spoken about in chapter two. She covered background information on Chan Kom as well as the study itself. The rest of the book is a broader reflection of the preceding vignettes interwoven with mentions and attribution of other sources that relate to Mayan communities and culture. The main focus of her study was on the quality of life issues and the life satisfaction of Mayan women. In studying these aspects, she was able to see the Mayan women are happy and content with their lives and appear to value work as they also share a mutual respect with their husbands.Her work has been reviewed by other scholars like Steffen W. Schmidt in Latin American Research Review.  And influences other scholar's work like John G. Frazier (and others) in their book, Rights, resources, culture, and conservation in the land of the Maya.
