Riane Tennenhaus Eisler (born 22 July 1931) is an Austrian-born American systems scientist and author who writes about the effect of gender politics historically on society. She is most known for her 1987 book The Chalice and the Blade, in which she coined the terms "partnership" and "dominator."


== Life ==
Eisler was born in Vienna in 1931 before her family fled from the Nazis to Cuba.  She later emigrated to the United States.  She has degrees in sociology and law from the University of California. She is an attorney, legal scholar and author. She is the founder of her "Center for Partnership Systems".She has published thirteen books, including one memoir, The Gate, published in 2000. Her first book was Dissolution: Dissolution: No-Fault Divorce, Marriage, and the Future of Women. Her second book was on the Equal Rights Amendment.In her third book The Chalice and the Blade, published in 1987, she coined the terms "partnership" and "dominator" to describe the two underlying forms of society. Partnership societies are characterized by gender equality, peace, sustainability, caring, while dominator societies are characterized by sexism, chronic war, ecological destruction, and unsustainability. According to her research, which references the work of archaeologists Marija Gimbutas and James Mellaart, among others, for millennia human societies were built on partnership, in which human capacity to give, nurture and sustain life was held in the highest regard, and shared responsibility was the gold standard. The fall into domination occurred around 6,500 years ago. Eisler has argued that the switch from partnership to dominator has led to gender biased monogamy, prostitution and illegitimacy, women's dependence and the acceptance of war.

Philosopher Terence McKenna referenced Eisler's work throughout his writings and talks, including in The Archaic Revival. Eisler's term dominator culture has been used by writers ranging from bell hooks to Tao Lin.
