Robert Charles Lieberman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1964. He received his B.A. degree from Yale University in 1986 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1994. From 1994 to 2013 he taught at Columbia University, where he served as chairman of the international and public affairs department from 2007 to 2012 and interim dean of the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) from 2012 to 2013. He was instrumental in recruiting leading faculty to SIPA, restructuring the curriculum, and convening an international conference on the future of global public policy education. In 2013, he was named the 14th provost of Johns Hopkins University, concurrently joining the faculty of the department of Political Science at the Johns Hopkins Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts & Sciences on July 1, 2013. In this role, Lieberman was responsible for "promoting and coordinating the university’s teaching and research mission" across the university's nine academic divisions. He also had oversight for research at a university that for thirty-five years has led the country in higher education research spending. In August 2016 he stepped down as provost and was appointed Krieger-Eisenhower Professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Political Science. He now lives in Baltimore, Maryland in the Roland Park neighborhood with his family. His wife is Lauren Osborne, and their children include a son Benjamin and twins, Martha and Aaron.
