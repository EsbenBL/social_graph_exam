Stanisław Andrzejewski (or Stanislav Andreski) (8 May 1919, in Częstochowa – 26 September 2007, in Reading, Berkshire) was a Polish-British sociologist. He is known for his indictment of the "pretentious nebulous verbosity" endemic in the modern social sciences in his classic work Social Sciences as Sorcery (1972).
Andrzejewski was a Polish Army officer. During the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 he was taken prisoner by the Soviets. He escaped to Britain and fought against the Germans on the Western Front in Władysław Anders' Polish II Corps.
At the University of Reading, United Kingdom, he was a professor of sociology, a department he founded in 1965.
