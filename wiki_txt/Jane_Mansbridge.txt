== Early life and education ==
Mansbridge received her B.A. from Wellesley College in 1961, her M.A. in history from Harvard in 1966, and her Ph.D. in government from Harvard in 1971.


== Career ==
Mansbridge previously taught at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.
Mansbridge is particularly known for the distinction between unitary and adversary democracy (based on common and conflicting interests respectively), and for her concepts of gyroscopic representation (based on inner motivation), the selection model of representation, and surrogate representation (representation of others outside one's district). She is currently working on the necessity for legitimate coercion created by our need for "free use" (or "free access") goods.
