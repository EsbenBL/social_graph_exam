== Research ==
Holzer's research has focused on the labor market problems of low-wage workers and other disadvantaged groups, particularly minority workers. He has studied the question of how employer characteristics, hiring practices and the job quality affect job opportunities for less-skilled workers, especially when they create "mismatches" between worker skills and those sought by employers, and between their respective geographic locations (or "spatial mismatch").
Holzer studied employer data extensively and implemented surveys of about 7000 firms during the 1990s on their hiring practices, skill needs and workforce characteristics. He analyzed trends in job quality and their effects on upward mobility for low-wage workers using LEHD data on workers and firms from the U.S. Census Bureau. He analyzed data on postsecondary education and employment outcomes, especially for disadvantaged workers.
Holzer's more recent work focuses on the challenges low-income youth and adults face in American higher education and in the job market. He has written extensively about the employment problems of disadvantaged men (especially those with criminal records), advancement prospects for the working poor, and workforce development policy. He also has written about welfare reform, discrimination, affirmative action, job training programs, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Holzer's research on employment issues and policy has been funded by grants from the Joyce Foundation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, the Institute for Research on Poverty, the Upjohn Institute, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Science Foundation, Ford Foundation, Mott Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation, the Gates Foundation, and the Public Policy Institute of California.
