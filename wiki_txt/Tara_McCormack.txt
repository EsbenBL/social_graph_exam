== Views ==
McCormack has a long association with LM Magazine and its successor Spiked magazine, and with their related projects such as the Battle of Ideas.In a 2007 article for Spiked reviewing a book by John Laughland on the Trial of Slobodan Milošević, she described the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) as practising "utter arbitrary lawlessness". The death of Milošević, in her opinion, "brought an end to the farce".


=== Syria ===
McCormack is a member of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media (SPM). In April 2018 The Times newspaper described the group as being "apologists for Assad". In response, McCormack said "What have we learnt from the air strikes? UK, US and France hold the UN Charter in contempt. They bombed on the basis of social media videos. By bombing the day the OPCW was to start work they also show contempt for this body. ... The front page of The Times was a hatchet job on me and other colleagues who are against intervention". McCormack has tweeted that Syria's civil defence volunteers, the White Helmets are "basically Al Qaeda" and "run by Jihadis".
