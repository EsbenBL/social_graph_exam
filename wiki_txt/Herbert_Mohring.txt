Herbert Mohring (1928 – June 4, 2012) was a transportation economist who taught at the University of Minnesota from 1961–1994. He received his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959, with a thesis on the life insurance industry supervised by Robert Solow.He is widely known for his identification of what was dubbed the Mohring effect of increasing returns in public transportation (see: Mohring (1972) for details).
Mohring and Harwitz (1962) also showed that the revenues from the first-best congestion tax exactly cover the capacity costs (which include depreciation and capital costs, but not investment costs) of highways when highways possess constant returns to scale.
