His research specialties included North American Indian ethnology, kinship, demography, and sociocultural evolution. His fieldwork included research with the Cheyenne, Mvskoke Creek, Seminole, Choctaw, Cree, and Pamunkey. His most recent work is a demographic exploration of the feasibility of space colonization, published by NASA in the book Interstellar Travel and Multi-Generational Space Ships.
He was featured in the "Spacemen” episode of National Geographic Channel’s Naked Science television series.  He worked as a consultant and expert witness on behalf of Native American groups who are seeking to protect their land, resources, and treaty rights, especially the descendants of those killed or attacked at the Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado in 1864, who were promised reparations under the Treaty of the Little Arkansas in 1865, which have never been paid. He was interested in the interactions between the biological and cultural aspects of "race," and was Editor-in-Chief of the 2007 Macmillan Encyclopedia of Race and Racism.  He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and former Chair of the Anthropology Section.
He lived in Gainesville, Florida with his wife, Shelley Arlen. They have two daughters. He died on 10 August 2016.
