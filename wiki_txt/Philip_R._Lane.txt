== Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland ==
Lane appeared regularly in the media prior to his appointment as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland's reputation was badly damaged in the Irish financial crisis. Lane has taken actions to address some of the main criticisms (e.g. explicit mortgage controls and the new modified gross national income metric), there is evidence other issues remain (e.g. commercial property bubbles, and light-touch regulation), and that new controls, such as mortgage limits, are being circumvented by Irish banks, and the Irish State itself.
