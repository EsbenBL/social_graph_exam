Martin Shubik (March 24, 1926 – August 22, 2018) was an American economist, who was Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Institutional Economics at Yale University.


== Work in economics ==
Before beginning his work in academia, Shubik studied at the University of Toronto and Princeton University. On the Yale faculty since 1963, Shubik specialized in strategic analysis, the study of financial institutions, the economics of corporate competition, and game theory. A collection of Shubik's papers, with an emphasis on his work with game theory, is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.   He wrote 21 books 331 articles, including Political Economy, Oligopoly and Experimental Games, 1999, and The Theory of Money and Financial Institutions, 2004.In 2010, Shubik was recognized by the American Economic Association as a Distinguished Fellow for "major contributions to a variety of fields in economics." The associated AEA citation discusses papers (co)authored by Shubik on computational and game-theoretical representations of for example:

a two-sided market in which a product that comes in large, indivisible units (houses, cars, etc.) is exchanged for money
the phenomenon of escalation among competitors [such that] actual behavior may deviate from the purely rational mode of play embodied in Nash equilibria
money play[ing] a crucial strategic role  [as a] central paradigm in monetary analysis [with the generality of the Walrasian model]
the shift in warfare brought about by the increasing permeability of national borders.He was elected to the 2018 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.


== Personal life ==
Shubik was born in New York and raised in Britain and Canada. He was one of three children. His siblings were Philippe Shubik, the cancer researcher and founder of the Toxicology Forum, and Irene Shubik, a British television drama producer.
