Nell-Breuning was not allowed to publish from 1936 to the end of Nazi Germany in 1945. After the war he lectured as an honorary professor at Goethe University at later established his own "Akademie der Arbeit" (Academy of Work). He exerted a strong influence on the social policy program of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and had a close relationship with the German trade unions. He died in Frankfurt am Main.
