After completing a B.A. (1983) in economics at Grove City, Boettke attended George Mason University where he earned an M.A. (1987) and a Ph.D. (1989) in economics. His thesis was The political economy of Soviet socialism, 1918–1928 under the supervision of Don Lavoie.

After receiving his doctoral degree, Boettke taught at several institutions, including Oakland University, Manhattan College and New York University. In 1998, he returned to George Mason University as a faculty member. In 2004, he was named a Hayek Fellow at the London School of Economics. He has also been a Faculty Fellow at the Charles University/Georgetown University American Institute for Political and Economic Studies in Prague and a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.

== Other pursuits ==
Boettke worked as a tennis instructor before pursuing his graduate degree in economics. After graduate school, he began coaching youth basketball and eventually coached at the high school and elite AAU level, qualifying for the AAU 16U National Championships in 2007. Several of his players reached college-level competition. In 2009, he was inducted as a coach into the local basketball Hall of Fame in Northern Virginia.


== Analytical anarchism ==
Analytical anarchism is the name given by Boettke to the positive political economy of anarchism, or anarchism from the economic point of view, in the libertarian tradition of Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty (1973) and David Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom (1973). Boettke claims that analytical anarchism has developed out of this tradition and is currently being pursued by economists such as Peter Leeson, Edward Stringham and Christopher Coyne. These professors are related to Mercatus Center and to the faculty of economics at George Mason University.
