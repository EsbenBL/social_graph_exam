=== Criminal charges ===
On April 8, 2004, Uekusa was arrested for trying to peep under a high school girl's skirt using his hand mirror on an escalator at Shinagawa Station of East Japan Railway Company in Minato, Tokyo. Immediately after the arrest, Uekusa admitted his guilt, and he apologized. He was dismissed from being a professor on May 7, 2004 because of the arrest, despite denying the charges.His trial opened at the Tokyo District Court on March 23, 2005, and the Chief Justice fined  him 500,000 yen and confiscated his hand mirror. He insisted that it was an "unfair judgement" and intended to appeal. The ruling was established however as he did not make the appeal by the deadline on April 6, 2005.Uekusa was arrested again at Keikyū Kamata Station for molesting a girl in a Keikyu train on September 13, 2006, at around 10:10 p.m. On September 27, 2006, Nagoya University of Commerce & Business announced that they had dismissed him from his duties as a visiting professor. Uekusa claimed to be innocent, saying that he was drunk when he was arrested, so he does not remember what happened that night. He was indicted for chikan on October 4, 2006.On January 22, 2007, Uekusa was released from the Tokyo Detention Center on bail of 6 million yen.On October 16, 2007, Uekusa was sentenced to four months in prison by Presiding Judge Sho Kamisaka of the Tokyo District Court. He repeated his earlier denials, but fabric traces on his suit in addition to witness testimony were enough to convince the court that he had groped under the victim's skirt. In handing down the sentence, Kamisaka noted that "The court cannot anticipate that the accused will be rehabilitated" on his own recognizance. Uekusa vowed to appeal, in a statement saying "the truth will always prevail." On April 16, 2008, The Tokyo High Court upheld a four-month prison term for Uekusa. On June 25, 2009, The Supreme Court turned down Uekusa's final appeal.In an interview with journalist Benjamin Fulford on June 19, 2008, he stated that he had been arrested in the national policy investigation after criticizing an economic policy by Junichiro Koizumi and Heizō Takenaka on a television program.
