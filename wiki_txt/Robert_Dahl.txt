Robert Alan Dahl (; December 17, 1915 – February 5, 2014) was an American political theorist and Sterling Professor of Political Science at Yale University. 
He established the pluralist theory of democracy—in which political outcomes are enacted through competitive, if unequal, interest groups—and introduced "polyarchy" as a descriptor of actual democratic governance. An originator of "empirical theory" and known for advancing behavioralist characterizations of political power, Dahl's research focused on the nature of decision making in actual institutions, such as American cities. He is the most important scholar associated with the pluralist approach to describing and understanding both city and national power structures.In addition to his work on the descriptive theory of democracy, he was long occupied with the formulation of the constituent elements of democracy considered as a theoretical but realizable ideal. By virtue of the cogency, clarity, and veracity of his portrayal of some of the key characteristics of realizable-ideal democracy, as well as his descriptive analysis of the dynamics of modern pluralist-democracy, he is considered one of the greatest theorists of democracy in history.

== Academic research ==


=== Early writings and pluralism ===
Dahl's influential early books include A Preface to Democratic Theory (1956), Who Governs? (1961), and Pluralist Democracy in the United States (1967), which presented pluralistic explanations for political rule in the United States.In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was involved in an academic disagreement with C. Wright Mills over the nature of politics in the United States.  Mills held that America's governments are in the grasp of a unitary and demographically narrow power elite. Dahl responded that there are many different elites involved, who have to work both in contention and in compromise with one another. If this is not democracy in a populist sense, Dahl contended, it is at least polyarchy (or pluralism). In perhaps his best known work, Who Governs? (1961), he examines the power structures (both formal and informal) in the city of New Haven, Connecticut, as a case study, and finds that it supports this view.From the late 1960s onwards, his conclusions were challenged by scholars such as G. William Domhoff and Charles E. Lindblom (a friend and colleague of Dahl).


=== Writing on power and influence ===
One of his many contributions is his explication of the varieties of power, which he defines as A getting B to do what A wants. Dahl prefers the more neutral "influence terms" (Michael G. Roskin), which he arrayed on a scale from best to worst: 

Rational Persuasion, the nicest form of influence, means telling the truth and explaining why someone should do something, like a doctor convincing a patient to stop smoking.
Manipulative persuasion, a notch lower, means lying or misleading to get someone to do something.
Inducement, still lower, means offering rewards or punishments to get someone to do something, like bribery.
Power threatens severe punishment, such as jail or loss of a job.
Coercion is power with no way out.
Physical force is backing up coercion with use or threat of bodily harm.Thus, the governments that use influence at the higher end of the scale are best. The worst use the unpleasant forms of influence at the lower end.


=== Writing on democracy and polyarchies ===

Dahl wrote many books on democracy throughout his career. The most influential are Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition (1971) and Democracy and Its Critics (1989).
In Polyarchy, Dahl uses the term "polyarchy" to refer to actual cases of democracy and provides a comprehensive discussion of possible causes of polyarchy.In his book, Democracy and Its Critics, Dahl clarifies his view about democracy. No modern country meets the ideal of democracy, which is as a theoretical utopia. Instead, he calls politically advanced countries "polyarchies". Polyarchies are "distinguished by the presence of seven institutions, all of which must exist for a government to be classified as a polyarchy:
Elected officials
Free and fair elections
Inclusive suffrage
Right to run for office
Freedom of expression
Alternative information
Associational autonomy


=== Criteria for a Democratic Process ===
Dahl specified five criteria for evaluating how democratic a process is:
Effective participation -- All members ought to have equal and effective opportunities to make their views known to other members.
Voting equality -- All members ought to have an equal and effective opportunity to vote, with votes counted as equal.
Enlightened understanding -- All members must have equal and effective opportunities to learn about the consequences and alternatives of a proposal.
Control of the agenda -- All members must have the exclusive opportunity  to choose if or how matters will be placed on the agenda.
Inclusion of adults -- All or most of adult permanent residents should be given the full rights of the above four criteria.


=== Later writings ===
In his later writing, Dahl examined democracy, in particular in the United States, with a critical view.
In How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (2001), Dahl argued that the US Constitution is much less democratic than it ought to be, given that its authors were operating from a position of "profound ignorance" about the future.  However, he adds that there is little or nothing that can be done about this "short of some constitutional breakdown, which I neither foresee nor, certainly, wish for."In On Political Equality (2006), Dahl addresses the issue of equality and discusses how and why governments have fallen short of their democratic ideals. He assesses the contemporary political landscape in the United States.
