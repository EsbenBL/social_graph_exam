His extensive writings have been published on four continents. His main works include: Gambling: Hazard and Reward (London University Press) and The Challenge of Corporatism (Macmillan). He also authored extensive research reports leading to policy implementation, and books and papers on globalism including, "The Third Way" and "American Declinism".


== History / career ==


=== Escape ===
Otto Neumann was born on 2 July 1922 in Vienna, Austria. At the age of 16, he was able to escape the Anschluss on the final Kindertransport out of Vienna leaving on 13 December 1938, from the Wien Westbahnhof train station.
After arriving in England, he was kept at a Dovercourt holiday camp until arrangements could be made for further care. He was offered a home with an English family, but after taking a placement exam, he was chosen as one of six older children arriving on the Kindertransport to earn a spot at the University of Oxford, studying there for 3 years.


=== Internment / war years ===
At the start of the war in 1939, there were 78,000 refugees in Britain who were considered "enemy aliens," a category that included all peoples living in the UK who were from Germany, Austria or Italy. Jewish people who had emigrated from Germany to escape Hitler's antisemitism were also considered enemy aliens.Otto was unable to finish studies at Oxford due to his being interned as an enemy alien on the first day of his inter-BSC college exam.
On 2 July 1940, Otto's 18th birthday, he was rounded up and eventually shipped to the Isle of Man. Later, he was transferred to the transit camp at the Lingfield horseracing track.Otto was due to sail on two different deportation ships, one bound for Australia, and one for North America. Upon arriving at the docks, each time he found that his name had been left off the final boarding lists. Both times the ships were sunk by enemy action. Later, released from internment, he had sponsorship from an American cousin and a visa to travel to America. However, with increased shipping loses, no further passengers were allowed to travel by the time clearance came through.
After being released from internment Otto managed to find work in London and served his duty as a fire watcher during the war. When allowed, Otto volunteered to serve in the RAF, but was rejected when it was learned that his parents were still in Vienna. He then volunteered for factory work and was sent to a place producing pistons for fighter aircraft where he worked for a short time.
At the age of 22, Otto became a professional gambler until the end of the war.
Engaging in sports he was, for two years running, Chelsea & Kensington's 100-yard swimming champion. In the last year of the war, he made the final in the British Open Table tennis championship beating two highly ranked players on the way and eventually losing to the world champion after a tough fight – no doubt his most outstanding sporting achievement. Otto was picked inside right for the Alliance League football team, the strongest combined amateur football team, only to fall victim to a clumsy tackle tearing his left knee cartilage.


=== Business ===
Marrying June Pattenden on 6 June 1946, Otto soon had two children, Paul, born in 1947, and Victoria, in 1948. Otto worked as company secretary for a West End fashion house.
Later, he went into business as a clothing manufacturer under the name of Paul Asker Fashions. The most successful item of manufacture was his introduction of the modern Hoop Skirt in the 1950s, which was designed by his wife.


=== British academia ===
Leaving his successful manufacturing business at the age of 40, Otto Newman returned to academia to complete his studies at the University of London, earning his Diploma in Sociology in 1964. He continued at the London School of Economics earning his BSc (Soc) in 1966 and his PhD in Sociology in 1970.
From 1968 to 1971, he was a lecturer in Sociology at the University of Stirling, in Scotland.
In 1971 he moved to the Polytechnic of the South Bank in London, where he chaired the department of Social Sciences from 1975 to 1987. He also directed the Lifestyle Research Unit, closely linked to the Greater London Council, co-operating in effecting policies enhancing the prospects for the city's youth. He served on the Executive of the British Sociological Association for a number of years, chairing the Publications Committee, editing the Sociology in Practice series and actively involved in the Sociology editorial board.


=== United States ===
From 1981 through 1982, Otto accepted a visiting lecturer position at Sangamon State University, later called the University of Illinois Springfield, then returned to South Bank University. Moving to California in 1987 he accepted a position at San Diego State University. He was also a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, San Diego from 1987 to 1990.  In 2008 he finished  writing his memoirs in a self-published work called "Escapes and Adventures: A 20th Century Odyssey."
He died on 29 November 2015 at the age of 93.
