Anton Blok (born 1935 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch anthropologist, famous for studying the Mafia in Sicily in 1960s.  Anton Blok was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan (1972–73) and the University of California, Berkeley in 1988. From 1973 until 1986, he served as full professor of cultural anthropology at Radboud University, Nijmegen. He then accepted a chair at the University of Amsterdam, where he remained until his retirement. For that occasion, thirty of his international colleagues and former students contributed essays in his honor, an edited volume titled as Miniature Etnografiche (SUN, 2000). Now a professor emeritus professor at U Amsterdam, Dr. Blok also spent one semester at Yale as a fellow.
