Richard Quinney (born 1934) is an American sociologist, writer, and photographer known for his philosophical and critical approach to crime and social justice. Quinney grew up on a farm in Walworth County, Wisconsin. After earning his PhD in sociology from the University of Wisconsin, he taught at several universities on the East Coast and in the Midwest. He was awarded the Edwin Sutherland Award in 1984 by the American Society of Criminology for his contributions to criminological theory. He is currently professor emeritus of sociology at Northern Illinois University.
Richard Quinney is also the author of several books that combine photography with autobiographical writing. He founded the independent press Borderland Books in Madison, Wisconsin. In addition to Quinney's works, the press publishes books by other notable Wisconsin authors such as Roy Chapman Andrews, Glenway Wescott, and August Derleth.
He has two daughters, Laura and Anne, and lives with his wife Solveig in Madison, Wisconsin.
