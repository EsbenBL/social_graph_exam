== Biography ==
Lamont (born 1957 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) completed her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in political theory at the University of Ottawa in 1979. She received her Doctor of Philosophy degree in sociology from the French university of La Sorbonne in 1983 and was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University from 1983 to 1985. Lamont served as professor at the University of Texas-Austin (1985–1987), Princeton University (1987–2003), and Harvard University (2003–present).


== Career ==
Lamont is an important contributor to the study of culture, inequality, evaluation, racism and anti-racism, cultural and social change. She is an expert in qualitative research and has coauthored an influential NSF report on the evaluation of qualitative research.
Lamont has also contributed to interdisciplinary social science research. From 2002 to 2019, Lamont served as co-director of the Successful Societies Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.  The interdisciplinary program brings together leading social scientists who meet three times a year to discuss how societies met various types of challenges. The group has produced two books: Successful Societies: How Institutions and Culture Affect Health (2009) and Social Resilience in the Neo-Liberal Era (2013). Both books were co-edited with Peter A. Hall and published by Cambridge University Press. The research program also produced a special issue of Daedalus on "Inequality as a Multidimensional Process," which Lamont co-edited with Paul Pierson (2019). These important contributions have also fed the agenda of the "Culture of Health Program" of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: With the Foundation's vice president for research, Lamont co-edited a special issue of Social Science and Medicine (2016) on "Mutuality, Mobilization, and Messaging". She also collaborated with a leading team of ecologists and economists at the Beijer Institute for Resilience at the Royal Academy of Sweden, which resulted in a paper on "Our future in the Anthropocene biosphere" (2021). She is co-chairing the 2022 UNDP Human Development report on social resilience in unsettled times.
In 2009 and 2010, Lamont served as Senior Advisor on Faculty Development and Diversity in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. In this role she put in place a universal mentoring program for tenure-track faculty. And from 2014-2021 Lamont served as acting director and director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs (WCFIA). With a large endowment and 235 faculty associates, this center is among the largest social science centers at Harvard.
From 2006-2009, Lamont was the chair of the Council for European Studies and from 2016-2018, she served as president elect, president, and past president of the American Sociological Association.Lamont has been a visiting professor at various institutions including the Collège de France, SciencesPo, Université de Paris 8, École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Mainz University, and Tel Aviv University. She has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Studies at Stanford University, the recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship and the Andrew Carnegie Fellowship, and a fellow of the Russell Sage Foundation in 1996 and again from 2019 to 2020.
In 2017, she received the Erasmus Prize, for her "devoted contribution to social science research into the relationship between knowledge, power, and diversity."


== Contributions to sociology ==
Lamont's major works compare how people's shared concepts of worth influence and sustain a variety of social hierarchies and inequality. She is concerned with the role of various cultural processes in the creation and reproduction of inequality. Recent publications include the Erasmus Prize-winning essay, Prisms of Inequality: Moral Boundaries, Exclusion, and Academic Evaluation; her co-authored book, Getting Respect: Responding to Stigma and Discrimination in the United States, Brazil, and Israel; and her presidential address to the ASA (ASR June 2018). She currently serves on various scientific boards including: American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID), Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS) and Nordic Centre for Research on Gender Equality in Research and Innovation (NORDICORE).Lamont's early writing formulated influential criticisms of the work of Pierre Bourdieu, a leading sociologist with whom she studied in Paris. Her first book, Money, Morals, Manners, showed that Bourdieu's theories of cultural capital and habitus ignore moral status signals and national repertoires that explain differences in American and French class cultures. This criticism set the stage for a large American literature that was critical of, but built upon, the work of Bourdieu. This movement coincided with the development of cultural sociology in American sociology. With fellow sociologists Ann Swidler, Michael Schudson, and numerous others, Lamont contributed to setting the agenda for the scholarly study of "meaning-making" in sociology.  The research of Lamont and colleagues demonstrated the importance of considering various aspects of culture as explanans and explanandum in the social sciences as something more than a "residual category".
Lamont's distinction between "symbolic" and "social" boundaries provides a framework within which to analyze the independent causal role of individual's worldviews in explaining structural phenomena such as inequality. Symbolic boundaries are "conceptual distinctions made by social actors ... that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership." Conversely, "social boundaries are objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities." In making this distinction, Lamont acknowledges that symbolic boundaries are a "necessary but insufficient" condition for social change. "Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character… and become social boundaries."Lamont's work has applied the "boundary-work" framework to the case of American and French race relations. In her award-winning Dignity of Working Men, Lamont shows how white and African-American conceptions of class are grounded in vastly different conceptions of self-worth. In Getting Respect, Lamont compares how stigmatized groups respond to ethnoracial exclusion in the United States, Brazil, and Israel.
In her 2009 book, How Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment, Lamont analyzes how experts in the social sciences and the humanities debate what defines originality, social and intellectual significance, and more. It also analyzes the place of the self, emotion and interaction in evaluation. This book has influenced current debates on funding, evaluation, and audit culture in the United States and Europe.  Of particular interest is the question of whether social sciences should be evaluated with different criteria than the sciences. With this book, Lamont has launched a broader program in the sociology of evaluation (including her 2012 paper "Toward a Sociology of Valuation and Evaluation"), which also links to the growing interest in the sociology of valuation.
Lamont is at work on a trade book titled “What we Value: Redefining Worth in the Second Gilded Age” to be published by Simon and Schuster/Penguin in 2023 (One Signal). This research is supported by Carnegie fellowship, RSF and Harvard. This book builds on her British Journal of Sociology paper "From 'having' to 'being': Self-worth and the current crisis of American society."
