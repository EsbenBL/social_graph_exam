== Investment views ==


=== In 1980s ===
Faber is credited for advising his clients to get out of the stock market before the October 1987 crash.


=== In 2000s ===
Faber predicted the rise of oil, precious metals, other commodities, emerging markets, and especially China in his book Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery.  He stated that there are few value investments available, except for farmland and real estate in some emerging markets like Russia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.He also expressed temporary bullishness for the U.S. dollar in mid-2008, before it dramatically recovered and positive expectations for holding the Japanese yen.  In December 2008, Faber said, "I think a recovery will not come in the next couple of years, maybe in five, 10 years' time". Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose by 48% from 865.58 on January 1, 2009 to 1282.62 on January 1, 2011.In 2009, Faber predicted with 100% confidence that the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping interest rates near zero would lead to hyperinflation approaching levels seen in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's inflation rate reached 89 sextillion percent in a previous report. Subsequently, annual increases in the CPI were 2.7% in 2009, 1.5% in 2010, 3.0% in 2011, 1.7% in 2012, 1.5% in 2013, 0.8% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2015.


=== In 2010s ===
In 2012, Faber claimed that there was a "100% chance" of a global economic recession later that year or in early 2013. Subsequently, the average world product grew steadily by 3.4% in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014, and 3.5% in 2015.
In 2012, Faber predicted that the S&P 500 index would fall at least 20% within 6–9 months following the re-election of Barack Obama. Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose from a low of 1359.88 on November 16, 2012 to 1480.40 as of January 1, 2013, 1570.70 on April 1, 2013 (up 15% from the November low, 6 months after Faber's prediction), 1668.68 on July 1, 2013 (up 22% from the November 2012 low) and 1783.54 on November 1, 2013 (up 31%).On March 27, 2013, Faber said that the U.S. is creating nowhere-to-hide bubbles in many emerging economies such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand (up four times from 2009 lows).On January 14, 2015, Faber predicted that gold prices will rise by 30% in 2015. Gold prices subsequently fell by 14% from $1234 on January 14, 2015 to $1060 on December 31, 2015.On July 23, 2015, Faber stated that investors must hold cash for better buying opportunities after correction.


== Writings ==
Faber writes the monthly paper investment newsletter The Gloom Boom & Doom Report, as well as the online subscription letter "Monthly Market Commentary". He has also authored several books, such as The Great Money Illusion; The Confusion Of The Confusions  (1988), Riding the Millennial Storm: Marc Faber's Path to Profit in the Financial Markets (1998) and Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery (2010).
Faber has been a contributor to Forbes
and International Wealth (a sister publication of the Financial Times). He has contributed regularly to several websites such as Financial Intelligence, Asian Bond Portal, Die Welt, Finanzen, Boerse, AME Info, Swiss Radio, Apple Hong Kong and Taiwan, Quamnet, Winners, Wealth and Oriental Daily.  He has also written occasionally for the International Herald Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and Borsa e Finanza.Faber has been long term bearish about the American economy for a number of years, and continues to be so. He concluded his June 2008 newsletter with the following mock quote:

"The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate. If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part."


== Racist remarks ==
Faber drew criticism on October 17, 2017, after including controversial and widely criticized as racist remarks in the latest print edition of his investment newsletter.
In the October edition of Faber's Gloom, Doom and Boom Report, he criticized "liberal hypocrites" and ongoing efforts to tear down "monuments of historic personalities." He opined that the U.S. grew successful because white people held power.
"Thank God white people populated America, and not the blacks," Faber wrote, according to an excerpt of the print newsletter obtained by Business Insider. "Otherwise, the U.S. would look like Zimbabwe, which it might look like one day anyway, but at least America enjoyed 200 years in the economic and political sun under a white majority. I am not a racist, but the reality – no matter how politically incorrect – needs to be spelled out as well." He further defended statues of Confederate figures calling them "honorable people whose only crime was to defend what all societies had done for more than 5,000 years: keep a part of the population enslaved." Faber defended his comments in a subsequent statement to Business Insider, adding that he is "naturally standing by this comment since this is an indisputable fact".
"If stating some historical facts makes me a racist, then I suppose that I am a racist. For years, Japanese were condemned because they denied the Nanking massacre," Faber said.Faber was subsequently asked to resign from the boards of Ivanhoe Mines, Sprott Inc. and NovaGold Resources. U.S-based Sunshine Silver Mining Corp, Vietnam Growth Fund managed by Dragon Capital, and Indochina Capital Corporation also dismissed him, Faber told Reuters. CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg TV said that they do not plan to book Faber in the future. Faber continues to stand by his remarks.
