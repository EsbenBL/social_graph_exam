Pierangelo Garegnani (1930–2011) was an Italian economist and professor of the University of Rome III. He was the Director of the Fondazione Centro Piero Sraffa di Studi e Documenti at the Federico Caffè School of Economics, and also the literary executor of the works, documents and papers left by the Italian economist Piero Sraffa to the University of Cambridge's Wren Library.
Professor Garegnani was one of the leading theoretical critics of neoclassical economics. He published several books and articles concerning the classical economic theory, from Ricardo to Sraffa, as an alternative theoretical foundation to analyse the capitalist economy. An account of his contributions was published by the Royal Economic Society. During the 1980s, Garegnani worked as a visiting professor at The New School.
