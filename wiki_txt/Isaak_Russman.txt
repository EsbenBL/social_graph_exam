Starting in 1969 and until the end of his life, Russman conducted research in operations research at the same institution where he had studied.
Russman taught discrete mathematics, the theory of algorithms and mathematical logic, probability theory, economic cybernetics, and systems analysis.
Russman conducted research on topics related to simulation-targeted systems (economic, social, institutional), quality assessment, and building valuation models. He is famous for creating the concept "difficulty in achieving the objectives", a concept which is used to assess the value of a certain specified requirement. This approach was usefully applied to models of control and management of organizational systems and portfolio optimization models.
