As a next step, she and her associates founded the Net Party, an Argentine political party that pledges to act according to people's wishes as expressed online.In 2013 she co-founded the non-profit Democracy Earth, based in Palo Alto, California, which provides an online platform for political groups, and in January 2016 she co-founded Open Collective, which provides a platform for open-source project groups to collect and spend money semi-transparently.Her TED talk, How to Upgrade Democracy for the Internet Era, received over a million views.
