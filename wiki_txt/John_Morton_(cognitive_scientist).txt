John Morton, OBE, FRS (born 1933) is an emeritus professor at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and was the director of the former Medical Research Council (MRC) Cognitive Development Unit (CDU) at University College London.


== Research ==
Morton's research focuses on event memory in adults and children; effects of memory on recall of events; types of memory system;  memory pathologies; multiple personality disorder; cognitive models of memory; development of cognitive abilities; and causal models of developmental disorders, particularly autism and dyslexia.
One of his most important theories is the logogen model of word recognition.Morton has also worked, with Mark H. Johnson, on infant face recognition. They hypothesized that infants turning their heads to preferentially attend to faces or face-like images suggested they possessed rudimentary facial processing capacities
