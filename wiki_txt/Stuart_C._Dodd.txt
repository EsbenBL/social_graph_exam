== Work ==
Dodd was a leading expert on typical statistical polling as head of the Washington State Public Opinion Laboratory at the University of Washington in the 1960s. He was the only pollster to accurately predict, that U.S. President Harry S. Truman would defeat Governor Thomas E. Dewey and was called to testify before Congress as to how that all happened.


=== Bogardus Scale ===
In 1954 Dodd and Nehnevasja became known for their introduction of precise metric distances into the Bogardus scale. According to Ethington, "revising some of the Bogardus response items and converting each to a power of 10 meters, they captured an almost convincing, common-sense physical distance for each item. Dodd and Nehnevasja had no intention of restoring geometric distance to any kind of constitutive role in the social process. Their sole objective, in fact, was to find an even more objective, trans-spatial metric".
