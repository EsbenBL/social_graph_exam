Moniz Bandeira's work O Feudo – A Casa da Torre de Garcia d'Ávila describes the history of the Casa da Torre throughout the centuries, from the 16th century to the independence of Brazil. He is also a descendant of Diogo Álvares Correia, the "Caramuru", famous colonizer of Brazil. Bandeira started writing poems at an early age. His first book, Verticais, was published in 1956 when he was 20 years old. In 1960, he published another, Retrato e Tempo. While in law school, Bandeira, worked for newspapers in Rio de Janeiro such as Correio da Manhã and Diário de Notícias, and participated in political life as a socialist militant linked to the Brazilian Labour Party. When the 1964 coup d'état overthrew President João Goulart, Bandeira fled into exile in Uruguay.He returned to Brazil some years later and led a clandestine life, continuing his historical research and writing, while participating in the resistance against the military regime. He was subsequently arrested by the Brazilian Navy and spent two years as a political prisoner.
