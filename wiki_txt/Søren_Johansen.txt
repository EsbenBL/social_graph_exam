Søren Johansen (born 6 November 1939) is a Danish Statistician and Econometrician who is known for his contributions to the theory of Cointegration. He is currently a professor at the Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen and in the Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES) of the Aarhus University.

== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Johansen was born in 1939 in Denmark.


=== Academic life ===
Johansen graduated from the University of Copenhagen in mathematical statistics. He began his academic career at the University of Copenhagen,  Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1964 and was promoted to full professor in 1989. In 1967 he obtained the Gold medal from University of Copenhagen for the thesis "An application of extreme points methods in probability" and in 1974, he became dr. phil. with the thesis "The embedding problem for Markov chains".
Johansen visited UCSD where he interacted with Robert Engle and Clive Granger during the years that the theory on cointegration was taking shape. In the period 1996-2001 he held a Chair in Econometrics at the European University Institute.
According to some rankings he was the most cited researcher in the world in economic journals.Johansen is married to Katarina Juselius, who is also a professor at the University of Copenhagen and was ranked as the eighth most cited economist in the world from 1990–2000 (Johansen was first among this list).
