== Income inequality ==
About income inequality, Kenworthy wrote:

As best I can tell from the available data, income inequality hasn't reduced economic growth. It hasn't hindered employment. It may or may not have played a role in fostering economic crises, including the Great Recession. It hasn't reduced income growth for poor households. [...] It may or may not have reduced equality of opportunity. [...] Income inequality has reduced middle-class household income growth. It very likely has increased disparities in education, health, and happiness in the United States. And it has reduced residential mixing in the U.S.
