Samuel Hollander,  (born April 6, 1937) is a British/Canadian/Israeli economist.
Born in London, he received a B.Sc. in economics from the London School of Economics in 1959. In 1961 he received an AM and a Ph.D. in 1963 from Princeton University. He started with the University of Toronto becoming an Assistant Professor (1963–1966), Associate Professor (1966–1970), Professor (1970–1984), University Professor (1984–1998), and upon his retirement in 1998, University Professor Emeritus. Since 2000 he is a Professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. He became a citizen of Canada in 1967 and of Israel in 2000.
Samuel Hollander is one of the most influential and controversial living authors on History of Economic Thought, especially on classical economics. His monumental studies of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill have provoked some sharp reactions. Especially his "new view" of David Ricardo as a direct predecessor of later neo-classical economists such as Marshall and Walras has triggered heated debates. Apart from many critics he has also enjoyed the support of a considerable number of prominent fellow economists. His work was highly recommended by the late Lord Robbins, who says "... he really surpasses all previous historians of economic thought, especially on Ricardo" (Robbins, 1998, p. 143).
