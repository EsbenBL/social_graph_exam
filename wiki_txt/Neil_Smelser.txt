== Major works ==


=== Theory of Collective Behavior ===
In Theory of Collective Behavior, Smelser offers a unified theory of collective behavior. It differs from the European social-psychological research on crowd psychology by Gustave Le Bon, Wilfred Trotter, William McDougall, and Sigmund Freud. It also breaks with the American tradition of Edward Alsworth Ross, Robert E. Park, and Herbert Blumer.As part of his theory, Smelser used the concept of value-added as a metaphor to describe how collective actions occur. Smelser's value added theory (or strain theory) argued that six elements were necessary for a particular kind of collective behavior to emerge:
Structural conduciveness - things that make or allow certain behaviors possible (e.g. spatial proximity)
Structural strain - something (inequality, injustice) must strain society
Generalized belief - explanation; participants have to come to an understanding of what the problem is
Precipitating factors - spark to ignite the flame
Mobilization for action - people need to become organized
Failure of social control - how the authorities react (or don't)


=== Economic sociology ===
Smelser was a proponent of economic sociology, an interdisciplinary field that links sociology and economics.  
In The Sociology of Economic Life (1963), Smelser defines the field of economic sociology "as the sociological perspective applied to economic phenomena."
Smelser contrasts economic sociology to mainstream economics in terms of (1) their concept of the actor, (2) their concept of economic action, (3) their sense of constraints on Economic Action, (4) their view of the relationship between the economy and society, (5) their goals of analysis, (6) the models they employ, and (7) their intellectual tradition.Neil J. Smelser and Richard Swedberg's edited volume The Handbook of Economic Sociology (1994; 2nd edition in 2005) is credited with "consolidat[ing] the field of economic sociology."


=== The comparative method ===
Smelser wrote some important early works on the comparative method in the social sciences. In Comparative Methods in the Social Sciences (1976), Smelser shows how classic studies of Alexis de Tocqueville, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber relied on the comparative method.
Smelser's work on the comparative method influenced a key text on the comparative method by Arend Lijphart.
