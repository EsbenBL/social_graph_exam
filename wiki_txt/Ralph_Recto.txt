Ralph Gonzalez Recto (Tagalog pronunciation: [gonˈsalɛs ˈrɛktɔ]; born January 11, 1964) is a Filipino politician serving as the president pro tempore of the Philippine Senate since 2017, previously holding the position from 2013 to 2016.

He garnered 98% of the votes cast in those two elections in the 4th District of Batangas.
