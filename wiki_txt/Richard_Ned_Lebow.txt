== Controversy ==
In 2018, Lebow was accused of making an inappropriate joke riding in an elevator during a conference.

Lebow emailed her to apologize, but said that focusing on minor offences harms the general fight for women rights. He refused to apologize in the way that the ISA demanded from him.
