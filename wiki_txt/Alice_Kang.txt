== Research ==
Kang teaches and conducts research on comparative politics, with a regional focus on Africa and especially Niger. Her scholarly contributions are in the areas of women's activism, gender quotas, and women's representation in politics. Kang's research is multidisciplinary, merging qualitative and quantitative methods and borrowing approaches from sociology and anthropology. Her publications include the 2015 book Bargaining for Women's Rights: Activism in an Aspiring Muslim Democracy (ISBN 978-0-8166-9218-7), which is known for developing a theory of how conservative counter-activism, and not just progressive activism, influences why some women's movements succeed more than others. Her work is rooted in immersive field research, which Kang has conducted since 2006 in Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso, and South Africa. Her field work in Niger during 2007-2008 was funded by a Fulbright Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Award.
