In 1953, after graduating in anthropology from the Universidad Femenina de México, she became a researcher under Roberto Weitlaner at the Escuela Nacional de Antropología, collaborating with Roberto Weitlaner at the Museo Nacional de Anthropología. In the 1950s and 1960s, she undertook fieldwork in Oaxaca, first studying the Cuicatec Indians and later conducting research in the Mixtec region under Kimball Romney.In 1957, thanks to Romney, Verbitsky continued her research on Mexican anthropology at the University of Chicago under Robert McCormick Adams Jr., Fred Eggan and Eric Wolf, earning an M.A. in 1959 and a Ph.D. in 1962 with her thesis "The Dynamics of the Domestic Group in Two Tzeltal Villages".

She spent a period at Northwestern University in 1961, after which she began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1965.In the mid-1970s, Hunt stressed the importance of kinship in investigating the anthropology of Mesoamerica, increasingly focusing on regional analysis and publishing "The Transformation of the Hummingbird: Cultural Roots of a Zinacantecan Mythical Poem" (1977) which drew on Claude Lévi-Strauss's ideas on structural anthropology.Eva Hunt, who became a professor at Boston University in 1978, died of cancer on 29 February 1980.
