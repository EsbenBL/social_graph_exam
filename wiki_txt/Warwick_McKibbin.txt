== Collaborations ==
The McKibbin-Sachs Global Model is a global economic model developed originally in 1984 jointly with Jeffrey Sachs and is a widely used intertemporal general equilibrium model of the world economy.The G-Cubed Model is a global economic model developed in 1991 jointly with Peter Wilcoxen and is a widely used multi-sector intertemporal general equilibrium model of the world economy.The Henderson McKibbin Taylor Rule for Monetary Policy was first proposed by Dale W. Henderson and Warwick McKibbin in 1993 and simultaneously by John B. Taylor.The McKibbin-Wilcoxen Blueprint also known as the McKibbin Wilcoxen Hybrid. McKibbin (Australian National University) and Peter Wilcoxen (Syracuse University) outline various approaches to climate change policy. They argue that the issue of taking action against climate change should be separated from the issue of whether Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Once the Kyoto Protocol is set aside it is clear that there are better options available. One such approach is the McKibbin-Wilcoxen Blueprint which is outlined in this article.
They argue that Kyoto Protocol-based carbon-trading systems are too inflexible/brittle to attract developing countries (particularly China & India). A better system would need to be flexible enough to refine outcomes over time (as new data become available).


== Honours and awards ==
McKibbin was awarded the Order of Australia in 2016 "For Distinguished Service to Education as an Economist, Particularly in the Area of Global Climate Policy, and to Financial Institutions and International Organisations" and the Centenary medal in 2003 "For Service to Australian Society through Economic Policy and Tertiary Education".
