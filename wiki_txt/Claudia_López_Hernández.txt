== Controversies ==


=== Investigations into parapolitics ===
López began to gain notoriety after publishing a series of reports on anomalies in regional election processes on the Semana magazine website. These reports were part of a sequence of events that led to the uncovering of the parapolitics scandal in 2006. Her arguments and opinion columns were controversial and led to judicial problems, as in the case of the complaint filed against her by Antioquia governor Luis Alfredo Ramos for a column which pointed out that he obtained votes with the help of paramilitary groups. "Ramos could have been elected without the support of the paramilitaries and chose not to do so," she said. The journalist's allegations were confirmed on 28 August 2013 with the issuance of an arrest warrant against the ex-governor for links with paramilitary groups. Later the Supreme Court gave him his freedom due to a lack of evidence and for being the victim of an alleged network of false witnesses.


=== El Tiempo dismissal controversy ===
In an October 2009 incident which caused controversy and debate on freedom of expression and of the press in Colombia, López was publicly dismissed from the newspaper El Tiempo after her regular Tuesday column in which she criticized how the paper had covered information related to the Agro Ingreso Seguro scandal. According to López, members of the Santos family who were former owners and now shareholders of the newspaper tried to favor the candidacy of former minister and president Juan Manuel Santos. López also referred to the paper's interest in acquiring the country's so-called third private television channel. El Tiempo published the column, with a note appended that López's opinion was being interpreted as a letter of resignation, which was accepted immediately. At the same time it described the columnist's assertions as "false, malicious, and defamatory."


=== Denunciation of ex-president Samper ===
In 2011 a criminal proceeding was resolved in López's favor, after ex-president Ernesto Samper denounced her for insult and defamation for linking him to the Mafia in a column in El Tiempo.


== Writings ==
Claudia López stood out as a columnist for Semana, El Tiempo, and La Silla Vacía. Her investigations into parapolitics were published in the books Parapolítica: la ruta de la expansión paramilitar y los acuerdos políticos and Y refundaron la patria: de cómo mafiosos y políticos reconfiguraron el Estado colombiano. In mid-2016 she presented her vision on how to end the armed conflict with the FARC in her book ¡Adiós A Las Farc! ¿Y ahora qué?.


== Personal life ==
On 2 September 2014, an attorney sued Senator López for having a relationship with Representative Angélica Lozano Correa, because the law prohibits two Congress members who have a de facto marital union from being members of the same political party. However, López and Lozano have argued that this prohibition does not apply to them since they maintain an engagement and not a marital union. López and Lozano married in December 2019.
