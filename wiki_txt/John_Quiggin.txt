== Other work ==
Quiggin writes a blog involving "commentary on Australian and world events from a socialist and democratic viewpoint". It was included in the Focus Economics Top Economics and Finance Blogs of 2018 and the Top 100 Economics Blogs of 2020 by the Intelligent Economist. He is also a regular contributor to Crooked Timber, Inside Story and The Guardian. Until April 2015, he was a Fellow at the Centre for Policy Development. He was an opinion columnist for the Australian Financial Review from 1996 until March 2012.
As of 2015, Quiggin opposed Bitcoin, calling it a "delusion" that would lead to "environmental disaster" due to the "ever-increasing environmental damage from the electricity used in the 'mining' of Bitcoins" and that "The sooner this collective delusion comes to an end, the better." He also proposed that the value of Bitcoin was a refutation of the efficient market hypothesis: "The EMH states that the market value of an asset is equal to the best available estimate of the value of the services or income flows it will generate. In the case of a company stock, this is the discounted value of future earnings. Since Bitcoins do not generate any actual earnings, they must appreciate in value to ensure that people are willing to hold them. But an endless appreciation, with no flow of earnings or liquidation value, is precisely the kind of bubble the EMH says can’t happen."
In 2012, through Princeton University Press, Quiggin published his book Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us which sold upward of 20 000 copies and was translated into eight languages. His most recent book, Economics in Two Lessons: Why Markets Work So Well, and Why They Can Fail So Badly, was published in 2019 also from Princeton University Press and provides an introduction to free-market economics, covering key theory as well as its successes and failures.He was appointed in 2012 to the Board of the Climate Change Authority of the Australian Government.
With reference to the pro-nuclear film Pandora's Promise, Quiggin comments that it presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable. Quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialisation.As part of his "commitment to public debate", Quiggin has contributed to a wide variety of Parliamentary inquires through submissions and appearances. These include the inquiries into Uranium Mining and Nuclear Power, Land Use in Victoria, the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the Urban Water Inquiry to name a few.
