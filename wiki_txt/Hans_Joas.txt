== Research ==
Hans Joas’ research focuses on social philosophy and sociological theory, mainly American Pragmatism and Historicism; the sociology of religion and the sociology of war and violence; as well as value change in modern societies.
The emergence/formation of values is a core theme of Hans Joas’ work. He developed a theory of "Affirmative Genealogy" of values, especially with regard to human rights. According to Joas values originate in experiences of self-formation and self-transcendence. He developed a phenomenology of experiences of self-transcendence. Joas emphasizes that his account of the contingency of value-formation is not to be seen as a plea against the claims of a universalistic morality.
