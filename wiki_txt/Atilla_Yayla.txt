== Life and career ==
He was born in 1957 in Kaman, Kırşehir.As an undergraduate, he studied economics at Ankara University, going on to earn a master's degree in public administration and a Ph.D in political science (1986).In the mid-1980s, around 1984-85 according to his statement, he embraced liberal views.

== Court case ==
In 2006, Yayla was charged with insulting the legacy of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk by calling him "that man" in a speech where he argued that the one-party period of the Republic of Turkey was less democratic than the preceding period of constitutional monarchy under Ottoman Empire and the early and short-lived multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey, and also strongly criticized the cult of personality that has grown up around Atatürk since. Some newspapers, notably Yeni Asır proclaimed him a traitor. In a court case, he was convicted and received a suspended 15-month jail sentence. Yayla was also dismissed temporarily from his academic post.


== Work and views ==
In 2008 Yayla was one of the signees of the Özür Diliyorum (I Apologize) campaign that caused an enormous reaction in Turkey by the government and the public. The declaration read as "My conscience does not accept the insensitivity showed to and the denial of the Great Catastrophe that the Ottoman Armenians were subjected to in 1915. I reject this injustice and for my share, I empathize with the feelings and pain of my Armenian brothers and sisters. I apologize to them."
Yayla supported The Kurdish Initiative project launched by the AKP government in 2009 to improve the human rights of Kurdish citizens of Turkey, and praised the advisory group, Akil İnsanlar Heyeti (The Wise People Commission), organized by the government to contribute to the solution process.
Yayla is the author of many books and articles in English and Turkish on terrorism, liberalism, constructivist rationalism, social justice, and Friedrich Hayek.
