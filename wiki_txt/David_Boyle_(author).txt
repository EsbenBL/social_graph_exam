He conducted an independent review for the Treasury and the Cabinet Office on public demand for choice in public services which reported in 2013.

== Writing ==
His book Authenticity put the phenomenon on the business and political agenda. His previous books The Tyranny of Numbers and The Sum of Our Discontent predicted and fermented the backlash against target culture.  Funny Money helped launched the time banks movement in the UK.
More recently, his writing has suggested why organisations and public services can be ineffective. He worked with the New Economics Foundation and NESTA on a series of publications about coproduction. His solutions are also published in The Human Element. This argues that organisations have abandoned human skills in favour of numerical targets or IT systems, which frustrate the business of building relationships and making things happen. He helped to launch the popular campaign against the failures of the Southern Rail franchise with his book Cancelled!, and his experimental 'passenger strike' in 2017.His history books usually have a business or economic dimension, including Blondel's Song (UK) and The Troubadour's Song (USA) about the imprisonment and ransom of Richard the Lionheart. His 2008 book Toward the Setting Sun tells the intertwined story of Christopher Columbus, John Cabot and Amerigo Vespucci and their race for America in the 1490s. His 2010 book, Eminent Corporations (with Andrew Simms) has introduced a new genre, the mini-corporate biography, launching the idea of corporate history as tragedy. His 2013 book Broke argued that the middle classes were also being squeezed by the political and economic elite.He has been the editor of several non-peer-reviewed journals including New Economics and Town & Country Planning. He is a fellow of the New Economics Foundation.
He was editor of the weekly Liberal Democrat News from 1992–1998. He edited the Foundation's publications New Economics, News from the New Economy, and then Radical Economics from 1987–2010.
