Ricardo Jorge Caballero (born 20 October 1959) is a Chilean macroeconomist who holds the Ford International chair of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a director of the World Economic Laboratory at MIT and an NBER Research Associate.  Caballero received his PhD from MIT in 1988, and he taught at Columbia University before returning to the MIT faculty.
Recently, Caballero's work has focused on Risk-Centric Macroeconomics and Safe Assets. He has also studied the aggregate behavior of economies with heterogeneous agents, the macroeconomic effects of irreversible investment in firm-specific assets, and Schumpeterian theories of technological progress through creative destruction.
