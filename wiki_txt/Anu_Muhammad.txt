He is the member-secretary of the citizen's movement platform called National Committee to Protect Oil-Gas-Mineral Resources-Power and Ports.


== Political views ==
Anu is involved in a variety of movements in Bangladesh and his appearance on TV talk shows with his anti-establishment position led to a death threat he received in February 2008. He was injured by the police in September 2009 during a demonstration protesting exploration deals granted by the government to two international oil companies. This event led to a protest by the Bangladesh Economic Association and to an open letter condemning the event, signed as it was by intellectuals, academics, and activists from around the world, including, among many others, Bertell Ollman, E. San Juan, Jr., Vijay Prashad, Gopal Balakrishnan, Nurul Kabir, and by Azfar Hussain, who convened this international signature campaign.
