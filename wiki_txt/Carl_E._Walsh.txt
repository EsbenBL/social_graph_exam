Walsh has become best known for his paper "Optimal Contracts for Central Bankers," published in 1995 in the American Economic Review. His theory is commonly referred to as the "Walsh Contract." In a 2004 speech, current Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke included "Optimal Contracts for Central Bankers" as one of the three most influential papers in macroeconomics over the past 25 years. His theory has also been questioned by Francisco Candel-Sánchez and Juan Cristóbal Campoy-Miñarro. In addition, Haizhou Huang and A. Jorge Padilla have commented on the concept.
