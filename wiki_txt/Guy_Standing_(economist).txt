== The Precariat ==
Standing's best-known book is The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class, published in 2011. In it, he blames globalisation for having plunged more and more people into the precariat, which he analyses as a new emerging social class. According to Standing, the precariat is not only suffering from job insecurity but also identity insecurity and lack of time control, not least due to workfare social policies.
Standing describes the precariat as an agglomerate of several different social groups, notably immigrants, young educated people, and those who have fallen out of the old-style industrial working class.Standing calls on politicians to make ambitious social reforms towards ensuring financial security as a right. He argues for an unconditional basic income as an important step to a new approach, stating that it would create economic growth. If politicians fail to take the necessary decisions, he predicts a wave of anger and violence, and the rise of far-right parties. There are some extracts of his book:

In every industrialised country, we currently apply means-tested benefits. That means you’re targeting the poor
The old system has broken. Wages will continue to decline. Insecurity will continue to grow. That is a recipe for economic instability
We are in an era of chronic insecurity and growing inequality. We need to have new mechanisms for income distribution


== Politics ==
In August 2015, Standing endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Standing argued in 2021 that the pandemic's consequences showed that a universal basic income was inevitable. Standing has also endorsed a carbon tax as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
