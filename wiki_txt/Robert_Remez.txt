Robert Remez,  an American experimental psychologist and   cognitive scientist,  is Professor of Psychology at Barnard College, Columbia University and Chair of the Columbia University Seminar on Language & Cognition (founded in 2000). His teaching focuses on the relationships between cognition, perception and language. He is best known for his theoretical and experimental work on perceptual organization. and speech perception.With Carol Fowler, Philip Rubin, and Michael Turvey, he introduced the consideration of speech in terms of a dynamical systems/action theory perspective. With Rubin and various other colleagues, he has used the technique of sinewave synthesis as a unique tool for exploring perceptual organization. He is the co-editor, with David Pisoni, of the Handbook of Speech Perception. He was the Ann Olin Whitney Professor and former Chair of the Department of Psychology at Barnard College and is a member of the Board of Directors of Haskins Laboratories.
Remez is a graduate of Brandeis University and the University of Connecticut.
