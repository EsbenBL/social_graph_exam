Crawford's research focuses on behavioural game theory, specifically bargaining and communication, experimental economics and matching. His work on strategic information transmission has been seminal in the field of strategic communication in economic games, with his 1982 paper (co-authored with Joel Sobel) establishing the concept of cheap talk in game theory. The Economist predicted him to be the next Nobel Prize laureate in 2011.
