Barrett graduated from Wylie (Texas) High School in 1969. He received his B.A. degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1973, his M.A. from the University of Essex (England) in 1986, and his Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 1990.


== Research ==
In 2005, Barrett discovered a volume of the CIA's internal history titled "Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation, Volume III: Evolution of CIAâ€™s Anti-Castro Policies, 1951- January 1961". This volume had been declassified in 1998 under the  1992 Kennedy Assassination Records Act. Among other revelations, Barrett leared via the volume that the head of the CIA had met prior to the Bay of Pigs project with a variety of corporate leaders whose companies had large investments in Cuba. Barrett says that he found the volume in a box labelled 'CIA Miscellaneous' while doing archival research at the National Archives. As of 2016, one of the five volumes of the history remained classified. By that year, as part of his research for a book on the interactions between the Kennedy White House and the CIA, Barrett had submitted three Freedom of Information Requests to the CIA requesting the volume. The CIA had not at that point released the volume.Barrett teaches classes related to U.S. Intelligence agencies, National Security Policy, the U.S. Presidency, and a Senior Seminar on the U. S. Presidency and the Vietnam War.
