Cornelius Martin "Neil" Kerwin (born April 10, 1949) is an American academic in public administration and former president of American University.
A 1971 undergraduate alumnus of American University, Kerwin continued his education with a Master of Arts degree in political science from the University of Rhode Island in 1973. In 1975, Kerwin returned to his alma mater and joined the faculty of the American University School of Public Affairs, then the School of Government and Public Administration. Kerwin completed his doctorate in political science from Johns Hopkins University in 1978 and continued to teach until 1989, when he became the dean of the school.
He continued in that post until 1997, when he was named American University's provost. During his tenure as provost, Kerwin oversaw a number of major changes including the tightening of graduate and doctoral programs, the foundation of the University College Program, and comprehensive reviews and overhauls of the General Education Program, University Honors Program and academic advising.
