== Work ==
His 1997 book Has Globalization Gone Too Far? was called “one of the most important economics books of the decade” in Bloomberg Businessweek.
In his article, he focused on three tensions between the global market and social stability. Pointing out that the so-called "globalization" has a dilemma of promoting international equality while exposing fault lines between the nation states with the skills and capitals to succeed in global markets and those without that advantage, he sees the free market system as a threat to social stability and deeply domestic norms. According to his analysis, there are three categories of reasons on why these tensions arise.
First, the tension is caused via globalization because reduced barriers to trade and foreign direct investments draw a vivid line between nations and groups that can take advantage of such cross-border relations and those who cannot. Rodrik refers to the first category of groups as highly skilled workers, professionals and those who are free to take their resources where they are most in demand. The second category would include unskilled workers and semiskilled workers, who, under globalization, as a resource become more elastic and easily substitutive.
The second source for tension comes because globalization engenders conflicts within and between nations over domestic norms and social institutions. Technology and culture are being more standardized around the world, and different nations with different norms and values tend to show repulsion toward such collective norms diffused internationally in a standardized form.
Lastly, the third threat of globalization arises because it has made it extremely difficult for national governments to provide social insurance.
