James Clyde Mitchell  (usually known as J. Clyde Mitchell) (21 June 1918 Pietermaritzburg – 15 November 1995) was a British sociologist and anthropologist.
In 1937 Mitchell helped found the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute group of social anthropologists/sociologists, now a part of the University of Zambia. He was influenced by Max Gluckman and conducted important research on social network analysis at the University of Manchester (see Manchester School). In the 1940s he carried out field research into social systems and social conditions in Central Africa (southern Malawi) interviewing heads of households in villages and urban areas and observing customs. In 1952 he was on the editorial committee of the Northern Rhodesia Journal.
Mitchell studied network analysis and was a founding member of the International Network for Social Network Analysis, contributing to its Connections magazine.
