== Education ==
Browning received his undergraduate education at the London School of Economics and his doctorate from Tilburg University.


== Career ==
He was previously the Director of the Center for Applied Microeconometrics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Before the appointment at University of Copenhagen, he was a Professor at McMaster University, Canada.


== Research ==
His work is in microeconomic analysis, with emphasis in the empirical assessments of theoretical propositions. He has worked in the areas of intrahousehold decision making; demand analysis; consumption and saving, and its interaction with labor supply. An important part of his work concerns the empirical assessment of rationality through the concept of revealed preference, and the modeling of individual heterogeneity in applied work.
