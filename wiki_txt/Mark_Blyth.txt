Blyth grew up in Dundee, Scotland and was raised by his grandmother after his mother died shortly after child birth. He played bass in rock bands and noted in an interview that "I was a musician from age 14 to 28. I've released five or six albums, but all with independent labels that never went anywhere. If they had, I wouldn't be here. I'd be lying on a beach with Heidi Klum."In 1991, Blyth received a Walker Bequest award from the University of Strathclyde and a Scottish International Educational Trust Award for Study in the United States. He eventually became a US citizen.

Rhodes '57 Professor of International Economics and Director of the Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University.Blyth is best known for his critique of austerity, Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea, described by Salon writer Elias Esquith as "necessary reading" and as an economics primer, a polemic, and a history that offers "insight into austerity's lineage, its theories, its champions and its failures...Mark Blyth's new book explains the damaging consequences of austerity in Europe and the U.S." Blyth characterized the argument advanced by austerity advocates as "a canard" and "complete horseshit".Using the term "Trumpism", Blyth argues that there are similar anti-establishment movements across the developed world.In August of 2020, Blyth expressed his support for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom.
