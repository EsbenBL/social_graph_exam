=== Main theories on public media ===
Lang has repeatedly stated in public that, regarding Macroeconomics, he believes in Karl Marx's Scientific communism and “Economic Crisis: Inevitable under Capitalism” theory.  He thinks that Big government can bring more justice and welfare to the society than Minarchism, which condones violations on the interests of small shareholders by financial capital, and eventually leading to financial crisis.  That is why he is sometimes called a New Left academic.

==== China's globalization crisis ====
(TODO: This section needs to be translated from Chinese.)For China 's globalization remained relatively "critical " attitude. His main idea is that many Chinese enterprises and local governments do not understand the international nature, or in his words, " farmland through water not previously dug ditches ." For example, "foreign" stock market operations through the acquisition of a cheap price or a lot of state-owned assets, causing increasingly serious loss of assets, as well as international [ [ chain ] ] the division of labor .
Lang believes that the existence of financial speculators internationally, such as George Soros of Quantum Group of Fund, these speculators are foreign exchange parity, commodities, precious metals prices from fluctuations in the main promoters, and Lang believes that behind them there is a long-term support of the world's financial powers, so meaningful, " financial war" , the rise and fall of these financial war against a country plays a key role, he and "Currency Wars", author Song Hongbing along with as "conspiracy theorists."
The face of the increasing appreciation of international oil prices in 2008, prices of food and some money, Lang pointed out that it is likely to be a behind by the " international financial speculators " under the control of a situation. The Chinese part of the industry, such as the steel industry is severely affected.

Lang repeatedly points to South Korean enterprises as a model, and criticizes many of China's emerging enterprises. He advocates studying the practices of transnational corporations, of cutting process flow in enterprises where enterprises no longer tangled in one or two leadership capacity, maintaining long-term business, but also full of innovation.

=== Reactions among Chinese economists ===
Among circles of Chinese economists, the prevailing opinion is that Lang's area of expertise does not cover China's economic system: he lacks a true understanding of China's situation, and his views on the restructuring of state enterprises are mostly shunned by his peers.  Initially, key economists remained silent, but then they realized that Lang seemed to be on the way to affect China's fundamental national policies.  So, they began to criticize his theories to try to turn the tide.  Besides academic criticisms, there were also accusations of "grandstanding" and "fishing for fame."  Nevertheless, it would appear that their attempts in turning the tide were basically futile.

Wu Jinglian:Lang's final verdict is "China's society has never been this bad in 5000 years."  His rationale is two-fold: first, the path of economic development alone, and second, marketization.  (TODO: Some text in this paragraph still needs to be translated into Chinese and is commented out.) 
Steven N. S. Cheung: Professor Lang knows nearly nothing about China's economic and political infrastructure. ... However, as a professor, how could Mr. Lang make such generalizations so irresponsibly?
Zhou Qiren: Speaking of Lang, I think it is not difficult to see that he is wrong. ... I do not see in Lang's allegations any kind of complex theories, concepts and reasoning. ... Lang [claimed], "Whose are the state-owned assets? Yours, mine, ours." ... Now what is he muddling?  He has no share of nothing.  No matter how blurry the property rights of state-owned assets are, it should be obvious that he has no part in the subject of rights. ... I can say with certainty that these outrageous views of Lang's did not just come off the top of his head.  The question beckons: These "stuff"—nonsensical, illogical, and just plain rude—came off the top of whose head?
Zhiwu Chen thinks that Lang's conspiracy theory is the opium of the people.
