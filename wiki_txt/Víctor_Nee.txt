== Work ==
Nee's research interests focus on middle range theories and their confirmation in economic sociology, new institutionalism, inequality and immigration.  
One of his contributions in the New Institutionalism in Sociology (1998) advances a networks-and-institutions approach. This and subsequent articles further an understanding of how norms and networks, and formal institutional elements combine and recombine to shape organizational action and economic performance.Nee contributed influential theories explaining a variety of macro-societal phenomena. He developed market transition theory, which launched a broad research program and debate on the interplay between market transition and change in the mechanisms of stratification. 
His book Capitalism from Below: Markets and Institutional Change in China co-authored with Sonja Opper (Harvard University Press 2012) explains the rise of dynamic capitalism in China. The book examines the emergence of new organizational and institutional forms, detailing how norms and networks promote economic performance in the absence of good government policies and formal institutions.In his book Remaking the American Mainstream, co-authored with Richard Alba (Harvard University Press 2003) he advances a neo-assimilaton theory explaining the cumulative inclusion of post-1965 immigrants and their children in the institutional mainstream of American economy and society. The book compares the late European and new immigration from Latin America and Asia to the United States.
