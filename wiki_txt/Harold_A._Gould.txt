== Reception ==
Robert I. Crane of the Syracuse University, reviewing Gould's The Hindu Caste System, Volume 1, calls it a "masterful study" of the highly complex Hindu system of caste with insightful and informed analysis. His discussion of "priests and contrapriests" contains stimulating ideas and guides the larger thrust of the volume. Also noteworthy for Crane is the chapter on Hindu jajmani system, with the best known evaluation of the jajmani relationships. However, Crane questions Gould's position on the primacy of religious value system and wonders if he might have overlooked the possibility of power-cum-economic interests having coopted the religious values.Lloyd I. Rudolph of the University of Chicago, reviewing Gould's Grass Roots Politics in India, calls it a "masterful account" of a century of political evolution in the Faizabad district (from roughly 1869 when the Faizabad Municipal Board was established to the 1970 by-elections in the Tanda constituency). Gould's objective is to analyze and explain India's "political systems," how a political system of national proportions came into being and has functioned at the grass roots. Following the model of Paul Brass in Factional Politics in an Indian State,
Gould views the Indian National Congress as a coalition of state parties, and the state parties themselves as coalitions of semi-independent district party organizations. It is at the district level that Congress party organizations interact with the traditional societies. Gould's principal vehicle for explaining the nexus between the traditional society and the party politics is "caste demographics." Gould, being a pioneer in the analysis of the "desacralized" caste system (caste delinked from religious and ritual dimensions and viewed as an "ethnic group"), shows how caste can, and has, become the vehicle for political participation and social transformation. Rudolph finds Gould's analysis powerful and persuasive, but wonders how much a district level analysis can be used to explain India's political system. Do we not see the influence of ideology, leadership and agency (taken as examples of "top down" phenomena) as much as the caste demographics in shaping the local politics?
