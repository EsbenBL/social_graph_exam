=== Sociology ===
Domhoff's first book, Who Rules America? (1967), was a 1960s sociological best-seller, arguing that the United States is dominated by an elite ownership class, both politically and economically. This work was partially inspired by Domhoff's experience of the Civil rights movement and projects he assigned for his social psychology courses mapping how different organizations were connected. It built on E. Digby Baltzell's 1958 book Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class, C. Wright Mills'  1956 book The Power Elite, Robert A. Dahl's 1961 book Who Governs? and Paul Sweezy work on interest groups, and Floyd Hunter's 1953 book Community Power Structure and 1957 book Top Leadership, USA.
Who Rules was followed by a series of sociology and power structure books like C. Wright Mills and the Power Elite (1968), Bohemian Grove and Other Retreats (1978), and three more best-sellers: The Higher Circles (1970), The Powers That Be (1979), and Who Rules America Now? (1983).Domhoff has written seven updates to Who Rules America?; every edition has been used as a sociology textbook. He also has a "Who Rules America?" web site, hosted by UCSC.


=== Psychology ===
In addition to his work in sociology, Domhoff has been a pioneer in the scientific study of dreams. In the 1960s, he worked closely with Calvin S. Hall, who had developed a content analysis system for dreams. He has continued to study dreams up to the present day, and his latest research advocates a neurocognitive basis for future dream research.He and his research partner, Adam Schneider, maintain two web sites dedicated to quantitative dream research: DreamResearch.net and DreamBank.net.
