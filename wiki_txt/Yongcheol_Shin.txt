He has previously held positions at leading academic institutions such as University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh and University of Leeds. His notable contributions to econometrics include asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag model, unit root tests in ESTAR framework, and the long-run structural VAR modelling approach.


== Education and career ==

He was a visiting professor at the SungKunKwan University, Seoul, and Wits University, Johannesburg. From 1995 to 1997, he worked on the econometric software project, Working with Microfit, at the Cambridge University as hands-on session supervisions.Shin has served as Reader from 2000 to 2004 and a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh School of Economics from 1998 to 2000.

Shin has published and written more than 46 articles in leading scientific journals in the areas of econometrics, macroeconomics, asset pricing and empirical finance. His contribution to the ARDL model for the cointegration analysis with Mohammad Hashem Pesaran was introduced in the Cambridge University book, "Econometrics and Economic Theory in the 20th Century" (Ed. Steinar Strøm).He was awarded Best Paper Award 2002–2004 by Econometric Reviews with Pesaran in 2005 for their research paper Long Run Structural Modelling.
