== Career ==

He is the founder of humanistic psychodrama and adopted in the same year  for the first time psychodrama with hypnosis in the context of sexual dysfunctions. In the last twenty years he concentrated on diagnosis and therapy of transgender people and is in Germany accepted as a court expert.  He also established humanistic psychodrama in the field of child psychotherapy. In the early 80s he began making film-documentations about complete group-psychotherapy-sessions in European countries. He is the publisher of book series and the International Journal of Humanistic Psychodrama. Gessmann is one of the few empirical researchers in the field of psychodrama and has published over 180 articles on psychological topics. Standards continued his research on the method of doubling from 1996. He is the only author in the German-speaking area, who handled this issue fundamentally and scientifically, including translations of the complete source texts from English.In 1973 he founded the Psychotherapeutisches Institut Bergerhausen (PIB) in Duisburg and in 1977 nearby Kerpen, Germany a European training center now for more than 1500 psychotherapists.

From 1998 to 2002, under his guidance, the tongue muscle training with the registered trademark ZMT  ®  was developed as an alternative treatment against sleep apnea.Gessmann developed and has taught humanistic psychodrama since 1979 as a new form of psychodrama. It became an integral part of humanistic psychology.  Gessmann moved the collective action and nature of the people at the center of the therapeutic ethic.  Faith, love, hope, and the idea of a human community are essential to meaningful humanistic psychodrama. Intuitive look for detecting the wholeness of a thing, the dialectical conception of polarities, the renunciation of absolute authority, take decisive influence on the image and life of man. The goals and methods of classical psychodrama were necessarily re-evaluated and described. This led to a fundamental change in international psychodrama practice. Through his work in many countries and with many different people of different ages, he was able to gain extensive experience, which in turn was very helpful for his future work. He understand new and strange situations and people faster and better. Working with different multicultural people taught him more and more that there is no single type of real life, but that there are an infinite number of individual ways of life and that every person has the right to decide for himself how he would like to shape his life. Good empathy and accepting knowledge of the difference between different people is a crucial prerequisite for successful therapeutic work. The humanistic image of man is guiding him and his work.
