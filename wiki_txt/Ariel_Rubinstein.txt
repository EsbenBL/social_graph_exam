== Biography ==
Ariel Rubinstein is a professor of economics at the School of Economics at Tel Aviv University and the Department of Economics at New York University.  He studied mathematics and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1972–1979 (B.Sc. Mathematics, Economics and Statistics, 1974;
M.A. Economics, 1975; M.Sc Mathematics, 1976; Ph.D. Economics, 1979).
In 1982, he published "Perfect equilibrium in a bargaining model", an important contribution to the theory of bargaining.  The model is known also as a Rubinstein bargaining model. It describes two-person bargaining as an extensive game with perfect information in which the players alternate offers.  A key assumption is that the players are impatient. The main result gives conditions under which the game has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium and characterizes this equilibrium.
