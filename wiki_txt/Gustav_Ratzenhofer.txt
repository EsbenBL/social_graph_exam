Gustav Ratzenhofer (July 4, 1842 in Vienna – October 8, 1904 in the Atlantic Ocean) was an Austrian officer, philosopher and was known primarily as a sociologist. He also wrote under the pseudonym Gustav Renehr.


== Life ==
Ratzenhofer was a watchmaker and joined in 1859 by the master watchmaker examination in the Austrian army, in which he made a brilliant career: second lieutenant (1864), member of the General Staff (1872), director of the Army Archives (1878), finally as Feldmarschall - lieutenant president of the Military High Court (1898). In 1901 Ratzenhofer left the army and devoted himself entirely to his private study of philosophy and sociology, where he was strongly influenced by active contacts with Ludwig Gumplowicz.
He died in 1904 on his way home from a study stay in the US.
In 1959, in Vienna, Floridsdorf (21st district) was named the Ratzenhofergasse after him.


== Work ==
Ratzenhofer understood sociology based on Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin and Auguste Comte as part of a comprehensive philosophy, which he described as "positive monism". He represented an evolutionary model of social development.Drive all social activity is by Ratzenhofer the "elemental force" (innate interests). "Jealousy" and "blood love" since time immemorial dominate the social events. The primitive society is governed by the "law of absolute hostility". Conflicts and subjugation then change "Peculiar State" to "Culture State" and ends in civilization, in the peaceful reconciliation of interests enables a creative and free life.
Ratzenhofer tried to explain all the laws of human coexistence by scientific methods, and emphasized the unity of Weltgesetzlichkeit. His work is considered an important contribution to the sociological interests and evolutionary theory. Particularly in the US, he was received as one of the founding fathers of policy sociology.
