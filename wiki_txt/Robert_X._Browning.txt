Browning is the founding director of the C-SPAN Archives. In 1986, with other Purdue professors, he developed the idea for an educational C-SPAN archive, which was approved in 1987 by David Caputo, then dean of Purdue's School of Humanities, Social Science and Education. In September 1987, the archive began cataloguing recordings of C-SPAN's coverage of Congress and other public affairs programming.Browning assumed the title of Director of C-SPAN Archives in 1998, when the archives were transferred to C-SPAN's management. He facilitates educational access to C-SPAN's collection and oversees the archives, which are located in Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette, Indiana. By the time of  the launch of the C-SPAN Video Library in 2010, Browning's  team converted over 120,000 hours of recordings of C-SPAN programming from analog to digital. In 2011, the C-SPAN Video Library was awarded a Peabody Award.
