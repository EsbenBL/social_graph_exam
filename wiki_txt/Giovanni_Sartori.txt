== Research ==
Sartori's interests were wide-ranging, but his lasting contributions were largely on political parties, constitutional design, and perhaps most significantly, concept analysis.


=== On concepts ===
Sartori was deeply interested in the formation, analysis, and use of political concepts.  He observed that political science, for better or worse, lacked the coordination in terminology that he presumed to exist in the physical and biological sciences.  He encouraged a more "intentional" use of concepts, with the objective of furthering a shared understanding of ideas.  In 1970, he and others established the first permanent research committee of the newly created International Political Science Association (IPSA).  The committee, Research Committee on Concepts and Methods (RC 01), was intended to ameliorate the "Tower of Babel problem" in political science, and is still active.
Sartori's 1970 article "Concept Misformation in Comparative Politics" published in The American Political Science Review is prominent in the field, leading Gary Goertz to write, "There are few articles in political science that deserve the predicate "classic," but Sartori's ... merits the label." Sartori's notions of "conceptual traveling" (the application of a concept from one case to a new case) and "conceptual stretching" (the mismatch that happens when a concept does not fit a new case) is influential in social science methodology. Conceptual stretching is frequently used as a criticism of studies that employ large-N quantitative analysis.


=== On parties and party systems ===
Sartori's Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis (1976) is a book that is seen as having as "outstanding, lasting significance to the field" on study on political parties. The book provides a comprehensive and authoritative approach to the classification of party systems.
