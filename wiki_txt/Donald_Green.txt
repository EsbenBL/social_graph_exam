In 1983, Green graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in political science and history from UCLA. In 1984 he earned an M.A. and in 1988 a Ph.D. in political science at the University of California, Berkeley for thesis titled Self-interest, public opinion, and mass political behavior.Green's career in academia began in 1989, when he became an assistant professor in the department of political science at Yale University. He was there until 2011, when he moved to Columbia University.
