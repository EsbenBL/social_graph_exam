Starting from 2010 until 2013, Frey was appointed to the Warwick Business School in the role of a Dinstinguished Professor of Behavioural Science.Frey was appointed to the Copenhagen Consensus expert commission in 2004, alongside four Nobel Prize prize winners. The main goal of this commission was to assess priorities for addressing the main challenges facing humanity including  hunger, AIDS, water access, trade barriers, corruption, and global warming. In July 2011, the University of Zurich established a commission to investigate allegations of publication misconduct (self-plagiarism) by Frey and his co-authors. In October of the same year the commission reported that Frey had committed misconduct, namely self-plagiarism. In July 2012, the Faculty of Business, Economics and Management at the University of Zurich decided to not extend the employment contract Frey had after having become emeritus professor.

== Self-plagiarism ==
During 2010 and 2011 Frey, with co-authors Benno Torgler and David Savage, published four articles concerning the Titanic disaster in four different journals. Concerning these articles, in 2011 Frey and his co-authors were accused of self-plagiarism. On 3 May 2011 David Autor, editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, wrote a public letter to Frey claiming "very substantial overlap between these articles and your JEP publication. Indeed, to my eye, they are substantively identical." Pointing out that the other articles were not cited, Autor further wrote that "your conduct in this matter [is] ethically dubious and disrespectful to the American Economic Association, the Journal of Economic Perspectives and the JEP's readers." In a public response Frey accepted theses accusations and offered his apologies, writing, "[i]t was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable."
