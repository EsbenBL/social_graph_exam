=== Work ===


==== Difficult public policy issues ====
In 1977 Nelson wrote an essay, The Moon and the Ghetto: An Essay on Public Policy Analysis, which asked "If we can put a man on the moon, why can't we solve the problem of the ghetto?" He argued that public policy progress was often hampered by the partial, and often faulty, conceptualisation of problems and solutions by the different decision-making parties. Economists, public policy experts and technologists all understand problems within their own terms of reference, and thus challenge the validity of other perspectives. This leads to muddling of values and facts, and to internecine policy warfare. Nelson recommended open-minded dialogue and a sequential, experimental approach to hard problems.


==== Technological paradigms ====
In 2008 Nelson wrote on “technological paradigms”. He believed the power of these varied greatly across fields of practice, in the sense that in certain field's progress has been much more rapid than in others where comparable resources have been applied to the effort. He proposed that one important factor in this is the extent to which the technology in a field is controllable and replicable. Another factor is the strength of the supporting sciences. He argued that these factors are strongly intertwined with the causal arrows going both ways.


=== Awards ===
Nelson has won various awards. In 2005 he was awarded the Leontief Prize presented by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University.  In 2006 he became the 27th laureate of the Honda Prize.
