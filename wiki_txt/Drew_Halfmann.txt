Drew Halfmann (born June 28, 1967) is an American sociologist best known for his research on social policy in the United States.


== Career ==
Drew Halfmann is currently Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Davis.His book Doctors and Demonstrators: How Political Institutions Shape Abortion Law in the United States, Britain, and Canada (University of Chicago Press, 2011), which won the 2012 Charles Tilly Award for Best Book from the American Sociological Association section on Collective Behavior and Social Movements, explains that abortion law remains contentious in the United States mainly due to permeability of political parties by social movements. This, Halfmann argues, is in contrast to abortion law in Britain and Canada, where the topic is a settled issue, experienced now in politics merely as a medical matter.Halfmann’s work has appeared in The American Sociological Review, Mobilization, Social Problems, Health, and other academic journals.
Halfmann earned his doctorate at New York University in 2001. He spent his undergraduate years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
