    "The aim of this project is to explore the social science community. To construct this \"community\" of social scientists, we found inspiration by looking at department for Social Science at Copenhagen University. The Social Science department have five different sciences: Sociology, psychology, economy, anthropology, and political science. With these five categories we found a list of scientists for each category on wikipedia and from these five lists we gathered the wikipedia page for each scientist, which then is just necessary to clean and preprocess to make possible to use for network analysis and NLP models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By looking into these disciplines’ social scientists we hope to find patterns in the connections both within the five categories but also between the five social sciences. We will first seek to answer the question of, what characteristics does the community of the five social sciences have? We will examine this question by looking into the over network properties of each followed by a network analysis. Thereafter we will examine the communities of the social sciences, by doing this we will answer these questions: Are the traditional categories within the social science community actually also apt/suitable for the social science community? Or are the categorizations just a historic relic which we should reject, and then embrace some other maybe more relevant categorizations within the social sciences? By looking into this it becomes possible to either deny or affirm the different scientists relevance within the different disciplines of the social science community. \n",
