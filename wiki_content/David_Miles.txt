'''David Kenneth Miles''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 1959<ref>Debrett's</ref>) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[economist]].  Born in Swansea, he has spent his working life in London, in teaching, business and the public sector. He is a Professor at [[Imperial College London]], and was Chief UK Economist of [[Morgan Stanley]] bank from October 2004 to May 2009. He was appointed to the [[Bank of England]]'s interest-rate-setting [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) from 1 June 2009 to June 2012<ref name=guardian190309>''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 March 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/19/miles-replaces-blancflower-mpc Miles to replace Blanchflower on Bank of England monetary policy committee]</ref> and again from June 2012 to 31 August 2015, before being replaced by [[Gertjan Vlieghe]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gertjan Vlieghe appointed as external member of the Monetary Policy Committee|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gertjan-vlieghe-appointed-as-external-member-of-the-monetary-policy-committee|website = GOV.UK|access-date = 6 February 2016|date = 28 July 2015}}</ref> According to the Bank of England, "As an economist he has focused on the interaction between financial markets and the wider economy."<ref>Bank of England, [http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/biographies/miles.htm Professor David Miles: Monetary Policy Committee Member], accessed 15 July 2009</ref>. In December 2020 he was appointed to the main board ("The Commission") of the central Bank of Ireland. 

Miles was born in 1959, and was educated at the [[Bishop Gore School]] in Swansea, [[University College, Oxford]], Nuffield College, Oxford, and the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>Morgan Stanley,[http://www.morganstanley.com/views/gef/team/index.html Global Economic Forum Team]</ref>

In 2003 Miles produced a report for the British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] to examine why the long-term fixed rate [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] market is not as popular a product in Britain as in other countries. His report states: "A great many borrowers focus on the initial cost of debt and do not seem to consider carefully how those payments might change relative to their incomes". Much of Miles's  academic research has focused on housing, pensions, monetary policy, asset pricing and ways to make the financial system more stable.

From 2004 to 2009 Miles was Chief UK Economist of [[Morgan Stanley]] bank.  

Miles predicted a substantial fall in real house prices in November 2006.<ref>''[[BBC]]'', 22 November 2006, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6172088.stm House prices 'set for slowdown']</ref>

In 2009 he was asked, along with Gerald Holtham and Professor Berndt Spahn, to serve on a Commission established by the Welsh Assembly Government to investigate the scope for the Welsh Assembly to have greater fiscal autonomy. The Holtham Commission reported in July 2010.

From June 2009 to August 2015 Miles served on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee.  In 2011 he published a detailed study of the appropriate balance sheet structure of banks to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis ("Optimal Bank Capital").<ref> "Optimal Bank Capital" http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/externalmpcpapers/extmpcpaper0031.pdf</ref> He concluded that the Basel III agreements on capital requirements for banks set the standard for equity at only about half its appropriate level.  In 2012 he began a second term with the Monetary Policy Committee.

He was President of the economics section of the British Science Association (BSA) for 2015. He was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2016 New Year Honours]] for services to monetary policy.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=61450|supp=y|page=N9|date=30 December 2015}}</ref> 

In 2016 he was appointed by Her Majesty's Treasury to advise on the measurement and reporting of yields on UK government debt. His report was completed in October 2016 and is being implemented.  
He is Chair of the board of trustees of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and a trustee of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. He is a member of Council of Economic Advisors to Her Majesty's Treasury. 

A keen scrum half in his youth, Miles also gained fame as the top try scorer in the South Wales regional league season 1976–77.
