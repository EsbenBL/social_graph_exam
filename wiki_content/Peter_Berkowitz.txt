In October 2020 he tested positive for the [[Novel coronavirus|new coronavirus]] following meetings with senior officials at [[10 Downing Street]] and the [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|Foreign Office]] in London, and with officials in Budapest and Paris. Berkowitz's compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing practices was reportedly lax during the trip, causing concerns about the spread of the virus to high-levels officials in Europe. Following Berkowitz's's trip, British officials became more selective in approving American officials for travel to the UK.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Peter Berkowitz|url=https://www.hoover.org/profiles/peter-berkowitz|access-date=2021-06-09|website=Hoover Institution|language=en}}</ref> U.S. State Department officials were angered by Berkowitz's decision to hold face-to-face meetings in Europe, arguing that it was unnecessary.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Jakes|first=Lara|date=2020-11-01|title=U.S. Diplomat Coughs Online, and European Allies Wonder if They Were Exposed|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/us/politics/coronavirus-state-department-diplomats.html|access-date=2020-11-01|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
