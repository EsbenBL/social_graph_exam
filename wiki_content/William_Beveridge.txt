'''William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCB}} (5 March 1879 – 16 March 1963) was a British economist and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician who was a [[Progressivism|progressive]] and social reformer who played a central role in designing the British welfare state. His 1942 report ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'' (known as the [[Beveridge Report]]) served as the basis for the [[welfare state]] put in place by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] elected in 1945.<ref> James Midgley, "Beveridge, Lord William", ''Encyclopedia of Social Work'' (19th ed. NASW Press:Washington DC. 1995) Vol. 3. p. 2574. </ref> 
 
He built his career as an expert on [[unemployment insurance]]. He served on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created [[labour exchange]]s, and later as Permanent Secretary of the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]]. He was Director of the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of [[University College, Oxford]].

Beveridge published widely on unemployment and [[social security]], his most notable works being: ''Unemployment: A Problem of Industry'' (1909), ''Planning Under Socialism'' (1936), ''[[Full Employment in a Free Society]]'' (1944), ''Pillars of Security'' (1943), ''Power and Influence'' (1953) and ''A Defence of Free Learning'' (1959). He was elected in a [[1944 Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election|1944 by-election]] as a Liberal MP (for [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]]); following his defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he was elevated to the [[House of Lords]] where he served as the leader of the Liberal peers.

==Early life and education==
[[File:William Beveridge at Balliol 1898, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beveridge at Balliol College in 1898]]
Beveridge, the eldest son of [[Henry Beveridge (1837–1929)|Henry Beveridge]], an [[Indian Civil Service]] officer and District Judge, and scholar [[Annette Beveridge|Annette Ackroyd]], was born in Rangpur, [[British India]] (now [[Rangpur (city), Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Bangladesh]]), on 5 March 1879.<ref name = "BeveridgeODNB"/>

Beveridge's mother had, with [[Elizabeth Malleson]], founded the Working Women's College in [[Queen Square, London]] in 1864. She met and married Henry Beveridge in Calcutta where she had gone in 1873 to open a school for Indian girls. William Beveridge was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], a leading [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] near the market town of [[Godalming]] in Surrey, followed by [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied Mathematics and Classics, obtaining a [[first class degree]] in both. He later studied law.<ref name="Harris43">Jose Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 43-78.</ref>

While Beveridge's mother had been a member of the [[Stourbridge]] Unitarian community,<ref name="Harris43"/> his father was an early [[religious humanism|humanist]] and [[positivism|positivist]] activist and "an ardent disciple" of the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]. Comte's ideas of a secular [[religion of humanity]] were a prominent influence in the household and would exert a lasting influence on Beveridge's thinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fabians.org.uk/who-was-william-beveridge/|publisher=[[Fabian Society]]|title=Who Was William Beveridge|date=21 December 2012|access-date=6 July 2018}}</ref> Beveridge himself became a "[[Materialism|materialist]] [[agnosticism|agnostic]]", in his words.<ref name="Harris1-323">Jose Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 1, 323.</ref>

==Life and career==
[[File:Sir W.H. Beveridge, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing left.jpg|thumb|upright|Beveridge in the 1910s]]
After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the [[social services]] and wrote about the subject for the ''[[Morning Post]]'' newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at [[Toynbee Hall]], a [[settlement house]] in London. There he worked closely with [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting [[old age pensions]], [[School meal|free school meals]], and campaigning for a national system of [[labour exchange]]s.<ref>Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 98-117.</ref>

In 1908, now considered to be Britain's leading authority on [[unemployment insurance]], he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to [[Winston Churchill]], who had recently been promoted to the [[First Asquith ministry|Cabinet]] as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and [[National Insurance]] to combat unemployment and poverty. During the [[First World War]] he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]].<ref>Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 196-227.</ref>

In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on [[social policy]]. He was so highly influenced by the [[Fabian Society]] socialists – in particular by [[Beatrice Webb]], with whom he worked on the 1909 ''Poor Laws'' report – that he could be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909).  The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with [[Edwin Cannan]] and [[Lionel Robbins]], who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots.<ref>Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 257-76.</ref> From 1929 he led the [[International scientific committee on price history]], contributing a large historical study, ''Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Century'' (1939).

In 1933 he helped set up the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]]. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape [[Nazi]] persecution. In 1937 Beveridge was appointed [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[University College, Oxford]].<ref name = "BeveridgeODNB"/>

==Wartime work==
[[File:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|Beveridge in 1943]]

Three years later, [[Ernest Bevin]], Minister of Labour in the wartime National government, invited Beveridge to take charge of the Welfare department of his Ministry. Beveridge refused, but declared an interest in organising British manpower in wartime (Beveridge had come to favour a strong system of centralised planning). Bevin was reluctant to let Beveridge have his way but did commission him to work on a relatively unimportant manpower survey from June 1940 and so Beveridge became a temporary civil servant. Neither Bevin nor the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry [[Thomas Williams Phillips|Sir Thomas Phillips]] liked working with Beveridge as both found him conceited.<ref name="Manpower survey">Paul Addison, ''The Road to 1945'', Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 117.</ref>

His work on manpower culminated in his chairmanship of the Committee on Skilled Men in the Services which reported to the War Cabinet in August and October 1941.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/small/cab-66-21-wp-42-44-24.pdf|title=Cabinet memorandum: The Committee on Skilled Men in the Services|last=Secretary of State for War|date=29 January 1942|website=The National Archives|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> Two recommendations of the committee were implemented: Army recruits were enlisted for their first six weeks into the [[General Service Corps]], so that their subsequent posting could take account of their skills and the Army's needs; and the [[Corps Of Royal Electrical And Mechanical Engineers|Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] was created.<ref name=":0" />

===Report on social insurance and views on full employment===
An opportunity for Bevin to ease Beveridge out presented itself in May 1941 when Minister of Health [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]] announced the formation of a committee of officials to survey existing social insurance and allied services, and to make recommendations. Although Brown had made the announcement, the inquiry had largely been urged by Minister without Portfolio [[Arthur Greenwood]], and Bevin suggested to Greenwood making Beveridge chairman of the committee. Beveridge, at first uninterested and seeing the committee as a distraction from his work on manpower, accepted only reluctantly.<ref name="Beveridge committee">[[Paul Addison]], "The Road to 1945", Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 169.</ref>

The report to Parliament on ''[[Beveridge Report|Social Insurance and Allied Services]]'' was published in November 1942. It proposed that all people of [[working age]] should pay a weekly [[national insurance]] contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. Beveridge argued that this system would provide a minimum standard of living "below which no one should be allowed to fall". It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the "five giants on the road of reconstruction" of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Beveridge included as one of three fundamental assumptions the fact that there would be a National Health Service of some sort, a policy already being worked on in the Ministry of Health.<ref name="Beveridge report">Paul Addison, "The Road to 1945", Jonathan Cape, 1975, pp. 169–70.</ref>

Beveridge's arguments were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics by arguing that welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of [[corporation|corporate]] ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as a great source of demand for British goods.

Beveridge saw [[full employment]] (defined as unemployment of no more than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. ''[[Full Employment in a Free Society]]'', written in 1944 expressed the view that it was "absurd" to "look to individual employers for maintenance of demand and full employment." These things must be "undertaken by the State under the supervision and pressure of democracy."<ref>According to Nobel Laureate [[Friedrich Hayek]], this book was ghostwritten by [[Nicholas Kaldor]]. Hayek said that Beveridge "wasn't the least interested in economics. He knew no economics whatever."  Cf. Kresge, Stephan, and Wenar, Leif, ''Hayek on Hayek'', (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994), p. 86.</ref> Measures for achieving full-employment might include [[Keynesian]]-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's thinking was [[social justice]], and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.

==Later career==
[[File:The Home Front in Britain 1939-1945 TR1625.jpg|thumb|upright|Beveridge talking to an American fighter pilot hospitalised at [[University College, Oxford]] during the [[Second World War]]]]
Later in 1944, Beveridge, who had recently joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in a [[1944 Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election|by-election]] to succeed [[George Charles Grey]], who had died on the battlefield in [[Normandy]], France, on the first day of [[Operation Bluecoat]] on 30 July 1944. Beveridge briefly served as [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the constituency of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]], during which time he was prominent in the [[Radical Action]] group, which called for the party to withdraw from the [[war-time electoral pact]] and adopt more radical policies. However, he lost his seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], when he was defeated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, [[Robert Thorp (MP)|Robert Thorp]], by a majority of 1,962 votes.

The following year, the new Labour Government began the process of implementing Beveridge's proposals that provided the basis of the modern Welfare State. [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] defeated [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Attlee announced he would introduce the Welfare State outlined in the 1942 Beveridge Report. This included the establishment of a [[History of the National Health Service|National Health Service in 1948]] with taxpayer funded medical treatment for all. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide "social security" so that the population would be protected from the "cradle to the grave". The new system was partly built upon the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Insurance scheme]] set up by then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and future [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] in 1911.

In 1946, Beveridge was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Beveridge, of Tuggal in the County of [[Northumberland]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37627 |date=25 June 1946 |page=3229 }}</ref> and eventually became leader of the Liberal Party in the [[House of Lords]]. He was the author of ''Power and Influence'' (1953). He was the President of the charity Attend (then the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1952 to 1962.<ref>[http://www.attend.org.uk/about-us/people-we-honour-0/attend-vips "Attend VIPs"]. ''attend.org.uk''. Retrieved on 29 November 2015.</ref>

==Eugenics==
Beveridge was a member of the [[Galton Institute|Eugenics Society]], which promoted the study of methods to 'improve' the human race by [[Eugenics|controlling reproduction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/society/2010/12/british-eugenics-disabled|title=The eugenics movement Britain wants to forget|last=Brignell|first=Victoria|date=9 December 2010|website=New Statesman|access-date=7 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaVoJemPPlAC|title=Eugenics, Literature, and Culture in Post-war Britain|first=Clare|last=Hanson|date=5 July 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415806985|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/about/|title=About – The Galton Institute|website=galtoninstitute.org.uk}}</ref> In 1909, he proposed that men who could not work should be supported by the state "but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood."<ref>{{Citation  | last = Sewell  | first = Dennis  | title = How eugenics poisoned the welfare state  | newspaper = The Spectator  | date = November 2009  | url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5571423/how-eugenics-poisoned-the-welfare-state.thtml  | access-date = 6 December 2009  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101128141116/http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5571423/how-eugenics-poisoned-the-welfare-state.thtml  | archive-date = 28 November 2010  | url-status = dead  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref> Whilst director of the London School of Economics, Beveridge attempted to create a Department of Social Biology. Though never fully established, [[Lancelot Hogben]], a fierce anti-eugenicist, was named its chair. Former LSE director [[John Ashworth (scientist)|John Ashworth]] speculated that discord between those in favour and those against the serious study of eugenics led to Beveridge's departure from the school in 1937.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=145449&sectioncode=26 |title=Five years of Darwin seminars: a paradigm shift? &#124; General |magazine=Times Higher Education |date=12 March 1999 |access-date=29 March 2013}}{{subscription}}</ref>

In the 1940s, Beveridge credited the Eugenics Society with promoting the [[Child benefit#United Kingdom|children's allowance]], which was incorporated into his 1942 report. However, whilst he held views in support of eugenics, he did not believe the report had any overall "eugenic value".<ref>''Eugenics Review'' 1944 April; 36(1): pp. 17–24.</ref> Professor [[Danny Dorling]] of the [[University of Sheffield]] says "there is not even the faintest hint" of eugenic thought in the report.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ARTICLES|url=http://www.rofea.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/20/9|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-29|website=www.rofea.org}}</ref>

Dennis Sewell states that "On the day the House of Commons met to debate the Beveridge Report in 1943, its author slipped out of the gallery early in the evening to address a meeting of the Eugenics Society at the Mansion House.  ...  His report he was keen to reassure them, was eugenic in intent and would prove so in effect.  ...  The idea of child allowances had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, to limit the number of children born to poor households.  For both effects to be properly stimulated, the allowance needed to be graded: middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents.  ...  The Home Secretary had that very day signalled that the government planned a flat rate of child allowance. But Beveridge, alluding to the problem of an overall declining birth rate, argued that even the flat rate would be eugenic. Nevertheless, he held out hope for the purists."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2het_tm-ToC|title=The Political Gene: How Darwin's Ideas Changed Politics|author=Dennis Sewell|publisher=Picador|year=2009|isbn=978-0-330-42744-9|pages=73–74}}</ref>  'Sir William made it clear that it was in his view not only possible but desirable that  graded family allowance schemes, applicable to families in the higher income brackets, be administered concurrently with his flat rate scheme,' reported the ''[[Eugenics Review]]''.<ref>''Eugenics Review'' 1943; vol. 35, p. 23.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:The graves of Lord and Lady Beveridge, 1992.jpg|thumb|right|The graves of Lord and Lady Beveridge]]
Beveridge married Jessy Janet, daughter of William Philip and widow of David Mair, in 1942. He died at his home on 16 March 1963, aged 84,<ref name = "BeveridgeODNB">{{Cite ODNB|id=31871|title=Beveridge, William Henry, Baron Beveridge|first = Jose|last = Harris}}</ref> and was buried in [[Thockrington]] churchyard, on the Northumbrian moors. His barony became extinct upon his death. His last words were "I have a thousand things to do".<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Jose|title=William Beveridge: A Biography|edition=Revised paperback|year=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198206852|page=477|chapter=18: Father of the Welfare State?}}</ref>

==Commemoration==
Beveridge Street in the [[Christchurch Central City]] was named for William Beveridge. It was one of 120 streets that were renamed in 1948 by [[Peter Fraser]]'s [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government of New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Manthei |first1=Marjorie |title=Our Little Corner of the World |date=2018 |publisher=Victoria Neighbourhood Association Inc |location=Christchurch |isbn=978-0-473-44506-5 |page=39}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-B.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names B |last=Harper |first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=73–74 |access-date=31 August 2018 | date=February 2016}}</ref>

In November 2018, [[English Heritage]] unveiled a [[blue plaque]] commemorating Beveridge at 27 Bedford Gardens in [[Campden Hill]], London W8 7EF where he lived from 1914 until 1921.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/sir-william-beveridge|title=Blue Plaques: Sir William Beveridge|work=English Heritage|access-date=24 November 2018}}</ref>

[[University College, Oxford]]'s society for students studying and tutors involved in the study of [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] was recently renamed the Beveridge Society in his honour.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}
