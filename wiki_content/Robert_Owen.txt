'''Robert Owen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|ɪ|n}}; 14 May 1771 – 17 November 1858) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] textile manufacturer, philanthropist and social reformer, and a founder of [[utopian socialism]] and the [[cooperative]] movement. He strove to improve factory working conditions, promoted experimental socialistic communities, and sought a more collective approach to child rearing, including government control of education.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Richard Gunderman |title=Robert Owen, born 250 years ago, tried to use his wealth to perfect humanity in a radically equal society |date=11 May 2021 |url=https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Robert-Owen-born-250-years-ago-tried-to-use-his-16167787.php |access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref> He gained wealth in the early 1800s from a [[textile mill]] at [[New Lanark]], Scotland. Having trained as a [[draper]] in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] he worked in London before relocating aged 18 to [[Manchester]] and textile manufacturing. In 1824, he moved to America and put most of his fortune in an experimental socialistic community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]], as a preliminary for his Utopian society. It lasted about two years. Other [[Owenite]] communities also failed, and in 1828 Owen returned to London, where he continued to champion the working class, lead in developing [[cooperative]]s and the [[trade union]] movement, and support child labour legislation and free co-educational schools.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Newtown Parish Register for births with an entry for Robert Owen, born June 12th 1771 (1294584).jpg|thumb|Baptism record of Robert Owen in the Newtown Parish Register]]
Robert Owen was born in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], a small market town in [[Montgomeryshire]], Wales, on 14 May 1771, to Anne (Williams) and Robert Owen. His father was a [[saddle]]r, [[ironmongery|ironmonger]] and local postmaster; his mother was the daughter of a Newtown farming family. Young Robert was the sixth of the family's seven children, two of whom died at a young age. His surviving siblings were William, Anne, John and Richard.<ref name=Britannica/><ref>{{Cite journal| author=Arthur H.

Owen received little formal education, but he was an avid reader. He left school at the age of ten to be apprenticed to a [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], Lincolnshire, [[draper]] for four years.

While in Manchester, Owen borrowed £100 from his brother William, so as to enter into a partnership to make [[spinning mule]]s, a new invention for spinning cotton thread, but exchanged his business share within a few months for six spinning mules that he worked in rented factory space.<ref>Podmore, pp. 42–43.</ref> In 1792, when Owen was about 21 years old, mill-owner [[Peter Drinkwater]] made him manager of the [[Piccadilly Mill]] at Manchester.

By the early 1790s, Owen's entrepreneurial spirit, management skills and progressive moral views were emerging. In 1793, he was elected a member of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]],<ref name=Timeline/> where the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] were discussed.

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Robert Owen's House, New Lanark.jpg|thumb|Robert Owen's house in [[New Lanark]], Scotland.]]
On a visit to Scotland, Owen met and fell in love with Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale, daughter of [[David Dale]], a [[Glasgow]] philanthropist and the proprietor of the large New Lanark Mills. After their marriage on 30 September 1799, the Owens set up home in New Lanark, but later moved to Braxfield, Scotland.<ref name=Timeline/><ref name=Estabrook64>Estabrook, p. 64.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=Robert Dale Owen |title=Threading My Way, Twenty-seven Years of Autobiography |publisher=G.

Robert and Caroline Owen had eight children, the first of whom died in infancy. Their seven survivors were four sons and three daughters: Robert Dale (1801–1877), William (1802–1842), Ann (or Anne) Caroline (1805–1831), Jane Dale (1805–1861), David Dale (1807–1860), Richard Dale (1809–1890) and Mary (1810–1832).<ref name=Timeline/><ref name=Rees/><ref>Estabrook, pp. 72, 80 and 83{{Cite book |author=Victor Lincoln Albjerg |title=Richard Owen: Scotland 1810, Indiana 1890 |series=The Archives of Purdue, no. 2|date=March 1946 |location=Lafayette, Indiana |page=16}} See also{{Cite web |title=Richard Owen |publisher=Indiana Department of Administration |url= http://www.in.gov/idoa/2783.htm |access-date=15 September 2017}}</ref> Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale and Richard, and his daughter Jane Dale, followed their father to the United States, becoming US citizens and permanent residents in New Harmony, Indiana.

==New Lanark mill==
In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became its manager in January 1800.<ref name=Timeline/><ref name=Estabrook64/> Encouraged by his management success in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. It had been established in 1785 by David Dale and [[Richard Arkwright]]. Its water power provided by the falls of the [[River Clyde]] turned its cotton-spinning operation into one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were involved, 500 of them children brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of [[Edinburgh]] and Glasgow. Dale, known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark residents was unsatisfactory, despite efforts by Dale and his son-in-law Owen to improve their workers' lives.<ref>Estabrook, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Harrison34>John F.

Many of the workers were from the lowest social levels: theft, drunkenness and other vices were common and education and sanitation neglected. Most families lived in one room. More respected people rejected the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills.<ref name=AdventuresSocialism>{{Cite web |first=Alex |last=cullen |title=Adventures in Socialism New Lanark establishment and Orbiston community |date=1891 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030362721/cu31924030362721_djvu.txt |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

Until a series of [[Truck Acts]] (1831–1887) required employers to pay their employees in common currency, many operated a [[truck system]], paying workers wholly or in part with tokens that had no monetary value outside the mill owner's "truck shop", which charged high prices for shoddy goods.<ref name="WeekesThesis">{{Cite thesis |first=Richard |last=Weekes |title=The British retail co-operative movement |type=MSa |publisher=University of Central Lancashire |date=2004 |url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/2932/1/Weekes_2004.pdf |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> Unlike others, Owen's truck store offered goods at prices only slightly above their wholesale cost,<ref name=Estabrook64/> passing on the savings from bulk purchases to his customers and placing alcohol sales under strict supervision.

==Philosophy and influence==
Owen tested his social and economic ideas at New Lanark, where he won his workers' confidence and continued to have success through the improved efficiency at the mill. The community also earned an international reputation. Social reformers, statesmen and royalty, including the future Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], visited New Lanark to study its methods.<ref name=Estabrook64/><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Kent Schuette |title=New Harmony, Indiana: Three Great Community Experiments |journal=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=45 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis |date=Spring 2014}}</ref> The opinions of many such visitors were favourable.<ref name=Harrison37>Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 37.</ref>

Owen's biggest success was in support of youth education and early child care. As a pioneer in Britain, notably Scotland, Owen provided an alternative to the "normal authoritarian approach to child education".<ref>Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America", ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 40.</ref> The manners of children brought up under his system were more graceful, genial and unconstrained; health, plenty and contentment prevailed; drunkenness was almost unknown and illegitimacy extremely rare. Owen's relations with his workers remained excellent and operations at the mill proceeded in a smooth, regular and commercially successful way.<ref name=AdventuresSocialism/><ref name=Estabrook64/>

However, some of Owen's schemes displeased his partners, forcing him to arrange for other investors to buy his share of the business in 1813, for the equivalent of US$800,000.<ref name=Estabrook64/> The new investors, who included [[Jeremy Bentham]] and the well-known Quaker [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], were content to accept a £5,000 return on their capital.<ref name=AdventuresSocialism/> The ownership change also provided Owen with a chance to broaden his philanthropy, advocating improvements in workers' rights and child labour laws, and free education for children.<ref name=Estabrook64/>

In 1813 Owen authored and published ''A New View of Society, or Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character'', the first of four essays he wrote to explain the principles behind his philosophy of socialistic reform.<ref name=GS269-70>{{Cite book |editor-first=Linda C. |editor-last=Gugin |editor2-first=James E. |editor2-last=St. Clair |title=Indiana's 200: The People Who Shaped the Hoosier State |publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press |year=2015 |location=Indianapolis |pages=269–70 |isbn =978-0-87195-387-2}}</ref> Owen had originally been a follower of the classical liberal, [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] Jeremy Bentham, who believed that free markets, in particular the right of workers to move and choose their employers, would release workers from the excessive power of capitalists. However, Owen developed his own, pro-socialist outlook. In addition, Owen as a [[Deism|deist]], criticised organised religion, including the [[Church of England]], and developed a belief system of his own.<ref name=Traces12/><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Ryan Rokicki |title=Science in Utopia: New Harmony's Naturalistic Legacy |journal=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=52 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis |date=Spring 2014}}</ref>

Owen felt that human character is formed by conditions over which individuals have no control. Thus individuals could not be praised or blamed for their behaviour or situation in life. This principle led Owen to conclude that the correct formation of people's characters called for placing them under proper environmental influences – physical, moral and social – from their earliest years. These notions of inherent irresponsibility in humans and the effect of early influences on an individual's character formed the basis of Owen's system of education and social reform.<ref>Merle Curti, "Robert Owen in American Thought," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 62.</ref>

Relying on his own observations, experiences and thoughts, Owen saw his view of human nature as original and "the most basic and necessary constituent in an evolving science of society".<ref name=Curti61>Curti, "Robert Owen in American Thought," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 61.</ref> His philosophy was influenced by Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s views on natural law, and his views resembled those of [[Plato]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], [[William Godwin]], [[John Locke]], [[James Mill]], and [[Jeremy Bentham]], among others. Owen did not have the direct influence of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers.<ref name=Curti61/><ref>"Panel Discussion", ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 85.</ref>

Owen's work at New Lanark continued to have significance in Britain and continental Europe. He was a "pioneer in factory reform, the father of distributive cooperation, and the founder of nursery schools."<ref name=Rees/> His schemes for educating his workers included opening an Institute for the Formation of Character at New Lanark in 1818. This and other programmes at New Lanark provided free education from infancy to adulthood.<ref name=GS269-70/><ref name=Timeline/> In addition, he zealously supported factory legislation that culminated in the [[Factory Acts|Cotton Mills and Factories Act]] of 1819. Owen also had interviews and communications with leading members of the British government, including its premier, Robert Banks Jenkinson, [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. He also met many of the rulers and leading statesmen of Europe.<ref name=Dowd>{{Cite web |first=Douglas |last=Dowd |title=Robert Owen: British Social Reformer |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Owen |access-date= 30 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=Guru>{{Cite web |title=Robert Owen |work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2008/10/31/robert-owen |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

Owen adopted new principles to raise the standard of goods his workers produced. A cube with faces painted in different colours was installed above each machinist's workplace. The colour of the face showed to all who saw it the quality and quantity of goods the worker completed. The intention was to encourage workers to do their best. Although it was no great incentive in itself, conditions at New Lanark for workers and their families were idyllic for the time.<ref name=Guru/><ref name=Dowd/>

===Eight-hour day===
Owen raised the demand for an [[eight-hour day]] in 1810 and set about instituting the policy at [[New Lanark]]. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of an eight-hour working day with the slogan "eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest".<ref name=Ward>{{Cite web |first=Marguerite |last=Ward |publisher=[[CNBC]] |date=3 May 2017 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/03/how-the-8-hour-workday-changed-how-americans-work.html |title=A brief history of the 8-hour workday, which changed how Americans work |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

===Models for socialism (1817)===
[[File:Robert Owen Statue, Balloon Street, Manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue commemorating Owen in [[Manchester]], in front of [[The Co-operative Bank]].]]
Owen embraced socialism in 1817, a turning point in his life, and began pursuing what he described as a "New View of Society".<ref name=Harrison34/> He outlined his position in a report to the committee of the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] on the country's [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Laws]].<ref name=CommitteeReport>{{Cite web |first=Robert |last=Owen |title=To the Chairman of The Committee on the Nation's Poor Laws |publisher=University of Texas |url=http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368owenrptcom.html |date=12 March 1817 |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> In addition, as misery and trade stagnation after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] captured national attention, the government invited Owen to offer advice on what to do to alleviate the industrial concerns. Although Owen attributed the immediate misery to the wars, he argued that the underlying cause was competition of human labour with machinery, and recommended setting up self-sufficient communities.<ref name=Rees/>

Owen proposed that communities of some 1,200 people should settle on land from {{convert|1000|to|1500|acre|ha|0}}, all living in one building with a public kitchen and dining halls. (The proposed size is likely to have been influenced by the size of the village of New Lanark.) Owen also proposed that each family have its own private apartments and the responsibility for the care of its children up to the age of three. Thereafter children would be raised by the community, but their parents would have access to them at mealtimes and on other occasions. Owen further suggested that such communities be established by individuals, parishes, [[county|counties]], or other governmental units. In each case there would be effective supervision by qualified persons. Work and enjoyment of its results should be experienced communally. Owen believed his idea would be the best way to reorganise society in general,<ref name=AdventuresSocialism /><ref name=Dowd/> and called his vision the "New Moral World".<ref name=GS269-70/>

Owen's utopian model changed little in his lifetime. His developed model envisaged an association of 500–3,000 people as the optimum for a working community. While mainly agricultural, it would possess the best machinery, offer varied employment, and as far as possible be self-contained. Owen went on to explain that as such communities proliferated, "unions of them federatively united shall be formed in circle of tens, hundreds and thousands", linked by common interest.<ref name="BloyVillages">{{Cite web |first=Marjie |last=Bloy |title=Robert Owen and 'villages of co-operation' |publisher=A web of English History |date=4 March 2016 |url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/ruralife/owenvill.htm |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

===Arguments against Owen and his answers===
Owen always tried to spread his ideas to wider communities. First, he started publishing his ideas in newspapers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Owen then sent such newspapers widely to parliamentarians, politicians and other important people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} These articles spurred the first negative reactions to his ideas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Opponents thought that Owen's plans would result in an uncontrollable increase in population and poverty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The other main criticism was that Owen's plan and the common use of everything would essentially make the country one large workshop.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} [[William Hone]] claimed that Owen saw people as unravelled plants from their roots, and that he wanted to plant them in rectangles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Another commentator accused Owen of wanting to imprison people in workshops like barracks and eradicate their personal independence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Owen's opponents had begun to regard him as an enemy of religion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} His influence in ruling circles, which he had hoped would help him to accomplish his "plan", started diminishing and rumours of his lack of religious conviction spread. Owen believed that without a change in the character of individuals and the environment in which they live, they would remain hostile to those around them. As long as such a social order continued, the positive aspects of Christianity could never be put into practice. Owen also considered it necessary to give people more freedom in order to improve the situation of the poor and working classes. Unless people were better educated, unless they gained more useful information and had permanent employment, they were a danger to the security of the state when given more freedom than the British Constitution did at the time. Without making any changes in the national institutions, he believed that even reorganizing the working classes would bring great benefits. So he opposed the views of radicals seeking to change in the public mentality by expanding voting rights.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sosyalizmin öncülerinden Robert Owen: Yaşamı, öğretisi, eylemi |last=Aybay |first=Rona |publisher=YKY |year=2005 |location=İstanbul}}</ref>

Other notable critics of Owen include [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who viewed his work as a precursor to their own.<ref>{{Citation |last=Marx |first=Karl |author-link=Karl Marx |title=The Communist manifesto |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952691991 |isbn=978-1-5189-2555-9 |oclc=952691991 |access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> They recognized in Owen the important understanding, developed by Marx in [[Das Kapital|''Capital'']], that it is the working class that are responsible for creating the unparalleled wealth in capitalist societies.<ref>{{Citation |last=Owen |first=Robert |title=The revolution in the mind and practice}}</ref> Similarly, Owen also recognized that under the existing economic system, the working class did not automatically receive the benefits of that newly created wealth. Marx and Engels, differentiated, however, their own scientific conception of socialism from Owen's societies.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Paden |first=Roger |date=2002 |title=Marx's Critique of the Utopian Socialists |journal=Utopian Studies |volume=13 |pages=67–91 |via=JSTOR}}</ref> They argued that Owen's plan, to create a model socialist utopia to coexist with contemporary society and prove its superiority over time, was insufficient to create a new society. In their view, Owen was a Utopian, since his objective was "to discover a new and more perfect system of social order and to impose this upon society".<ref>{{Citation |last=Engels |first=Friedrich |title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm}}</ref> They believed that socialism would erupt from within the class conflict itself as a result of the inherent contradictions of capitalism. Moreover, socialism could only be achieved by violent revolution, since the bourgeoisie would always be able to deflect and block peaceful attempts. 

==Community experiments==
[[File:New harmony vision.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[New Moral World]], Owen's envisioned successor of [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]]. [[Owenism|Owenites]] fired bricks to build it, but it was never constructed.]]
To test the viability of his ideas for self-sufficient working communities, Owen began experimenting in communal living in America in 1825. Among the most famous efforts was the one set up at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana.<ref name=Rees/> Of the 130 identifiable communitarian experiments in America before the [[American Civil War]], at least 16 were [[Owenism|Owenite]] or Owenite-influenced. New Harmony was Owen's earliest and most ambitious of these.<ref name=Harrison37/>

Owen and his son William sailed to America in October 1824 to establish an experimental community in Indiana.<ref name=Leopold21>{{Cite book |author=Richard William Leopold |title=Robert Dale Owen, A Biography |publisher=Harvard University Press |series=Harvard Historical Studies |volume=45 |year=1940 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=21 |oclc=774894}}</ref> In January 1825 Owen used a portion of his own funds to purchase an existing town of 180 buildings and several thousand acres of land along the Wabash River in [[Indiana]]. [[George Rapp]]'s [[Harmony Society]], the religious group that owned the property and had founded the communal village of Harmony (or Harmonie) on the site in 1814, decided in 1824 to relocate to [[Pennsylvania]]. Owen renamed it New Harmony and made the village his preliminary model for a Utopian community.<ref name="GS269-70"/><ref>{{Cite book |author=Karl J. R.

Owen sought support for his socialist vision among American thinkers, reformers, intellectuals and public statesmen. On 25 February and 7 March 1825, Owen gave addresses in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and others in the US government, outlining his vision for the Utopian community at New Harmony, and his socialist beliefs.<ref name=GS269-70/><ref>Estabrook, p. 66. See also {{Cite book |author=Robert Owen |title=Manifesto of Robert Owen: The discoverer, Founder, and Promulgator, of the Rational System of Society, and of the Rational Religion |year=1840 |page=14}}</ref> The audience for his ideas included three former [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] – [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[James Madison]]) – as well as the outgoing US President [[James Monroe]], and the President-elect, [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Rowland Hill Harvey |title=Robert Owen: Social Idealist |publisher=University of California Press |year=1947 |pages=99–100}}</ref> His meetings were perhaps the first discussions of socialism in the Americas; they were certainly a big step towards discussion of it in the United States. [[Owenism]], among the first socialist ideologies active in the United States, can be seen as an instigator of the later socialist movement.<ref name=WeekesThesis/><ref name=AdventuresSocialism/>

Owen convinced [[William Maclure]], a wealthy Scottish scientist and philanthropist living in Philadelphia to join him at New Harmony and become his financial partner. Maclure's involvement went on to attract scientists, educators and artists such as [[Thomas Say]], [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], and Madame [[Marie Duclos Fretageot]]. These helped to turn the New Harmony community into a centre for educational reform, scientific research and artistic expression.<ref name=GS269-70/><ref name=Traces2-25>{{Cite journal |first=Amanda S. |last=Bryden |first2=Connie A. |last2=Weinzapfel |title =Editors' Page: 'That Wonder of the West' |journal=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=2 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis |date=Spring 2014}} See also: {{Cite journal| author=Heather Baldus |title =A Broad Stroke: New Harmony's Artistic Legacy |journal=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=25 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis |date=Spring 2014}}</ref>

Although Owen sought to build a "Village of Unity and Mutual Cooperation" south of town, his grand plan was never fully realised, and Owen returned to Britain to continue his work. During his long absences from New Harmony, Owen left the experiment under the day-to-day management of his sons, Robert Dale Owen and William Owen, and his business partner, Maclure. However, New Harmony proved to be an economic failure, lasting about two years, although it had attracted over a thousand residents by the end of its first year. The socialistic society was dissolved in 1827, but many of its scientists, educators, artists and other inhabitants, including Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale Owen, and his daughter Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy, remained at New Harmony after the experiment ended.<ref name=Timeline/><ref name=GS269-70/><ref name=Traces2-25/>

Other experiments in the United States included communal settlements at Blue Spring, near [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Indiana, at [[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]], Ohio, and at [[Forestville Commonwealth]] at [[Coxsackie (town), New York|Earlton]], New York, as well as other projects in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Tennessee]]. Nearly all of these had ended before New Harmony was dissolved in April 1827.<ref>Roger D. Branigin, "Robert Owen's New Harmony: An American Heritage," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 20.</ref><ref>Forestville Commonwealth was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974. See {{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>

Owen's Utopian communities attracted a mix of people, many with the highest aims. They included vagrants, adventurers and other reform-minded enthusiasts. In the words of Owen's son David Dale Owen, they attracted "a heterogeneous collection of Radicals", "enthusiastic devotees to principle," and "honest [[latitudinarians]], and lazy theorists," with "a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in."<ref name="clayton">{{Cite book |author=Joseph Clayton |title=Robert Owen: Pioneer of Social Reforms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuspAAAAYAAJ&q=%22a+heterogeneous+collection+of+radicals%22&pg=PA43 |year=1908 |publisher=A.C. Fifield| location=London}}</ref>

[[Josiah Warren]], a participant at New Harmony, asserted that it was doomed to failure for lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and personal property. In describing the community, Warren explained: "We had a world in miniature – we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result.... It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us... our 'united interests' were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation...."<ref>Warren, ''Periodical Letter II'' (1856)</ref> Warren's observations on the reasons for the community's failure led to the development of [[American individualist anarchism]], of which he was its original theorist.<ref name="JosiahWarren">{{Cite web |first=Jeff |last=Riggenbach |title=Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist |date=23 February 2011 |url=https://mises.org/library/josiah-warren-first-american-anarchist |publisher=Mises Institute |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> Some historians have traced the demise of New Harmony to serial disagreements among its members.<ref name=Estabrook68>Estabrook, p. 68.</ref>

Social experiments also began in Scotland in 1825, when [[Abram Combe]], an Owenite, attempted a utopian experiment at [[Orbiston, Scotland|Orbiston]], near Glasgow, but this failed after about two years.<ref name="Garnett">{{Cite book |first=Ronald |last=Garnett |title=Co-operation and the Owenite Socialist Communities in Britain, 1825-45 |date=1972 |publisher=Manchester University Press}}</ref> In the 1830s, additional experiments in socialistic cooperatives were made in [[Ireland]] and Britain, the most important being at [[Ralahine]], established in 1831 in [[County Clare]], Ireland, and at [[East Tytherley|Tytherley]], begun in 1839 in [[Hampshire]], England. The former proved a remarkable success for three-and-a-half years until the proprietor, having ruined himself by gambling, had to sell his interest. Tytherley, known as Harmony Hall or [[Queenwood College]], was designed by the architect Joseph Hansom.<ref>Penelope Harris, "The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882), Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall, and Churches of the Catholic Revival", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, p. 75 {{ISBN|0-7734-3851-3}}</ref> This also failed. Another social experiment, [[Manea Colony]] in the [[Isle of Ely]], Cambridgeshire, launched in the late 1830s by William Hodson, likewise an Owenite, but it failed in a couple of years and Hodson emigrated to the United States. The Manea Colony site has been excavated by Cambridge Archaeology Unit (CAU) based at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/34742897 |title=Archaeology of 19th Century Utopia |website=www.academia.edu |access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref>

Although Owen made further brief visits to the United States, London became his permanent home and the centre of his work in 1828. After extended friction with William Allen and some other business partners, Owen relinquished all connections with New Lanark.<ref name=Timeline/><ref name=Estabrook68/> He is often quoted in a comment by Allen at the time, "All the world is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/1828?cat=technology#human_rights_social_justice |title=1828: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=13 July 2009}} See also {{Cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18866 |title=Who said this: "all strange but thee and Me" – Literature Network Forums |publisher=Online-literature.com |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref> Having invested most of his fortune in the failed New Harmony communal experiment, Owen was no longer a wealthy capitalist. However, he remained the head of a vigorous propaganda effort to promote industrial equality, free education for children and adequate living conditions in factory towns, while delivering lectures in Europe and publishing a weekly newspaper to gain support for his ideas.<ref name=Estabrook68/>

In 1832 Owen opened the [[National Equitable Labour Exchange]] system,<ref name=Timeline/><ref>Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 36.</ref> a [[time-based currency]] in which the exchange of goods was effected by means of labour notes; this system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen.

==Role in spiritualism==
[[File:Tomb of Robert Owen (1771-1858) - geograph.org.uk - 661997.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Robert Owen, [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], Powys]]
In 1817, Owen publicly claimed that all religions were false.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Richard William Leopold |title=Robert Dale Owen, A Biography |publisher=Harvard University Press |series=Harvard Historical Studies |volume=45 |year=1940 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=8 |oclc=774894}}</ref> In 1854, aged 83, Owen converted to [[spiritualism]] after a series of [[Séance|sittings]] with [[Maria B. Hayden]], an American medium credited with introducing spiritualism to England. He made a public profession of his new faith in his publication ''The Rational Quarterly Review'' and in a pamphlet titled ''The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women''.<ref name=Spence679/>

Owen claimed to have had medium contact with spirits of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others. He explained that the purpose of these was to change "the present, false, disunited and miserable state of human existence, for a true, united and happy state... to prepare the world for universal peace, and to infuse into all the spirit of charity, forbearance and love."<ref>{{Cite book |author=Frank Podmore |title=Robert Owen: A Biography |volume=II |pages=604–5}}</ref>

[[Spiritualists]] claimed after Owen's death that his spirit had dictated to the medium [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] in 1871 the "[[Emma Hardinge Britten|Seven Principles of Spiritualism]]", used by their National Union as "the basis of its religious philosophy".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.snui.org/index.php?act=viewDoc&docId=9 |title=History of Spiritualism |publisher=SNU international |access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>

==Later years==
As Owen grew older and more radical in his views, his influence began to decline.<ref name=Estabrook68>Estabrook, p. 68.</ref> Owen published his memoirs, ''The Life of Robert Owen'', in 1857, a year before his death.<ref name=Timeline/>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Crowd of people congregated by the grave of Robert Owen at the old parish church, Newtown (1293839).jpg|thumb|Crowds of locals gather to commemorate Robert Owen at his grave in Newtown, Montgomeryshire, in the 1890s]]
Although he had spent most of his life in England and Scotland, Owen returned to his native village of Newtown at the end of his life. He died there on 17 November 1858 and was buried there on 21 November. He died penniless apart from an annual income drawn from a trust established by his sons in 1844.<ref name=Timeline/><ref name=Rees/><ref>Leopold, ''Robert Dale Owen, A Biography'', p. 327.</ref>

Owen was a reformer, philanthropist, community builder, and spiritualist who spent his life seeking to improve the lives of others. An advocate of the working class, he improved working conditions for factory workers, which he demonstrated at New Lanark, Scotland, became a leader in trade unionism, promoted social equality through his experimental Utopian communities, and supported the passage of child labour laws and free education for children.<ref name=Estabrook68/> In these reforms he was ahead of his time. He envisioned a [[communal society]] that others could consider and apply as they wished.<ref>Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 41.</ref> In ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'' (1849), he went on to say that character is formed by a combination of Nature or God and the circumstances of the individual's experience.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Robert Owen |title=Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race, or, The Coming Change from Irrationality to Rationality |publisher=Effingham Wilson |year=1849 |location=London |pages=1 & 9 |oclc=11756751}}</ref> Citing beneficial results at New Lanark, Scotland, during 30 years of work there, Owen concluded that a person's "character is not made ''by'', but ''for'' the individual,"<ref>Owen, ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'', p. 29. See also: Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 38.</ref> and that nature and society are responsible for each person's character and conduct.<ref>Owen, ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'', p. 59.</ref>

Owen's agitation for social change, along with the work of the Owenites and of his own children, helped to bring lasting social reforms in women's and workers' rights, establish free public libraries and museums, child care and public, co-educational schools, and pre-Marxian communism, and develop the Co-operative and trade union movements. New Harmony, Indiana, and New Lanark, Scotland, two towns with which he is closely associated, remain as reminders of his efforts.<ref name=GS269-70/><ref>Branigin, "Robert Owen's New Harmony" in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', pp. 21–23.</ref>

Owen's legacy of public service continued with his four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale, and his daughter, Jane, who followed him to America to live at New Harmony, Indiana:
*[[Robert Dale Owen]] (1801–1877), an able exponent of his father's doctrines, managed the New Harmony community after his father returned to Britain in 1825. He wrote articles and co-edited with [[Frances Wright]] the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' in the late 1820s in Indiana and the ''Free Enquirer'' in the 1830s in [[New York City]]. Owen returned to New Harmony in 1833 and became active in Indiana politics. He was elected to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] (1836–1839 and 1851–1853) and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] (1843–1847), and was appointed chargé d'affaires in Naples in 1853–1858. While serving as a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]], he drafted and helped to secure passage of a bill founding the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1846. He was elected a delegate to the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitutional Convention 2|Indiana Constitutional Convention]] in 1850,<ref name=Rees/><ref name=Estabrook72-74>Estabrook, pp. 72–74.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Owen, Robert Dale (1801–1877) |work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |publisher=U.S. Congress |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=O000152 |access-date=12 September 2017}}</ref> and argued in support of widows and married women's property and divorce rights. He also favoured legislation for Indiana's tax-supported public school system.<ref name=Traces12/> Like his father, he believed in [[spiritualism]], authoring two books on the subject: ''Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World'' (1859) and ''The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next'' (1872).<ref name=Estabrook72/><ref>Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 100.</ref>
*William Owen (1802–1842) moved to the United States with his father in 1824. His business skill, notably his knowledge of cotton-goods manufacturing, allowed him to remain at New Harmony after his father returned to Scotland, and serve as adviser to the community. He organised New Harmony's Thespian Society in 1827, but died of unknown causes at the age of 40.<ref name=Traces11/><ref>Estabrook, p. 80.</ref><ref>Leopold, p. 21.</ref>
*Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy (1805–1861) arrived in the United States in 1833 and settled in New Harmony. She was a musician and educator who set up a school in her home. In 1835 she married Robert Henry Fauntleroy, a civil engineer from Virginia who lived at New Harmony.<ref>Estabrook, pp. 82–83.</ref><ref name=PL25>{{Cite book |first=Elinor |last=Pancoast |first2=Anne E. |last2=Lincoln |title=The Incorrigible Idealist: Robert Dale Owen in America |publisher=Principia Press |date =1940 |location=Bloomington, Indiana |page=25 |oclc=2000563}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Josephine Mirabella Elliott |title=The Owen Family Papers |journal=Indiana Magazine of History |volume =60 |issue =4 |page=343 |publisher=Indiana University |location=Bloomington |date=December 1964 |url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/9072/11858 |access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref>
*[[David Dale Owen]] (1807–1860) moved to the United States in 1827 and resided at New Harmony for several years. He trained as a geologist and natural scientist and earned a medical degree. He was appointed a United States geologist in 1839. His work included geological surveys in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], more specifically the states of [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]], as well as [[Minnesota Territory]]. His brother Richard succeeded him as state geologist of Indiana.<ref>Estabrook, pp. 88–89.</ref><ref name=Leopold50-51>Leopold, ''Robert Dale Owen, A Biography'', pp. 50–51.</ref>
*[[Richard Dale Owen]] (1810–1890) emigrated to the United States in 1827 and joined his siblings at New Harmony. He fought in the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1847, taught natural science at Western Military Institute in Tennessee in 1849–1859, and earned a medical degree in 1858. During the [[American Civil War]] he was a [[colonel]] in the [[Union army]] and served as a commandant of [[Camp Morton]], a prisoner-of-war camp for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. After the war, Owen served as Indiana's second state geologist. In addition, he was a professor at [[Indiana University]] and chaired its natural science department in 1864–1879. He helped plan [[Purdue University]] and was appointed its first president in 1872–1874, but resigned before its first classes began and resumed teaching at Indiana University. He spent his retirement years on research and writing.<ref name=Leopold50-51/><ref>Elliott, pp. 343–44.</ref><ref>Estabrook, pp. 94–95.</ref>
