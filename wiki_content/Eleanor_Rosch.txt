'''Eleanor Rosch''' (once known as '''Eleanor Rosch Heider''';<ref name=":0">"Natural Categories", Cognitive Psychology, Vol. 4, No. 3, (May 1973), p. 328.</ref> born 1938)<ref>[http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~mbsclass/hall_of_fame/rosch.html Eleanor Rosch - School of Information Science - Hall of Fame]</ref> is an American [[psychologist]]. She is a [[professor]] of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]],<ref>[https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/eleanor-rosch Eleanor Rosch, MIT Press website]</ref> specializing in [[cognitive psychology]] and primarily known for her work on [[categorization]], in particular her [[prototype (linguistics)|prototype]] theory, which has profoundly influenced the field of [[cognitive psychology]].

Throughout her work Rosch has conducted extensive research focusing on a range of topics, including semantic categorization, [[mental representation]] of [[concept]]s, and [[linguistics]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosch|first=Eleanor|title=Cognitive representations of Semantic Categories|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=September 1975|volume=104|issue=3|pages=192–233|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.104.3.192}}</ref> Her research interests include cognition, concepts, causality, thinking, memory, and cross-cultural, and Eastern and religious psychology. Her more recent work in the psychology of religion has sought to show the implications of [[Buddhism]] and contemplative aspects of Western religions for modern psychology.

==Early life and education==
Rosch was born in New York City, the daughter of an English teacher from England and a mother who was a Russian refugee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/02/www.dialogonleadership.org/Roschx1999.html|title=Dialog on Leadership: Professor Eleanor Rosch Interview|website=www.iwp.jku.at|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> She completed an undergraduate philosophy thesis at [[Reed College]] on [[Wittgenstein]], who she said "cured her of studying philosophy."{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

After school, she served as a social worker in Portland for several years, returning later to Harvard to study clinical psychology at the then-Department of Social Relations. Rosch delivered a paradigm-changing<ref>{{cite book |last=Levitin |first=Daniel |date=2006 |title=This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession |url={{Google books|_B3CEBJhhBQC|page=87|plainurl=yes}} |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |page=141 |isbn=9780525949695 |access-date=2015-08-13 }}</ref> doctoral thesis at [[Harvard]] about category formation, under the direction of Roger Brown. After a short stint at [[Brown University]] and [[Connecticut College]], Rosch joined the Department of Psychology at University of California, Berkeley in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heider |first1=Eleanor Rosch |title=Information Processing and the Modification of an 'Impulsive Conceptual Tempo' |journal=Child Development |date=October 1971 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=1276–81 |jstor=1127811 |doi=10.2307/1127811 |pmid=5157116 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heider |first1=Eleanor Rosch |last2=Olivier |first2=Donald C. |title=The structure of the color space in naming and memory for two languages |journal=Cognitive Psychology |date=April 1972 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=337–354 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90011-4 }}</ref>

==Research==
From field experiments Rosch conducted (alongside her then-husband [[Karl G. Heider|Karl Heider]]) in the 1970s with the [[Dani people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], she concluded that when categorizing an everyday object or experience, people rely less on abstract definitions of categories than on a comparison of the given object or experience with what they deem to be the object or experience best representing a category ("prototype").{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Although the Dani lack words for all the English colors (their language contained only two color terms dividing all colors into either the "light, bright" category or the "dark, cool" category), Rosch showed that they could still categorize objects by colors for which they had no words. She argued that basic objects have a psychological import that transcends cultural differences and shapes how such objects are mentally represented. She concluded that people in different cultures tend to categorize objects by using prototypes, although the prototypes of particular categories may vary.<ref name=":0" />

Rosch contributed to multiple scholarly works of taxonomic analysis of objects based on these prototype ("chair") and subordinate terms ("tall black leather chair"). She inferred that overuse of subordinate terms could be attributed to the attitude of snobbery and elitism.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Cognition and Categorization|last=Rosch|first=Eleanor|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=1978|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=1–25}}</ref>

Her work has been often referenced by that of computer vision and deep learning researcher [[Aude Oliva]], who has built upon Rosch's object classifications to teach computers to recognize basic scenes instantly interpreted by humans.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
