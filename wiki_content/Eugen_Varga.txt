'''Eugen Samuilovich "Jenő" Varga''' (born as '''Eugen Weisz''', November 6, 1879, [[Budapest]] &ndash; October 7, 1964, [[Moscow]]) was a Soviet economist of Hungarian origin.

==Biography==
===Early years===

He was born as Jenő Weiß (Hungarian orthography: Weisz) in a poor [[Jews|Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Löwy|author-link=Michael Löwy|title=Redemption and Utopia: Jewish Libertarian Thought in Central Europe : a Study in Elective Affinity|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/redemptionutopia0000lowy/page/174 174]|isbn=9780804717762|url=https://archive.org/details/redemptionutopia0000lowy|url-access=registration|quote=Redemption and Utopia: Jewish Libertarian Thought in Central Europe : a Study in Elective Affinity.}}</ref> as a child of Samuel Weisz - who was a teacher in the primary school of [[Nagytétény]] - and Julianna Singer. Eugen "Jenő" Varga studied philosophy and economic geography at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]]. In 1906, he started writing in socialist and academic journals, mainly on economic subjects, but also on other topics. Before [[World War I]] he gained some fame by discussing with [[Otto Bauer]] about the origins of inflation in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In this period he belonged to the Marxist Centrists, of whom [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] were the most prominent spokesmen.

===Hungarian revolution===

He participated as minister of finance in the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] of 1919. After the overthrow of the Soviet Republic he fled to Vienna.

===Soviet emigration===

In 1920 he went to the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Arthur Holitscher]].<ref name="DM2">{{cite book |last1=Holitscher |first1=Arthur |title=Drei Monate in Sowjet-Rußland von Arthur Holitscher|date=1921 |publisher=S. Fischer |location=Berlin |url=https://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/drei-monate-in-sowjet-russland-5950/2 |language=de}}</ref> Here he started working for the [[Comintern]], specializing in international economic problems and agrarian questions. In years 1922-1927 he was working at the department of trade in the Soviet embassy in [[Berlin]]. In the 1930s he became an economic adviser to [[Joseph Stalin]]. He survived the purges of the 1930s.

During [[World War II]] he advised the Soviet Government in matters of post-war reparations. He attended the Potsdam Conference of 1945 as an expert. Like most of his compatriots living and working in Moscow, he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], but he also remained active in the [[Hungarian Communist Party]].

He authored the economic reports the congresses of the Comintern discussed between 1921 and 1935. A large number of his writings were studies of the international [[economic conjuncture]], in which he made great effort to assess quantitative trends in output, investment and employment using official economic data from numerous countries. He also extensively studied [[Germany|German]] imperialism.

In 1946 he published ''The Economic Transformation of Capitalism at the End of the Second World War'', in which he argued that the capitalist system was more inherently stable than had been hitherto believed. This led to the closure of the Institute which he headed. (See: Paolo Spriano, ''Stalin and the European Communists''. London: Verso, 1985). Finally, in 1949 he would make his self-criticism. Though he remained a leading academic economist, his prestige had diminished. In the second edition of the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' he was qualified as a "bourgeois economist."

===Years after Stalin===

After Stalin's death in 1953, he reappeared on the scene, but the new men in power in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] believing in the virtues of peaceful co-existence were not interested in Varga's predictions of the outbreak of a "necessary" economic crisis in the United States. After his death, his selected works in three volumes were published in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Hungary]], and [[East Germany]].

Varga never returned to living in his native Hungary. Because he was very close to [[Mátyás Rákosi]], he was several times invited as an economic advisor to Hungary. In this period (1945-1950) he had specialized in economic planning, pricing and monetary reforms, i.e. reforms the Hungarian Communists now in power were carrying out. After the fall of Rákosi caused by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the take-over by the [[János Kádár|Kádár]] team, Varga's advisory work was not appreciated anymore.
