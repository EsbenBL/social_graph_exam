Martin was born in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]], on July 5, 1880.  Graduating with honors at the age of 24 from [[Illinois College]] in Jacksonville, he moved on to Chicago, attending [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] from 1904 until his ordination as a Congregational Minister in 1907.<ref name="auto3">Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf</ref>  Martin received a Litt.D.

In 1915, his successful life took a radical shift in course.  He divorced his wife of eight years and left the professional ministry.  He moved to New York and began writing for the [[New York Globe]].<ref name="auto7">Steven B.

== Commentary on the early 20th century ==
In ''The Behavior of Crowds'' (1920), his first nationally reviewed book, he posed what he saw as the dilemma of the modern age: a technological information revolution that made it possible, in the absence of an adequate educational system, to influence ignorant men and women with [[propaganda]] and half-truths.  Unscrupulous [[demagogues]], corrupt politicians, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertisers, and revolutionary [[ideologues]] found ready-made audiences when they appealed to the baser (a subconscious urge, behavior, or intuition directed by primeval, animalistic, self-serving, and/or ignoble motivations) instincts.<ref name="auto3"/>

Martin was a [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[individualistic]] [[Liberalism|liberal]], in the tradition of the [[Renaissance]] [[humanists]] and the authors of [[The Federalist Papers]]. He believed in restrained government and in the self-selection of intellectually promising students through appropriate programs of adult education.

His most famous and widely read work, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'', appeared in 1926, the same year he helped found the American Association for Adult Education.<ref name="auto3"/>  When his book, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'' was released in 1926, [[Frederick Paul Keppel]], the president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]] proclaimed it as “the most important contribution to the understanding of [[adult education]]… this far in the United States.”<ref>Day, M., J, & Seckinger, D. (1987, May 21–23). Everett Dean Martin: Spiritual leader of the adult education movement in the United States.  Paper presented at the Adult Education Research Conference Proceedings, Laramie, Wyoming.</ref>  In March 1928, [[John Dewey]] responded to a request from [[Marie Mattingly Meloney]], editor of the [[New York Herald-Tribune]] Sunday Magazine, and offered his recommendations on recently published texts on education.  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] wrote, “I think the best educational books of recent publication are…Martin, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.  This was not the first time [[John Dewey|Dewey]] recommended Everett Dean Martin’s book.  In 1927, the editors of the Journal of the [[National Education Association]] approached [[John Dewey|Dewey]] and asked, “What book have you recently found especially worthwhile?  Something that you have read easily, eagerly, and with profit, either in the field of education or out of it.”  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] identified two books; one of them was Martin's ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.<ref name="auto1"/>

== Appointments ==
From 1919 to 1922, Martin served as chairman of The [[National Board of Review]] of Motion Pictures.<ref name="auto8"/>

Martin was an instructor and lecturer at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] from 1921 to 1929, and served on the board of directors of [[The New School]] from 1925 to 1932.<ref name="auto2"/>  He taught classes in sociology, psychology, social behavior, and adult education.<ref name="auto2"/>  At [[The New School]], Martin taught alongside other prominent intellectuals of the day including, [[Alfred Adler]], [[Norman Angell]], [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], [[Charles Austin Beard]], [[Edwin Grant Conklin]], [[Herbert J. Davenport]], [[John Dewey]], [[Lawrence K. Frank]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], [[Joseph Jastrow]], [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Alfred Kreymborg]], [[Eduard C. Lindeman]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Frederick Macaulay]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], [[Gorham Munson]], [[Moissaye Joseph Olgin]], [[Harry Allen Overstreet]], [[James Harvey Robinson]], [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], and [[Leo Wolman]].<ref>The Survey, “The New School, A Laboratory of Social Sciences.” (Advertisement), Volume 46, August 16th, 1921.</ref><ref name="auto2"/>

Among the courses Martin taught at [[The New School]] between 1921 and 1929 were: Introduction to Social Psychology, Fundamental Problems in Adult Education, The Process of Adult Learning, Psychology and the Problems of Social Behavior, Some Applications of Social Psychology, Studies on Social Behavior, and Psychological Problems of Social Reconstruction.<ref name="auto2"/>  An example of Martin's lecture topics in from a 1925 course on [[social philosophy]] taught at [[The New School]] include: The [[Psychology]] of the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; The So-Called [[Collective consciousness|Group Mind]]; Has Man a Social or [[Herd behavior|”Herd”]] Instinct?; The [[Psychology]] of Mass Appeal; Leadership in the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; Reform Legislation; The Present Industrial Transition.<ref name="auto2"/>

Why is this seminal individual virtually ignored amidst the ranks of the founders of the [[adult education]] movement?  Apparently Martin's wholehearted commitment to liberal education has placed him in juxtaposition with the early proponents of practical education in the eyes of contemporary scholars.  Here is an individual virtually dismissed not only in the history of [[adult education]], but also in the contemporary exploration of [[adult education]].”<ref name="auto7"/>

Among those recruited to the programs of the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]]<ref name="auto4"/> of [[Cooper Union]] during Martin’s tenure as Director (1926-1934) had been [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Will Durant]], [[Clifton Fadiman]], and [[Hilda Worthington Smith]], all soon to surpass Martin in fame and influence.  Yet, in his heyday, Martin was regarded as one of the leading figures in [[adult education]] in the United States.<ref name="auto3"/>

Morse A. Cartwright, who was the Executive Director of the American Association for Adult Education from its founding in 1926 to its ultimate dissolution and transformation in 1949, considered Martin to be the "spiritual father" of the association in particular and of the entire movement in general.<ref name="auto5">Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324</ref> Cartwright went on to say in his eulogy for Martin, published in the Journal of Adult Education, that:

“. . . Thousands who had heard him lecture in all parts of the United States, more thousands who had read his numerous books and articles on philosophical and psychological subjects, and the large audience which for years listened to his notable Friday night addresses and discussions in the Great Hall of [[Cooper Union]] in New York, all attested to the challenging qualities of his mind and heart.”<ref name="auto5"/>

In 1934 Martin was asked to direct the Department of Social Philosophy at the [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City|New York]] through a $15,000 per year grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] through his long-time friend [[Frederick Paul Keppel]].  Martin remained in this position until 1936 when he accepted an opportunity to move to California and direct an experimental program in teaching at [[Claremont Colleges]].<ref name="auto7"/>

Martin was a professor of [[social psychology]] at [[Scripps College]] in [[Claremont, California]], from 1936 up until his death in 1941.

== Death ==
Martin died on May 10, 1941, of a heart attack in [[Claremont, California]] at the age of 60.<ref name="auto3"/>  Martin's third wife, Daphne Crane Drake, whom he married in 1931, survived him.<ref name="auto6"/>  Mrs. Everett Dean Martin (Daphne Crane Drake) was a former president of the Child Study Association of America (1934).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankstreet.edu/library/bank-street-archives/|title=Bank Street Archives}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/programs/child-welfarechild-labor/child-study-association-of-america-statement-of-purpose-1913/|title=Child Study Association of America – Statement of Purpose 1913|date=27 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6963jbx|title = Child Study Association of America - Social Networks and Archival Context}}</ref>
