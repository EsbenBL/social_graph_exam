'''Theda Skocpol''' (born May 4, 1947) is an American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[political science|political scientist]], who is currently the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at [[Harvard University]]. She is a highly influential figure in both sociology and political science.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weir|first=Margaret|date=2002|title=Theda Skocpol: "Probing the Institutional Roots of Politics"|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/theda-skocpol-probing-the-institutional-roots-of-politics/898933CECC3295469629CAA9FBF80369|journal=PS: Political Science & Politics|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=769–772|doi=10.1017/S1049096502001373|issn=1537-5935}}</ref> She is best known as an advocate of the [[historical institutionalism|historical-institutional]] and [[comparative sociology|comparative]] approaches, as well as her "state autonomy theory".  She has written widely for both popular and academic audiences. She has been President of the American Political Science Association and the Social Science History Association.<ref name="Skocpol"/>

In historical sociology, Skocpol's works and opinions have been associated with the structuralist school. As an example, she argues that social revolutions can best be explained given their relation with specific structures of agricultural societies and their respective states. Such an approach differs greatly from more "behaviorist" ones, which tend to emphasize the role of "revolutionary populations", "revolutionary psychology", and/or "revolutionary consciousness", as determinant factors of revolutionary processes.

Her 1979 book ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' was highly influential in research on revolutions, ushering in a new paradigm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Beck |first=Colin J. |date=2018 |title=The Structure of Comparison in the Study of Revolution |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0735275118777004 |journal=Sociological Theory |language=en-US |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=134–161 |doi=10.1177/0735275118777004 |s2cid=53669466 |issn=0735-2751}}</ref>

==Biography==
Theda Skocpol was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]] on May 4, 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bisesi |first1=Michael |title=Skocpol, Theda |journal=International Encyclopedia of Civil Society |date=2010 |pages=1373 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-93996-4_669 |isbn=978-0-387-93994-0 }}</ref> Both of her parents, Jennie Mae Becker Barron and Allan Barron, were teachers. Her mother wanted her to study [[home economics]] at a small [[liberal arts college]], while her father was concerned about the cost of college education.<ref name="Skocpol"/> She earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in sociology at [[Michigan State University]] in 1969. While she attended Michigan State, she participated in the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|antiwar movement in response to the Vietnam War]]. Through the Methodist student association, she went to [[Rust College]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Holly Springs, Mississippi]], to teach English and math to incoming freshman. Many of the students were from [[sharecropper]] families, and were [[First-generation college students in the United States|first-generation college students]]. She called her time in Mississippi observing racism and segregation "life-changing".<ref name="Skocpol"/> She then went on to earn both her M.A. (1972) and [[Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]] (1975). While attending Harvard, Skocpol studied with [[Barrington Moore Jr.]] Her first published article, in 1973, was a critique of Moore's ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Munck|first=Gerardo L.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Passion_Craft_and_Method_in_Comparative.html?id=itGOAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description|title=Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics|last2=Snyder|first2=Richard|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8464-1|pages=15|language=en}}</ref>

From 1975 to 1981, Skocpol served as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Sociology, at Harvard. During this time, Skocpol published her first of many books, ''[[States and Social Revolutions|States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in Russia, France and China]]'' (1979). Some of her subsequent work focused on methodology and theory, including the co-edited volume ''Bringing the State Back In'', which heralded a new focus by social scientists on the [[State (polity)|state]] as an agent of social and political change.

In 1981, Skocpol moved on to work at the [[University of Chicago]]. For the next five years, Skocpol would serve as an Associate Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and of Social Science, Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and Director for the Center for the Study of Industrial Societies.<ref name="Skocpol bio">{{cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/thedaskocpol/files/skocpol_cv_2009.pdf|title=Theda Skocpol|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=2016-07-10|ref=7}}</ref>

In the early 1980s, Skocpol publicly alleged that Harvard University had denied her tenure (1980) because she was a woman. This charge was found to be justified by an internal review committee in 1981.<ref name="New York Times - Harvard Controversy">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/magazine/a-question-of-sex-bias-at-harvard.html |title=A QUESTION OF SEX BIAS AT HARVARD |date=October 18, 1981|website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=17 July 2014}}</ref> In 1984, [[Harvard University]] offered Skocpol a tenured position (its first ever for a female sociologist), which she accepted.

From 1986 to the present, Skocpol has held various positions at [[Harvard University]] including: Professor of Sociology; Director for the Center for American Political Studies; Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; and presently{{when|date=November 2020}} is the Professor of Government and of Sociology, Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology.

== Honors and titles ==
Throughout her career, Skocpol has held many positions at various academic, and professional organizations, some of which include: President of Politics and History Section, Chairperson, and later Council member of the [[American Political Science Association]] (1991–1996).  Out of over one hundred past presidents, since 1903, only about ten women have held that office. Skocpol is also Founder and Co-Editor, Princeton Studies in American Politics: Historical, Comparative, and International Perspectives (1993 – present); and Senior Advisor in the Social Sciences, [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] (2006–2008).

According to her Curriculum Vitae Skocpol has been distinguished by over twenty awards and honors, some of which are: C. Wright Mills Award of [[The Society for the Study of Social Problems]] in 1979; elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2006; and she was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2008. Her book ''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers'' (1992) was awarded the 1993 Woodrow Wilson Award for best book in political science by the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Theda Skocpol|url=https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/theda-skocpol|access-date=2017-04-15|publisher=sociology.fas.harvard.edu|language=en}}</ref> She is also an elected member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref name="Skocpol">{{Cite journal|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|last2=Schickler|first2=Eric|date=2019-05-11|title=A Conversation with Theda Skocpol|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-030816-105449|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-030816-105449|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 2007, she was awarded the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]], one of the world's most prestigious prizes in political science for her "visionary analysis of the significance of the state for revolutions, welfare, and political trust, pursued with theoretical depth and empirical evidence."<ref>{{cite web|title=Theda Skocpol|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/thedaskocpol/home|website=Theda Skocpol|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=June 26, 2016|ref=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_14913020.asp|title=SvD: Skocpol går till botten med staten|date=2007-09-29|website=Svenska Dagbladet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102703/http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_14913020.asp|archive-date=2007-09-29|url-status=bot: unknown|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>

In 2015, she was named an [[Andrew Dickson White]] Professor-at-Large at [[Cornell University]] (term: 2015–2021).

In Oktober 2019 Skocpol was awarded with an honorary doctorate from [[Radboud University]] Nijmegen.

== Major works and contributions ==
===''States and Social Revolutions (1979)''===
{{main|States and Social Revolutions}}

Skocpol’s most famous book, ''States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in [[Russian Revolution|Russia]], [[French Revolution|France]] and [[Xinhai Revolution|China]]'' (1979), discusses how most theories account only for direct action in bringing about revolutions. Social Revolutions are fast-paced foundational transformations of society's state and class structures. She includes the structure involved in creating a [[revolutionary situation]] that can lead to a social revolution - one that changes civic institutions and government once the administration and military branches collapse.

In her text, Skocpol "offers a framework of reference for analyzing social-revolutionary transformations in modern world history" and discusses and compares the causes of The "[[Timeline of the French Revolution|French Revolution]]" of 1787–1800, [[The Russian Revolution]] of 1917–1921, and [[Xinhai Revolution|The Chinese Revolution]] of 1911–1949.

According to Skocpol, there are two stages to social revolutions: a crisis of state and the emergence of a dominant class to take advantage of a revolutionary situation. The crisis of state emerges from poor economy, natural disaster, food shortage, or security concerns. Leaders of the revolution also have to face these constraints, and their handling of them affects how well they re-establish the state.

Skocpol uses Marxism’s class struggle to assert that the main causes of social unrest are state social structures, international competitive pressures, international demonstrations, and class relations. Critics suggest that Skocpol ignores the role of individuals and ideology<ref>{{cite web|last=Wikisum|title=States and Social Revolutions|url=http://wikisum.com/w/Skocpol:_States_and_social_revolutions}}</ref>  and uses varied comparative methodological strategies.

===State Autonomy Theory===
Before she wrote'' Protecting Soldiers and Mothers'', Skocpol first devised what she termed State Autonomy Theory.  This theory underlined the idea that state bureaucracies could have the potential for autonomous operations, and that this potential was ignored by scientists who were focused on society-centric studies. Skocpol considers the idea that parties are more important in America than the government, and that class dominance plays heavily into American politics.<ref>Skocpol, Theda, Peter Evans, and Dietrich Rueschemeyer. "Bringing the state back in." Cambridge (1999).</ref>

===''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers (1992)''===
In this book, Skocpol shows, contrary to the conventional wisdom, that the United States was a precocious [[welfare state]] in the early 20th century and that it did not lag behind European states at that point in time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Munck|first=Gerardo L.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Passion_Craft_and_Method_in_Comparative.html?id=itGOAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description|title=Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics|last2=Snyder|first2=Richard|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8464-1|pages=23|language=en}}</ref>

In the book, Skocpol considers increased benefits for Civil War veterans and their families resulting from competitive party politics, as well as greater actions taken in women's movements. Soldiers and mothers benefited from social spending, labor regulations, and health education through reformative women's clubs across the nation. Simultaneously, Skocpol refutes her claim that theorists had ignored states' independent power in her state autonomy theory, explaining "my state-centered theoretical frame of reference had evolved into a fully 'polity-centered approach,' meaning that social movements, coalitions of pressure groups, and political parties must be given their due in understanding power in America."

Skocpol explains how clubs and associations fill the vacuum left by fewer bureaucracies and an official church throughout the country, offering a case study in how women succeeded in gaining labor rights, pensions, minimum wage, and subsidized natal health clinics. Further, Skocpol points out that women were able to overcome class disparity to achieve these goals, working at a national level, influencing representatives with books, TV, magazines, and meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/theory/skocpol.html|title=The Death of State Autonomy Theory: A Critique of Skocpol's Protecting Soldiers And Mothers|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|date=September 2005|website=Who Rules America}}</ref>

===''Diminished Democracy (2003)''===
''Diminished Democracy'' discusses the changes in US public involvement and its recent concerning decline. Skocpol talks about how to reverse it in explaining how the U.S. became a civic nation, the organizers of that movement, management of civic organizations, changes in them, the harmful effects of that change, and how to recreate a sense of citizenship.

Since fewer and fewer Americans join voluntary groups that meet frequently, there has been a proliferation of nonprofit groups led by elites who can interact with the government, but not the people. Skocpol provokes the reader with the idea that civic involvement will one day become another job rather than a civilian responsibility.

=== Scholars Strategy Network ===
In 2009, Skocpol conceived of and co-founded the [[Scholars Strategy Network]], an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of [[academia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/02/environmentalist-failure-to-pass-cap-and-trade#.UR_sYt3N2oc.email|title=The Politics of Climate Change Legislation|date=2013-02-15|work=Harvard Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://harvardmagazine.com/2014/09/citizen-scholars|title=Citizen Scholars|date=2014-08-15|work=Harvard Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> As of 2018, she serves as the network's Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholars.org/scholar/theda-skocpol|title=skocpol.theda {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=scholars.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
In 1967, while studying at [[Michigan State University]], she married [[William Skocpol|Bill Skocpol]]. They were both students at Michigan State, with Bill a physics major from Texas. They had met through a Methodist organization for students.<ref name="Skocpol"/> Her last name is sometimes quoted as ''Skočpol''. She has one son, Michael Skocpol, an attorney and former [[law clerk]] for [[Sonia Sotomayor]].

She is also an avid [[American football]] fan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/01/talking-patriots-with-harvard-political-scientist-and-superfan-theda-skocpol/|title = Talking Patriots with Harvard political scientist and superfan Theda Skocpol|date = 17 January 2019}}</ref>
