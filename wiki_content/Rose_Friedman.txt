==Biography==
Rose Friedman attended [[Reed College]] and then transferred to the [[University of Chicago]], where she received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. After this she began to study for a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago and completed all work necessary for the Ph.D. except for writing the dissertation. In her youth, she wrote articles with [[Dorothy Brady]] on consumption. She received an honorary LL.D. in December 1986 from [[Pepperdine University]]. She is believed to have been born the last week of December, 1910; however, the birth records have been lost. She was born in [[Staryi Chortoryisk]], in [[Ukraine]], to the Director family, prominent Jewish residents.

She was married to her frequent collaborator, [[Milton Friedman]] (1912–2006), who won the 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. Her brother, [[Aaron Director]] (1901–2004), was a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and one of the founders of the [[Law and economics|economic analysis of law]].

With Milton, she co-wrote two books on economics and public policy, ''[[Free to Choose]]'' and ''Tyranny of the Status Quo'', and their memoirs ''Milton and Rose D. Friedman, Two Lucky People'', which appeared in 1998. Together they founded [[EdChoice]] (formerly the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation), with the aim of promoting the use of [[school vouchers]] and freedom of choice in education. She also co-produced the PBS television series, ''[[Free to Choose]]'', and assisted her husband in writing his 1962 political philosophy book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''.

When Milton received his Medal of Freedom in 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] said jokingly in his speech that Rose was known for being the only person to ever have won an argument against Milton. The Friedmans had two children, Janet and [[David D. Friedman|David]].
