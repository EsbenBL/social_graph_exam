<!--Paragraph #1: Topic: Background, planning, context-->
In 1802, while serving as President of the United States, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to artist [[Charles Willson Peale]] that his concept of the new university would be "on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet," and it might even attract talented students from "other states to come, and drink of the cup of knowledge".<ref name="Peale">Alf J. Mapp, Jr., ''Thomas Jefferson: Passionate Pilgrim'', p. 19.</ref> Virginia was already home to the [[College of William and Mary]], but Jefferson lost all confidence in his ''alma mater,'' partly because of its religious nature – it required all its students to recite a [[catechism]] – and its stifling of the sciences.<ref name="yalereview1878">''New Englander and Yale Review'', Volume 37, W. L. Kingsley, "Ought the State provide for Higher Education?", 1878, page 378.</ref><ref name="russell">Phillips Russell, ''Jefferson, Champion of the Free Mind'', p. 335.</ref> Jefferson had flourished under College of William and Mary professors [[William Small]] and [[George Wythe]] decades earlier, but the college was in a period of great decline and his concern became so dire by 1800 that he expressed to British chemist [[Joseph Priestley]], "we have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it."<ref name="yalereview1878" /><ref name="1888circular">''Circular of Information'', State Board of Education, United States Bureau of Education.

<!--Paragraph #2: Formal founding and construction-->
In 1817, three presidents (Jefferson, [[James Monroe]], and [[James Madison]]) and [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court]] [[John Marshall]] joined 24 other dignitaries at a meeting held in the Mountain Top Tavern at [[Rockfish Gap]]. After some deliberation, they selected nearby Charlottesville as the site of the new University of Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.snp.guide/p/turk-mountain-overlook-to-rockfish-gap.html |title="Guide to SNP" – Turk Mountain Overlook to Rockfish Gap |website=snp.guide |access-date=June 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603010939/http://www.guidetosnp.com/web/LogoftheDrive/logs6.aspx |archive-date=June 3, 2010 }}</ref> Farmland just outside [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] was purchased from [[James Monroe]] by the Board of Visitors for construction of a newly chartered regional school to be known as ''Central College,'' which itself was an institutional successor to Albemarle Academy though neither school would ever open for instruction. The school laid its first building's cornerstone late in that same year, and the ongoing building of the Academical Village proved influential as the Commonwealth of Virginia chartered a new flagship university to be based on the site in Charlottesville on January 25, 1819. [[John Hartwell Cocke]] collaborated with [[James Madison]], Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson's dream to establish the university. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius |author-link=Virginius Dabney |url=http://repo.lib.virginia.edu:18080/fedora/get/uva-lib:179274/uva-lib-bdef:100/getFullView |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715002828/http://repo.lib.virginia.edu:18080/fedora/get/uva-lib:179274/uva-lib-bdef:100/getFullView |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=[[Charlottesville]] |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=0-8139-0904-X |page=3 }}</ref> The university was built on [[Monacan Indian Nation]] tribal land.

In contrast to other universities of the day, at which one could study in either medicine, law, or divinity, the first students at the University of Virginia could study in one or several of eight independent schools – medicine, law, mathematics, chemistry, ancient languages, modern languages, natural philosophy, and moral philosophy.<ref>''Popular Science'', July 1905, "The Progress of Science"</ref> Another innovation of the new university was that higher education would be separated from religious doctrine. UVA had no divinity school, was established independently of any religious sect, and [[#The Grounds|the Grounds]] were planned and centered upon a library, [[Rotunda (University of Virginia)|the Rotunda]], rather than a church, distinguishing it from peer universities still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular strain of Protestantism or another.<ref name="sem">[[Joseph J. Ellis]], ''American Sphinx'', p. 283.</ref> Jefferson opined to philosopher [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]] that "a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution", and never has there been one. There were initially two degrees awarded by the university: ''Graduate,'' to a student who had completed the courses of one school; and ''Doctor'' to a graduate in more than one school who had shown research prowess.<ref name="1911EB">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Virginia, University of |volume=28 |pages=125–126}}</ref>

[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[James Madison]] was the 2nd rector of the University of Virginia until 1836.]]

Jefferson was intimately involved in the university to the end, hosting Sunday dinners at his [[Monticello]] home for faculty and students until his death. Jefferson viewed the university's foundation as having such great importance and potential that he counted it among his greatest accomplishments and insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his national accomplishments, such as the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and any other aspects of his presidency, in favor of his role with the young university.

Initially, some of the students arriving at the university matched the then-common picture of college students: wealthy, spoiled aristocrats with a sense of privilege which often led to brawling, or worse. This was a source of frustration for Jefferson, who assembled the students during the school's first year, on October 3, 1825, to criticize such behavior; but was too overcome to speak. He later spoke of this moment as "the most painful event" of his life.<ref name="bb">"[http://uvamagazine.org/articles/bad_boys Bad Boys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229101436/http://uvamagazine.org/articles/bad_boys |date=December 29, 2016 }}", ''Virginia'', Carlos Santos</ref>

Although the frequency of such irresponsible behavior dropped after Jefferson's expression of concern, it did not die away completely. Like many universities and colleges, it experienced periodic [[student riots]], culminating in the shooting death of Professor [[John A. G. Davis]], Chairman of the Faculty, in 1840. This event, in conjunction with the growing popularity of temperance and a rise in religious affiliation in society in general, seems to have resulted in a permanent change in student attitudes, and the behavior among students that had so greatly bothered Jefferson finally vanished.<ref name="bb"/>

In the year of Jefferson's death, poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]] enrolled at the university, where he excelled in Latin.<ref>"[https://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/rotunda/prefire/early/poe Edgar Allan Poe at the University]," ''University of Virginia Library.''  2018.

Accessed May 19, 2018.</ref> He left because of financial difficulties. The [[University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] opened in 1836, making UVA the first comprehensive university to open an engineering school.

Unlike the majority of Southern colleges, the university was kept open throughout the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], despite its state seeing more bloodshed than any other and the near 100% [[conscription]] of the [[American South]].<ref name="CivilWarTrust">[http://www.civilwar.org/education/civil-war-casualties.html Civil War Casualties by the Civil War Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113041950/http://www.civilwar.org/education/civil-war-casualties.html |date=January 13, 2013 }}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref> After [[Jubal Early]]'s total loss at the [[Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia|Battle of Waynesboro]], Charlottesville was willingly surrendered to Union forces to avoid mass bloodshed, and UVA faculty convinced [[George Armstrong Custer]] to preserve Jefferson's university.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Charlottesville_During_the_Civil_War Charlottesville During the Civil War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906043011/http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Charlottesville_During_the_Civil_War |date=September 6, 2014 }}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref> Although [[Union Army|Union troops]] camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational mission.

{{AmCyc Poster|Virginia, University of|UVA's 16 schools in operation as of 1879}}

Thanks to a grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia, tuition became free for all Virginians in 1875.<ref name="AmCyc">See wikisource link to the right</ref> During this period the University of Virginia remained unique in that it had no president and mandated no [[core curriculum]] from its students, who often studied in and took degrees from more than one school.<ref name="AmCyc" /> However, the university was also experiencing growing pains. As the original [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|Rotunda]] caught fire and [[#Jefferson's Lawn, Rotunda, and Range|was gutted]] in 1895, there would soon be sweeping changes, much greater than merely reconstructing the Rotunda in 1899.

===1900s===
<!--topic:President-->
[[File:Alderman 1920.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|[[Edwin Alderman]] was UVA's first president between 1904 and 1931, and instituted many reforms toward modernization.]]
{{Wikisource|1=Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_67/July_1905/The_Progress_of_Science|2=July 1905 ''Popular Science'' article about UVA taking a President}}

Jefferson had originally decided the University of Virginia would have no president. Rather, this power was to be shared by a rector and a [[Board of Visitors]]. But as the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks of the growing university.<ref name="EVAlderman">Encyclopedia Virginia [http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Alderman_Edwin_Anderson_1861-1931 President Edwin Alderman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228003042/http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Alderman_Edwin_Anderson_1861-1931 |date=December 28, 2011 }} "By the turn of the 20th century the administrative affairs had grown to such an extent that the old form of government became too cumbersome. The appointment of Alderman brought a new era of progressivism to the university and service to Virginia." Retrieved January 25, 2012</ref> [[Edwin Alderman]], who had only recently moved from his post as president of [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]] since 1896 to become president of [[Tulane University]] in 1900, accepted an offer as president of the University of Virginia in 1904. His appointment was not without controversy, and national media such as ''[[Popular Science]]'' lamented the end of one of the things that made UVA unique among universities.<ref>''Popular Science'', July 1905 Volume 67, "The Progress of Science"</ref>

Alderman stayed 27 years, and became known as a prolific fund-raiser, a well-known orator, and a close adviser to U.S. president and UVA alumnus [[Woodrow Wilson]].<ref name="EVAlderman" /> He added significantly to the University Hospital to support new sickbeds and public health research, and helped create departments of geology and forestry, the [[Curry School of Education]], the [[McIntire School of Commerce]], and the summer school programs in which young [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] soon took part.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Philip Alexander |author-link=Philip Alexander Bruce |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i68VAAAAIAAJ&q=edwin+alderman+philip+bruce&pg=PA45 |title=The History of the University of Virginia: The Lengthening Shadow of One Man |year=1921 |volume=V |location=New York |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing|Macmillan]]}}</ref> Perhaps his greatest ambition was the funding and construction of a library on a scale of millions of books, much larger than the Rotunda could bear. Delayed by the [[Great Depression]], Alderman Library was named in his honor in 1938. Alderman, who seven years earlier had died in office en route to giving a public speech at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], is still the longest-tenured president of the university.

In 1904, UVA became the first university south of Washington, D.C. to be elected to the [[Association of American Universities]]. After a gift by [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1909 the University of Virginia was organized into twenty-six departments across six schools including the [[University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering]], the [[University of Virginia School of Law|James Madison School of Law]], the [[James Monroe]] School of International Law, the [[James Southall Wilson|James Wilson]] School of Political Economy, the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] School of English and the [[University of Virginia Medical School|Walter Reed School of Pathology]].<ref name="1911EB" /> The honorific historical names for these schools – several of which have remained as modern [[#Organization and administration|schools of the university]] – are no longer used.

In December 1953, the University of Virginia joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] for athletics. At the time, UVA had a football program that had just broken through to be nationally ranked in 1950, 1951, and 1952, and consistently beat its rivals North Carolina and Virginia Tech by such scores as 34–7 and 44–0. Other sports were very competitive as well. However, the administration of [[Colgate Darden]] de-emphasized athletics, defunding the department and declining to join the ACC before being overruled by the Board of Visitors on that decision. It would take until the 1980s for the bulk of athletics programs to fully recover, but approaching the year 2000 UVA was again one of the [[#Athletics|most successful all-around sports programs]] with NCAA national titles achieved in an array of different sports; by 2020, it had twice won the [[Capital One Cup (college sports)|Capital One Cup]] for overall athletics excellence in men's sports.

UVA established a [[junior college]] in 1954, known today as the [[University of Virginia's College at Wise]]. [[George Mason University]] and the aforementioned Mary Washington University used to exist as similar [[satellite campus]]es, but those are now wholly self-administered.

The [[#Academical Village|Academical Village]] and nearby [[Monticello]] became a joint [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987. Simultaneously with [[Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park]] and [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], they were the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth U.S. sites designated as culturally significant to the collective interests of global humanity, coming after the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Yosemite National Park]] three years earlier. As such, UVA possesses the only U.S. collegiate grounds to be internationally protected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).

==== Integration, coeducation, and student dissent ====

===Academical Village===
{{see also|The Lawn|The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|l2=The Rotunda|The Range (University of Virginia)|l3=The Range}}

Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique [[Jeffersonian architecture]]. In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the design of the University of Virginia "was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century."<ref name="schuyler">''Architectural Record," 4 (January–March 1895), pp. 351–353</ref> In the [[United States Bicentennial]] issue of their ''AIA Journal'', the [[American Institute of Architects]] called it "the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years."<ref name="aia">''AIA Journal'', 65 (July 1976), p. 91</ref>  The Academical Village, together with Jefferson's home at [[Monticello]], which he also designed, is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The first collegiate architecture and culture World Heritage Site in the world, it was listed by UNESCO in 1987.<ref name ="WHS" /><ref>{{cite web |url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat#s4 |title = World Heritage List Statistics |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date = March 3, 2020}}</ref>

Jefferson's original architectural design revolves around the ''Academical Village'', and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of the Lawn, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, the Range, and the larger university surrounding it. The principal building of the design, the Rotunda, stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the university. It is half the height and width of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the models for many similar designs of "centralized green areas" at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area. The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson's ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.

Most notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by similar buildings built at: [[Duke University]] in 1892; [[Columbia University]] in 1895; [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1902; [[Rice University]] in 1910; Peabody College of [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1915; [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Killian Court (1916)|Killian Court]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1916; the Grand Auditorium of [[Tsinghua University]] built in 1917 in Beijing, China; the Sterling Quad of [[Yale Divinity School]] in 1932; and the university's own [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration|Darden School]] in 1996.

[[File:Lawn_UVa_south_toward_Old_Cabell_Hall_2010.jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|Winter view toward the South Lawn]]

Flanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called "serpentine" because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard|title=Grizzard, Frank E.''Documentary history of the construction of the buildings at the University of Virginia, 1817–1828''.

On October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms. The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the help of overzealous faculty member [[William Holding Echols|William "Reddy" Echols]], who attempted to save it by throwing roughly {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of [[dynamite]] into the main fire in the hopes the blast would separate the burning Annex from Jefferson's own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. Perhaps ironically, one of the university's main honors student programs is named for him. University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect [[Stanford White]] to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Jefferson's design and redesigning the Rotunda interior—making it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a president's house. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda's northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were moved to the South Lawn in White's new buildings.{{Citation needed |reason= sources definitely exist for this, but they are not listed here | date= August 2019 }}

The White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge "quadrangle", albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the [[University of Cambridge]] or [[University of Oxford]].

In concert with the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Stanford White's changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson's original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson's birthday, April 13, 1976. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] came to visit the Rotunda in that same year for the Bicentennial, and had a well-publicized stroll of The Lawn.  The university was listed by ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'' in September 2011 as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States and by [[MSN]] as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/18|title="America's most beautiful college campuses" ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)|work=Travel + Leisure|access-date=November 26, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206054616/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/18|archive-date=December 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.ie.msn.com/student-special/most-beautiful-universities-666#image=4|title=Most beautiful universities|publisher=[[MSN]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120104454/http://lifestyle.ie.msn.com/student-special/most-beautiful-universities-666#image=4|archive-date=January 20, 2013|access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

===Libraries===
[[File:University of Virginia School of Law, Library.jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|Inside the Law Library]]

The first library at University of Virginia was the Rotunda. Rather than a chapel or other religious structure, the university was built around its library. Thomas Jefferson was deeply engaged in selecting the materials that made up that library's original collection, and in developing the system by which it would be organized. The Rotunda served as the University Library for over a century, until Alderman Library was opened in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.library.virginia.edu/renovation/history-of-the-project/|title=History}}</ref>

Today the University of Virginia Library System consists of a dozen libraries and holds over 5&nbsp;million volumes. Its Electronic Text Center, established in 1992, has put 70,000 books online as well as 350,000 images that go with them. These e-texts are open to anyone and, {{As of|2002|lc=on}}, were receiving 37,000 daily visits (compared to 6,000 daily visitors to the physical libraries).<ref>{{cite web|title=Electronic Center at UVa Library |publisher=Digital Scholarship Services |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/ |access-date=December 20, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220160141/https://etext.lib.virginia.edu/ |archive-date=December 20, 2006 }}</ref> Alderman Library holds the most extensive Tibetan collection in the world, and holds ten floors of book "stacks" of varying ages and historical value. The [[Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library]] features a collection of American literature as well as two copies of the [[Dunlap broadside|original printing]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English graduate student, discovered an unpublished [[Robert Frost]] poem from 1918.<ref name="Frost-Poem">{{cite news | url = http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2006/sep/29/grad-student-discovers-unpublished-frost-poem/ | last = Lim | first = Melinda | date = September 29, 2006 | title = Grad student discovers unpublished Frost poem | access-date = December 11, 2006 | work = [[Cavalier Daily]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115951/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2006/sep/29/grad-student-discovers-unpublished-frost-poem/ | archive-date = January 14, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Clark Hall is the library for SEAS (the engineering school), and one of its notable features is the Mural Room, decorated by two three-panel murals by Allyn Cox, depicting the Moral Law and the Civil Law.

Since 1992, the University of Virginia also hosts the [[Rare Book School]], a non-profit organization in the study of historical books and the history of printing that began at [[Columbia University]] in 1983.

===Other areas===

Away from the historic area, UVA's architecture and its allegiance to the Jeffersonian design are controversial. The 1990s saw the construction of two deeply contrasting visions: the [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects|Williams Tsien]] post-modernist [[Hereford College]] in 1992 and the unapologetically Jeffersonian [[Darden School of Business]] in 1996. Commentary on both was broad and partisan, as the [[University of Virginia School of Architecture]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded Hereford for its bold new lines, while some independent press and wealthy donors praised the traditional design of Darden.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/arts/architecture-view-jefferson-s-legacy-dialogues-with-the-past.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 Jefferson's Legacy: Dialogues with the Past] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232736/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/arts/architecture-view-jefferson-s-legacy-dialogues-with-the-past.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |date=March 3, 2016 }}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref><ref name="JeffQuest">[http://www.c-ville.com/Jeffersonian_quest Jeffersonian Quest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722195916/http://www.c-ville.com/Jeffersonian_quest/ |date=July 22, 2015 }}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref> The latter group appeared to have the upper hand when the [[The Lawn#The South Lawn Project|South Lawn Project]] was designed in the early 2000s.<ref name="JeffQuest" /><ref>[http://www.readthehook.com/86465/cover-going-south-wheres-lawn Going South: But where's the Lawn?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001813/http://www.readthehook.com/86465/cover-going-south-wheres-lawn |date=September 11, 2014 }}, accessed September 9, 2014</ref>

Billionaire [[John Kluge]] donated {{convert|7379|acre|km2}} of additional lands to the university in 2001. Kluge desired the core of the land, the 2,913-acre [[Morven (Simeon, Virginia)|Morven]], to be developed by the university and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core. Five farms totaling {{convert|1261|acres|0|abbr=on}} of the gift were soon sold to musician [[Dave Matthews]], of the [[Dave Matthews Band]], to be used in an [[organic farming]] project to complement his nearby [[Blenheim Vineyards]].<ref>[http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/kluge-feb-25-2002.html UVa Foundation sells five Kluge farms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195453/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/kluge-feb-25-2002.html|date=September 10, 2014}}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref> Morven has since hosted the Morven Summer Institute, a rigorous immersion program of study in civil society, sustainability, and creativity.<ref name="MorvenCD">[http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/02/university-to-repair-morven-farm University to further develop Morven Farms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911011001/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/02/university-to-repair-morven-farm |date=September 11, 2014 }}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref> {{as of|2014}}, the university is developing further plans for Morven and has hired an architecture firm for the nearly three thousand acre property.<ref name="MorvenCD" /> In addition, the UVA Foundation owns the building and grounds of the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection.

===Student housing===

[[File:Pavilion VIII at the Lawn UVa 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|54 students are selected to live on The Lawn during their final year.]]

The primary housing areas for first-year students are [[McCormick Road Dormitories]], often called "Old Dorms", and [[Alderman Road Dormitories]], often called "New Dorms".  The 1970s-era Alderman Road Dorms are being fully replaced with brand new dormitory buildings in the same area. The replacements feature hall-style living arrangements with common areas and many modern amenities. Instead of being torn down and replaced like the original New Dorms, the Old Dorms will see a $105&nbsp;million renovation project between 2017 and 2022.<ref>[http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/09/mccormick-road-dorms-to-see-massive-renovation-project McCormick Road Dorms to See Massive Renovation Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908085419/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2014/09/mccormick-road-dorms-to-see-massive-renovation-project |date=September 8, 2014 }}, accessed September 8, 2014</ref> They were constructed in 1950, and are also hall-style constructions but with fewer amenities. The Old Dorms are closer to the students' classes.

In the 1980s, in response to a housing shortage, the Stadium Road Residential Area was built to the south of the Alderman Road Dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.arch.virginia.edu/housinghistory/grounds/goochdillard.htm|title=Gooch/Dillard Residence Area|website=web.arch.virginia.edu|access-date=November 7, 2019|archive-date=November 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107212212/http://web.arch.virginia.edu/housinghistory/grounds/goochdillard.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> The largest of the houses in this area are the [[Gooch Dillard Residence Halls]] which house 610 students.

There are three [[residential college]]s at the university: [[Brown College at Monroe Hill|Brown College]], [[Hereford College]], and the [[International Residential College]]. These involve an application process to live there, and are filled with both upperclass and first-year students. The application process can be extremely competitive, especially for Brown because of its location in central Grounds.

It is considered a great honor to be invited to live on The Lawn, and 54 fourth-year undergraduates do so each year, joining ten members of the faculty who permanently live and teach in the Pavilions there.<ref>[http://www.virginia.edu/housing/options.php?id=lawn&type=upperclass UVA Housing: Lawn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905235427/http://www.virginia.edu/housing/options.php?id=lawn&type=upperclass |date=September 5, 2014 }}, accessed September 5, 2014</ref> Similarly, graduate students may live on The Range. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] formerly lived in 13 West Range, and since 1904 the Raven Society has retrofitted and preserved his room much as it may have existed in the 1820s.

==Organization and administration==
{{Wikisource1911Enc|Virginia, University of|circa 1911 organization of the university}}
The university has several affiliated centers including the [[Rare Book School]], headquarters of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]], [[University of Virginia Center for Politics]], Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership, and [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]]. The [[Fralin Museum of Art]] is dedicated to creating an environment where both the university community and the general public can study and learn from directly experiencing works of art. The university has its own internal recruiting firm, the Executive Search Group and Strategic Resourcing. Since 2013, this department has been housed under the Office of the President.

[[Hunter R.

==Student life==
Student life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions. The campus of the university is referred to as the "Grounds". Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years to reflect Jefferson's belief that learning is a lifelong process, rather than one to be completed within four years.

[[File:William Faulkner 1954 (2) (photo by Carl van Vechten).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[William Faulkner]] once lived among the students of UVA after winning the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], and bequeathed most of his papers to Alderman Library.]]

===Student-faculty interaction and connections===
Professors are traditionally addressed as "Mr." or "Ms." at UVA instead of "Doctor" (although medical doctors are the exception) in deference to Jefferson's desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title. UVA facilitates close interactions between students and professors in a number of ways.

First-year students in the College of Arts & Sciences have the opportunity to take two University Seminars, one per semester, which are later made available to other students as well. These small classes, numbering from 4 to 19 students each, provide opportunities to work closely with professors at the university from the outset of a student's academic career. The small groupings also help facilitate more frequent and intense discussions between students in this closer environment.

Select faculty live at [[Brown College at Monroe Hill]], [[Hereford College]], [[International Residential College]], and in Pavilions on [[The Lawn]]. This gives more opportunities for professors to invite students to lunches and dinners, which regularly happens, and creates chances for impromptu meetings and interactions between faculty and students around Grounds.

Reflecting this close student-faculty interaction at UVA, it welcomed Nobel Laureate [[William Faulkner]] to a position as "Writer-in-Residence" in 1957.<ref name=Blotner>Joseph Blotner and Frederick L. Gwynn, (eds.) (1959) ''Faulkner in the University: Conferences at the University of Virginia, 1957–1958''.</ref> He had no teaching responsibilities, and was paid merely to live among the students and write. He was badly injured in a horse riding accident in 1959, and did not return to the state before his death in 1962.<ref name=Blotner /> Faulkner then bequeathed the majority of his papers to Alderman Library, giving UVA the largest Faulkner archives in the world.<ref>[http://uvamagazine.org/articles/faulkner_revisited Faulkner, Revisited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616201223/http://uvamagazine.org/articles/faulkner_revisited |date=June 16, 2017 }}, accessed June 6, 2017</ref>

===Global citizenship initiatives===
The [[International Residential College]] is a [[residential college]] at UVA that attracts and celebrates students from across the globe who choose to attend the university. It is one of three major residential colleges at UVA. Students there come from 45 different countries, representing 40% of the student population; but U.S. students are encouraged to live at IRC as well to learn about the countries from which their classmates have journeyed to attend UVA.

UVA was previously the academic sponsor for [[Semester at Sea]], a multi-country study abroad program conducted on a cruise ship.

The University of Virginia received the 2015 Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization, by the Association of International Educators.<ref name="Simon">[http://as.virginia.edu/news/why-globalize-education-president-sullivan-says-benefits-are-far-reaching President Sullivan Says Benefits of UVA's Globalization Are Far Reaching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302032919/http://as.virginia.edu/news/why-globalize-education-president-sullivan-says-benefits-are-far-reaching |date=March 2, 2016 }}, accessed February 19, 2016</ref> This award confirms the university's success and commitment in educating its students on a global scale as well as nationally.<ref name="Simon" />

===Student leadership opportunities===
There are a number of UVA undergraduate leadership opportunities that are offered in addition to the standard student government or fraternity and sorority positions found at many universities. They include UVA's [[#Secret societies and debating societies|secret societies and debating societies]], the [[#Honor system|student-run honor committees]], and the chance to be recognized as a fourth-year student at the pinnacle of student leadership by being asked to live on [[The Lawn]].

The [[Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy]], established in 2007, expands on these unique student leadership opportunities to study Leadership itself as a cross-disciplinary subject of focus and is closely aligned with many of the university's schools, including the [[University of Virginia School of Architecture|Architecture]], [[Curry School of Education|Education]], [[University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Engineering]], [[University of Virginia School of Law|Law]], [[University of Virginia School of Medicine|Medical]], and [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration|Darden]] schools, as well as with programs in politics, economics, and applied ethics.

The University of Virginia has a long history of student activists who formed radical environmental, religious, and political groups to champion various social changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu03897.xml;query=|title=A Guide to the Social Movements Collection, ca. 1959–1989, 2000, and n.d.

===Secret societies===
{{Main|Secret Societies at the University of Virginia}}

[[File:IMPsecretsociety.jpg|thumb|right|The mark of [[IMP Society|one]] out of [[Secret societies at the University of Virginia|many]] secret societies active on Grounds at the university]]

Student societies have existed on Grounds since the early 19th Century. Secret societies have been a part of University of Virginia student life since the first class of students in 1825. While the number of societies peaked during the 75-year period between 1875 and 1950, there are still six societies active that are over 100 years old, and several newer societies.

===Honor system===
{{Main|Honor system at the University of Virginia}}

{{quote box  |width = 20em
 |title = Honor Pledge<ref>[http://www.virginia.edu/uvatours/shorthistory/code.html The Code of Honor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118221358/http://www.virginia.edu/uvatours/shorthistory/code.html |date=January 18, 2015 }}, accessed December 15, 2014</ref>
 |quote = On my honor, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment.}}

The nation's first codified honor system was instituted by UVA law professor [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.]] in 1842, after a fellow professor was shot to death on [[The Lawn]]. There are three tenets to the system: students simply must not [[lie]], [[cheating|cheat]], or [[theft|steal]]. It is a "single sanction system", meaning that committing any of these three offenses will result in expulsion from the university. If accused, students are tried before their peers – fellow students, never faculty, serve as counsel and jury.

The honor system is intended to be student-run and student-administered.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Honor Committee | publisher = University of Virginia | url = http://www.virginia.edu/honor/ | date = December 11, 2006 | access-date = January 9, 2007 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013105720/http://www.virginia.edu/honor/ | archive-date = October 13, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Although Honor Committee resources have been strained by mass cheating scandals such as a case in 2001 of 122 suspected cheaters over several years in a single large Physics survey course, and federal lawsuits have challenged the system, its verdicts are rarely overturned.<ref>{{cite news |author=Greta von Susteren |title=University of Virginia Tackles Cheating Head On |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0105/10/bp.00.html |work=[[CNN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |access-date=November 13, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127181118/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0105/10/bp.00.html |archive-date=November 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Meg Scheu|title=Judge Denies Call to Dismiss Lawsuit|url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/1999/07/judge-denies-call-to-dismiss-lawsuit|work=[[Cavalier Daily]]|date=June 22, 1999|access-date=November 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505025911/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/1999/07/judge-denies-call-to-dismiss-lawsuit|archive-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>In 1983 the Fourth Circuit rejected a challenge brought by an expelled law student, the [http://openjurist.org/719/f2d/69/henson-v-honor-committee-of-u-va-u Henson case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125020150/http://openjurist.org/719/f2d/69/henson-v-honor-committee-of-u-va-u |date=November 25, 2014 }}, concluding U VA's student-run honor system afforded sufficient due process to pass constitutional scrutiny.</ref> There is only one documented case of direct UVA administration interference in an honor system proceeding: the trial and subsequent retrial of Christopher Leggett.<ref>{{cite news |author=Robert O' Harrow Jr. |title=Honor Case Causes Uproar at U-Va.; Some Angry Over Official Intervention, Student Panel's Unusual Reversal of Decision |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-905552.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=August 8, 1994 |access-date=November 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329042444/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-905552.html |archive-date=March 29, 2015 }}</ref>

===Student activities===
Many events take place at the University of Virginia, [[Events Held on The Lawn at UVA|on the Lawn]] and across Grounds. One of the largest events at UVA is Springfest, hosted by the University Programs Council. It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert, various inflatables and games. Another popular event is [[Foxfield Races|Foxfield]], a [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] and social gathering that takes place nearby in [[Albemarle County]] in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia and neighboring colleges.<ref name="foxfield">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/24000_plus_descend_on_foxfield_for_annual_steeplechase_social_gathering/20967/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915145603/http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/24000_plus_descend_on_foxfield_for_annual_steeplechase_social_gathering/20967/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 15, 2008 |work=Daily Progress |location=Charlottesville |date=April 27, 2008 |last=Borden |first=Jeremy |title=24,000-plus descend on Foxfield for annual steeplechase, social gathering }}</ref>

[[File:University of Virginia Amphitheater.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|The University Amphitheater is often used for outdoor lectures and student gatherings.]]

The student life building is called Newcomb Hall. It is home to the Student Activities Center (SAC) and the Media Activities Center (MAC), where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources, as well as several meeting rooms for student groups. Student Council, the student self-governing body, holds meetings Tuesdays at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. in the Newcomb South Meeting Room. Student Council, or "StudCo", also holds office hours and regular committee meetings in the newly renovated Newcomb Programs and Council (PAC) Room. The PAC also houses the University Programs Council and Class Councils. Newcomb basement is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper ''The Declaration'', ''[[The Cavalier Daily]]'', and the Consortium of University Publications.

In 2005, the university was named "Hottest for Fitness" by ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite magazine | title = America's 25 Hot Schools | magazine = [[Newsweek]] | date = August 2004 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/ | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070903110639/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/ | archive-date = September 3, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities. Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, across the street from the Alderman Dorms. The University of Virginia sent more workers to the [[Peace Corps]] in 2006<ref name="Peace Corps1">{{cite web| url = http://www.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/stats/schools2006.pdf| title = Peace Corps – Top Producing Colleges and Universities| access-date = December 8, 2006| publisher = [[Peace Corps]]| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227132115/http://www.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/stats/schools2006.pdf| archive-date = February 27, 2008| df = mdy-all}}</ref> and 2008<ref name="Peace Corps2">{{cite web| url = http://www.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/stats/schools2008.pdf| title = Peace Corps – Top Producing Colleges and Universities| access-date = January 16, 2009| publisher = [[Peace Corps]]| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090115041744/http://www.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/stats/schools2008.pdf| archive-date = January 15, 2009| df = mdy-all}}</ref> than any other "medium-sized" university in the United States. Volunteerism at the university is centered around Madison House which offers numerous opportunities to serve others. Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food from restaurants to the homeless of Charlottesville rather than allowing it to be discarded, among numerous other volunteer programs.

As at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students. Concerns particularly arose about a past trend of fourth-years consuming excessive alcohol during the day of the last home football game.<ref name="4thYear5th">{{cite web| url = http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2005/12/01/coverHighSpiritsWahoosTack.html| title = High spirits: Wahoos tackle fourth-year fifth| access-date = December 11, 2006| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060627121634/http://readthehook.com/stories/2005/12/01/coverHighSpiritsWahoosTack.html| archive-date = June 27, 2006| df = mdy-all}}</ref> President Casteen announced a $2.5&nbsp;million donation from [[Anheuser-Busch]] to fund a new UVA-based Social Norms Institute in September 2006.<ref name="SocialNorms">{{cite web| url = http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2006/09/28/NEWS-socialnorms-A.doc.aspx| title = Busch league: UVA gets big bucks to ban binging| access-date = December 11, 2006| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202123/http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2006/09/28/NEWS-socialnorms-A.doc.aspx| archive-date = September 30, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> A spokesman said: "the goal is to get students to emulate the positive behavior of the vast majority of students".

===Fraternities and sororities===
{{Main|Fraternities and sororities at University of Virginia}}

The University of Virginia has a number of [[fraternities and sororities]] on campus, encompassing the traditional social fraternities and sororities as well as coeducational [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]], [[Service fraternities and sororities|service]], and [[Honor societies#List of scholastic examples|honor fraternities]]. Social life at the university was originally dominated by debating societies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patton|first=John|title=Jefferson, Cabell, and the University of Virginia|publisher=Neale Publishing Company|location=New York, NY |page=[https://archive.org/details/jeffersoncabell01pattgoog/page/n250 235] |url = https://archive.org/details/jeffersoncabell01pattgoog |quote=edgar mason.|year=1906}}</ref> The first fraternity chapter founded at UVA was [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] in 1852, and it was quickly followed by many more; the University of Virginia was the birthplace of two national fraternities, [[Kappa Sigma]] and [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], which exist at the university to this day.<ref name="dabney cw">{{cite book|last=Dabney|first=Virginius |title = Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |year=1981|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville, VA |page = 20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2iErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA301|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities |year=1920 |access-date=June 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906013434/https://books.google.com/books?id=2iErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA301 |archive-date=September 6, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2iErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA301 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities |year=1920 |access-date=June 29, 2015 |url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906013434/https://books.google.com/books?id=2iErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA301#v=onepage |archive-date=September 6, 2015 }}</ref>

Through the twentieth century, the roles of these organizations on campus expanded to encompass social sororities, professional fraternities and sororities, service fraternities, honor societies, black fraternities and sororities, and multicultural fraternities and sororities. Roughly 30% of the student body are members of social fraternities and sororities, while additional students are involved with service, professional, and honor fraternities.<ref name="fsl brochure">{{cite web |title=Fraternity and Sorority Life at the University of Virginia, 2014–2015 |url = http://www.virginia.edu/fsl/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-2014-2015-FSL-Brochure.pdf |publisher=University of Virginia Office of the Dean of Students |access-date=April 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623003150/http://www.virginia.edu/fsl/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-2014-2015-FSL-Brochure.pdf |archive-date=June 23, 2015 }}</ref> [[Fraternities and sororities in North America#Joining|"Rush and pledging"]] occur in the spring semester for most organizations.

A set of bus lines operated by the university's [[University Transit Service]] connect different parts of the UVA Grounds with adjacent parking facilities. This is complemented by a set of bus lines operated by [[Charlottesville Area Transit]] that connect the University of Virginia with other parts of Charlottesville. The [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] maintains the roads through the university grounds as [[State Route 302 (Virginia)|State Route 302]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/route-index-07012003.pdf |title=Virginia Route Index |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701135847/http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/route-index-07012003.pdf |archive-date=July 1, 2015 }}&nbsp;{{small|(239&nbsp;KB)}}, revised July 1, 2003</ref>

[[Charlottesville Union Station]] is just {{convert|0.6|miles|km}} from UVA, and from there [[Amtrak#Efficiency|energy efficient]] [[Amtrak]] passenger trains serve Charlottesville on three routes: the [[Cardinal (train)|''Cardinal'']] (Chicago to New York City), [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']] ([[New Orleans]] to New York City), and ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' (Virginia to [[Boston]]). The long-haul ''Cardinal'' operates three times a week, while the ''Crescent'' and ''Northeast Regional'' both run daily.

==Athletics==
{{main|Virginia Cavaliers}}
Virginia has ranked near the top of collegiate athletics programs in recent years. In 2015 and 2019, UVA won the nationwide [[Capital One Cup (college sports)#Champions|Capital One Cup]] for overall men's sports excellence.<ref name=19Cup /> The teams and athletes representing Virginia in [[college athletics]] have been dubbed the ''Cavaliers'' [[Virginia Cavaliers#Fight song|since 1923]], predating the NBA's [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] by nearly half a century.

In 2019, [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia men's basketball]] won the NCAA Championship in "[[March Madness]]", the single-elimination national [[college basketball]] tournament considered by ''[[YouGov]]'' polled American viewers (as of the same year) to be the most exciting [[college athletics|collegiate sporting]] event.<ref>[https://www.newsweek.com/final-four-ncaa-march-madness-super-bowl-nba-finals-1385983 March Madness 2019: Where Does the NCAA Final Four Rank in America's Favorite Sporting Events?], accessed April 28, 2019</ref><ref>[https://today.yougov.com/topics/sports/articles-reports/2019/04/01/march-madness-final-four-exciting-event Americans say March Madness Final Four is one of top three most exciting sports events of the year], accessed April 28, 2019</ref> In 2015, when Virginia first won its first Capital One Cup its teams won the [[2014 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2014 College Cup]], the [[2015 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Bracket|2015 College World Series]], and the [[2015 NCAA Division I Tennis Championships|2015 NCAA Tennis Championships]]. When it repeated the feat in 2019, the program won both March Madness and the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2019 Men's Lacrosse Championship]].

Virginia's athletics director is Carla Williams, the first African American woman to hold the position at any [[power conference]] university. The previous athletics director was [[Craig Littlepage]], the first African American to have that title in the ACC. He held the position for sixteen years and, under his leadership, UVA added many significant hires who have demonstrated success near the top of their respective sports, including recent NCAA Champions [[Tony Bennett (basketball)|Tony Bennett]], [[Lars Tiffany]], [[Brian O'Connor (baseball coach)|Brian O'Connor]], and Todd DeSorbo, as well as [[Bronco Mendenhall]]. Among coaches who have longer tenures, [[George Gelnovatch]] has won two NCAA men's soccer national titles since 2009. Steve Swanson has led women's soccer teams to six ACC titles and 24 consecutive winning seasons. Kevin Sauer has led UVA women's rowing to two NCAA titles since 2010.

[[File:Virginia-UVA-Johns-Hopkins-lacrosse.jpg|thumb|right|UVA lacrosse has won 11 national championships, including nine national titles since NCAA oversight began.]]

===Championships===
In the 21st century alone, UVA teams have won seventeen NCAA championships. The men's teams have won recent NCAA titles in basketball (2019); lacrosse (2003, 2006, 2011, 2019, and 2021); baseball (2015); soccer (2009 and 2014); and tennis (2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017). UVA women have won recent NCAA titles in rowing (2010 and 2012) and swimming & diving (2021). The Cavaliers rank [[Atlantic Coast Conference#NCAA team championships|first in the ACC]] (a [[power conference]]) with 21 men's NCAA Championships, and rank second in the conference with eight women's NCAA Championships.

Under [[Tony Bennett (basketball)|Tony Bennett]] the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Cavaliers]] have experienced a basketball renaissance, winning the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Final Four|2019 NCAA Championship]], winning the [[ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournaments]] of 2014 (over Duke) and 2018 (over North Carolina), and winning regular-season championships in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. UVA recently became the third program in ACC history to win 30 or more games in consecutive seasons and [[John Paul Jones Arena]] is considered one of the more intimidating trips for opposing teams to make. The women's basketball program fell just short of its own NCAA Championship in 1990, losing the Championship Game in overtime. The team is currently led by WNBA legend [[Tina Thompson]].

The [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Virginia men's]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers women's lacrosse|women's lacrosse]] programs are two of the most dominant in the history of the sport, winning ten of UVA's twenty-nine NCAA Championships between them and two more (for a total of 11 recognized national championships) before NCAA oversight began. 2019 and 2021 NCAA champion men's head coach [[Lars Tiffany]] has brought UVA back to prominence after [[Dom Starsia]] retired as the all-time ACC leader in men's lacrosse wins. All three UVA head coaches in the position prior to Tiffany still rank (as of 2019) in [[List of college men's lacrosse coaches with 250 wins|the top 20]] of career wins. Three-time NCAA champion head coach Julie Myers leads women's lacrosse and under her guidance, Virginia is the only program to qualify for 24 straight NCAA Tournament berths as of 2019.<ref>[https://virginiasports.com/coaches.aspx?rc=2564&path=wlax Julie Myers], accessed May 15, 2019</ref>

The [[Virginia Cavaliers baseball|Cavalier baseball]] team under [[Brian O'Connor (baseball coach)|Brian O'Connor]] has also experienced tremendous success. UVA finished as national Runners-up in the [[2014 College World Series]] and came back to win the [[2015 College World Series]]. Virginia has hosted five NCAA Super Regional tournament events at [[Davenport Field at Disharoon Park|Davenport Field]].

The [[Virginia Cavaliers men's tennis|UVA men's tennis]] program won "three-peat" NCAA Championships in 2015–2017 after winning the Cavaliers' first in 2013. The program has regularly featured notable international talent combined with outstanding locally grown high school tennis talent from in-state Virginia (often [[Northern Virginia]]).<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-state-of-nova/post/nova-tennis-stars-may-be-americas-future-hope/2011/05/09/AFBmXSeG_blog.html NoVA Tennis Stars May Be America's Future Hope], accessed May 15, 2019</ref>

===Rivalries===
Official ACC designated rivalry games include the [[Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry]] and the Virginia–[[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]] series. These two rivalries are guaranteed an annual game in all sports, and a home-and-away series in men's and women's basketball. The Cavaliers competed against the Hokies in the ''[[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry#Commonwealth Challenge & Clash|Commonwealth Challenge]]'' and more recently competed in the ''Commonwealth Clash'', under new rules, for many sports in which they compete head-to-head. The Cavaliers went 2–0 against the Hokies in the ''Challenge'' and 3–2 in the ''Clash'' (5–2 overall). Perhaps the two most significant rivalry games played between the Cavaliers and Hokies were both in men's basketball, on March 1, 2007, and January 15, 2019. In the former, the two teams met with identical 10–4 ACC records and the winner would clinch a share of the regular-season conference championship.

Other notable [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball#Rivalries|basketball rivalries]] include those against North Carolina and Maryland. Notably the [[1982 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|1982 ACC Tournament]] championship game where [[Dean Smith]] had his team of future NBA stars (such as [[Michael Jordan]] and [[James Worthy]]) hold the ball for seven minutes, against a Virginia team featuring [[Ralph Sampson]], led to the advent of the [[shot clock]] and the [[three-point field goal|three-point line]]. The Maryland rivalry is now mostly dormant, but was reignited for the 2014 and 2018 editions of the [[ACC–Big Ten Challenge]], with both Challenges won by the Cavaliers on the road in College Park.

[[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Virginia men's lacrosse]], as one of the all-time great NCAA programs, has a championship rivalry with fellow ACC program Syracuse (the Cavaliers and Orange holding 18 NCAA Championships between them) as well as rivalries against Big Ten programs Johns Hopkins and Maryland. The Syracuse and Johns Hopkins rivalries are played out at least once each season (Syracuse played ''twice'' in 2021<ref>[https://virginiasports.com/sports/mlax/schedule/ 2021 Virginia men's lacrosse schedule]. University of Virginia, January 2021. Accessed February 15, 2021.</ref>) with the teams often finding themselves facing off a second or third time in the ACC and NCAA Tournaments. [[Virginia Cavaliers women's lacrosse|Virginia women's lacrosse]], also a multi-NCAA Championship program, maintains several of those same rivalries.

The Virginia football team competes against North Carolina in the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]], a historic football rivalry game which a sitting President of the United States, [[Calvin Coolidge]], made time to attend in Charlottesville in 1924. The 1960s and 1970s were particularly dark decades for the football program, which later experienced a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s under [[George Welsh (American football)|George Welsh]]. Coach Welsh led the program to its first bowl bids starting with the [[1984 Peach Bowl]]. Welsh, who even reached AP No. 1 rankings for Virginia in October 1990, is a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] after compiling the second-most wins in ACC history after [[Bobby Bowden]].<ref>[https://www.fromtherumbleseat.com/2010/7/22/1578527/acc-history-in-numbers-coaching ACC History in Numbers: Coaching], accessed December 3, 2017</ref> In a historic rivalry between two legendary coaches, Welsh finished two games up in the head-to-head series against Virginia Tech coach [[Frank Beamer]], 8–6. He was also dominant against UNC in the South's Oldest Rivalry, finishing 13–5–1, including a perfect 10–0 record against North Carolina at [[Scott Stadium]].
