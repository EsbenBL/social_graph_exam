'''Jean-Claude Trichet''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ klod tʁiʃɛ|lang}}; born 20 December 1942) is a French [[economist]] who served as [[President of the European Central Bank]] from 2003 to 2011. Previous to his assumption of the presidency he served as [[Governor of the Banque de France|Governor of the Bank of France]] from 1993 to 2003 under presidents [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac]].

After stepping down from the European Central Bank, Trichet has taken speaking arrangements across France and served on the Board of Directors of the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. He was asked to join the non-doctrinal [[think tank]], [[Bruegel (institution)|Bruegel]], to consult on economic policy. In 2008, Trichet ranked fifth on ''[[Newsweek]]'''s list of the world's most powerful along with economic triumvirs [[Ben Bernanke]] (fourth) and [[Masaaki Shirakawa]] (sixth).<ref>{{cite web | title=Economic Triumvirate: 4.

==Early life and education==
Trichet was born in 1942 in [[Lyons]], the son of a professor of Greek and Latin.<ref>Ralph Atkins (14 May 2010), [https://www.ft.com/content/8bbaa714-5f8b-11df-a670-00144feab49a Man in the News: Jean-Claude Trichet] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> He was educated at the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Nancy|École des Mines de Nancy]], from which he graduated in 1964. He later earned a master's degree in economics from the [[University of Paris]] and then trained at the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]] (best known as [[Sciences Po]]), finishing in 1966, and the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA) from 1969–1971, two French higher education institutions in the field of political science and state administration.{{fact|date=December 2021}}

==Career==
=== Career in the public sector ===
From 1987, Trichet served as head of the [[Trésor public]]. In this capacity, he also chaired the [[Paris Club]] of creditor nations in the mid-1980s and was closely involved in debt problems that struck Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Ralph Atkins (9 May 2010), [https://www.ft.com/content/dcea346a-5b9e-11df-85a3-00144feab49a  Trichet resists political interference amid crisis] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> He also became a member of Washington-based financial advisory body, the [[Group of Thirty]]. Soon after taking office at Trésor, Trichet oversaw the change to an anti-inflationary ''franc fort'' (strong franc) policy, to pave the way for currency union with Germany. In 1993, he led Trésor’s move to grant the [[Bank of France]] independence to set its own interest rates.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/unknown/2003/06/19/trichet-in-the-clear Trichet in the clear] ''[[The Economist]]'', 19 June 2003.</ref>

In 1993, Trichet was appointed governor of [[Banque de France]]. Both as director of the French Treasury and then governor of the Banque de France, he was widely seen as one of the architects of the [[European monetary union]].<ref>Ralph Atkins (9 May 2010), [https://www.ft.com/content/dcea346a-5b9e-11df-85a3-00144feab49a  Trichet resists political interference amid crisis] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

By 1997, [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]] and [[President of France|President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] proposed Trichet as France’s candidate for the position as president of the [[European Central Bank]];<ref>Tony Czuczka (29 December 1997), [https://asia.nikkei.com/NAR/Articles/Jean-Claude-Trichet-17-The-French-government-s-11th-hour-ECB-candidate Jean-Claude Trichet (17): The French government's 11th-hour ECB candidate] ''[[The Nikkei]]'', 18 September 2014.</ref> this way they opposed [[Wim Duisenberg]], the candidate preferred by the majority of the [[Eurozone]] members. Under a compromise laid out by German Finance Minister [[Theo Waigel]], Duisenberg would resign midway through his eight-year term to make way for Trichet.<ref>Tony Czuczka (29 December 1997), [https://apnews.com/article/3d5663b0feb83527d87ebe08864215de Germans, French dismiss report of European central bank deal] ''[[Associated Press]]''.</ref> On 1 November 2003 he succeeded [[Wim Duisenberg]].

During his time in office, Trichet oversaw the ECB’s response to the [[European debt crisis]], including its Securities Markets Programme to stem the crisis in eurozone government bond markets.<ref>Paul Carrell (10 September 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-stark/stark-resignation-limits-draghis-room-on-bond-buys-idUSTRE7883DF20110910 Stark resignation limits Draghi's room on bond buys] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In 2011, ECB board member [[Jürgen Stark]] resigned in what was widely seen as a protest against this policy.<ref>Paul Carrell (10 September 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-stark/stark-resignation-limits-draghis-room-on-bond-buys-idUSTRE7883DF20110910 Stark resignation limits Draghi's room on bond buys] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

=== Career in the private sector ===
On 28 January 2012, the board of the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] approved Trichet’s nomination to the Board, where he represented (with Dominique d’Hinnin of the [[Lagardère Group]]) the French state’s holding company [[SOGEADE]].<ref>http://bourse.lefigaro.fr/indices-actions/actu-conseils/jean-claude-trichet-devient-administrateur-d-eads-58750 [[lefigaro.fr]] 1/26/2012</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/business/global/trichet-likely-to-join-board-of-airbus-parent.html [https://nytimes.com], 1/26/2012</ref>

Trichet succeeded [[Mario Monti]] as chairman of the European branch of the [[Trilateral Commission]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&pid=11 |title=About the Trilateral Commission – European Region |publisher=trilateral.org |access-date=2013-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509143411/http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&pid=11 |archive-date= 9 May 2013 }}</ref> 

Trichet was a member of the Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance, which was established by the [[G20]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors for the period from 2017 to 2018.<ref>[https://www.globalfinancialgovernance.org/about-g20-epg/epg-members/ Members] Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance.</ref> In early 2021, Grynspan was appointed by the G20 to the High Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on financing the global commons for pandemic preparedness and response, co-chaired by [[Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala]], [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]] and [[Lawrence Summers]].<ref>[https://www.mef.gov.it/en/ufficio-stampa/comunicati/2021/The-G20-establishes-a-High-Level-Independent-Panel-on-financing-the-Global-Commons-for-Pandemic-Preparedness-and-Response-00001/ Ministry of Economy and FinanceThe G20 establishes a High Level Independent Panel on financing the Global Commons for Pandemic Preparedness and Response] [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]], press release of 27 January 2021.</ref>

== Political positions ==
At the height of the euro crisis, Trichet publicly criticized [[President of France|President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]], who had agreed at a meeting in Deauville in 2010 that sovereign debt could be restructured in a bailout to make private investors pay their share; the plan was never implemented.<ref>Pierre Briançon (19 March 2018), [https://www.politico.eu/article/jean-claude-trichet-on-global-finance-we-still-live-in-an-abnormal-situation/ Jean-Claude Trichet: We still live in an ‘abnormal situation’] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

At the ceremony for the [[Charlemagne Prize]] in 2011, Trichet called for the creation of a central finance ministry to oversee spending by countries that use the [[euro]].<ref>Jack Ewing and Niki Kitsantonis (2 June 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/business/global/03euro.html Trichet Urges Creation of Euro Oversight Panel] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

On 5 August 2011 Trichet wrote, together with [[Mario Draghi]], a [[Trichet-Draghi letter|letter]] to the [[Italian government]] to push for a series of economic measures that would soon be implemented in [[Italy]].<ref name="Pisani-Ferry2014">{{cite book|author=Jean Pisani-Ferry|title=The Euro Crisis and Its Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjmTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-999333-8|page=183}}</ref>

In 2015, Trichet joined forces with two other former governors of the Bank of France – [[Michel Camdessus]] and [[Jacques de Larosière]] – in publicly supporting [[President of France|President]] [[François Hollande]]’s appointment of [[François Villeroy de Galhau]] to head the central bank.<ref>Dominique Vidalon (27 September 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0RR0WO20150927 Three former French central bankers back Villeroy de Galhau: Les Echos] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In a 2019 article for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Trichet publicly hit back against some of his former colleagues at the European Central Bank – including [[Jürgen Stark]] and [[Otmar Issing]], who both worked as ECB chief economist under Trichet’s presidency –, calling them "misguided" in their criticism of the loose monetary policy pursued by his successor as president [[Mario Draghi]].<ref>Mark Tran (6 January 2003), [https://www.ft.com/content/149c1f48-ed87-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901 Jean-Claude Trichet defends Mario Draghi stance on monetary policy] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

== Controversy ==
=== Crédit Lyonnais scandal ===
In January 2003, Trichet was put on trial with eight others charged with irregularities at [[Crédit Lyonnais]], one of France's biggest banks. Trichet was in charge of the French treasury at that time. He was cleared in June 2003, which left the way clear for him to move to the [[European Central Bank|ECB]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Top Euro banker cleared of scandal cover-up| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3000170.stm | access-date=2007-08-15  | work=BBC News | date=18 June 2003}}</ref> A parliamentary inquiry found no wrong-doing by Trichet, other civil servants or the three finance ministers in office during the critical period.<ref>Martin Arnold (13 October 2019), [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/jan/06/france.theeuro Head of Bank of France appears in court] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

===2009 banking crisis===
Within the European Central Bank, Trichet strongly resisted any contemplation of [[European sovereign debt crisis|Greece defaulting on its debt]]. It was only in October 2011, with the end of his term imminent, that consensus was reached to allow a 50% cut in the value of Greek bonds.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Denials That Trapped Greece |author=Landon Thomas Jr. |author2= Stephen Castle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/business/global/europes-two-years-of-denials-trapped-greece.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2011 |access-date=5 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Hypo Alpe Adria bailout ===
As part of a 2015 investigation launced by Austria’s parliament into defunct lender [[Hypo Alpe Adria]], then opposition party [[NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum|NEOS]] named Trichet among 200 people it wanted to question.<ref>Michael Shields (14 January 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0KN1BE20150114 Austria parliament starts investigation into Hypo bank collapse] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> At the time of Austria purchasing Hypo Alpe Adria from [[BayernLB]] in late 2009, Trichet had lobbied for the deal.<ref>Michael Shields (11 March 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0C349E20130311 Embattled Hypo Alpe Adria extends executive contracts] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Trichet has been criticised for the ECB's response to the Great Recession, which emphasised price stability over recovery and growth.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Impeccable Disaster| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/opinion/an-impeccable-disaster.html | access-date=2011-09-12  | work=New York Times | date=11 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/the-summer-of-confidence |title=The Summer of Confidence |author=Paul Krugman |date=1 December 2011 |series=The Conscience of a Liberal (blog)|work=The New York Times|access-date=4 December 2011}}</ref>
He was also criticized when he refused to answer a question about a possible conflict of interests concerning his successor's involvement at [[Goldman Sachs]] before taking charge as head of the ECB.<ref>{{cite web|title=LIENS DRAGHI-GOLDMAN SACHS : TRICHET RESTE MUET (ARTE)|url=http://www.arretsurimages.net/breves/2012-09-05/Liens-Draghi-Goldman-Sachs-Trichet-reste-muet-Arte-id14400|website=Arret Sur Images|access-date=9 September 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
At age 22, Trichet married Aline Rybalka, a diplomat and translator whose parents immigrated to France from Ukraine. They have two sons: Pierre-Alexis Trichet (born 1971), a marketing strategy director at telecommunications company [[Orange SA]]; and Jean-Nicolas Trichet (born 1974), a musician and producer.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aPt.eeWENckA Bloomberg: "Trichet Proving Prophet-Making No Panacea in Recovery" By Simon Kennedy and Jana Randow] 21 August 2009</ref>
