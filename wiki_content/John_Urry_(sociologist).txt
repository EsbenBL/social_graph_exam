'''John Richard Urry''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FAcSS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʊər|i}}; 1 June 1946, [[London]] – 18 March 2016, [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]) was a British sociologist who served as a professor at [[Lancaster University]]. He is noted for work in the fields of the sociology of tourism and mobility.

He wrote books on many other aspects of modern society including the transition away from "organised capitalism", the sociology of nature and [[environmentalism]], and social theory in general.

==Background==
Born in London and educated at the [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], Urry gained his first degrees from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1967, a 'double first' [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in Economics, before going on to gain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Sociology from the same institution in 1972. He arrived at Lancaster University Sociology department as a lecturer in 1970, becoming head of department in 1983 and a professor in 1985.

Urry was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], a Founding Academician of the UK [[Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Professor John Urry FAcSS|url=https://www.acss.org.uk/news/professor-john-urry-facss/|website=Academy of Social Sciences|access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref> and was a Visiting Professor at both Bristol and Roskilde Geography Departments. 

His partner was the sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]].

==Research interests==

His original research interests were in the sociology of power and revolution and this resulted in the publication of ''Reference Groups and the Theory of Revolution'' (1973) and ''Power in Britain'' (1973).

Early work at Lancaster was in the area of social theory and the philosophy of the social sciences. ''Social Theory as Science'', (1975, 1982), co-written with his colleague Russell Keat, set out the main features of the realist philosophy of science. Critical confrontation with a number of [[Marxism|Marxist traditions]], of [[Althusser]]ian [[structuralism]], German state theory, and neo-[[Gramsci]]an theory, resulted in the ''Anatomy of Capitalist Societies'' (1981).

==Research Areas==
Research until his death focused on five main areas.

===Regionalism===
First, there was the urban and regional research mainly associated with the Lancaster Regionalism Group. Collaborative research resulted in ''Localities, Class and Gender'' (1985) and ''Restructuring. Place, Class and Gender'' (1990) Two particular themes were pursued: the relationship between society and space (as in the ''Social Relations and Spatial Structures'', co-edited with Derek Gregory, 1985); and the possibilities of developing local economic policies (as in ''Place, Policy and Politics'', 1990).

===Economic and social change===
The second area of research was the more general dimensions of economic and social change in western capitalist societies. This resulted in three jointly written books, ''Capital, Labour and the Middle Classes'' (1983); ''The End of Organized Capitalism'' (1987); and ''Economies of Signs and Space'' (1994; latter two with [[Scott Lash]]).

===Consumer and tourism services===
Thirdly, research focused upon one particular set of industries that are of particular significance in contemporary western societies, namely consumer services and especially tourist-related services. The economic, social, environmental and cultural implications of such developments can be seen in ''The Tourist Gaze'' (1990, 2002: 2nd edn.), ''Consuming Places'' (1995), ''Touring Cultures'' (1997, edited with Chris Rojek), ''Tourism Mobilities'' (2004, edited with Mimi Sheller), and ''Performing Tourist Places'' (with J-O Barenholdt, M Haldrup, J. Larsen). This concern was extended to issues of environmental change and the 'sociology of nature' see ''Contested Natures'' (1998), ''Bodies of Nature'' (2001) (both with Phil Macnaghten) and ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011).

===Mobility===
Fourthly, Urry had various research projects and publications relating to the changing nature of mobility. Publications include: ''Sociology Beyond Societies'' (2000), a special issue of Theory, Culture and Society, (August 2004 on Automobilities coedited with Mike Feathersone, Nigel Thrift); Mobile Technologies of the City (2006); coedited with [[Mimi Sheller]]. John Urry also directed the Centre for Mobilities Research between 2003 and 2015 and was later the Co-Director of the Institute for Social Futures.

===Complexity theory===
Finally, John Urry had been exploring some implications of [[complexity theory for the social sciences]]. Publications here include ''Global Complexity'' (2003), and "Complexity", a special double issue of ''[[Theory, Culture & Society]] ''(2005).

He was also one of the founding editors of the new journal ''[[Mobilities (journal)|Mobilities]]'', and served as editor of the ''International Library of Sociology'' since 1990 (Routledge).
