After graduating from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] with high honors (1987), Orszag earned an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] [[summa cum laude]] in [[economics]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1991 after completing an 80-page long senior thesis titled "Congressional Oversight of the [[Federal Reserve]]: Empirical and Theoretical Perspectives."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orszag|first=Peter R.|date=1991|title=Congressional Oversight of the Federal Reserve: Empirical and Theoretical Perspectives|url=http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01gf06g3488}}</ref> He then received a [[M.Sc.]] (1992) and a [[Ph.D.]] (1997) in economics from the [[London School of Economics]].

==Career==
Orszag became a lecturer at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and taught [[macroeconomics]] in 1999 and 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/sspf/event/2013/possibilities-and-perils-future-economic-policy-peter-orszag|title=Possibilities and Perils: The Future of Economic Policy (Peter Orszag)|date=March 28, 2013|website=Social Science and Policy Forum|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref> As a senior fellow and Deputy Director of Economic Studies at the [[Brookings Institution]], he co-founded and directed The Hamilton Project and (in conjunction with [[Georgetown Public Policy Institute|Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute]]) the [[Pew Charitable Trust]]'s Retirement Security Project.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Why Do Capable Public Servants Like Economist Peter Orszag Keep Circling Back From Washington to Wall Street? -- New York Magazine - Nymag|url=https://nymag.com/news/business/wallstreet/peter-orszag-2011-4/|access-date=2020-08-14|website=New York Magazine|language=en-us}}</ref>

He served as Special [[Assistant to the President]] for Economic Policy (1997–1998), and as Senior Economist and Senior Adviser on the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] (1995–1996) during the [[Clinton administration]]. He also formed a consulting group called Sebago Associates, which merged into Competition Policy Associates and was bought by FTI Consulting Inc. for a reported $70 million.<ref>{{Cite web|title=FTI Consulting to Acquire Competition Policy Associates Inc|url=https://ir.fticonsulting.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fti-consulting-acquire-competition-policy-associates-inc}}</ref>

After leaving the Obama administration, Orszag took a job with [[Citigroup]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/ex-white-house-budget-director-joins-citigroup/ | title=Ex-White House Budget Director Joins Citigroup | work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Dash | date=December 9, 2010}}</ref> A 2011 article in [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] suggested Citi's hiring of Orszag "signaled that Citi would be invested in the intellectual marketplace," and that "just about anyone will take the call of a former White House budget director."<ref name=":0" /> In May 2016, Orszag joined [[Lazard]] as managing director and vice chairman of investment banking.<ref name=Lazard/>

He is also an invitee of the [[Bilderberg Group]] and attended the conferences in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

==Congressional Budget Office==
Orszag was director of the [[Congressional Budget Office]] from January 2007 to November 2008. During his tenure, he repeatedly drew attention to the role rising health care expenditures are likely to play in the government's long-term fiscal problems—and, by extension, the nation's long-term economic problems. "I have not viewed CBO's job as just to passively evaluate what Congress proposes, but rather to be an analytical resource. And part of that is to highlight things that are true and that people may not want to hear, including that we need to address health-care costs."<ref name = kleinbio>{{cite news | last=Klein | first=Ezra | title=The Number-Cruncher-in-Chief | publisher=The American Prospect | date=January 14, 2009 | url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=numbercruncherinchief | access-date=January 14, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612160458/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=numbercruncherinchief | archive-date=June 12, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref> During his time at the CBO, he added 20 full-time health analysts (bringing the total number to 50), thereby strengthening the CBO's analytical capabilities and preparing Congress for health-care reform.<ref name = kleinbio/>

He was widely praised for his time at CBO for preparing the agency for the debates to come.  When he stepped down, ''[[National Journal]] noted that "Orszag, who will turn 40 on Dec. 16, has been praised by lawmakers from both parties as an objective analyst with deep knowledge of the most pressing fiscal issues of the day, including health care policy, Social Security, pensions, and global climate change. He is the unusual economist who blends an understanding of politics, policy and communications in ways that wrap zesty quotes around complex ideas."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1108/111808nj1.htm|title=Obama expected to name Peter Orszag OMB director}}</ref>

==Office of Management and Budget==
[[File:20090106 BudgetMeeting-3297.jpg|thumb|2009 budget meeting]]On November 25, 2008, President-elect [[Barack Obama]] announced that Orszag would be his nominee for director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], the arm of the White House responsible for crafting the federal budget and overseeing the effectiveness of federal programs.<ref>

Orszag, in a November 2009 speech in New York, said that deficits, which were expected to add $9 trillion to the existing national debt of $12 trillion over the next decade, are "serious and ultimately unsustainable." He said that deficit spending was necessary to help boost the economy when unemployment is hovering around 10 percent. But he said that red ink must be stopped as the economy recovers. During a recovery, private investment will again pick up and compete with the federal government for capital.<ref>{{cite news |title=OMB director warns growing deficit a threat to American economy |author=Walter Alarkon |date=November 3, 2009 |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/66085-omb-director-warns-growing-deficit-a-threat-to-us-economy}}</ref> In 2011, he was described by New York Magazine as a "deficit hawk and clashed with Larry Summers, who wasn’t as focused on the long-term debt crisis."<ref name=":0" />

In July 2010 Orszag said that "The problem now is weak growth and high unemployment rather than outright economic collapse". Still, the deficit would be equivalent to 10 percent of the [[gross domestic product]], the highest level since [[World War II]]. The Office of Management and Budget's mid-session review, forecast a smaller deficit and stronger economic growth than the administration's initial budget release. The deficit forecast in 2011 increased to $1.42 trillion, up from the $1.27 estimate in February. For 2012, the deficit estimate rose to $922 billion, up from $828 billion in the previous report. The annual budget shortfall would bottom out in 2017 at $721 billion, or 3.4 percent of GDP, and begin rising again in following years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/801-economy/110663-obama-budget-office-forecasts-147t-deficit-high-unemployment|title=Obama budget office forecasts $1.47T deficit, high unemployment|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725195608/http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/801-economy/110663-obama-budget-office-forecasts-147t-deficit-high-unemployment|archive-date=2010-07-25}}</ref>

A review of Orszag's daily schedules shows his sustained focus on healthcare reform as soon as he joined Obama's [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]. The daily schedules for Orszag, who left his position as OMB director in July 2010, reveal that he and key White House aides regularly met to discuss healthcare starting in January 2009, within days of Obama entering office. Orszag also had meetings with insurance executives and health experts as the White House made health reform its top legislative priority after enacting the $814 billion stimulus from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

When Orszag resigned, the [[Progressive Policy Institute]] summed up his time in office: "For an administration numbers-cruncher, he was unusually visible, which was a good thing. With a reputation for impartiality and brilliance, Orszag gave the administration's agenda analytical ballast. There will no doubt be efforts on the right to brush Orszag with the red ink that the administration finds itself swimming in, but that's politics as usual. Inheriting the worst economy since the 1930s, Orszag presided over the Herculean task of preventing a complete meltdown and setting the foundation for a recovery. In many ways, he's a reflection of the administration at its best: a rigorous, pragmatic empiricist."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://progressivepolicy.org/orszag-a-tough-act-to-follow |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503000458/http://progressivepolicy.org/orszag-a-tough-act-to-follow |archive-date=2012-05-03 }}</ref>

==Citigroup==
Orszag held two jobs at [[Citigroup]]: Vice Chairman of Corporate and Investment Banking and Chairman of the Financial Strategy and Solutions Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/experts/energy-policy-energy-policy-pollution/peter-r-orszag/b3538|title=Peter R. Orszag: Bio|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150227022210/http://www.cfr.org/experts/energy-policy-energy-policy-pollution/peter-r-orszag/b3538|archive-date=February 27, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref> He joined Citigroup in 2011.  According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', "for an ambitious economist like Peter Orszag, going to work for Citigroup represented a choice. As a young staffer working in the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton White House]], he saw laid before him two different paths: [[Joseph Stiglitz|Stiglitzism]] and [[Robert Rubin|Rubinism]]. There were both intellectual and career-arc components to these. While both are liberal Democrats, Rubin was the consummate insider, whose philosophy was that the free markets, balanced budgets, and limited regulation would create a rising tide that would lift all boats (or at least make Wall Street not complain too much about Clinton's social programs). Stiglitz, the public intellectual, is as concerned with the boats as with the tide. Orszag certainly had a lot in common with Stiglitz's academic mien, having grown up in an intensely intellectual family in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], outside Boston. His father was the celebrated Yale math professor [[Steven Orszag]]. But Orszag possessed an ambition that would take him beyond the ivory tower. He ultimately chose Rubinism. It makes perfect sense that Orszag would have been drawn toward Rubin. It must have been incredibly seductive seeing this world, watching the Rubin wing of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] move so easily from government to Wall Street boardrooms to the table with [[Charlie Rose]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/business/wallstreet/peter-orszag-2011-4/|title=Revolver|last=Sheman|first=Gabriela|date=April 10, 2011|website=New York Magazine|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>

==Lazard==
In May 2016, Orszag joined [[Lazard]] as Vice Chairman of investment banking and Managing Director.<ref name=Lazard/><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/business/dealbook/ex-obama-cabinet-official-joins-lazard.html | work=New York Times | title= Ex-Obama Cabinet Official Joins Lazard | date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> He was later named Global Co-Head of Healthcare and, subsequent to that, Head of North American M&A. Orszag took over as CEO of Financial Advisory in June 2019, overseeing the firm's advisory work for corporations and governments across the globe.<ref name=CEOAnnouncement/> Orszag has been charged with "breathing new life into Lazard" as the firm faces increased competition from copycat advisory firms.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Indap |first1=Sujeet |last2=Agnew |first2=Harriet |last3=Massoudi |first3=Arash |title=Ex-Obama adviser leads Lazard quest for bigger share of dealmaking |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7ddb24a4-fef3-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47 |work=The Financial Times |date=November 13, 2019}}</ref> As CEO, Orszag led Lazard's team of advisors who worked with Argentina's government during the country's $65 billion sovereign debt restructuring in 2020.
