==Education and career==
Jamison began her study of clinical psychology at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the late 1960s, receiving both [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degrees in 1971. She continued on at UCLA, receiving a [[Candidate of Philosophy|C.Phil.]] in 1973 and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1975, and became a faculty member at the university. She went on to found and direct the school's [[Mood disorder|Affective Disorders]] Clinic, a large teaching and research facility for outpatient treatment. She also studied [[zoology]] and [[neurophysiology]] as an undergraduate at the [[University of St. Andrews]] in Scotland.

After several years as a tenured professor at UCLA, Jamison was offered a position as Assistant Professor and then Professor of Psychiatry at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] School of Medicine.

==Academic contributions==
Her latest book, ''Robert Lowell:  Setting the River on Fire'' was a Pulitzer Prize Finalist for Biography in 2018.

Her book ''Manic-Depressive Illness'', first published in 1990 and co-authored with psychiatrist [[Frederick K. Goodwin]] is considered a classic textbook on bipolar disorder. The Acknowledgements section states that Goodwin "received unrestricted educational grants to support
the production of this book from [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]], [[AstraZeneca]], [[Bristol Meyers Squibb]], [[Forest Laboratories|Forest]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen]], [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], and [[Sanofi]]", but that although Jamison has "received occasional lecture honoraria
from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Eli Lilly" she "has received no research support from any pharmaceutical or biotechnology company" and donates her royalties to a non-profit foundation.

Her seminal works among laypeople are her memoir ''An Unquiet Mind'', which details her experience with severe [[mania]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]], and ''Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide'', providing historical, religious, and cultural responses to [[suicide]], as well as the relationship between [[mental illness]] and suicide. In ''Night Falls Fast'', Jamison dedicates a chapter to American public policy and public opinion as it relates to suicide. Her second memoir, ''Nothing Was the Same'', examines her relationship with her second husband, the psychiatrist [[Richard Jed Wyatt]], who was Chief of the Neuropsychiatry Branch of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] until his death in 2002.

In her study ''Exuberance: The Passion for Life'', she cites research that suggests that 15 percent of people who could be diagnosed as bipolar may never actually become [[depression (mood)|depressed]]; in effect, they are permanently "high" on life. She mentions President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as an example.

''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'' is Jamison's exploration of how bipolar disorder can run in artistic or high-achieving families. As an example, she cites [[Lord Byron]] and his relatives.

Jamison wrote ''An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness'' in part to help clinicians see what patients find helpful in therapy. J. Wesley Boyd, an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry at Tufts University's School of Medicine, wrote, "Jamison's description [of the debt she owed her psychiatrist] illustrates the importance of merely being present for our patients and not trying to soothe them with platitudes or promises of a better future."<ref>Boyd, J. Wesley. "Stories of Illness: Authorship in Medicine" Psychiatry, Vol. 60 Winter 1997: 352. Print</ref>

==Personal life==
Jamison has said she is an "exuberant" person who longs for peace and tranquility but in the end prefers "tumultuousness coupled to iron discipline" to a "stunningly boring life."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-247.htm |title=Kay Jamison Interview |access-date=2005-11-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119033108/http://mcmanweb.com/article-247.htm |archive-date=2005-11-19 }}</ref> In ''An Unquiet Mind'', she concluded:

<blockquote>I long ago abandoned the notion of a life without storms, or a world without dry and killing seasons. Life is too complicated, too constantly changing, to be anything but what it is. And I am, by nature, too mercurial to be anything but deeply wary of the grave unnaturalness involved in any attempt to exert too much control over essentially uncontrollable forces. There will always be propelling, disturbing elements, and they will be there until, as Lowell put it, the watch is taken from the wrist. It is, at the end of the day, the individual moments of restlessness, of bleakness, of strong persuasions and maddened enthusiasms, that inform one's life, change the nature and direction of one's work, and give final meaning and color to one's loves and friendships.<ref>Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness {{ISBN|1447275284}}, Publisher: Picador (1 Jan. 2015)</ref></blockquote>

Jamison was born to Dr. Marshall Verdine Jamison (1916–2012), an officer in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and Mary Dell Temple Jamison (1916–2007).<ref>{{cite web|title=Marshall Verdine Jamison |url=http://www.northumberlandecho.com/?p=2136 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130030315/http://www.northumberlandecho.com/?p=2136 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 30, 2013 |access-date=September 22, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="An_Unquiet_Mind" /> Jamison's father, and many others in his family, had bipolar disorder.<ref name="An_Unquiet_Mind" />

As a result of Jamison's military background, she grew up in many different places, including [[Florida]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[California]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]. She has two older siblings, a brother and a sister, who are three years and half a year older, respectively.<ref name="An_Unquiet_Mind" /> Her niece is writer [[Leslie Jamison]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.graywolfpress.org/blogs/video-leslie-jamison-and-kay-redfield-jamison-conversation-politics-prose |title=Video: Leslie Jamison and Kay Redfield Jamison in Conversation at Politics & Prose |date=April 17, 2014 |access-date=October 8, 2017 |work=Graywolf Press}}</ref> Jamison's interest in science and medicine began at a young age and was fostered by her parents. She worked as a [[candy striper]] at the hospital on the [[Andrews Air Force Base]] .<ref name="An_Unquiet_Mind" />

Jamison moved to California during adolescence, and soon thereafter began to struggle with bipolar disorder. She continued to struggle in college at UCLA. At first she wanted to become a doctor, but because of her increasing manic episodes she decided she could not maintain the rigorous discipline needed for medical school. She then found her calling in psychology. She flourished in this field and was extremely interested in mood disorders. Despite her studies, Jamison did not realize she was bipolar until three months into her first job as a professor in UCLA's Department of Psychology. After her diagnosis, she was put on [[lithium (medication)]], a common drug used to contain moods. At times, she would refuse the medication because it impaired her motor skills, but after a greater depression she decided to continue to take it. Jamison once attempted suicide by overdosing on lithium during a severe depressive episode.

Jamison is an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]],<ref>{{harvnb|Jamison|1999|p=310}}</ref> and was married to her first husband, Alain André Moreau, an artist, during her graduate school years.<ref name="An_Unquiet_Mind">{{harvnb|Jamison|1995|pages=57, 222}}</ref> She then married Dr. Richard Wyatt in 1994;<ref>{{harvnb|Jamison|2009|p=32}}</ref> they remained married until his death in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Connor |first=Anahad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/12/us/richard-j-wyatt-63-is-dead-led-studies-of-schizophrenia.html |title=Richard J.

Their romance is detailed in her memoir ''Nothing Was the Same''.

In 2010, Jamison married Thomas Traill, a cardiology professor at Johns Hopkins.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas-Lester |first=Avis |url=http://views.washingtonpost.com/on-success/what-it-takes/2009/12/a_career-altering_mental_illness.html|title=A psychologist's career-altering mental illness |newspaper=Washington Post|year=2010 |access-date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>
