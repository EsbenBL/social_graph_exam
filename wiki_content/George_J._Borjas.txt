== Personal life and education ==
Borjas was born in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], on October 15, 1950. He immigrated to the [[United States]] in October 1962 with his mother. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in economics and mathematics from [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)|St. Peter's College]] in 1971. He then completed his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in economics from [[Columbia University]] in 1974. He completed his [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Columbia University]] in 1975 for thesis titled ''Job Investment, Labor Mobility and Earnings''.<ref name="CV">{{cite web|url=http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~GBorjas/VITA.pdf |title=Curriculum Vitae of George J. Borjas |access-date=2008-06-30 |publisher=Harvard University |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725015602/http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~GBorjas/VITA.pdf |archive-date=2008-07-25 }}</ref>

He is married and has three children.<ref name="CV"/>

== Academic career ==
Borjas became an assistant professor of economics at [[Queens College, City University of New York]] from 1975 to 1977. He was a post-doctoral fellow at the Department of Economics, [[University of Chicago]] from 1977 to 1978. He was also a Senior Research Analyst, [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] from 1972 to 1978.<ref name="CV"/>

He joined the faculty at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1980 and remained there for ten years. He then became a professor at the [[University of California, San Diego]] from 1990 to 1995. He joined the faculty at [[Harvard University]] in 1995.<ref name="CV"/> He is a professor of economics at Harvard University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/gborjas/home|title=George Borjas|website=scholar.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>

== Work ==
Borjas was called "America’s leading immigration economist" by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. He is an influential figure in the debate on immigration and his research on the economic impact of immigration plays a central role in the debate over immigration policy in the United States.<ref name="Davis"/>

He has written many books and has published more than 100 articles in books and scholarly journals, including the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', and the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]''.<ref name="Bio of Borjas"/> His most recent book is ''We Wanted Workers: Unraveling the Immigration Narrative'' (W. W. Norton & Company, 2016).

With an application to the self-selection of migrants, Borjas provided the first formalization of the [[Roy model]].<ref>	Borjas, G. J. (1987): Self-Selection and the Earnings of Immigrants. American Economic Review 77(4), pp. 531-553.</ref>

== Controversy ==

=== Jason Richwine ===
Borjas was the primary  advisor to [[Jason Richwine]], whose Harvard dissertation concluded that Latino immigrants to the U.S. are and will remain less intelligent than "native whites." Borjas claimed that he "played no role in topic selection or forming the research agenda" for Richwine's dissertation, but some social science scholars noted it could be problematic for a dissertation advisor to fail to challenge a student's topic selection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/the-inside-story-of-the-harvard-dissertation-that-became-too-racist-for-heritage-3a14238f662e/

=== Mariel boatlift research ===
In 2017, an analysis of Borjas' study on the effects of the [[Mariel boatlift]] concluded that Borjas' findings "may simply be spurious" and that his theory of the economic impact of the boatlift "doesn't fit the evidence."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/6/23/15855342/immigrants-wages-trump-economics-mariel-boatlift-hispanic-cuban |title=There's no evidence that immigrants hurt any American workers |date=23 June 2017 |access-date=2017-08-03 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}</ref> A number of other studies concluded the opposite of what Borjas' study had found.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-16/immigrants-don-t-steal-from-americans-paychecks|title=Immigrants Don't Steal From Americans' Paychecks|date=2017-06-16|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-20}}</ref> Borjas denied that he had misconstrued the data, calling the controversy "fake news."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-great-mariel-boatlift-experiment-1497630468
 |title=The Great Mariel Boatlift Debate: Does Immigration Lower Wages? |access-date=2017-08-03 |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=16 June 2017 |last1=Leubsdorf |first1=Ben }}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article162682623.html|title=Controversial Mariel study puts Cuban-American professor in middle of storm|work=miamiherald|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref> Borjas furthermore suggested that one of the economists, [[Michael Clemens]], whose study challenged Borjas' was motivated by the political bias of "Silicon Valley" philanthropists who contribute to the [[Center for Global Development]] where Clemens works, accusing Clemens of being a paid [[shill]] of "open-borders plutocrats", and saying that "they wouldn’t buy or commission research that didn’t fit their priors."<ref name=":1" /> Nobel laureates [[Abhijit Banerjee|Abhijit V. Banerjee]] and [[Esther Duflo]] wrote of the debate that Borjas's analysis omitted comparisons to relevant groups for no clear reason.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Banerjee|first1=Abhijt|title=Good Economics for Hard Times|last2=Duflo|first2=Esther|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2019|quote=a subsequent reanalysis showed these new results once again get reversed when data about Hispanic high school dropouts (who would seem to be the most obvious people to compare Cuban migrants with, but are for some reason omitted by Borjas) and women (again omitted by Borjas for no clear reason) are included}}</ref>

In August 2017, the Trump administration, while defending [[RAISE Act|its plan]] to reduce levels of legal [[immigration to the United States]] by 50%, cited Borjas' research on the Mariel boatlift as evidence that low-skilled immigration reduced wages for American workers.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/08/do-low-skilled-immigrants-negatively-impact-wages-/|title=Do low-skilled immigrants hurt American workers?|work=PolitiFact|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4888381/immigration-act-mariel-boatlift-history/|title=The White House Used This Moment as Proof the U.S. Should Cut Immigration. Its Real History Is More Complicated|last=Jr|first=Julio Capó|website=Time|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> Fact-checkers noted that Borjas' research on the Mariel boatlift was rebutted by other researchers and has received "major criticisms".<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/04/541321716/fact-check-have-low-skilled-immigrants-taken-american-jobs|title=FACT CHECK: Have Immigrants Lowered Wages For Blue-Collar American Workers?|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref>

That same month in ''The Atlantic'' when asked about the academic community's suppression of data showing immigration's potential costs, Borjas said there's “a lot of self-censorship among young social scientists.” Donald Davis, an economist and immigration advocate, responded stating, “George and I come out on different sides of policy on immigration, but I agree that there are aspects of discussion in academia that don’t get sort of full view if you come to the wrong conclusion.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/the-democrats-immigration-mistake/528678/|title=How the Democrats Lost Their Way on Immigration|last=Beinart|first=Peter|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

The extent to which immigration is a detriment or boon to the American economy continues to be hotly debated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/04/541321716/fact-check-have-low-skilled-immigrants-taken-american-jobs|title=FACT CHECK: Have Immigrants Lowered Wages For Blue-Collar American Workers?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}</ref>

=== Economic Job Market Rumors forum ===
After a peer-review scandal was revealed on the website, in June 2016, Borjas praised the discourse on the Economics Job Market Rumors as being "refreshing": "There’s still hope for mankind when many of the posts written by a bunch of over-educated young social scientists illustrate a throwing off of the shackles of political correctness and reflect mundane concerns that more normal human beings share: prestige, sex, money, landing a job, sex, professional misconduct, sex..."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/upshot/evidence-of-a-toxic-environment-for-women-in-economics.html|title=Evidence of a Toxic Environment for Women in Economics|last=Wolfers|first=Justin|date=2017-08-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gborjas.org/2016/06/30/a-rant-on-peer-review/ |title=A rant on peer review |access-date=2017-08-18 |publisher=George Borja's blog}}</ref> A 2017 paper found evidence of outright hostility towards women on the website.<ref name=":0" /> When asked about the paper, Borjas said, "While there is some value in that forum, there is also a great deal that is offensive and disturbing. The problem is I’m not sure exactly where to draw line."<ref name=":0" /> According to [[J. Bradford DeLong|Brad DeLong]], "the only economics professor of any ideology or university I can recall ever praising EJMR is George Borjas."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://equitablegrowth.org/equitablog/should-read-justin-wolfers-evidence-of-a-toxic-environment-for-women-in-economics/|title=Must: Justin Wolfers: Evidence of a Toxic Environment for Women in Economics {{!}} Equitable Growth|website=Equitable Growth|date=18 August 2017|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-20}}</ref>

== Political views ==
The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' describes him as "avowed conservative".<ref name=":4" /> According to the ''Miami Herald'', Borjas, himself an immigrant, "supports increased restrictions on immigration, but he doesn’t believe a wall — built by Mexico or anyone else — does any good. He opposes the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants as inhumane. And he advocates a tax on businesses — high-tech, agricultural and all the rest — that profit from cheaper immigrant wages, and giving that money to Americans displaced by the immigrants."<ref name=":4" />

== Honors ==
Borjas was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1998 and a fellow of the Society of Labor Economists in 2004. He was also a member of the Council of Economic Advisors for the [[Governor of California]] from 1993 to 1998, of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Panel on the Demographic and Economic Impact of Immigration from 1995 to 1997, and chaired the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation's]] Committee of Visitors for the Economics Program in 1996.<ref name="Bio of Borjas"/>

In 2011 he was named co-winner of the [[IZA Prize in Labor Economics]].<ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/awards/borjas-iza-prize George Borjas Named Co-Winner of 2011 IZA Prize in Labor Economics] Harvard Kennedy School, July 21, 2011. Retrieved December 1, 2012</ref>
