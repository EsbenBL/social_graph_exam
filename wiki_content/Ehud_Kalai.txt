'''Ehud Kalai''' is a prominent [[Israeli American]] [[game theorist]] and [[mathematical]] [[economist]] known for his contributions to the field of [[game theory]] and its interface with [[economics]], [[social choice]], [[computer science]] and [[operations research]].  He was the James J. O’Connor Distinguished Professor of Decision and Game Sciences at [[Northwestern University]], 1975-2017, and currently is a Professor Emeritus of Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences.

==Biography==
Born in [[Mandatory Palestine]] on December 7, 1942, Kalai moved to the US in 1963.  He received his AB in mathematics from the [[University of California Berkeley]] (1967) and an MS (1971) and a PhD (1972) in statistics and mathematics from [[Cornell University]].  After serving as an assistant professor of statistics at [[Tel Aviv University]] (1972–75), he was hired by [[Northwestern University]] to establish a research group in game theory.  He is the founding director of the Kellogg Center of Game Theory and Economic Behavior and the executive director of the [[Nancy L. Schwartz Memorial Lecture]] series.

Kalai is the founding Editor of ''[[Games and Economic Behavior]]'', the leading journal in game theory.  With Robert J. Aumann, Kalai founded the [[Game Theory Society]] and served as its president from 2003 to 2006.  He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], of the [[Econometric Society]],<ref>''[http://www.econometricsociety.org/fellows.asp Fellows of the Econometric Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210090215/http://www.econometricsociety.org/fellows.asp |date=December 10, 2008 }}'' (March 2008).

Since 2008, the [[Game Theory Society]] has awarded the [[Kalai Prize]] for outstanding papers at the interface of [[game theory]] and [[computer science]]. The prize was named after Kalai in recognition of his contributions to bridging these two fields.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gametheorysociety.org/about/|title=Game Theory Society|website=www.gametheorysociety.org|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref>

==Selected Contributions==
In cooperative game theory, the '''Kalai-Smorodinsky solution''' reopened the study of bargaining by showing that the long unchallenged [[Nash solution]] is not unique.  He later axiomatized the '''Egalitarian solution''' to bargaining problems and, with Dov Samet, formulated its extension to general (NTU) cooperative games, unifying it with the Shapley (TU) Value.<br />
In non cooperative game theory, the Kalai and Lehrer model of '''rational learning''' showed that rational players with truth-compatible beliefs eventually learn to play [[Nash equilibria]] of repeated games.  In particular, in Bayesian equilibria of repeated games all relevant private information eventually becomes common knowledge.   Kalai's work on '''large games''' showed that the equilibria of [[Bayesian game]]s  with many players are structurally robust, thus large games escape major pitfalls in game-theoretic modeling.<br />
Kalai is also known for seminal collaborative research on  '''flow games''' and totally balanced games; '''strategic complexity''' and its implications in economics and political systems; '''arbitration, strategic delegation and commitments'''; extensions of Arrow’s [[Impossibility Theorem]] in social choice; '''competitive service speed''' in queues; and on rational '''strategic polarization''' in group decision making.
