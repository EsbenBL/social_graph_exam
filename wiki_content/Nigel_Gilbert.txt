==Career==
A [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] engineering graduate ([[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]]), he turned to the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] for his PhD under the direction of [[Mike Mulkay|Michael Mulkay]].  He was a lecturer at the [[University of York]] (1974–76) and then joined the [[University of Surrey]] where he became a professor in the Department of Sociology in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web

At the University of Surrey he founded the Social and Computer Sciences research group in 1984 with a grant from the [[Alvey Programme]]. The group focused on applying social science to the design of intelligent knowledge-based systems. Later he established the Centre for Research in Social Simulation (1997),<ref>{{Cite web

==Work==

===Sociology of scientific knowledge===
Gilbert and Mulkay (1984) is a key contribution on the use of [[discourse analysis]] methods in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> By applying discourse analysis to extensive qualitative data on a scientific dispute in the field of chemistry, Gilbert and Mulkay account for the social processes that underpin knowledge production, especially when consensus has not yet been established within the scientific community.

===Secondary analysis of large government datasets===
With [[Sara Arber]], he was a pioneer in the use for academic analysis of computer files of survey data collected by the [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]], a [[Secondary data|data source]] that has now become commonplace in sociology.<ref>{{cite journal

===Access to social security information===
The regulations determining what claimants of UK welfare benefits are entitled to (e.g. [[income support]], [[tax credits]], [[Disability Living Allowance]]) are complicated and often very difficult for claimants to apprehend unaided.  With the growing availability of personal computers in the 1980s, he realised that an interactive program, designed for claimants themselves to use, could be helpful.<ref>{{cite journal

This work also contributed to understanding the interface requirements for publicly accessible computer systems, using graphical interfaces and, later, speech dialogue interfaces

===Social simulation===
Nigel Gilbert is one of the founders of modern [[computational sociology]], a discipline that merges social science research with [[Social simulation|simulation techniques]] with the goal of modelling complex policy issues and fundamental aspects of human societies. His first work in this area was a project on modelling the emergence of organised society in prehistoric France, with Jim Doran

He and Stuart Peters created a journal management system, [https://web.archive.org/web/20200201154849/https://www.epress.ac.uk// epress], originally to make running ''Sociological Research Online'' and ''JASSS'' easier, but now available commercially and used by about 40 journals.

In 2016, he became the Director of a newly established Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus (CECAN)

Beside his research activity, he has served on a number of government and national committees: as the Deputy Chairman of the Manufacturing, Production and Business Processes Foresight Panel (1994–99), Deputy Chairman of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]'s Research Priorities Board (1997–2000) and on the Advisory Group of the Foresight Intelligent Infrastructures Project,<ref>{{Cite web
