==History==

===Founding===
[[File:American University Glover Gate.jpg|thumb|left|The front gate at American University]]
[[File:American University in 1916.jpg|thumb|American University in 1916]]
The American University was established in the District of Columbia by an Act of Congress on December 5, 1892, primarily due to the efforts of Methodist bishop [[John Fletcher Hurst]], who aimed to create an institution that could train future [[public servants]]. Hurst also chose the university's site, which was the rural periphery of the District. After more than three decades devoted principally to securing financial support, the university was officially dedicated on May 15, 1914, with its first instructions beginning October of that year when 28 students were enrolled, 19 of whom were graduates and the remainder special students not candidates for a degree. The First Commencement, at which no degrees were awarded, was held on June 2, 1915. The Second Annual Commencement was held the following year and saw the awarding of the first degrees: one master's degree and two doctor's degrees. AU admitted both women and African Americans, which was uncommon in higher education at the time. Among its first 28 students were five women, while an African American doctoral student was admitted in 1915.

[[File:AU McKineyHall ACC.jpeg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Army Chemical Corps]]
Shortly after these early commencement ceremonies, classes were interrupted by war. During [[World War I]], the university allowed the U.S. military to use some of its grounds for testing. In 1917, the U.S. military divided American University into two segments, [[Camp American University]] and [[Camp Leach]]. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program and the site of chemical weapons testing;<ref name="Gross">{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Chemical Warfare: From the European Battlefield to the American Laboratory|journal=Distillations|date=Spring 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemical-warfare-from-the-european-battlefield-to-the-american-laboratory|access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref> this required a major cleanup effort in the 1990s. Camp Leach was home to advanced research, development, and testing of modern camouflage techniques. {{As of|2014}}, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] was still removing ordnance including [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]].

Instruction was first offered only at the graduate level, in accordance with the plan of the founders. This changed in 1925 with the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts (subsequently named the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]), which offered the first undergraduate degrees and programs. What is now the [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]] was founded in 1934,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spa.american.edu/pages.php?ID=12 |title=The School of Public Affairs at American University |publisher=Spa.american.edu |access-date=July 23, 2012}}</ref> partly to educate future federal employees in new approaches to [[public administration]] introduced by the [[New Deal]]; during the event commemorating its launch, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] stressed cooperation between the school and his administration.

AU's relationship with the U.S. government continued during [[World War II]], when the campus hosted the U.S. Navy Bomb Disposal School and a [[United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve)|WAVE]] barracks. For AU's role in these wartime efforts, the [[Victory ship]] [[SS American Victory|SS ''American Victory'']] was named in its honor.

===Post-war expansion (1949–1990)===
[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|President [[John F. Kennedy]] delivers the [[wikisource:A Strategy of Peace|commencement address at American University]], June 10, 1963]]

The post-war period saw considerable growth and restructuring of AU. In 1947, the Washington Semester Program was established, pioneering the concept of 
semester-long internships in the nation's capital. In 1949, the university merged with the [[Washington College of Law]], which began in 1896 as the first law school founded by women and the first coeducational institution for the professional study of law in the District. Shortly after that, three departments were reorganized as schools: the School of Business Administration in 1955 (subsequently named the Robert P. and Arlene R. Kogod College of Business Administration and in 1999 renamed the [[Kogod School of Business]]); the School of Government and Public Administration in 1957; and the [[School of International Service]] in 1958.

In the early 1960s, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operated the [[Federally funded research and development centers|FFRDC]] [[Project Camelot|Special Operations Research Office]] as a think tank at American University. The government abandoned the think tank after its research was criticized as imperialistic by the general public.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} AU's political involvement was furthered by President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Spring 1963 [[American University speech|commencement address]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/BWC7I4C9QUmLG9J6I8oy8w.aspx |title=Commencement Address at American University, June 10, 1963 |date=June 10, 1963 |website=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> In the speech, Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and to reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear war during that juncture of the [[Cold War]].

From 1965 to 1977, the College of Continuing Education existed as a degree-granting college responsible for on- and off-campus adult education programs. The Lucy Webb Hayes School of Nursing provided an undergraduate study in Nursing from 1965 until 1988. In 1972, the School of Government and Public Administration, the School of International Service, the Center for Technology and Administration, and the Center for the Administration of Justice (subsequently named the School of Justice) were incorporated into the College of Public and International Affairs.

The university bought the Immaculata Campus in 1986 to alleviate space problems. This would later become Tenley Campus.

In 1986, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation Center began. Financed with $5 million from and named for Saudi Arabian Trustee [[Adnan Khashoggi]], the building was intended to update athletics facilities and provide a new arena, as well as a parking garage and office space for administrative services. Costing an estimated $19 million, the building represented the largest construction project to date but met protest by both faculty and students to the university's use of Khashoggi's name on the building due to his involvement in the international arms trade.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/01/11/american-u-donation-stirs-debate/a8487a86-1788-4a79-ab8f-16e02c03df43/ |title=AMERICAN U. DONATION STIRS DEBATE |last=Isikoff |first=Michael |date=January 11, 1987 |newspaper=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref>

In 1988, the College of Public and International Affairs was reorganized to create two free-standing schools: the School of International Service and the School of Public Affairs, incorporating the School of Government and Public Administration and the School of Justice. That same year, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center was completed while the [[Iran–Contra affair|Iran–Contra Affair]] controversy was at its height, although his name remained on the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation in the mid to late 1990s.

===Present day (1990–)===

The [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]] became independent from the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] in 1993.

In 1997, [[American University of Sharjah]], the only coeducational, liberal arts university in the [[United Arab Emirates]], signed a two-year contract with AU to provide academic management. This contract has since been extended multiple times through August 2009. A team of senior AU administrators relocated to [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] to assist in the establishment of the university and guide it through the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] accreditation process.

In fall 2005, the new [[Katzen Arts Center]] opened.

[[Benjamin Ladner]] was suspended from his position as president of the university on August 24, 2005, pending an investigation into possible misuse of university funds for his personal expenses. University faculty passed votes of no confidence in President Ladner on September 26.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/26/AR2005092601801.html |title=AU Faculty Members Vote No Confidence in Ladner |last1=Kinzie |first1=Susan |last2=Strauss |first2=Valerie |date=September 27, 2005 |newspaper=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> On October 10, 2005, the board of trustees of American University decided that Ladner would not return to American University as its president.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/education/president-of-american-university-agrees-to-resign.html |title=President of American University Agrees to Resign |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |date=October 25, 2005 |website=The New York Times |language=en-US |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> Dr. [[Cornelius M.

In 2017, Taylor Dumpson became AU's first female black student body president. In her first full day in office, bananas were found at three places on campus, hanging from noose-like ropes, and marked with the initials "AKA", which are also the initials of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.  The university considered the incident to be racist, and then-president Neil Kerwin called it a "cowardly, despicable act." In May 2018, the school said it had exhausted "all credible leads" about who had perpetrated the incident.<ref>Larimer, Susan (May 2, 2017) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/05/02/a-cowardly-despicable-act-american-u-president-responds-to-banana-incident-on-schools-campus/ "Man who harassed black student online must deliver ‘sincere’ apology, renounce white supremacy"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref><ref name="larimer" />

Also in May 2018, Dumpson filed a lawsuit against several people, including [[Andrew Anglin]], the founder of the [[neo-Nazi]] website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''. She accused Anglin of organizing a racist and sexist trolling campaign against her.<ref>{{cite news|title=School's First Black Student President was the Target of a Racist Attack.

A federal judge ordered the defendants to pay more than $101,000 in compensatory damages, $500,000 in punitive damages, and more than $124,000 in attorney's fees. Dumpson also entered a restraining order against him. Although Dumpson and Anglin have not settled, she settled in December 2018 with one of the people who harassed her, a man from Oregon who was required to apologize, to renounce white supremacy, to stop trolling and [[doxing]] online, and to provide information to and cooperate with authorities in the prosecution of white supremacists.<ref name="larimer">Larimer, Sarah (December 21, 2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/12/21/man-who-harassed-black-student-online-must-deliver-sincere-apology-renounce-white-supremacy/ "Man who harassed black student online must deliver ‘sincere’ apology, renounce white supremacy"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref>

==Campuses==
[[File:Eric Freidheim Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|Eric Friedheim Quadrangle]]
American University has two contiguous campuses for academics and student housing: the main campus on Massachusetts Avenue and the East Campus on Nebraska Avenue. The [[Washington College of Law]] has since been moved to the site of the [[Tenley Campus]] located in [[Tenleytown]]. Additionally, AU owns several other buildings in the [[Tenleytown]], [[Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.|Spring Valley]], the East Campus in [[Wesley Heights]], and [[American University Park]] areas.

[[File:American University.webm|thumb|left|American University]]The first design for the campus was done by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. However, it was significantly modified over time due to financial constraints.

===Tenley campus===
{{Main|Tenley Campus}}
[[File:CapitolHallTenley.jpg|thumb|right|Capital Hall, Tenley Campus, American University]]
Formerly the Immaculata School, [[Tenley Campus]] is located half a mile east of the main campus and was purchased by American University in 1987 specifically for the Washington Semester program. Tenley Campus used to be home to the Washington Semester and Washington Mentorship Program students, which featured housing primarily for international and transfer students. Before the construction of the new Washington College of Law, Tenley Campus was home to the main offices of: the [[School of Professional & Extended Studies]], including the Washington Semester Program, University Marketing and Publications, and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. During the summer, the residence halls were used to house students in the Washington Semester - Summer Internship Program.

Since 2016, Tenley Campus has been home to American University's law school, the [[Washington College of Law]]. Over several years, former dormitory halls and academic buildings were torn down and replaced with many newer, more contemporary academic buildings that now house the Washington College of Law. The law school's reputation has fallen since construction began on the new campus. Graduates are reportedly saddled with enormous amounts of debt, and in 2014 only 42% of graduates held jobs that required they pass the Bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13068976/why-did-american-universitys-law-school-plunge-in-the-rankings|title=Why Did American University's Law School Plunge in the Rankings?|website=Washingtoncitypaper.com|date=August 21, 2014|access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>

The university is composed of eight divisions, referred to as colleges or schools, which house its academic programs. Except for WCL, undergraduate and graduate courses are housed within the same division, although organized into different programs.

American University is also home to a unique program known as the Washington Semester Program. This program partners with institutions around the world to bring students to AU for a semester. The program operates as part of the [[School of Professional & Extended Studies]]. The program combines two seminar courses three days a week with a two-day-per-week internship that gives students a unique look at Washington, D. C. The program is unique because the courses are not typical lecture courses; instead, speakers from various sectors of a particular field are invited to address the class, often from different perspectives.<ref>[http://www.washingtonsemester.com/ "Washington Semester at American University"]. Retrieved February 5, 2007.</ref>

In the ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' survey of college presidents' salaries for 2007–08, President [[Cornelius M. Kerwin]] was fifth highest in the nation with a compensation of $1.4 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=De Vise|first=Daniel|date=November 2, 2009|title=Ex-president of GWU lead in pay survey|page=B1|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

[[File:LibraryRevamp.jpg|thumb|left|The Jack I. and Dorothy G. Bender Library and Learning Resources Center sits at the top of the Eric Friedheim Quadrangle.]]

The Jack I. and Dorothy G. Bender Library and Learning Resources Center is the main library facility for the campus. A branch Music Library is located in the Katzen Art Center. The Pence Law Library, part of AU's Washington College of Law, operates separately from the main library system. The University Library is part of the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC), which includes seven other libraries. The WRLC operates a consortium loan service between member institutions and has a shared collections site in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

The Bender Library provides various individual and group study spaces. It includes a Curriculum Materials Center, a New Media Center, Graduate Research Center, classrooms, and a café. About 160 public computer workstations are available throughout the Bender building. Researchers also may borrow laptops, chargers, tablets, and other electronic devices. In October 2012, the library acquired a large poster printer which researchers may use for presentations and other academic purposes.

The Library's Archives and Special Collections houses unique and rare materials and information on the institution's history. The University Archives is the repository for papers and other documents, including sound recordings and photographs, spanning more than a century of the university's history. Special Collections houses rare materials. Among the more important holdings are the [[Artemas Martin]] collection of mathematical texts, the Charles Nelson Spinks collection of artistic and historical works of Japan, the Irwin M. Heine collection of literary works, and Christopher Johnson collection of William Faulkner books.

=== Feminist identity ===
{{peacock|date=April 2021}}
American University's feminist student-run clubs include AUSG Women's Initiative (WI), the first-generation women student-run organization which "advocates for AU by creating responsive programming addressing gender & sexuality based issues.” Another is Sister Sister AU. The mission is described as “building a community for women of the African Diaspora at American University.” Black Girls Vote is "dedicated to the engagement, education, and empowerment of collegiate women through the electoral process."

American University's institutional feminist organizations include the Women and Politics Institute in the School of Public Affairs. The institute announces its mission on its website as "to close the gender gap in political leadership and provide young women with academic and practical training that encourages them to become involved in the political process and facilitates research by faculty and students that enhances their understanding of the challenges and opportunities women face in the political arena." The department of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) within the College of Arts and Sciences is "an interdisciplinary program encompassing feminist studies, masculinity studies, and sexuality studies. The program is committed to a multicultural curriculum that sustains and integrates diverse perspectives." Students who major or minor in WGSS gain experience off-campus in the nation's capital through an internship placement in an organization or agency whose mission embraces some aspect of women's/gender/sexuality studies. WGSS has both undergraduate programs and graduate programs which empower feminist philosophy at the university.

American University's discrimination and sexual harassment policy regarding Title IX rights is "to prohibit sex- or gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual violence, relationship violence, and stalking. American University is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive environment for all students and employees. American University does not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, personal appearance, gender identity and expression, family responsibilities, political affiliation, source of income, veteran status, an individual's genetic information or any other bases under federal or local laws (collectively "Protected Bases") in its programs and activities."  Although the policy of American University and the federal civil rights law is strict, The Office of Advocacy Services for Interpersonal and Sexual Violence (OASIS) "provides free and confidential victim advocacy services for American University students who are impacted by all forms of sexual violence either directly or indirectly."  The Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI) is dedicated to enhancing LGBTQ, multicultural, first-generation, and women's experiences on campus.

In addition to these feminist activities and facilities on AU's campus, AU is home to several women suffragist alumni such as [[Alice Paul]], one of the prominent leaders and strategists of the suffrage campaign. In 1896, The Washington College of Law was founded for women. In 1915, 5 of AU's first 28 students were women.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
