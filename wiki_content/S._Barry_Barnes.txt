'''S. Barry Barnes''' (born 27 March 1943) was Professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Exeter]].

Barnes worked at the 'Science Studies Unit' at the [[University of Edinburgh]] with [[David Bloor]] from the 1970s through the early 1990s, where they developed the [[strong programme]] in the [[Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]]. He moved to the sociology department in Exeter in 1992. Barnes is known for his naturalistic approach to science, a view elaborated in his book ''Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory'' (1974). He advocated a post-[[Kuhnian]] approach to scientific knowledge, and suggested that philosophers, historians and other researchers study scientific practice in a variety of fields as cultural traditions whose development could be given causal explanations. In this view conceptual change in normal science is a process unfolding through expert debate and negotiation. This latter perspective was developed in ''T. S. Kuhn and Social Science'' (1982).
