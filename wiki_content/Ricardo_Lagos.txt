'''Ricardo Froilán Lagos Escobar''' ({{IPA-es|riˈkaɾðo fɾojˈlan ˈlaɣos eskoˈβaɾ}}; born 2 March 1938)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latercera.com/politica/noticia/lagos-celebra-80-anos-evento-autoridades-ex-colaboradores/85850/|title=Lagos celebra sus 80 años en evento con autoridades y ex colaboradores|date=March 3, 2018|website=La Tercera}}</ref> is a [[Chile]]an lawyer, economist and [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] politician who served as [[president of Chile]] from 2000 to 2006. During the 1980s he was well-known for his opposition to the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990)|Chilean military dictatorship]] and astounded contemporaries in 1988 by openly denouncing dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] on live television. He served as Minister of Education from 1990 to 1992 and Minister of Public Works from 1994 to 1998 under president Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle before narrowly winning the [[1999–2000 Chilean presidential election|1999-2000 presidential election]] in a [[Two-round system|runoff]] against [[Independent Democrat Union]] (UDI) candidate [[Joaquín Lavín]]. Lagos was the third president from the center-left [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] to have governed Chile since 1990. He was succeeded on March 11, 2006 by Socialist [[Michelle Bachelet]], from the same coalition. From 2007 to 2010 he served as a [[Special Envoy on Climate Change]] for the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].<ref name=UN07b>{{cite web

==Early years==
Lagos was born in [[Santiago, Chile]]. He was the only child of Froilán Lagos Sepúlveda (a farmer who died when his son was eight years old) and Emma Escobar Morales (who died in 2005). He attended primary school at Liceo Experimental Manuel de Salas and high school at the prestigious [[Instituto Nacional]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/chile/president-lagos.htm|title=Ricardo Froilán Lagos Escobar|last=Pike|first=John|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref>

In 1961, Lagos married [[Carmen Weber]], with whom he had two children, Ricardo and Ximena. In 1969, he met [[Luisa Durán]] and they married in 1971. The couple shared the parenting of the children of Lagos' first marriage, the children of Durán's first marriage, Hernán and Alejandro, and their only child together, Francisca.

While in university Ricardo Lagos attended the lectures of historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]] whom he held in high esteem.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Góngora |first1=Álvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |language=es |publisher=Zig-Zag |pages=173–174 }}</ref>

==Academic and diplomatic career==
After obtaining his law degree from the [[University of Chile]] in 1960, Lagos pursued a Ph.D. in Economics from [[Duke University]], which he completed in 1966. During that time he became a visiting professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] political science department until 1965. After his time in North Carolina, he maintained ties with both universities. On his return to Chile, he was employed at the Institute of Economy of the University of Chile directed by Carlos Massad. In 1967, he was named Director of the School of Political and Administrative Sciences, a position he held until 1973, when he became Secretary General of the University of Chile. Lagos subsequently began work as a professor of economics in the School of Law at the University of Chile, and between 1971 and 1972 he was Director of the Institute of Economy. He was later named Director of the Latin American Council of Social Sciences.

During the 1970s, Lagos declared himself an "independent of the [[Left-wing politics|left]]" and abandoned the Radical Party of Chile, which he had joined in 1961, when this party supported [[Jorge Alessandri]]'s government. Although he did not possess much diplomatic experience, he worked with Hernán Santa Cruz as the Chilean delegates to the [[United Nations]] and presented an outstanding speech on the international financial crisis. During the speech, he strongly criticized the decision of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] to [[Nixon shock|suspend the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold]], a measure that would end in the rounding up the Asian crisis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}} In 1972, President [[Salvador Allende]] appointed Lagos as the Chilean ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]], but the appointment was never ratified by [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ricardo-Lagos|title=Ricardo Lagos {{!}} president of Chile|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}</ref> As a Regional Director of the training program of post graduate studies in social sciences, he was later put in charge of Project [[UNESCO]], of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) in [[Buenos Aires]]. As a public servant he also served Chile as a United Nations delegate with rank of ambassador at the 26th [[United Nations General Assembly]]. In addition, he was a delegate to the UN's 3rd Conference of Commerce and Development ([[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]).

Soon after the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup d'état]], he and his family were sent into exile in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], where he took the position of Secretary General of the [[Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences]] (FLACSO). He moved for a year to the United States, where he became visiting professor of the William R. Kenan chair for Latin American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1975, he worked as a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme.

Lagos returned to Chile in 1978, and worked for the Regional Program of Employment of the United Nations, PREALC. During the implementation of policies imposed by the [[International Monetary Fund]] his mission was to advise all the governments in the South American continent on the matter of employment.

==Political career==
During the 1980s, Lagos assumed a fundamental role in the fight for the recovery of democracy. In addition to being one of the leaders of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]], he became President of the Democratic Alliance, a force that grouped the majority of the democratic parties opposing the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. In 1983, he decided to leave his position as international civil employee in the United Nations. In December of that year, he became president of the Democratic Alliance. In 1987, as the president of the Committee of the Left for Free Elections, he called on all citizens and parties to enroll  in the electoral registries to vote "no" in a 1988 national plebiscite on whether Pinochet should be allowed to remain president of Chile.

Lagos became the undisputed leader of Pinochet's opponents after appearing in [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]]'s first political debate show since the 1973 coup d'état, ''De cara al país'' (towards the country), where he stated; "With the triumph of "[[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|No]]", the country will prevent General Pinochet from being 25 years in power, it will mark the start of the end of the dictatorship." Lagos then looked directly into the camera and accusingly raised his index finger to say directly to all viewers: {{blockquote|''General Pinochet has not been honest with the country... I will remind you, General Pinochet, that on the day of the [[1980 Chilean constitutional referendum|1980 plebiscite]] you said that "President Pinochet would not be a candidate in 1989". ... And now, you promise the country another eight years, with [[Chile under Pinochet#Human rights violations|tortures, murders, and human rights violations]]. It seems to me inadmissible, that a Chilean can have so much hunger for power, to aim to stay 25 years in power! Never before has a Chilean done so. And you asked me to answer either Yes or No, and that's what I did. Please excuse me, [[Raquel Correa|Raquel]], but I'm speaking after being silent for 15 years already!''|Ricardo Lagos}}

To this day, in Chile the phrase "Lagos' finger" refers to this memorable event; on that night, many people were convinced he would not survive to see the next day.

After the triumph of the ''No'' alternative and the subsequent resignation of Pinochet, Lagos declined to be a candidate for the presidency in spite of being the main leader of the opposition. Instead, he supported [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s candidacy and ran for a seat in the Senate for the Santiago-West district. On December 11, 1989, the day of the elections, he obtained the district's second majority. Nevertheless, he did not win a seat because his alliance's list did not double the vote of the second most voted list; this being a requisite in the Chilean electoral system created by Pinochet.

In 1990, Lagos was named Minister of Education by President Patricio Aylwin. In this position, he initiated reform aimed at increasing equality in access and improving education levels. In June 1993, he pushed for the notion of using primary elections in order to select the [[Concertación]] coalition's candidate for the following presidential election. He lost this primary to [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], who went on to become President of Chile. In 1994, Frei himself named Lagos Minister of Public Works. In this role, he developed an innovating system of road concessions, integrated the private sector in the construction of works and its later operation. During the Frei administration, he continued to be a leader of opinion and was a sure option for the following presidential election. His status was later ratified by his appointment as one of the members of the ''Committee of Twelve Distinguished Members'' of the [[Socialist International]], which he shared with such personalities as [[Felipe González]] and [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]. This committee was set up to process proposals for the renovation of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] thought for the 21st century.

In 1999, Lagos resigned as minister in order to begin his presidential campaign. In the primaries, he defeated senator [[Andrés Zaldívar]], of the [[Christian Democratic Party]] to become the Concertación's sole presidential candidate. In the first round of the presidential election in December of the same year, he defeated right-wing candidate [[Joaquín Lavín]], by only 30,000 votes. Since he failed to obtain an absolute majority, as is required to be elected president, a presidential runoff was subsequently held in January 2000 for the first time ever in Chile. Winning 51.3 percent of the vote, Lagos became the new President of Chile.

During the first year of his term in office, Lagos had to confront a high level of unemployment, generated by the political instability of the region, in a process that began to revert during the end of 2003 . He also promised to keep the budget deficit in check and interest rates and inflation low.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/18/world/man-ricardo-lagos-escobar-chilean-socialist-clinton-blair-mold.html|title=Ricardo Lagos Escobar – A Chilean Socialist in the Clinton-Blair Mold|last=Krauss|first=Clifford|date=2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Lagos enjoyed great popular support, bordering on 50%, and ending around 55-65% during the last six months of his term. He left office with an approval rating of 70%, a historic level of support for any politician in Post-Pinochet Chile The policy of proximity with people was pronounced in the opening of the doors of the [[Palacio de La Moneda]], that had remained closed since the 1973 coup d'état. Lagos's lowest approval rating in office was 40%, a solid approval rating for any Chilean politician post-Pinochet.

Beginning in 2002, his government had to face suspicions of political corruption due to the prosecution of one of his ministers, Carlos Cruz, and of other civil employees of the Public Works Ministry, in the denominated MOP-GATE case. [[Gloria Ana Chevesich]], the judge in charge of this case, discovered that ministers, undersecretaries and other officials of exclusive confidence of the President, received additional payments to their regular remuneration: the so-called "extra payments". This irregularity was acknowledged by Lagos, who specified that the practice had also developed during the governments of Frei Ruiz-Tagle and Aylwin. The official position of the government consisted of not acknowledging the criminal nature of these practices and establishing a legal reform that increased the pay of ministers and undersecretaries of the government, a matter that was approved in its legislative proceeding.

===Foreign relations===
[[File:Ricardo lagos with bush.jpg|thumb|290px|Ricardo Lagos with former [[United States|US]] president [[George W. Bush]]]]

During 2004, Lagos faced a series of tensions in his relation with other South American countries, caused by recurring Bolivian aspirations for [[Atacama border dispute|access to the sea]]. This situation was linked with the power crisis taking place in [[Argentina]], an important supplier of natural gas to Chile. In bilateral meetings between Bolivian President [[Carlos Mesa]] and Argentine President [[Néstor Kirchner]], the former agreed to the sale of Bolivian gas to Argentina under the condition that "not a single gas molecule be sold to Chile". Additionally, the [[Venezuela]]n President, [[Hugo Chávez]], has supported in various instances the Bolivian sea claim, causing a diplomatic impassé between Chile and Venezuela. The tension between both governments had dissipated during July 2004.

===Legacy===

During Lagos' presidency, Free Trade Agreements were signed with the [[European Community]], the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]] (though some of his supporters in the center-left [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] consider that these agreements may have negative effects on the country); the incidence of extreme poverty was significantly reduced;<ref>South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2002</ref> the legal workweek was reduced from 48 to 45 hours;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2010/twerp_925.pdf |title=The Role Of Consumers In Competition |access-date=2020-06-06}}</ref> improvements were made in infrastructure and transport; an unemployment insurance scheme was created; as well as the AUGE health program guaranteeing coverage for a number of medical conditions; the ''Chile Barrio'' housing program; the ''Chile Solidario'' program;<ref>Attacking inequality in the health sector: a synthesis of evidence and tool by Abdo Yazbeck</ref> compulsory schooling was extended to 12 years; the first divorce law in Chile was approved;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/ricardo-lagos-41058|title=Ricardo Lagos|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref> monetary compensation to victims of torture under the Pinochet regime identified in the [[Valech Report]] was authorized; and, recently, a recast [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]] was signed. He finished his six-year term with a historically high [[approval rating]] of 70%.

==Post-presidential career==

===Political===
On March 24, 2006 Lagos inaugurated his own foundation called ''Democracia y Desarrollo'' ("Democracy and Development") in Santiago. Three days later he began a two-year term as President of the [[Club de Madrid]]— an exclusive organization of former presidents created by a Spanish philanthropist to promote democracy across the world. He also assumed co-chairmanship of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]]'s Board of Directors.

On May 2, 2007, Lagos, along with [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] and [[Han Seung-soo]], was named by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] as a [[Special Envoy on Climate Change]]. His appointment was and still is very controversial among Chilean environmental groups who questioned his track record on the matter, claiming that he 'showed an utter lack of consideration for the environment, promoted policies against environmental sustainability and favored the interests of big economic groups, even defending crimes against nature internationally', favouring large corporations every single time there was a clash between local communities, environmental concerns and perceived economic benefits.<ref>{{cite web

On January 14, 2017, Lagos accepted the Party for Democracy's nomination to run for president in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ricardo Lagos, ex-Chile president, runs to lead country again|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-politics-lagos-idUSKBN14Y0T0?il=0|access-date=15 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=14 January 2017}}</ref> However, he withdrew soon after the Party for Democracy, publicly backed  Alejandro Guillier. Following this he announced his retirement.

===Publishing===
In early 2007, Lagos became a member of the editorial board of ''[[Americas Quarterly]]'', a policy publication focused on relations and development in the Western Hemisphere. Lagos contributes regularly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-chile-politics-lagos/chiles-lagos-drops-out-of-2017-presidential-race-idUKKBN17C1K4?il=0|title=Chile's Lagos drops out of 2017 presidential race|author=Reuters Editorial|work=U.K.|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-04-28/former-president-ricardo-lagos-exits-chiles-presidential-race|title=In Chile, a New Political Era Dawns|last=The Conversation|date=2017|website=www.usnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052356/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-04-28/former-president-ricardo-lagos-exits-chiles-presidential-race|archive-date=2017-12-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Academic===
After abandoning power, Lagos taught a one-month special seminar at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s Center for Latin American Studies, called "Democracy and Development in Latin America."
