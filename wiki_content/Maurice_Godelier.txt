== Career ==
In 1963, Godelier initiated the first program on [[economic anthropology]] in France at [[Collège de France|College de France]]. In this program he focused on refining the Marxist ideas of [[base and superstructure]] and [[modes of production]].<ref name="Besnier"/>

From 1966 to 1969, Godelier conducted his first major anthropological field study on the Baruya in Papua New Guinea. His research provided significant contributions to the limited understanding of New Guinea cultures. In 1982, he used his research to write an [[ethnography]] on the Baruya. The book, entitled ''[[The Making of Great Men]]'', discusses sex- and gender-based inequality and provided insight into the systems of power in [[Melanesia]]. His analysis of the systems of power was further developed in ''[[Big Men and Great Men]]'', published in 1991, which he co-edited with [[Marilyn Strathern]].<ref name="Besnier"/>

In the late 1990s, Godelier addressed the future of peripheral societies under the effects of world capitalism and a new analysis of kinship theory focusing on gender inequality and sexuality.<ref name="Besnier"/> In 1995, he founded the [[Centre de recherche et de documentation sur l'Océanie|Center for Research and Documentation on Oceania]], which he directed until 1999.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130508175836/http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/fr/pres/compress/GodelierMedailleOr2001.htm</ref>

From 2000 to 2003, Godelier served on various organizations related to research in social sciences in Europe and his anthropological work in [[Oceania]].<ref name="Besnier"/> He is currently (2013–2015) president of the ''[[Société des océanistes]]''.
