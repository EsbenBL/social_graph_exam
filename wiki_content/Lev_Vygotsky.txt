'''Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky''' ({{lang-ru|Лев Семёнович Выго́тский|p=vɨˈɡotskʲɪj}}; {{lang-be|Леў Сямёнавіч Выго́цкі|p=vɨˈɡotskʲɪj}}; {{OldStyleDate|November 17|1896|November 5}} – June 11, 1934) was a Soviet [[psychologist]], known for his work on [[Developmental psychology|psychological development in children]]. He published on a diverse range of subjects, and from multiple views as his perspective changed over the years. Among his students was [[Alexander Luria]] and [[Kharkov school of psychology|Kharkiv school of psychology]].

He is known for his concept of the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD): the distance between what a student (apprentice, new employee, etc.) can do on their own, and what they can accomplish with the support of someone more knowledgeable about the activity. Vygotsky saw the ZPD as a measure of skills that are in the process of maturing, as supplement to measures of development that only look at a learner's independent ability.

Also influential are his works on the relationship between language and thought, the development of language, and a general theory of development through actions and relationships in a socio-cultural environment.

Vygotsky is the subject of great scholarly dispute. There is a group of scholars who see parts of Vygotsky's current legacy as distortions and who are going back to Vygotsky's manuscripts in an attempt to make Vygotsky's legacy more true to his actual ideas.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> Vygotsky's main work was in [[developmental psychology]]. In order to fully understand the human mind, he believed one must understand its genesis. Consequently, the majority of his work involved the study of infant and child behavior, as well as the development of language acquisition (such as the importance of [[pointing]] and [[inner speech]]<ref>{{ cite journal |title=Inner Speech: Development, Cognitive Functions, Phenomenology, and Neurobiology |year=2015 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=931–965 |last1=Alderson-Day |first1=Ben |last2=Fernyhough |first2=Charles |pmc=4538954 |pmid=26011789 |doi=10.1037/bul0000021 }}</ref>) and the development of concepts; now often referred to as [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] or schemata.<ref>{{ cite book |title=Chapter 6: The Development of Scientific Concepts in Childhood |year=1932  |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/ch06.htm |last=Vygotsky |first=L.S.

Early in the psychological research period of his career (1920s), which focused upon [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] and [[Reductionism|reductionist]] "instrumental psychology" in many ways inspired by the work of [[Ivan Pavlov]] (his theory of "higher nervous activity") and [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] (and his "reflexologist" followers), Vygotsky argued that human psychological development could be formed through the use of meaningless (i.e., virtually random) signs that he viewed as the psychological equivalent of instrument use in human labor and industry.<ref name="revBook"/> It was later during the "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of his career (the first half of the 1930s) that Vygotsky rejected this earlier reductionist views on signs.

While Vygotsky never met [[Jean Piaget]], he had read a number of his works and agreed on some of his perspectives on learning.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Hassard|first1=Jack|title=''The Art of Teaching Science: Inquiry and Innovation in Middle School and High School''|last2=Dias|first2=Michael|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-88999-9|location=Oxon}}</ref> At some point (around 1929–30), Vygotsky came to disagree with Piaget's understanding of learning and development, and held a different theoretical position from Piaget on the topic of inner speech; Piaget asserted that egocentric speech in children "dissolved away" as they matured, while Vygotsky maintained that egocentric speech became internalized, what we now call "inner speech".<ref>Vygotsky, L. S. & Luria, A., (1930) [https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/1934/tool-symbol.htm Tool and symbol in child development] marxists.org</ref> However, in the early 1930s he radically changed his mind on Piaget's theory and openly praised him for his discovery of the social origin of children's speech, reasoning, and moral judgements. Piaget only read Vygotsky's work after his death.<ref name=":0" />

Nearing the end of his life, Vygotsky's later work involved [[adolescent development]].<ref>Lev Vygotsky (1931) [https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/1931/adolescent/ch10.htm marxists.org:  Adolescent Pedagogy ''The development of thinking and concept formation in adolescence'']</ref> However, his most important and widely known contribution is his theory for the development of "higher psychological functions," which considers human psychological development as emerging through unification of interpersonal connections and actions taken within a given socio-cultural environment (i.e., language, culture, society, and tool-use). Vygotsky eventually came to dialogue with the mainstream Gestalt line of thought and adopted a more holistic approach to understanding development. Under the increasing influence of the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with the German-American [[Gestalt psychology]] movement, Vygotsky adopted their views on "psychological systems" and—inspired by [[Kurt Lewin]]'s "[[field theory (psychology)|topological (and vector) psychology]]"—introduced the enigmatic construct of the "[[zone of proximal development]]". It was during this period that he identified the play of young children as their "leading activity", which he understood to be the main source of preschoolers' psychological development, and which he viewed as an expression of an inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. At this time, Vygotsky fully revealed his long-time interest in the [[philosophy of Baruch Spinoza|philosophy of Spinoza]], who would remain one of his favorite thinkers throughout his life. A fervent [[Spinozism|Spinozist]] in many respects, Vygotsky was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's thought, largely in response to Spinoza's examinations concerning human emotion.<ref>Vygotsky, L.

Jornet & Cole (2018): "It has been known since the publication of ''Thought and Language'' in English that at the end of his life, Vygotsky turned to the ideas of Spinoza to overcome what he considered the shortcomings of his earlier theoretical ideas, bringing emotion to center stage in the process of development. Recent scholarship has made it clear that Spinoza was important from the beginning of Vygotsky's career. His doctoral thesis, ''The Psychology of Art'', opens with a quotation from Spinoza, and years later [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leont'ev]] (1997) made it clear in his introduction to Vygotsky's collected works that Vygotsky's interest in the philosophy of Spinoza began as early as his student years, and "would remain his favorite thinker for the rest of his life". Spinoza's lifelong influence on Vygotsky, however, has remained a relatively unexplored issue."</ref> As his work matured, Spinoza's thought became a more central visitation in Vygotsky's later work, increasingly focused on the issue of human emotion and its role in higher psychological functions and development that he largely omitted in his earlier work and utterly needed for creating a holistic psychological theory.

As early as the mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] developmental psychology and educational theory of Jean Piaget (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the "zone of proximal development" became a central component of the development of "[[Social constructivism|social constructivist]]" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after [[Ivan Pavlov]] and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator [[Alexander Luria]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last1=Haggbloom |first1=S.J. |last2=Warnick |first2=R. |last3=Warnick |first3=J.E. |last4=Jones |first4=V.K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=G.L. |last6=Russell |first6=T.M. |last7=Borecky |first7=C.M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=R. |last9=Powell III |first9=J.L. |last10=Beavers |first10=J. |last11=Monte |first11=E. |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913 |s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Lev Semionovich Vygotsky ({{lang-rus|Лев Семёнович Выго́тский|p=vɨˈɡotskʲɪj}}; {{OldStyleDate|November 17|1896|November 5}} – June 11, 1934) was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of [[Orsha]], [[Belarus]] (then belonging to [[Russian Empire]]) into a non-religious middle-class family of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] extraction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pound|first=L.|title=How Children Learn|date=2019|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-909280-73-1|location=London|pages=51|language=en|edition=New}}</ref> His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker.

Lev Vygodskii was raised in the city of [[Gomel]], where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the [[Moscow University]] by mere ballot through a "[[Jewish quota#Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students|Jewish Lottery]]": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at Shaniavskii University.

Vygodskii's early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]], and proposed the solution of the "Jewish question" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.  His own academics, however, included a wide field of studies including linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.

Lev Vygotsky never completed his formal studies at the [[Imperial Moscow University]] and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the [[October Revolution|October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the [[Ukrainian State]] at the time) after the German occupation during [[WWI]], until the [[Bolsheviks]] captured the town in 1919. After that, he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev Símkhovich Výgodskii' ({{lang-rus|Лев Си́мхович Вы́годский}}), with the surname becoming ''Vygótskii'' and the [[Russian patronymic|patronymic]] 'Símkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semiónovich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.<ref name="bioBook">Yasnitsky, A. (2018).

London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]</ref>

In January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in [[Petrograd]] (soon thereafter renamed [[Leningrad]]). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a "staff scientist, second class".<ref>Van der Veer, R., & Valsiner, J. (1991). [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/10170 Understanding Vygotsky. A quest for synthesis]. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.</ref> He also became a secondary teacher, covering a period marked by his interest in the processes of learning and the role of language in learning.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Nutbrown|first1=Cathy|title=Early Childhood Education: History, Philosophy and Experience|last2=Clough|first2=Peter|last3=Selbie|first3=Philip|date=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-4497-7|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=57}}</ref>

By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation in 1925 entitled "The Psychology of Art" that was not published until the 1960s and a book entitled "Pedagogical Psychology" that apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In the summer of 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf.<ref>van der Veer, R. & Zavershneva, E. (2011).

After his release from the hospital, Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and was presented by the editors as one of the most important of Vygotsky's works.<ref name="Zavershneva, E 2009">Zavershneva, E. 2009.

However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a "[[Marxism|Marxist]] Psychology" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.<ref name="Kozulin1986">Kozulin, Alex. 1986. "Vygotsky in Context" in Vygotsky L. "Thought and Language", MIT Press. pp. xi - lvii</ref>

From 1926 to 1930, Vygotsky worked on a research program investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including [[Alexander Luria]], Boris Varshava, [[Alexei Leontiev]], [[Leonid Zankov]], and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: 
* The instrumental approach, which aimed to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning.
* A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development
* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories <ref name="Kozulin1986"/>

In the early 1930s, Vygotsky experienced deep crises, both personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism, he made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the [[Gestalt psychology]] and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932–1934, Vygotsky aimed to establish a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death, this theory remained only unconfirmed and unfinished.

==Life and scientific legacy==
Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from ''Psychology of Art'' (1925) to ''Thought and Language'' [or ''Thinking and Speech''] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of [[developmental psychology]], [[child development]], and [[education]] were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as [[internalization]] of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of [[zone of proximal development]], a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the [[psychology of art]], development of higher [[mental function]]s, [[philosophy of science]] and the [[Methodology|methodology of psychological research]], the relation between [[learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], concept formation, interrelation between [[language and thought]] development, play as a psychological phenomenon, [[learning disabilities]], and abnormal human development (aka ''defectology''). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] "instrumental" period of the 1920s, integrative "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929–1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.

==="Instrumental" period (1920s)===

====Cultural mediation and internalization====
Vygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of [[cultural mediation]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]]. ''Internalization'' may be understood in one respect as "knowing how". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk, initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is ''appropriation'', in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.

===The period of crisis, criticism, and self-criticism (1929–1932)===

In the 1930s, Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of the theory of his "instrumental" period of the 1920s. Around 1929–1930, he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929,<ref>Cf. self-criticism of 1929: "I am revising the s[econd] part of "monkey"[i.e., the book Ape, primitive, and child]. Alas! The f[irst] chapter is written wholly according to the Freudianists [...]; then the impenetrable Piaget is turned into an absolute beyond all measure; instrument and sign are mixed together even more, and so on and so forth. This is not the fault of A. R. [Luria] personally, but of the entire "epoch" of our thinking. We need to put a stop to this unrelentingly.

'''Now''' I understand all this more deeply" (Zavershneva, 2010b, p. 54)</ref> Specifically, Vygotsky criticized his earlier idea of radical separation between the "lower" and "higher" psychological functions and, around 1932, appears to abandon it.<ref>Vygotsky in his presentation of December, 1932, a year and half before his death: "1. The necessity of a new stage of inquiry does not stem from the fact that a new thought has occurred to me or a new idea has caught my interest, but from the necessity of developing the research itself—new facts prod me into searching for new and more intricate explanations. The narrowness, bias, and schematism of the old mindset led us to the wrong assessment of the essential principles that we mistook for the secondary ones: interfunctional connections. We focused attention on the sign (on the tool) to the detriment of the operation with it, representing it as something simple, which goes through three phases: magical—external—internal. But the knot is external and the teenager’s diary is external. Hence we have a sea of poorly explained facts and a desire to delve more deeply into the facts, i.e., to evaluate them theoretically in a different way.
2. The higher and lower functions are not constructed in two tiers: their number and names do not match. But our previous understanding was not right, either [, according to which] a higher function is the mastery of the lower ([e.g.,] voluntary attention is the subordination to it of involuntary attention) because this means exactly—in two tiers". Vygotsky’s record titled "Symposium, December 4, 1932", see in Zavershneva, E. 2010b. "The Vygotsky Family Archive: New Findings. Notebooks, Notes, and Scientific Journals of L.S. Vygotsky (1912–1934)". ''Journal of the Russian and East European Psychology'' 48 (1):34-60, pp. 41-42</ref>

Vygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the "higher" and the "lower" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as [[Sergei Rubinstein]] criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to a generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], including [[Alexander Luria|Luria]], [[Mark Lebedinsky]], and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leontiev]], moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the [[Kharkov School of Psychology|Kharkov school of psychology]]. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as [[paedology]] and uncritical borrowings from contemporary "bourgeois" science. Considerable critique came from alleged followers of Vygotsky, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.

==="Holistic" period (1932–1934)===

There occurred a period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory, a transition from a mechanist orientation of his 1920s to an integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period, Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of [[Gestalt psychology]], most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.

====Zone of Proximal Development====
"[[Zone of Proximal Development]]" (ZPD) is a term Vygotsky used to characterize an individual's mental development. He originally defined the ZPD as “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.” He used the example of two children in school who originally could solve problems at an eight-year-old developmental level (that is, typical for children who were age 8). After each child received assistance from an adult, one was able to perform at a nine-year-old level and one was able to perform at a twelve-year-old level. He said "This difference between twelve and eight, or between nine and eight, is what we call ''the zone of proximal development.''" He further said that the ZPD “defines those functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation, functions that will mature tomorrow but are currently in an embryonic state.” The zone is bracketed by the learner's current ability and the ability they can achieve with the aid of an instructor of some capacity.

Vygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children's learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., [[behaviorism]]): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., [[gestaltism]]): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child's actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child's independent capabilities. The advancement through and attainment of the upper limit of the ZPD is limited by the instructional and scaffolding-related capabilities of the more knowledgeable other (MKO).  The MKO is typically assumed to be an older, more experienced teacher or parent, but often can be a learner's peer or someone their junior. The MKO need not even be a person, it can be a machine or book, or other source of visual and/or audio input.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|title=Vygotsky &#124; Simply Psychology|date=Aug 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805212531/https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|access-date=Sep 1, 2020|archive-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>

====''Thinking and speech''====
Perhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, ''Thinking and speech'', entitled in Russian, ''Myshlenie i rech'', that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his "instrumental" and "holistic" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. The first English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title ''Thought and Language'' for the Russian title ''Mysl' i iazyk''. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of "internalization" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to "think out loud", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.

===Death (1934) and posthumous fame===
Vygotsky died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:

<blockquote>This is the final thing I have done in psychology – and I will like [[Moses]] die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.<ref name="revBook"/></blockquote>

Immediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]]. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works—most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers—Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a [[Cult following|cult figure]] for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = J. | last2 = Yasnitsky | first2 = A. | year = 2015 | title = Deconstructing Vygotsky's Victimization Narrative: A Re-Examination of the "Stalinist Suppression" of Vygotskian Theory | url = http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Fraser%20&%20Yasnitsky%20(2015).pdf | journal = History of the Human Sciences | volume = 28| issue = 2| pages = 128–153| doi = 10.1177/0952695114560200 | s2cid = 4934828 }}</ref><ref>The last line of the notebook entry, from Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', 'The rest is silence', was also the last line of Vygotsky's first publication (1915), 'The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark', repr. as ch. 8 in Vygotsky, ''The Psychology of Art'' (1925).</ref>

===Eastern Europe===

===North America===
In North America, Vygotsky's work was known from the end of the 1920s through a series of publications in English, but it did not have a major effect on research in general.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, ''Thinking and Speech'', published with the title,''Thought and Language'', did not seem to change the situation considerably.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as ''Mind in Society'', that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents [[Michael Cole (psychologist)|Michael Cole]], [[James Wertsch]], their associates and followers, and is relatively well known under the names of "[[cultural-historical activity theory]]" (aka CHAT) or "[[activity theory]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=W.M.|author2=Lee, J.Y. |title="Vygotsky's Neglected Legacy": Cultural Historical Activity Theory|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=June 2007|volume=77|issue=2|doi=10.3102/0034654306298273|pages=186–232|url=http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2007_06.dir/att-0021/Wolff-Michael_Roth_Vygotsky.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.7175|s2cid=12099538}}</ref><ref name="toomela1">{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology | journal = Culture & Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 353–364 | doi=10.1177/1354067x0063005| s2cid = 143980608 }}</ref><ref  name="toomela2">{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2008 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too | journal = Culture & Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 289–303 | doi=10.1177/1354067x08088558| s2cid = 144330215 }}</ref> [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]], a concept introduced by Wood, [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.

==Criticisms of North American "Vygotskian" and original Vygotsky's legacy==
A critique of the North American interpretation of Vygotsky's ideas and, somewhat later, its global spread and dissemination appeared in the 1980s.<ref>Cf. Valsiner, J. (1988). Developmental psychology in the Soviet Union. Brighton, Sussex: Harvester Press, p. 117: Present-day psychologists’ interest in Vygotsky’s thinking is indeed paradoxical. On the one hand, his writings seem increasingly popular among developmental psychologists in Europe and North America. On the other hand, however, careful analyses and thorough understanding of the background of Vygotsky’s ideas is rare... Vygotsky seems to be increasingly well known in international psychology, while remaining little understood. The roots of his thinking in international philosophical and psychological discourse remain largely hidden. His ideas have rarely been developed further, along either theoretical or empirical lines.</ref> The early 1980s criticism of Russian and Western "Vygotskian" scholars <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = J | year = 1987 | title = Vygotsky and the Vygotskians | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 95 | issue = 4| pages = 609–613 | doi = 10.1086/444328 | s2cid = 142282282 }}</ref> continued throughout the 1990s. Van der Veer & Valsiner (1991) called these strands of Vygotskian thought "neo-Vygotskian fashions in contemporary psychology"<ref>Van der Veer, R., and J. Valsiner. 1991. Understanding Vygotsky: A quest for synthesis. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 1</ref> and Cazden (1996) called them "selective traditions" in Vygotskian scholarship.<ref>Cazden, C. B. 1996.

Van der Veer and Valsiner also suggest clearly distinguishing between Vygotsky's original notion of "zona blizhaishego razvitiia" (''ZBR'') and what they think of as its "superficial interpretations" collectively known as "zone of proximal development" (''ZPD'').<ref>Valsiner, J., & Van der Veer, R.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p.4: It is often an open question as to what functions such declarations can have in science.

==Revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies==
During the early twenty-first century, several scholarly reevaluations of the popular version (sometimes disparagingly termed "Vygotsky cult", "the cult of Vygotsky", or even "the cult of personality around Vygotsky") of Vygotsky's legacy have been undertaken and are referred to as the "revisionist revolution in Vygotsky Studies".<ref name="revBook">Yasnitsky, A. & van der Veer, R.

The revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies was termed a "revisionist revolution"<ref name="revBook"/> to describe a relatively recent trend that emerged in the 1990s. This trend is typically associated with growing dissatisfaction with the quality and scholarly integrity of available texts of Vygotsky and members of [[Vygotsky Circle]], including their English translations made from largely mistaken, distorted, and even in a few instances falsified Soviet editions,<ref>Veer, R., van der (1997).

==''Complete Works of L. S. Vygotsky''==
Scholars associated with the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] movement in Vygotsky Studies propose returning to Vygotsky's original uncensored works, critically revising the available discourse, and republishing them in both Russian and translation with a rigorous scholarly commentary.<ref name="html"/><ref>[http://www.ichs.udk.-berlin.de Veer, R., van der (2010).

This project is carried out by an international team of volunteers—researchers, archival workers, and library staff—from Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland, who joined their efforts and put together a collection of L. S. Vygotsky's texts. This publication work is supported by a stream of critical scholarly studies and publications on textology, history, theory and methodology of Vygotskian research that cumulatively contributes to the first ever edition of ''The Complete Works of L.S.
