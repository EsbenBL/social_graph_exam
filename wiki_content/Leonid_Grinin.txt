==Major contributions==

Leonid Grinin's current research interests include  [[Big History]] and macro-evolution, [[globalization]] studies, economic cycles, the long-term trends in the cultural [[evolution]] and evolution of technologies, technological forecasting, periodization of history, political [[anthropology]] and long-term development of the political systems, world-systems studies, revolutions.

===Periodization of history===
Grinin suggests a four-staged [[periodization]] of historical process. The transition from one stage to another is the change of all basic characteristics of the respective stage. As the starting point of such a change Grinin proposes the [[Production (economics)|production]] principle that describes the major qualitative stages of the development of the world [[productive forces]]. Grinin singles out four principles of production: [[Hunter-gatherer]]; Craft-Agrarian; Industrial; and Information-Scientific. To clear up the chronology of the beginning of each respective stage he proposes the three production revolutions: the Agrarian or [[Neolithic Revolution]]; the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the Information-Scientific (Cybernetic) Revolution<ref>Grinin L. Production Revolutions and Periodization of History: A Comparative and Theoretic-mathematical Approach. Social Evolution & History. Vol. 6, num, 2, 2007. [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]</ref>

===Future technological development===
Leonid Grinin connects major technological achievements with the Cybernetic revolution. He thinks that the technologies will develop in the direction of self-regulating systems which will penetrate many spheres starting from medicine to food production. With respect to possible dramatic changes of the human organism he argues that they may rise unprecedented ethical issues and seriously damage many vital aspects of our life including family relations, gender, and morals.<ref>Grinin, Leonid; Grinin, Anton L. Global Technological Perspectives in the Light of Cybernetic Revolution and Theory of Long Cycles. Journal of Globalization Studies. Volume 6, Number 2 / November 2015. [http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/396111/]</ref>

===Development of political systems===

Grinin insists that the two-stage scheme of the state macroevolution (Early State – Mature State) proposed by [[Henri J. M. Claessen|Henri Claessen]] and Peter Skalnik is not sufficient, and suggests that it should be modified as "Early State – Developed State – Mature State", emphasizing that the differences between developed and early states are no less pronounced than the ones between the former and the mature states.<ref>Grinin L. Early State, Developed State, Mature State: The Statehood Evolutionary Sequence. Social Evolution & History. Vol. 7, num. 1, 2008, pp. 67-81  [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/128479/]</ref>

===Globalization and sovereignty===
In the world political science the subject of change, ‘diffusion’, or ‘disappearing’ of national [[sovereignty]] is widely debated. Grinin argues that on the whole globalization contributes to the change and reduction of state sovereign powers, and he investigates the reasons and consequences of the deliberate voluntary reduction of sovereign prerogatives as most states voluntarily and deliberately limit the scope of their sovereignty.<ref>Grinin L. Globalization and Sovereignty: Why do States Abandon their Sovereign Prerogatives? Age of Globalization. Number 1, 2008 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/127716/]</ref>

===People of celebrity===
Grinin also investigates the influence of the personal [[celebrity]] factor on the social life of modern society, analyses celebrities as a special stratum and reasons for the rapid increase in the importance of social role of personal celebrity. He argues that personal celebrity is to be added to the list of those features that determine the major forms of inequality and by analogy with [[Peter L. Berger]]'s '[[knowledge class]] people' suggests defining the stratum of people whose occupation is connected with celebrity and whose major capital is celebrity with the notion ‘people of celebrity’.<ref>Grinin L. ‘People of celebrity’ as a new social stratum and elite. In Hierarchy and Power in the History of Civilizations: Cultural Dimensions (pp. 183–206). / Ed. by Leonid E. Grinin and Andrey V. Korotayev. Moscow: KRASAND, 2009.  [http://www.socionauki.ru/authors/grinin_l_e/publ_eng/#2009]</ref>
 
Among other things it has been suggested by Grinin to view social [[anagenesis]]/aromorphosis as a universal / widely diffused social innovation that raises social systems’ complexity, adaptability, integrity, and interconnectedness.<ref>Leonid Grinin & Andrey Korotayev. [https://www.academia.edu/35162265/Social_Macroevolution_Growth_of_the_World_System_Integrity_and_a_System_of_Phase_Transitions Social Macroevolution: Growth of the World System Integrity and a System of Phase Transitions.  World Futures, Volume 65, Issue 7 October 2009 , pages 477–506].</ref>

===Great Divergence and Great Convergence===
Together with [[Andrey Korotayev]] he has also made a significant contribution to the current [[Great Divergence]] debate.<ref>[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319177793 ''Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective''] (Springer, 2015, with [[Andrey Korotayev]]).</ref> As is noted by [[Jack Goldstone]], the "new view, carefully presented and rigorously modeled by Grinin and Korotayev, provides a richer and more nuanced version of the “Great Divergence,” bridging many of the differences between the traditional and California viewpoints. Yet they go further. Amazingly, by building a model utilizing human capital (education), global population growth, and regional productivity, they show how both the Great Divergence and the recent “Great Convergence” (the economic catching up of developing countries) are phases of the same process of global modernization."<ref>[https://www.sociostudies.org/upload/sociostudies.org/journal/seh/2016_2/194-200.pdf Goldstone, Jack A. "Great Divergence and Great Convergence in a Global Perspective." Social Evolution & History 15.2 (2016): 197-198.]</ref>
