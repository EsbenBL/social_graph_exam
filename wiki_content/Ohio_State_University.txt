'''The Ohio State University''', commonly '''Ohio State''' or '''OSU''', is a [[public university|public]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The [[Flagship universities|flagship]] of the [[University System of Ohio]], it is considered a [[Public Ivy]], and has been ranked by major [[College and university rankings in the United States|institutional rankings]] as among the best public universities in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1870 as the state's land-grant university and the ninth university in [[Ohio]] with the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]], Ohio State was originally known as the '''Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College''' and focused on various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but it developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of then-Governor and later U.S. president [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], and in 1878 the [[Ohio General Assembly]] passed a law changing the name to "the Ohio State University" and broadening the scope of the university. [[College admissions in the United States|Admission standards]] tightened and became [[College admissions in the United States|greatly more selective]] throughout the 2000s and 2010s. 

Ohio State's [[political science]] department and faculty have greatly contributed to the construction and development of the [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivist]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] schools of [[international relations]]; a 2004 [[London School of Economics|LSE]] study ranked the program as 1st among a public institution and 4th overall in the world. A member of the [[Association of American Universities]], Ohio State is a leading producer of [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], and is the only school in [[North America]] that offers an [[ABET]]-accredited undergraduate degree in [[Welding|welding engineering]]. The university's [[List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment|endowment]] of $6.8 billion in 2021 is among the largest in the world. Past and present alumni and faculty include 5 Nobel Prize laureates, 9 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 7 [[Churchill Scholarship|Churchill Scholars]], 1 [[Fields Medal]]ist, 7 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, 64 [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship|Goldwater scholars]], 6 [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]], 15 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]], and 108 [[List of American universities with Olympic medals|Olympic medalists]]. It is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "[[Research I university|R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity]]". As of 2021, Ohio State has the most students in the 95th percentile or above on [[standardized test]]ing of any public university in the United States.

The university has an extensive student life program, with over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]]; and three student governments. Its athletic teams compete in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are known as the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]]. The school's [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|football program]] has had great success and is one of the major programs of college football; their [[Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry|rivalry]] against the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] has been termed as one of the greatest in [[Sports in North America|North American sports]]. As of 2017, Ohio State's football program is valued at $1.5 billion, the highest valuation of any such program in the country. The main campus in Columbus has grown into the [[List of largest United States university campuses by enrollment|third-largest university campus]] in the United States, with nearly 50,000 undergraduate students and nearly 15,000 graduate students. The university also operates regional campuses in [[Ohio State University, Lima Campus|Lima]], [[Ohio State University, Mansfield Campus|Mansfield]], [[Ohio State University, Marion Campus|Marion]], [[Ohio State University, Newark Campus|Newark]], and [[Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute|Wooster]]. Ohio State competes as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] for the majority of its sports.

{{Main|History of Ohio State University}}
[[File:University_Hall,_The_Ohio_State_University_(Columbus,_Ohio).jpg|thumb|[[University Hall (Ohio State University)|University Hall]] was the first building on the Ohio State campus. The building was rebuilt in 1976.]]

=== Early beginnings (1870–1930) ===
The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests and competition for resources from [[Ohio University]], which was chartered by the [[Northwest Ordinance]], and [[Miami University]].<ref name=":4">{{cite web|last=Berdahl |first=Robert M. |url=http://cio.chance.berkeley.edu/chancellor/sp/flagship.htm |title=Discussion of "Flagship Universities" by UC-Berkeley Chancellor Berdahl |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |date=October 5, 1998 |access-date=October 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511120058/http://cio.chance.berkeley.edu/chancellor/sp/flagship.htm |archive-date=May 11, 2011  }}</ref>

Championed by the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], the Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a [[land-grant university]] under the [[Morrill Act of 1862]] as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College.<ref name=":4" />

The school was originally within a farming community on the northern edge of Columbus. While some interests in the state had hoped the new university would focus on matriculating students of various agricultural and mechanical disciplines, Hayes manipulated both the university's location and its initial board of trustees towards a more comprehensive educational mission.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878 the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ohio State History and Traditions|url=https://news.osu.edu/history.html|publisher=The Ohio State University|access-date=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216131558/http://news.osu.edu/history.html|archive-date=February 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Also in 1878, the Ohio legislature recognized an expanded scope for the university by changing its name to "the Ohio State University".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/buckeye-history/faqs#1|title=The statute has quote marks, and states "shall be known and designated hereafter as 'The Ohio State University.'"|access-date=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815234443/http://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/buckeye-history/faqs/#1|archive-date=August 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="arl.org">The government of Ohio, in its official web site listing the state's compiled laws: "3335.01 The Ohio State University.

Ohio State began accepting graduate students in the 1880s, and in 1891, the school saw the founding of its law school, Moritz College of Law. It would later acquire colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, commerce, and journalism in subsequent years.

=== Mid-20th century (1930–1985) ===
In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the [[Association of American Universities]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Staff|title=The Ohio State University {{!}} Association of American Universities|url=https://www.aau.edu/who-we-are/our-members/ohio-state-university|url-status=live|access-date=April 13, 2021|website=[[Association of American Universities]]}}</ref>

The Ohio State University and the University of Michigan football programs participated in the "[[The Ten Year War]]" between 1967 and 1978. In consistently close matches, it pitted coaches [[Woody Hayes]] of Ohio State and [[Bo Schembechler]] of Michigan against each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beekman|first=Scott|date=2009|title=War as They Knew It: Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, and America in a Time of Unrest by Michael Rosenberg|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/mhr.2009.0025|journal=Michigan Historical Review|volume=35|issue=2|pages=130–131|doi=10.1353/mhr.2009.0025|issn=2327-9672}}</ref>

=== Modern era (1985–present) ===
Ohio State had an [[open admissions]] policy until the late 1980s; particularly since the early 2000s, the college has greatly raised standards for admission, and it has been increasingly cited as one of the best public universities in the [[Midwestern United States|United States]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last1=Greene|first1=Howard|title=The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities|last2=Greene|first2=Matthew|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2001|isbn=978-0060934590|location=[[United States]]|pages=12}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Masuoka|first1=Natalie|last2=Grofman|first2=Bernard|last3=Feld|first3=Scott L.|date=July 2007|title=Ranking Departments: A Comparison of Alternative Approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1049096507070825|journal=PS: Political Science & Politics|volume=40|issue=3|pages=531–537|doi=10.1017/s1049096507070825|issn=1049-0965|quote=...Ohio State’s has come to be one of the major departments in American politics...|s2cid=15449994}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Freedman|first=David H.|date=2016-06-16|title=The War on Stupid People|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/the-war-on-stupid-people/485618/|access-date=2021-04-05|website=The Atlantic|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Grosch|first1=Michael|title=Mediale Hochschul-Perspektiven 2020 In Baden-Wuerttemberg: Empirische Untersuchung Im Rahmen Der Allianz "Forward IT"|last2=Hartmann|first2=Jörg|last3=Holstein|first3=Sarah|last4=Marks|first4=Philipp|last5=Sexauer|first5=Andreas|last6=Zafirov|first6=Aleksandar|publisher=[[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]|year=2017|isbn=9783731506232|pages=38|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bayor|first=Ronald|title=Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2011|isbn=9780313357862|volume=2|pages=1994}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Smola|first=Jennifer|title=As Ohio State marks 150 years, has its land-grant mission evolved?|url=https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/education/2020/08/22/as-ohio-state-marks-150-years-has-its-land-grant-mission-evolved/42273375/|access-date=2021-04-05|website=The Columbus Dispatch|language=en-US}}</ref> As of 2021, it has by far the most students in the country in the 95th percentile or above of test-takers on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] and [[SAT]] of any public university.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mathews|first=Jay|title=Top Colleges Not Better, Data Shows|language=en-US|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/college-rejections-stress/2021/04/22/ba475d4c-a2ce-11eb-a774-7b47ceb36ee8_story.html|access-date=2021-05-04|issn=0190-8286|quote=He ranked colleges by the number — not the percentage — of students with SAT math scores over 700 or ACT math scores over 30.

Ohio State's {{convert|1,764|acre|adj=on}} main campus is about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of the city's downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] of about {{convert|11|acre|adj=off}}.<ref name="faqs">{{cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/digitalcontent/faqs#7|title=FAQs|website=University Libraries|publisher=The Ohio State University|access-date=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013151555/https://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/digitalcontent/faqs#7|archive-date=October 13, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Four buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: [[Hale Hall]] (originally Enarson Hall), [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Hayes Hall]], [[Ohio Stadium]], and [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Orton Hall]].
Unlike earlier public universities such as Ohio University and Miami University, whose campuses have a consistent architectural style, the Ohio State campus is a mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles.
The [[William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]], anchoring the Oval's western end, is Ohio State library's main branch and largest repository. The Thompson Library was designed in 1913 by the Boston firm of Allen and Collens in the Italianate Renaissance Revival style, and its placement on the Oval was suggested by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] who had designed New York City's [[Central Park]]. In 2006, the Thompson Library began a $100-million renovation to maintain the building's classical Italian Renaissance architecture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2009/08/03/OSU_library.ART_ART_08-03-09_A1_5NEL3IU.html|title=OSU's main library reopens today after three-year, $109 million renovation|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=January 17, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Ohio State operates North America's 18th-largest university [[research library]] with a combined collection of over 5.8&nbsp;million volumes. Additionally, the libraries regularly receive about 35,000 serial titles. Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.<ref name="arl.org"/> Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include the [[Byrd Polar Research Center]] Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] and other polar research materials; the [[Hilandar Research Library]], which has the world's largest collection of [[medieval]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] manuscripts on microform; the [[Cartoon Research Library|Ohio State Cartoon Library & Museum]], the world's largest repository of original cartoons; the Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator [[John Glenn]].

Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. Designed by architects [[Peter Eisenman]] of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]]'s gift of $25&nbsp;million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking [[deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of the Wexner Center's permanent collection is [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Nude on a black armchair|Nude on a Black Armchair]]'', which was purchased by alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]] at auction for $45&nbsp;million.

To the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller, expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone [[Greek theatre]]) and [[Mirror Lake (Ohio)|Mirror Lake]].

[[Knowlton Hall]], dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to [[Ohio Stadium]]. Knowlton Hall along with the [[Max M. Fisher College of Business|Fisher College of Business]] and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall was designed by Mac Scogin Merril Elam from Atlanta along with WSA Studio from Columbus and is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, City and Regional Planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested that five white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of [[Architecture]].<ref name="herrick">{{cite web|url=http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|title=Knowlton Hall, Austin E.|access-date=September 15, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928002321/http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|archive-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref>

The [[OSU College of Medicine and Public Health|Ohio State College of Medicine]] is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the [[James Cancer Hospital]], a cancer research institute and one of the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s forty-one [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|comprehensive cancer centers]], along with [[the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital]], a research institute for cardiovascular disease.

The campus is served by the [[Campus Area Bus Service]].

===Diversity===
''The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students'' lists Ohio State as one of the 20 best campuses in America for [[LGBT]] students.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rosenbloom |first=Stephanie |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E0D71531F937A2575AC0A9609C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Is This Campus Gay-Friendly?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>

The Morrill Scholarship Program (MSP) is Ohio State's premier diversity/merit scholarship program, rewarding academically talented students who are actively engaged in diversity-based leadership, service and social justice activities. MSP seeks academically talented high school seniors who will contribute to campus diversity actively engage as advocates, and champions of diversity, inclusion, social justice and academic excellence on campus. There are three scholarship levels: prominence, excellence, and distinction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://odi.osu.edu/msp-about|title=What is The Morrill Scholarship Program?|last=OSU|website=OSU.EDU|date=March 18, 2019|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref>

===University housing===
[[File:SCampusGateway.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|South Campus Gateway]]
Ohio State operates 41 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom), and West Campus ("The Towers"). The residence hall system has 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations.

Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.

Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield, and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses.

The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the University's residence halls, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions of the residence halls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://involvedliving.osu.edu/rhac/about-us/ |title=About Us : Involved Living |publisher=Involvedliving.osu.edu |access-date=December 16, 2016}}</ref>

===Honors programs===
Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability [[undergraduates]]: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors. The Scholars program is centered on thirteen specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "Media, Marketing, and Communications Scholars", "Biological Sciences Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars", "Business Scholars" and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars." Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program. Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended to ten incoming freshmen and following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates. Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]], [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], or [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]] Scholarships.

Ohio State also administers two large-scale [[scholarship|scholarship programs]] to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from [[low-income]] or traditionally underrepresented groups. The first, the Young Scholars Program, was initiated in 1988. 120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school. The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers. Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid. The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005. This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds. Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of [[Ohio county government|Ohio's 88 counties]].

Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors & Scholars House, which served as the university president's residence until 1972. Three residence halls are designated all or in part as honors residences: Bradley Hall, Lincoln Tower, and Taylor Tower.

===Activities and organizations===
[[File:EnarsonHall.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Hale Hall]] (original Ohio Union)]]

Ohio State is rated at the #3 most amazing student union (Best College Reviews).<ref name="Ohio State Quick facts"/>  The [[Ohio Union]] was the first student union built by an American public university. The Ohio Union is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Ohio Union|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|access-date=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203081517/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|archive-date=December 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Student organizations===
[[Student organizations]] at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including [[academic]], [[Social issues|social]], [[religious]], [[artistic]], [[community service|service-based]], [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and many more.
There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|title=The Ohio State University Undergraduate Admissions and First Year Experience|access-date=September 15, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816181742/http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|archive-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref> The university's forensics team has won the state [[National Forensics Association]] tournament several times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/news/00-01/294.html|title=Forensics Team Wins State Champ.|website=www.ohio.edu|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

[[Block O|Block "O"]] is currently the largest student-run organization on the campus of Ohio State. With over 2,400 annual members, Block "O" serves as the official [[student cheering section]] at athletic events for the University. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men's Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university's oldest organization.

Each year, students may sign-up to participate in BuckeyeThon, Ohio State's student-led philanthropy. The organization hosts events throughout the year to support the hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/aboutus/our_beneficiary|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}</ref> at [[Nationwide Children's Hospital]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Although BuckeyeThon is operated entirely by student volunteers, it is embedded within Student Life and the Ohio State University Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|title=Word document of BuckeyeThon Constitution and Bylaws (March 2015)|website=ohiounion.osu.edu|publisher=The Ohio State University Office of Student Life|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927044941/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|archive-date=September 27, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The organization receives support, advising, and specialized leadership training from the university. Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon's signature event, a [[Dance marathon|Dance Marathon]] consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5&nbsp;million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/events/dance_marathon|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}</ref> Unique to BuckeyeThon is the use of an operational fund separate from the main philanthropic cancer fund. As a registered non-profit, BuckeyeThon is subject to university audit and issues gift receipts through the Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giveto.osu.edu/makeagift/?fund=315502|title=Make your gift|website=www.giveto.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}</ref> An annual operational fund relies on university grants, outside sponsors, and event registration fees. This allows the entirety of donations made to the cancer fund to solely support patients without hindrance from outside costs.

Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. ''The Makio'' is the official yearbook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |title=Makio – Ohio Union |publisher=Ohiounion.osu.edu |access-date=October 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218162454/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |archive-date=February 18, 2010  }}</ref> ''The Makio's'' sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and revived again in 2000 thanks to several student organizations. ''[[The Lantern]]'' is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper{{clarify|date=August 2020}} in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. ''Mosaic'' is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[art]]. ''[[Sundial Humor Magazine|The Sundial]]'' is a student-written and published humor magazine. Founded in 1911, it is one of the oldest humor magazines in the country. After a 17-year hiatus in which no magazine was published it has recently been revived, first in print form, and now in an online humor blog, as well as multiple social media outlets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2011/01/23/humor-mag-rises-again-at-ohio-state.html |title=Humor Magazine Lives Again |access-date=May 19, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |title=Homepage of The Sundial |access-date=May 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530175636/http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Ohio State has two improvisational comedy groups, ''The 8th Floor Improv'' and ''Fishbowl Improv'', who regularly perform long and short-form improv around campus and across the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.8thfloorimprov.com |title=The 8th Floor Improv |publisher=The 8th Floor Improv |access-date=October 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924074338/http://www.8thfloorimprov.com/ |archive-date=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FishbowlImprov|title=8th Floor Improv's Facebook Page|work=Facebook|access-date=September 15, 2014}}</ref> There are two student-run radio stations on campus.

===Student government===
At the Ohio State University, three recognized student governments represent their constituents.<ref name=govt>{{cite web|title=Student Governments|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|access-date=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208063009/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|archive-date=December 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student [[Representation (politics)|representatives]] who serve as liaisons from the [[undergraduate]] student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at Ohio State.
* Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides [[academic]], [[Academic administration|administrative]], and social programs for the university community in general and for [[graduate students]] in particular. The council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss, and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the University community.
* Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of [[dentistry]], [[law]], [[medicine]], [[optometry]], [[pharmacy]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. Its purpose is to act as a liaison between these students and the governing bodies of the University.
