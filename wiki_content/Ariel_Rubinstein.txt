==Biography==
Ariel Rubinstein is a professor of economics at the School of Economics at [[Tel Aviv University]] and the Department of Economics at [[New York University]].  He studied mathematics and economics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], 1972–1979 (B.Sc. Mathematics, Economics and Statistics, 1974;
M.A. Economics, 1975; M.Sc Mathematics, 1976; Ph.D. Economics, 1979).

In 1982, he published "Perfect equilibrium in a bargaining model",<ref name=Rubinstein1982>{{cite journal

It describes two-person bargaining as an extensive game with [[perfect information]] in which the players alternate offers.  A key assumption is that the players are impatient. The main result gives conditions under which the game has a unique [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] and characterizes this equilibrium.
