Schilling was the co-author of the book ''Strategy, Politics and Defense Budgets'' (1962) along with [[Paul Y. Hammond]] and [[Glenn H. Snyder]].  Writing for the journal ''Defense Analysis'' in 1989, Michael D. Yaffe wrote that 25 years later the three authors' "insights about defense planning still ring true" and that the book was a landmark of defense-policy literature.<ref name="yaffe">{{cite journal | title=Landmarks in Defense Literature: Strategy, Politics and Defense Budgets | first=Michael D. | last=Yaffe | journal=Defense Analysis | volume=5 | number=2 | date=Summer 1989 | pages=163–166 | doi=10.1080/07430178908405394}}</ref>  Schilling's portion, ''The Politics of National Defense: Fiscal 1950'', was an examination of the process by which the U.S. defense budget was arrived at during a time of fundamental change for U.S. security policy and an analysis of the forces at play that made rational choice so difficult.<ref name="yaffe"/>  An influential work,<ref name="pph-1986"/> two decades later, [[John Lewis Gaddis]] commented that it was still the "classic discussion" of defense spending during that period.<ref>{{cite journal | first=John Lewis | last=Gaddis | author-link=John Lewis Gaddis | title=The Emerging Post-Revisionist Synthesis on the Origins of the Cold War | journal=[[Diplomatic History (journal)|Diplomatic History]] | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=171–190 | date=July 1983 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.1983.tb00389.x}}</ref>  [[Robert J.

He was also co-author of ''American Arms and a Changing Europe: Dilemmas of Deterrence and Disarmament'' (1973) and co-editor of ''European Security and the Atlantic System'' (1973).  In addition, he published a number of scholarly articles.  One of those was regarding the decision by the President [[Harry S. Truman]] and the U.S. government to [[History of nuclear weapons#The first thermonuclear weapons|proceed with development of the hydrogen bomb]] in 1950; in the mid-1950s Schilling interviewed virtually every participant in that decision, and gave public lectures on the subject,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/38898044/ | title=H-Bomb Hatched Despite 'Confusion, Compromises' | newspaper=Pasadena Independent | date=November 18, 1960 | page=29 | via=Newspapers.com }}</ref> but a book-length treatment of the decision did not incorporate these interviews until after his passing.

During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] that split the faculty and campus, Schilling was considered one of the more vocal of the conservative faculty members, opposing the demonstrators and their spokesperson [[Mark Rudd]] and supporting the position of the university administration.<ref name="McCaughey2003"/><ref name="nyt051268"/><ref name="avorn"/> (Off campus, the politics of any of these "conservatives" was often anything but, and they were uncomfortable with such labels when their goal as they saw it was simply the restoration of order in American and European academies.<ref name="McCaughey2003"/>)  Shortly after midnight at the start of April 25, 1968, the third day of student protests and occupations, Schilling was part of a faculty delegation unsympathetic to the protesters that entered the occupied portion of [[Low Library]] to attempt a dialogue with them; it went nowhere.<ref name="avorn">{{cite book | title=Up Against the Ivy Wall: A History of the Columbia Crisis | first=Jerry L. | last=Avorn | publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] | location=New York | year=1968 | pages=87, 102, plates after 150, 303}}</ref>  That evening, he spoke to a large gathering of like-minded students and faculty at Wollman Auditorium and gained applause after proclaiming, "if Mark Rudd is still at Columbia in the fall, I will not be."<ref name="McCaughey2003">{{cite book |title=Stand, Columbia: A History of Columbia University in the City of New York, 1754–2004 |last=McCaughey |first=Robert |year= 2003|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location= New York |isbn=978-0-231-13008-0 |pages=447, 449, 463 }}</ref> On the evening of April 26, he was part of a press conference in which several faculty members endorsed a moderate student group called the Majority Coalition that wanted to prevent the granting of amnesty to the occupying students; Schilling said he had "high admiration for [the] conduct" of the counter-demonstrators.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19680427-01.1.3&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------ | title=Student Group Aims to Block Amnesty | first=Paul | last=Starr | author-link=Paul Starr | newspaper=[[Columbia Daily Spectator]] | date=April 27, 1968 | page=1}}</ref>  He was one of several professors to propose that the faculty themselves cordon off Low Library to prevent free entry and exit of the demonstrators and seize the university identification cards of those leaving.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19680427-01.1.3&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------ | title=Brown Speaks Before 500 at Hamilton Rally | first=Arthur | last=Kokot | newspaper=[[Columbia Daily Spectator]] | date=April 27, 1968 | page=4}}</ref>  On April 28, he was part of a line of faculty formed outside Low Library that sought to prevent violence among students.<ref name="avorn"/>  He supported the administration's April 30 decision to bring in the police to clear the buildings, saying it was "a horrible decision to make [but] the right one".<ref name="nyt051268">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/05/12/88944472.pdf | title=Columbia Faculty Cast in New Role | first=John | last=Leo | author-link=John Leo | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 12, 1968 | pages=1, 69}}</ref>  Schilling subsequently faulted colleague [[Alan Westin]], leader of a faculty group more sympathetic to the demonstrators, and others in that group, for engaging in behavior that turned what he thought would have been a manageable student-administration conflict into "a disaster".<ref name="McCaughey2003"/>

[[Image:Professor Warner R Schilling talking to students after class 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Schilling talking to students after one of his "Weapons, Strategy, and War" classes in 2008]]

Schilling was known for his teaching, which included courses such as "American Strategies in World Politics", "Causes of War",  and "Weapons, Strategy, and War".<ref name="siwps-wrs"/>  The last of these was a popular course<ref name="csm-2003"/> that, according to the university, "became legendary among undergraduates and graduate students", and which he was still teaching well into his eighties.<ref name="siwps-wrs"/>  Each year, while observed by a university security officer, he brought an unloaded, [[World War I]]-era rifle to class to allow students to physically imagine what using it in battle would be like.<ref name="csm-2003">{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0211/p14s01-lehl.html | title=Understanding war: It's a slow march | first=Marius Mihai | last=Hentea | newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=February 11, 2003}}</ref>  A panel session at the [[International Studies Association]] 2009 annual conference in New York commemorated his teaching and mentoring contributions in the field of [[security studies]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.isanet.org/Conferences/NewYork2009.aspx | title=ISA Annual Convention, New York, 2009: About the Conference | publisher=[[International Studies Association]] }}{{subscription required}}</ref>  As Stacie E.

In a 2003 profile by ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', Schilling said that students were more oriented towards academic careers than they had been in years past, but were less knowledgeable about history and geography and less personally vulnerable to decisions about war and peace.<ref name="csm-2003"/>  On the importance of studying history, he said, "There are a whole host of questions that, even if you are only interested in the here and now, can best be answered by looking backward. It requires a greater leap of faith than I am willing to undertake to think that people are brighter in the year 2003 than they were in 1903 or 1803 or 1703. There are some things which have changed, but I don't think there have been any major new innovations in human intelligence or human emotions. If you are interested in the human animal and how the human animal behaves in different circumstances, a study of past behavior, or in this case, history, is one very useful way of building up your working capital, insight, and knowledge."<ref name="csm-2003"/>  <!-- TODO add course guide mentions? -->

He died in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], on October 20, 2013, at age 88.<ref name="siwps-wrs"/>

Schilling was a perfectionist who had trouble finishing writing projects during his lifetime.<ref name="abf-hist"/><ref>Young, ''Super Bomb'', p. xii.</ref>  After his death, unfinished works of his – regarding assassination as an instrument of foreign policy, and his interviews and conclusions regarding the aforementioned H-bomb decision – were published in collaboration with other authors and scholars.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/nuclear-warfare-the-decision-to-make-it-worse/ | title=Nuclear Warfare: The Decision to Make It Worse | author-first=Jonathan L. | author-last=Schilling | publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] | date=31 January 2020}}</ref>
