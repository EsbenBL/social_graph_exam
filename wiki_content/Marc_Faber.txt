In 2009, Faber predicted with 100% confidence that the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping interest rates near zero would lead to [[hyperinflation]] approaching [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|levels seen in Zimbabwe]].

In 2012, Faber predicted that the S&P 500 index would fall at least 20% within 6–9 months following the re-election of Barack Obama.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209215640/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/b/7ba1b8b8-08d2-4d06-9ebf-fb34ba756ab5 ]</ref> Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose from a low of 1359.88 on November 16, 2012 to 1480.40 as of January 1, 2013, 1570.70 on April 1, 2013 (up 15% from the November low, 6 months after Faber's prediction), 1668.68 on July 1, 2013 (up 22% from the November 2012 low) and 1783.54 on November 1, 2013 (up 31%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices/table/by-month|title=S&P 500 Historical Prices by Month|website=www.multpl.com}}</ref>

On March 27, 2013, Faber said that the U.S. is creating nowhere-to-hide bubbles in many emerging economies such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand (up four times from 2009 lows).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-is-creating-nowhere-to-hide-bubbles-faber-p8XzT~6EQwCmlC52JQRQXw.html |title=Faber: U.S. Is Creating Nowhere-to-Hide Bubbles - Bloomberg Business |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>

Faber has been long term bearish about the American economy for a number of years, and continues to be so. He concluded his June 2008 newsletter with the following mock quote:
<blockquote>
''"The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate. If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part."''
</blockquote>

== Racist remarks ==
Faber drew criticism on October 17, 2017, after including controversial and widely criticized as racist remarks in the latest print edition of his investment newsletter.

In the October edition of Faber's ''Gloom, Doom and Boom Report'', he criticized "liberal hypocrites" and ongoing efforts to tear down "monuments of historic personalities." He opined that the U.S. grew successful because white people held power.

"Thank God white people populated America, and not the blacks," Faber wrote, according to an excerpt of the print newsletter obtained by [[Business Insider]]. "Otherwise, the U.S. would look like Zimbabwe, which it might look like one day anyway, but at least America enjoyed 200 years in the economic and political sun under a white majority. I am not a racist, but the reality – no matter how politically incorrect – needs to be spelled out as well."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bryan|first1=Bob|title=Marc Faber, author of influential 'Gloom, Doom, and Boom' report, says 'thank God white people populated America, not the blacks'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/marc-faber-investment-letter-white-people-blacks-confederate-statues-2017-10|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> He further defended statues of Confederate figures calling them "honorable people whose only crime was to defend what all societies had done for more than 5,000 years: keep a part of the population enslaved."<ref name="DerrickFDI-2017">{{cite news|last1=Derrick|first1=Jayson|title=Famed Doomsday Investor: 'Thank God White People Populated America'|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/news/famed-doomsday-investor-thank-god-white-people-populated-america/ar-AAtExeN|accessdate=19 November 2017|agency=msnbc|date=17 October 2017}}</ref> Faber defended his comments in a subsequent statement to Business Insider, adding that he is "naturally standing by this comment since this is an indisputable fact".

"If stating some historical facts makes me a racist, then I suppose that I am a racist. For years, Japanese were condemned because they denied the Nanking massacre," Faber said.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/marc-faber-says-us-wouldnt-have-made-as-much-progress-if-colonized-by-blacks-2017-10-17|title=Faber says U.S. wouldn't have made as much 'progress' if colonized by blacks|first=Mark|last=DeCambre|website=MarketWatch}}</ref>

Faber was subsequently asked to resign from the boards of [[Ivanhoe Mines]], Sprott Inc. and [[NovaGold Resources]]. U.S-based Sunshine Silver Mining Corp, Vietnam Growth Fund managed by [[Dragon Capital]], and Indochina Capital Corporation also dismissed him, Faber told Reuters. CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg TV said that they do not plan to book Faber in the future. Faber continues to stand by his remarks.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ablan|first1=Jennifer|title='Dr. Doom', Marc Faber, removed from more boards after comments on race|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-faber/dr-doom-marc-faber-removed-from-more-boards-after-comments-on-race-idUSKBN1CP2MV|website=Reuters|date=20 October 2017|accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Horowitz|first1=Julia|title=Market strategist Marc Faber under fire for racist remarks|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/17/investing/marc-faber-white-america/index.html|accessdate=23 October 2017|publisher=CNN|date=17 October 2017}}</ref>
