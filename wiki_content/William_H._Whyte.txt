'''William Hollingsworth''' "'''Holly'''" '''Whyte, Jr.''' (October 1, 1917 – January 12, 1999) was an American [[urbanist]], sociologist, organizational analyst, [[journalism|journalist]] and people-watcher. He identified the elements that create vibrant public spaces within the city and filmed a variety of urban plazas in New York City in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|pages=767}}</ref> After his book about corporate culture ''[[The Organization Man]]'' (1956) sold over two million copies, Whyte turned his attention to the study of human behavior in urban settings. He published several books on the topic, including ''[[The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces]]'' (1980).<ref name="PPS">{{cite web |url=http://www.pps.org/reference/wwhyte/ |title=William H.

==Biography==
Whyte was born in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]] in 1917.  An early graduate of [[St. Andrew's School (Delaware)|St. Andrew's School]] in [[Middletown, Delaware]], he graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1939 and then served in [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] between 1941 and 1945. He was commissioned and served as battalion intelligence officer with the [[3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]] in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].
He  left Guadalcanal at the end of the campaign with a serious case of malaria that lingered for years. He spent the rest of the war lecturing and writing at the [[Marine Corps University|Marine Corps Staff and Command School]] at Quantico, Virginia, on the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/patrolling-guadalcanal.htm|title = Patrolling Guadalcanal|date = 16 February 2010}}</ref>

In 1946 he joined ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]'' where he remained until 1958.<ref name="NYT 1999">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/13/arts/william-h-whyte-organization-man-author-and-urbanologist-is-dead-at-81.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=William H.

In 1952, Whyte coined the term "[[Groupthink]]":

{{quote|Groupthink being a coinage&nbsp;– and, admittedly, a loaded one&nbsp;– a working definition is in order. We are not talking about mere instinctive conformity&nbsp;– it is, after all, a perennial failing of mankind. What we are talking about is a rationalized conformity&nbsp;– an open, articulate philosophy which holds that group values are not only expedient but right and good as well.<ref>Fortune. pp. 114–117, 142, 146. (March 1952)</ref>}}

Whyte wrote a 1956 [[bestseller]] titled ''[[The Organization Man]]''<ref name="Guardian 1999">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/15/guardianobituaries1 |title=Secret life of US corporations |first=Godfrey |last=Hodgson |date=15 January 1999 |work=The Guardian |access-date=16 August 2012}}</ref>   after ''Fortune Magazine'' sponsored him to do extensive interviews on the [[chief executive officer|CEO]]s of corporations such as [[General Electric]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].

While working with the [[New York City Planning Commission]] in 1969, Whyte began to use direct observation to describe behavior in urban settings.  With research assistants wielding still cameras, movie cameras, and notebooks, Whyte described the substance of urban public life in an objective and measurable way.

These observations developed into the "Street Life Project", an ongoing study of pedestrian behavior and city dynamics, and eventually to Whyte's book called ''[[City: Rediscovering the Center]]'' (1988).  "City" presents Whyte's conclusions about jaywalking, 'schmoozing patterns,' the actual use of urban [[plazas]], appropriate sidewalk width, and other issues.  This work remains valuable because it is based on careful observation, and because it contradicts other conventional wisdom, for instance, the idea that pedestrian traffic and auto traffic should be separated.

Whyte along with [[Project for Public Spaces]] worked closely on the renovation of [[Bryant Park]] in New York City.

Whyte served as mentor to many, including the urban-planning writer [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Paco Underhill]], who has applied the same technique to measuring and improving retail environments, [[Dan Biederman]] of [[Bryant Park]] Corporation, who led the renovation of Bryant Park and the [[Business Improvement District]] movement in New York City, [[Fred Kent]], who worked with Whyte for a number of years before starting [[Project for Public Spaces]], and future [[New York City Planning Commission]]er, heiress and socialite [[Amanda Burden]].<ref>Satow, Julie, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/nyregion/amanda-burden-planning-commissioner-is-remaking-new-york-city.html "Amanda Burden Wants to Remake New York. She Has 19 Months Left."], ''The New York Times'', May 18, 2012. Accessed February 13, 2018.</ref>

Whyte married fashion designer Jenny Bell Bechtel in 1964.  They had one daughter, Alexandra Whyte.

He is interred at the [[Oaklands Cemetery]] in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
