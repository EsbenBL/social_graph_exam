'''Charles Tilly''' (May 27, 1929 – April 29, 2008<ref name="NYTobit" />) was an American [[sociology|sociologist]], [[political science|political scientist]], and historian who wrote on the relationship between [[politics]] and [[society]]. He was a professor of [[history]], sociology, and [[social science]] at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1969 to 1984 before becoming the [[Joseph L. Buttenwieser]] Professor of Social Science at [[Columbia University]].

He has been described as "the founding father of 21st-century sociology"<ref name="NYTobit" /> and "one of the world's preeminent sociologists and historians" as his "scholarship was unsurpassed, his humanity of the highest order, his spirit unwavering."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DB113AF931A35756C0A96E9C8B63&scp=1&sq=Paid+notice+Tilly&st=nyt|publisher=query.nytimes.com|access-date=June 23, 2015|title=Paid Notice: Deaths – Tilly, Charles}}</ref> After his death, numerous special journal issues, conferences, awards and obituaries appeared in his honor.<ref name="ssrc">{{cite web|url=http://essays.ssrc.org/tilly/resources|title=Tributes to Charles Tilly -- Memorials to Credit & Blame » Annotated Links to Charles Tilly Resources|publisher=essays.ssrc.org|access-date=June 23, 2015}}</ref> He was an influential proponent of large-scale historical social science research. The title of Tilly's 1984 book ''Big Structures, Large Processes, Huge Comparisons'' is characteristic of his particular approach to social science research.

==Personal life and education==
Tilly was born in [[Lombard, Illinois]] (near Chicago). He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1950 with a Bachelor of Arts [[magna cum laude]]. He served in the [[US Navy]] as a [[paymaster]] of an amphibious squadron during the [[Korean War]]. Tilly completed his Doctor of Philosophy in [[Sociology]] at Harvard in 1958.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Charles Tilly, 78, Writer and a Social Scientist, Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/nyregion/02tilly.html?_r=0|access-date=8 February 2016|agency=The New York Times}}</ref>

While at Harvard, he was a student in the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]] during the "Harvard revolution" in social network analysis.<ref name="columbia">{{cite web|url=http://ilas.columbia.edu/announcements/ilas_tribute_charles_tilly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726213406/http://ilas.columbia.edu/announcements/ilas_tribute_charles_tilly |archive-date=2014-07-26 |url-status=dead |title=Institute of Latin American Studies at Columbia University - ILAS Tribute - Charles Tilly|access-date=June 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Max Weber in Politics and Social Thought: From Charisma to Canonization|author=Derman, J.|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139577076|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbEgAwAAQBAJ|page=225|access-date=June 23, 2015}}</ref>
According to Dr. Victor Lee Burke,{{citation needed|reason=Still need published source for following anecdotes|date=June 2014}} one of Tilly's graduate students at the University of Michigan, Tilly stated that he was a teaching assistant to [[Pitirim Sorokin]], who along with [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[George C. Homans]] was considered by many in the profession to be among the world's leading sociologists. According to Tilly, Sorokin was known to call him up in the wee small hours of the morning and say in a distinct Russian accent, "Mr. Tilly you have to teach my class today" and then hang up, leaving Tilly in a panic. Tilly dutifully taught the class without the slightest idea of what Sorokin intended for the day. Tilly also planned to have Sorokin chair his dissertation but every time Sorokin heard Tilly's ideas he would say something like "Very interesting Mr. Tilly but I do think Plato said it better."<ref>as recounted in his Big Structures, Large Systems, Huge Comparisons</ref> Tilly failed his preliminary examination at Harvard because he forgot what time it was and never showed up. He eventually turned to Barrington Moore and George Homans to supervise his dissertation, but Tilly never failed to say that Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin was a great person even though Tilly eschewed any great person theory of history. Although Tilly rejected exchange theory, he considered Homans, one of exchange theory's creators, to be among the best writers in the history of sociology and he mentioned to the audience at the American Sociological Association where he accepted his Distinguished Scholarship Award (he always called it the Sorokin Award to his students its original name) that he wished that George Homans were alive so he could thank him.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Academic career==
Charles Tilly taught at the [[University of Delaware]], [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[The New School]], and [[Columbia University]]. At Michigan, Tilly was professor of history 1969–1984, professor of sociology 1969–1981, and the Theodore M. Newcomb Professor of Social Science 1981–1984. At Columbia, he was the Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Social Science, and along with [[Harrison White]], Tilly played a key role in the emergence of the [[relational sociology|New York School of relational sociology]]. Over the course of his career, Tilly wrote more than 600 articles and 51 books and monographs.<ref name='death'/>

He was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[Sociological Research Association]] and the [[Ordre des Palmes Academiques]].<ref name="ISERP_PR">{{cite web|author1=ISERP|title=Charles Tilly Remembered |url=http://www.reflectioncafe.net/2008/07/charles-tilly-remembered.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005070256/http://www.reflectioncafe.net/2008/07/charles-tilly-remembered.html|archive-date=October 5, 2008}} (Archived 29 April 2008 press release from ISERP, Columbia University.)</ref>

==Academic work==
Tilly's academic work covered multiple topics in the [[social sciences]] and influenced scholarship in disciplines outside of sociology, including history and [[political science]]. He is considered a major figure in the development of [[historical sociology]], the early use of [[quantitative methods]] in historical analysis, the methodology of event cataloging, the turn towards relational and [[social network analysis|social-network]] modes of inquiry, the development of [[wikt:process|process]]- and mechanism-based analysis, as well as the study of: [[contentious politics]], [[social movements]], the history of [[Labor movement|labor]], [[state formation]], revolutions, [[democratization]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]], and [[urban sociology]].

===State formation===

Tilly's 1990 book ''[[Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1992|Coercion, Capital, and European States]]'' discusses the processes of [[state formation]] in Europe in terms of coercive and capital-based processes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/does-war-make-states/F845D0CAE9888FA3539454ED6CFBE4F2|title=Does War Make States?: Investigations of Charles Tilly's Historical Sociology|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-14150-6|editor-last=Kaspersen|editor-first=Lars Bo|doi=10.1017/9781316493694|editor-last2=Strandsbjerg|editor-first2=Jeppe}}</ref> <ref name='coercion'>{{cite book | last = Tilly | first = Charles | title = Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1990 | publisher= B.

===Urban sociology===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Tilly studied migration to cities, and was an influential theorist about urban phenomena and treating communities as [[social networks]].<ref name="WellmanSOCNET" /> In 1968 Tilly presented his report on European collective violence to the [[U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence|Eisenhower Commission]], a body formed under the Johnson administration to assess urban unrest amidst the Civil Rights Movement. The report was included in Vol. 1 of ''Violence in America'', a collection edited by scholars on the staff of the commission.<ref>Tilly, Charles. 1969. "Collective Violence in European Perspective." Pp. 4–45 in ''Violence in America'', edited by Hugh Graham and [[Ted Robert Gurr|Tedd Gurr]]. Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office</ref> As informed by his studies of contentious politics in 19th-century Europe, and the present violence in the U.S., his interest in cities and communities became closely linked with his passion for the study of both social movements and collective violence.<ref>Tilly, Charles. 1988. "Misreading, then Rereading, Nineteenth-Century Social Change." Pp. 332–58 in Social Structures: A Network Approach, edited by Barry Wellman and SD Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

Tilly received several awards including the Common Wealth Award in sociology in 1982, the Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences in 1994, the [[Eastern Sociological Society]]'s Merit Award for Distinguished Scholarship in 1996, the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award in 2005, the [[International Political Science Association]]'s [[Karl Deutsch Award]] in Comparative Politics in 2006, the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Sidney Hook Memorial Award in 2006 and the [[Social Science Research Council]]'s Albert O. Hirschman Award in 2008.
