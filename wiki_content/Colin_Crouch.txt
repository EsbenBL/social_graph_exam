==Post-democracy==
Crouch coined the term ''[[post-democracy]]'' in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''<ref>Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]], 5 May 2011.</ref> for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
