{{Anthropology}}
'''Clifford James Geertz''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-ca-geertz.ogg|ɡ|ɜːr|t|s}}; August 23, 1926 – October 30, 2006) was an American [[anthropologist]] who is remembered mostly for his strong support for and influence on the practice of [[symbolic anthropology]], and who was considered "for three decades... the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."<ref name=":0">Shweder, Richard A., and Byron Good, eds. 2005. ''Clifford Geertz by His Colleagues''. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref> He served until his death as [[professor emeritus]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].

==Life and career==
Geertz was born in [[San Francisco]] on August 23, 1926. After service in the [[US Navy]] in [[World War II]] (1943–45), Geertz received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[philosophy]] from [[Antioch College]] in 1950. He then attended [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1956 as a student in the Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary program led by [[Talcott Parsons]]. Geertz worked with Parsons, as well as [[Clyde Kluckhohn]], training as an anthropologist.

Geertz conducted his first long-term fieldwork together with his wife, Hildred, in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]], a project funded by the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He also studied the religious life of a small, upcountry town for two-and-a-half years, living with a railroad laborer's family.<ref name=":1">Geertz, Clifford. 2001. ''Available Light: Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]].</ref>{{Rp|8–9}}

After finishing his thesis, Geertz returned to Indonesia, in [[Bali]] and [[Sumatra]],<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|10}} after which he would receive his Ph.D. in 1956 with a [[Thesis|dissertation]] entitled ''Religion in [[Mojokuto|Modjokuto]]: A Study of Ritual Belief In A Complex Society''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Religion in Modjokuto: A Study of Ritual and Belief in a Complex Society|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1956|location=Boston|oclc=421067853}}</ref>

Throughout his life, Geertz received [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate degrees]] from around fifteen colleges and universities, including Harvard, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and the [[University of Chicago]]; as well as awards such as the [[Association for Asian Studies]]' (AAS) 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies.<ref>Association for Asian Studies (AAS), [http://www.aasianst.org/publications/distinguished.htm 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies]; retrieved 2011-05-31</ref> Following his divorce from anthropologist Hildred Geertz, his first wife, he married Karen Blu, another anthropologist.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Geertz.htm|title=Anthropologist Biographies - Geertz|date=1926-08-23|website=Department of Anthropology|publisher=[[Indiana University Bloomington]]|access-date=2012-08-13}}</ref>

=== Teaching ===
He taught or held fellowships at a number of schools before joining the faculty of the anthropology department at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1960. In this period Geertz expanded his focus on [[Indonesia]] to include both [[Java]] and [[Bali]] and produced three books, including ''Religion of Java'' (1960), ''[[Agricultural Involution]]'' (1963), and ''Peddlers and Princes'' (also 1963). In the mid-1960s, he shifted course and began a new research project in [[Morocco]] that resulted in several publications, including ''Islam Observed'' (1968), which compared Indonesia and [[Morocco]].

In 1970, Geertz left Chicago to become professor of social science at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] from 1970 to 2000, then as [[emeritus]] professor. In 1973, he published ''The Interpretation of Cultures'', which collected essays Geertz had published throughout the 1960s. That became Geertz's best-known book and established him not just as an Indonesianist but also as an anthropological theorist. In 1974, he edited the anthology ''Myth, Symbol, Culture'' that contained papers by many important anthropologists on [[symbolic anthropology]]. Geertz produced ethnographic pieces in this period, such as ''Kinship in Bali'' (1975), ''Meaning and Order in Moroccan Society'' (1978; written collaboratively with Hildred Geertz and Lawrence Rosen) and ''Negara'' (1981).

===Later life===
From the 1980s to his death, Geertz wrote more theoretical and essayistic pieces, including book reviews for the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''. As a result, most of his books of the period are collections of essays—books including ''Local Knowledge'' (1983), ''Available Light'' (2000), and ''Life Among The Anthros'' (2010), which was published posthumously. He also produced a series of short essays on the stylistics of ethnography in ''Works and Lives'' (1988), while other works include the autobiographical ''After The Fact'' (1995).

Geertz conducted extensive [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. This fieldwork was the basis of Geertz's famous analysis of the [[Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight|Balinese cockfight]] among others. While holding a position in Chicago in the 1960s, he directed a multidisciplinary project titled ''Committee for the Comparative Studies of New Nations''. As part of the project, Geertz conducted fieldwork in [[Morocco]] on "bazaars, mosques, olive growing and oral poetry,"<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|10}} collecting ethnographic data that would be used for his famous essay on [[thick description]].<ref name=":3">Geertz, Clifford. 1973. "Thick Description: Towards an Interpretive Theory of Culture." Pp. 3–30 in ''[[The Interpretation of Cultures]]''. New York: [[Basic Books]].</ref>

Geertz contributed to social and [[culture theory|cultural theory]] and is still influential in turning [[anthropology]] toward a concern with the frames of meaning within which various peoples live their lives. He reflected on the basic core notions of [[anthropology]], such as [[culture]] and [[ethnography]]. He eventually died of complications following heart surgery on October 30, 2006.<ref name=":2" /> At the time of his death, Geertz was working on the general question of [[ethnic diversity]] and its implications in the modern world.

Geertz's often-cited essay "[[Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight]]"<ref name="Geertz_1973" /> is a classic example of [[thick description]], a concept adopted from the British philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]] which comes from [[ordinary language philosophy]]. ''Thick description'' is an anthropological method of explaining with as much detail as possible the reason behind human actions.<ref>[[Gilbert Ryle|Ryle, Gilbert]]. 1996 [1968]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20141221022028/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/CSACSIA/Vol14/Papers/ryle_1.html The Thinking of Thoughts: What is 'Le Penseur' Doing?]." ''Studies in Anthropology'' 11. UK: [http://csac.anthropology.ac.uk/ Centre for Social Anthropology and Computing], [[University of Kent]]. Archived from the [http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/CSACSIA/Vol14/Papers/ryle_1.html original] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221022028/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/CSACSIA/Vol14/Papers/ryle_1.html |date=2014-12-21 }} on 2014-12-21. {{ISSN|1363-1098}}.</ref> Many human actions can mean many different things, and Geertz insisted that the anthropologist needs to be aware of this. The work proved influential amongst historians, many of whom tried to use these ideas about the 'meaning' of cultural practice in the study of customs and traditions of the past.

Another of Geertz's philosophical influences is that of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s post-analytic philosophy, from which Geertz incorporates the concept of [[family resemblance]]s into anthropology. Geertz would also introduce anthropology to the "[[umwelt]]-[[mitwelt]]-vorwelt-folgewelt" formulation of [[Alfred Schütz]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],<ref>Geertz, Clifford. 1993 [1973]. ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays.'' London: Fontana Press.</ref>{{Rp|367n}} stressing that the links between the "consociate," "contemporary," "predecessor," and "successor" that are commonplace in anthropology derive from this very formulation.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|68}}

At the [[University of Chicago]], Geertz became a champion of [[symbolic anthropology]], a framework which gives prime attention to the role of symbols in constructing public meaning. In his seminal work ''[[The Interpretation of Cultures]]'' (1973), Geertz outlined culture as "a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life."<ref name="Geertz_1973" />{{Rp|89}}

He was one of the earliest scholars to see that the insights provided by common language, philosophy and literary analysis could have major explanatory force in the social sciences.<ref name="Geertz_1973" /> Geertz aimed to provide the social sciences with an understanding and appreciation of “thick description.” Geertz applied thick description to anthropological studies, particularly to his own '[[interpretive anthropology]]', urging anthropologists to consider the limitations placed upon them by their own cultural cosmologies when attempting to offer insight into the cultures of other people.<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|5}} He produced theory that had implications for other social sciences; for example, Geertz asserted that culture was essentially [[semiotic]] in nature, and this theory has implications for comparative political sciences.<ref name="Geertz_1973" />

[[Max Weber]] and his [[Verstehen|interpretative social science]] are strongly present in Geertz's work. Drawing from Weber, Geertz himself argues for a “[[Semiotics|semiotic]]” concept of culture:<ref name="Geertz_1973">Geertz, Clifford. 1973. ''[[The Interpretation of Cultures]]''. New York: [[Basic Books]].</ref><blockquote>Believing…that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun…I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretative one in search of meaning. It is explication I am after, construing social expression on their surface enigmatical. (p.5)</blockquote>Geertz argues that to interpret a culture's web of symbols, scholars must first isolate its elements, specifying the internal relationships among those elements and characterize the whole system in some general way according to the core symbols around which it is organized, the underlying structures of which it is a surface expression, or the ideological principles upon which it is based. It was his view that culture is public, because “meaning is,” and systems of meanings are what produce culture, because they are the collective property of a particular people.<ref name="Geertz_1973" /> We cannot discover the culture's import or understand its systems of meaning, when, as Wittgenstein noted, “we cannot find our feet with them.”<ref name="Geertz_1973" /> Geertz wants society to appreciate that social actions are larger than themselves:<ref name="Geertz_1973" />

<blockquote>It is not against a body of uninterrupted data, radically thinned descriptions, that we must measure the cogency of our explications, but against the power of the scientific imagination to bring us into touch with the lives of strangers.”{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}</blockquote>

In seeking to converse with subjects in foreign cultures and gain access to their conceptual world, this is the goal of the semiotic approach to culture.<ref name="Geertz_1973" /> [[Cultural theory]] is not its own master; at the end of the day we must appreciate, that the generality “thick description” contrives to achieve, grows out of the delicacy of its distinctions, not the sweep of its abstraction.<ref name="Geertz_1973" /> The essential task of theory-building here is not to codify abstract regularities, but to make thick description possible; not to generalize across cases, but to generalize within them.<ref name="Geertz_1973" />
[[File:Bali cocks fighting1.jpg|left|thumb|142x142px|Cockfight in Bali]]
During Geertz's long career he worked through a variety of theoretical phases and schools of thought. He would reflect an early leaning toward [[Functional psychology|functionalism]] in his essay "Ethos, Worldview and the Analysis of Sacred Symbols", writing that "the drive to make sense out of experience, to give it form and order, is evidently as real and pressing as the more familiar biological needs."<ref name="Geertz_1973" />{{Rp|140}}

==Legacy==
Geertz's research and ideas have had a strong influence on 20th-century academia, including modern anthropology and communication studies, as well as for geographers, ecologists, political scientists, scholars of religion, historians, and other humanists.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Clifford Geertz 1926 - 2006 | publisher = Institute for Advanced Study Press | year = 2006 | location = Princeton, New Jersey | url = http://www.ias.edu/news/press-releases/geertz-1926-2006 | access-date = 2010-03-03 | archive-date = 2013-01-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122114054/http://www.ias.edu/news/press-releases/geertz-1926-2006 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

[[University of Miami]] Professor Daniel Pals (1996) wrote of Geertz that "his critics are few; his admirers legion."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankenberry|first1=Nancy K.|last2=Penner|first2=Hans H.|year=1999|title=Clifford Geertz's Long-Lasting Moods, Motivations, and Metaphysical Conceptions|journal=The Journal of Religion|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|volume=79|issue=4|pages=617–40|doi=10.1086/490503|isbn=0-13-158591-6|s2cid=170496549|via=JSTOR}}

[[Talal Asad]] attacked the dualism in Geertzian theory: the theory does not provide a bridge between external symbols and internal dispositions. Asad also pointed out the need for a more nuanced approach toward the historical background of certain concepts.<ref name="Asad">Asad, Talal (1983). ''Anthropological Concepts of Religion: Reflections on Geertz''. Man (N.S.) 18:237-59.</ref>
Criticizing Geertz's theory of religion in general, Asad pointed out a gap between 'cultural system' and 'social reality' when attempting to define the concept of religion in universal terms.<ref name="Asad" />
He would also criticize Geertz for ascribing an authorizing discourse around conversations of comparative religion that, Asad argues, doesn't really exist. Furthermore, Asad criticized Geertz for operating according to a [[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]] view of religion that places import on signs and symbols that may or may not carry through in non-Christian religious cultures.<ref>	Asad, Talal. 1993. "The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category." ''Genealogies of religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power in Christianity and Islam'', pp. 27-54.</ref>
