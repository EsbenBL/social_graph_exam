'''Public opinion''' is the collective opinion on a specific topic or voting intention relevant to a society.

== Etymology ==
The term "public opinion" was derived from the French ''{{Lang|fr|opinion publique}}'', which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).<ref>Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.</ref>

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].<ref>The term ''{{Lang|fr|opinion publique}}'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.</ref><ref name=Speier>{{cite journal | last1 = Speier | first1 = Hans | year = 1950| title = Historical Development of Public Opinion | url = http://ddd.uab.cat/record/47067| journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 376–388 | doi = 10.1086/220561 | pmid = 15397399 | s2cid = 46454679 }}</ref>

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').<ref name=Speier/>

== History ==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm dates to the late 17th century, but opinion had been regarded as having singular importance much earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.<ref>See {{in lang|fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.</ref> Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the "mistress of success" and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was "the queen of the world".

In his treatise, ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' c, [[John Locke]] considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

In his 1672 essay ''On the Original and Nature of Government'', [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it must be force of custom, or opinion which subjects power to authority". Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299 |doi=10.1086/220561|pmid=15397399|s2cid=46454679|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/record/47067}}</ref>

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

=== Coffee-houses ===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|Coffeehouse in 17th century [[London]]]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]] in Russell Street, Covent Garden.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&pg=PA531#v=onepage&q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire.

Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]</ref> The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London. Each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses". According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government", were the "seats of English liberty".<ref>Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge & Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}</ref>

=== Gentleman clubs ===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]], c. 1730]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century. Some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]] and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]], a city with a growing and affluent middle class which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion".<ref>Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer, 2008</ref>

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}</ref> He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

== Concepts ==
The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of {{Lang|de|[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]}}, argued (''{{Lang|de|Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung}}'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''{{Lang|de|Gesellschaften}}'') which [[religion]] has in communities ({{Lang|de|Gemeinschaften}}).<ref>Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.</ref>

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of [[public sphere]] to the discussion of public opinion. According to Habermas, the public sphere, or bourgeois public, is where "something approaching public opinion can be formed".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|title=Rethinking popular culture. Contemporary perspectives in cultural studies|publisher=The University of California Press|year=1991|editor-last=Mukerji C.|publication-place=Berkeley|pages=398–404|chapter=The Public Sphere|editor-last2=Schudson, M}}</ref> Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass" in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into four categories:
# Quantitative measurement of opinion distributions.
# Investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue.
# Description or analysis of the public role of public opinion.
# Study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

== Formation ==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

=== Mass media effects ===
{{see also|Media manipulation|Propaganda through media}}
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth. When asked for their opinion on a subject about which they are uninformed, people often provide [[pseudo-opinion]]s they believe will please the questioner.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=December 18, 2015 |website=[[KIVI-TV]] |access-date=July 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718234655/https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |archive-date=July 18, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.<ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53">Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48</ref> Since the late 2000s, the Internet has become a platform for forming public opinion. Surveys have showed that more people get their news from [[social media]] and news websites as opposed to print newspapers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shearer |first1=Elisa |title=Social media outpaces print newspapers in the U.S. as a news source |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/10/social-media-outpaces-print-newspapers-in-the-u-s-as-a-news-source/ |website=Pew Research Centre |access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref> The accessibility of social media allows public opinion to be formed by a broader range of [[social movements]] and news sources. [[:nb:Gunn Enli|Gunn Enli]] identifies the Internet's effect on public opinion as being “characterised by an intensified personalisation of political advocacy and increased anti-elitism, popularisation and populism”.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Enli |first1=Gunn |s2cid=149265798 |title=Twitter as arena for the authentic outsider: exploring the social media campaigns of Trump and Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election |journal=European Journal of Communication |date=2017 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=50–61 |doi=10.1177/0267323116682802 |hdl=10852/55266 |ref=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0267323116682802|hdl-access=free }}</ref> Public opinion has become more varied as a result of online news sources being influenced by [[political communication]] and agenda setting.

== Role of influentials ==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]", or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies<ref>{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=978-1-4128-0507-0 }}</ref><ref>Lazarsfeld et al., 1968</ref> have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process. In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}</ref> suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced. This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis". The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials. The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process. The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories. Thus, this leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e. media, influencers and general public).

== Relationship with public policy ==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510|citeseerx=10.1.1.716.5464}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref> This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|s2cid=144394578|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}</ref> It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state.

== Relationship with foreign policy ==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the [[Almond–Lippmann consensus]] being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the [[Vietnam War]], [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Walter Lippmann]] argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.<ref name="jstor.org">{{cite journal | last1 = Holsti | first1 = Ole R | year = 1992 | title = Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates | jstor = 2600734 | journal = International Studies Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 439–466 | doi = 10.2307/2600734 }}</ref> More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132|doi-access=free|title=The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis|year=2008|last1=Baum|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Potter|first2=Philip B.K.|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=11|pages=39–65}}</ref><ref name="jstor.org"/>

People's judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.<ref>Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''</ref>

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Jon Hurwitz and Mark Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hurwitz | first1 = Jon | last2 = Peffley | first2 = Mark | year = 1987| title = How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model | jstor = 1962580 | journal = The American Political Science Review | volume = 81 | issue = 4| pages = 1099–1120 | doi = 10.2307/1962580 }}</ref> Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].<ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]</ref>

== Relationship with U.S. presidency ==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".<ref name=":0"/> A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs because of the complexity.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}</ref>

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Since they are not an institution (like Congress), they can also "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality".<ref name=":0" />

A study by James N. Druckman and [[Lawrence R. Jacobs]] discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected.
