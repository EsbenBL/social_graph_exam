'''Josiah Clark Nott'''  (March 31, 1804{{spaced ndash}}March 31, 1873) was an American surgeon and anthropologist. He is known for his studies into the [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]] of [[yellow fever]]. 

Nott, who owned slaves, used his scientific reputation to defend the institution of slavery. He claimed that "the negro achieves his greatest perfection, physical and moral, and also greatest longevity, in a state of slavery".<ref>

</ref> Nott was influenced by the racial theories of [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799&ndash;1851), one of the inspirators of [[physical anthropology]]. Morton collected hundreds of human skulls from around the world and tried to classify them in his attempt at [[phrenology]]. Morton had been among the first to claim that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the [[cranial capacity]] (the measure of the volume of the interior of the skull). A large skull meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. By studying these skulls he came to the conclusion of [[polygenism]], that each race had a separate origin.

==Early life and education==
Nott was born on March 31, 1804, in the U.S. state of [[South Carolina]]. He was the son of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] politician and judge [[Abraham Nott]]. He received his medical degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1827 and completed his post-graduate training in [[Paris]].<ref name="HCHOF">{{cite web|title=Josiah Clark Nott, M.D. (1804-1873)|work=Alabama Healthcare Hall of Fame|url=http://www.healthcarehof.org/honorees02/nott.html|accessdate=2008-02-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723112221/http://www.healthcarehof.org/honorees02/nott.html|archivedate=2008-07-23}}</ref> He moved to [[Mobile, Alabama]] in 1833 and began a surgical practice.<ref name="HCHOF"/>

Nott took up theories that the [[mosquito]] was a vector for [[malaria]], held by [[John Crawford (physician)|John Crawford]] and his contemporary Lewis Daniel Beauperthy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chernin E |title=Josiah Clark Nott, insects, and yellow fever |journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=790–802 |date=November 1983 |pmid=6140039 |pmc=1911699 }}</ref> He is credited as being the first to apply the insect vector theory to [[yellow fever]], then a serious health problem of the [[American South]].<ref name="HCHOF"/>  In his 1850 ''Yellow Fever Contrasted with Bilious Fever'' he attacked the prevailing [[miasma theory]]. Nott lost four of his children to yellow fever in one week in September 1853.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=WG|title=Yellow fever and Josiah Clark Nott.|journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine|date=April 1974|volume=50|issue=4|pages=499–508|pmid=4594855|pmc=1749383}}</ref>

Morton's followers, particularly Nott and [[George Gliddon]] (1809–1857) in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and claimed and backed up his findings which supported the notion of [[polygenism]], which claims that humanity originates from different ancestral lineages; it is the ancestor of the [[multiregional hypothesis]].

In their book, Nott and Gliddon argued that the races of mankind each occupied distinct zoological provinces and did not originate from a single pair of ancestors; they both believed God had created each race and positioned each race in separate geographic provinces. The doctrine of zoological provinces outlined in ''Types of Mankind'' did not allow for "superiority" of one type of race over another; each type was suited to its own province, and was superior within its own province. Nott claimed that because races were created in different provinces, that all race types must be of equal antiquity.<ref>David Keane, Caste-based discrimination in international human rights law, 2007, pp. 91-92</ref> However Nott and other polygenists, such as Gliddon, believed that the biblical Adam means "to show red in the face" or "[[blushing|blush]]er"; since only light skinned people can blush, the biblical Adam must be of the [[Caucasian race]].<ref name="Scott Mandelbrote 2010. pp. 151 - 154">Scott Mandelbrote, Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: 1700–present), Volume 2, 2010. pp. 151 - 154</ref>

Nott persistently attacked the scientific basis of the Bible and also rejected the [[theory of evolution]], claiming that the environment does not change any organism into another, and also rejecting [[common descent]]. Nott believed monogenism was "absurd" and had no biblical or scientific basis. He pointed to excavations in Egypt which depicted animals and humans as they looked today to refute monogenism and evolution. According to Nott, the monuments and artifacts found in Egypt show us that the "White, Mongolian and Negro existed at least five thousand years ago". Nott claimed that this proved beyond dispute that each race had been created separately.<ref name="Scott Mandelbrote 2010. pp. 151 - 154"/>

Nott claimed that the writers of the Bible had no knowledge of any races except themselves and their immediate neighbors, and that the Bible does not concern the whole of the earth's population. According to Nott there are no verses in the Bible which support monogenism and that the only passage the monogenists use is Acts 17:26, "And [he] hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"<ref>{{cite web |title=Acts 17:26 |url=https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-17-26/ |website=kingjamesbibleonline.org |access-date=23 May 2021}}</ref> but, according to Nott, the monogenists are wrong in their interpretation of that verse because the "one blood" of Paul's sermon only includes the nations he knew existed, which were local.<ref name="Scott Mandelbrote 2010. pp. 151 - 154"/>

In 1856, Nott hired [[Henry Hotze]] to translate [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853&ndash;55), a founding text of "biological racism" that contrasts with [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] (1658–1722)'s theory of races, and Nott  provided an appendix with his most recent results. Gobineau subsequently complained that Hotze's translation had ignored his comments on "American decay generally and slaveholding in particular".<ref>

In 1857, Nott and Gliddon again co-edited a book, ''Indigenous Races of the Earth''.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/indigenousraceso01nott#page/n33/mode/2up Indigenous Races of the Earth (Philadelphia 1857)]</ref>  That book built upon the arguments in ''Types of Mankind'' that linked anthropology with "scientific" studies of race to establish a supposed natural hierarchy of the races.  The book included chapters from [[Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury]], [[J. Atkin Meigs]], and Francis Polszky, letters from [[Louis Agassiz]], Joseph Leidy, and A.W. Habersham.

[[Charles Darwin]] opposed Nott and Gliddon's polygenist and [[creationist]] arguments in his 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', arguing for a monogenism of the human species. Darwin conceived the common origin of all humans (aka [[single-origin hypothesis]]) as essential for [[evolutionary theory]]. Darwin cited Nott and Gliddon's arguments as an example of those classing the races of man as separate species; Darwin disagreed and he concluded that humanity is one species.<ref>{{Cite book

Nott was a founder of the [[Medical College of Alabama]], established in Mobile in 1858, and served as its professor of surgery. In 1860 he successfully appealed to the [[Alabama legislature|state legislature]] for a monetary appropriation and a state charter for the school. During the [[American Civil War]], he served as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] surgeon and [[staff officer]]. During the early years of the war he served as director of the Confederate General Army Hospital in Mobile; later, he served in the field as medical director on the staffs of Brig. Gen. [[Daniel Ruggles]] and Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]], and as hospital inspector. He lost both of his remaining sons to the war. Upon his own death in 1873, he was interred at [[Magnolia Cemetery (Mobile, Alabama)|Magnolia Cemetery]] in Mobile.

==Honors==
A building at [[The University of Alabama]] was named Nott Hall in honor of Nott for his work at the predecessor Medical College of Alabama.  This attracted controversy in 2016, with several student groups petitioning that either the building be renamed or an educational plaque be added due to Nott's open racism even by the standards of his era.<Ref>[https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20161108/student-group-seeking-change-targets-building-namesakes-with-racist-pasts Student group seeking change targets building namesakes with racist pasts]</ref><ref>[https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2016/0223/Why-keep-a-KKK-leader-s-name-on-a-University-of-Alabama-building Why keep a KKK leader's name on a University of Alabama building?]</ref> On August 5, 2020, his name was removed from the building, which was renamed Honors Hall.<ref>[https://www.al.com/education/2020/08/alabama-strips-racists-name-from-campus-building.html]</ref>
