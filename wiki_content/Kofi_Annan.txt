Annan studied economics at [[Macalester College]], international relations at the [[Graduate Institute Geneva]], and management at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Annan joined the UN in 1962, working for the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[Geneva]] office. He went on to work in several capacities at the [[UN Headquarters]] including serving as the [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General]] for [[United Nations peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] between March 1992 and December 1996. He was appointed the Secretary-General on 13 December 1996 by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], and later confirmed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], making him the first office holder to be elected from the UN staff itself. He was re-elected for a second term in 2001, and was succeeded as Secretary-General by [[Ban Ki-moon]] on 1 January 2007.

As Secretary-General, Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy; worked to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], especially [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|in Africa]]; and launched the [[UN Global Compact]]. He was criticized for not expanding the Security Council and faced calls for his resignation after an investigation into the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]], but was largely exonerated of personal corruption.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/opinion/the-verdict-on-kofi-annan.html|title=The Verdict on Kofi Annan|date=30 March 2005|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Editorial|issn=0362-4331|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723053730/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/opinion/the-verdict-on-kofi-annan.html|archive-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> After the end of his term as UN Secretary-General, he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation in 2007 to work on [[international development]].

==Early years and education==
Kofi Annan was born in [[Kumasi]] in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana) on 8 April 1938. His twin sister Efua Atta, who died in 1991, shared the middle name ''Atta'', which in the [[Akan language]] means 'twin'.<ref name="CNNI" /> Annan and his sister were born into one of the country's  [[Fante people|Fante]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families; both of their grandfathers and their uncle were Fante [[Ghanaian chieftaincy|paramount chiefs]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Kofi Annan – The Man To Save The World? |url=http://www.williamshawcross.com/index.php?page=annan |url-status=dead|magazine=Saga Magazine |access-date=21 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114194400/http://www.williamshawcross.com/index.php?page=annan |archive-date=14 January 2014 |date=November 2002|via=William Shawcross}}</ref>

In the [[Akan names]] tradition, some children are named according to the day of the week on which they were born, sometimes in relation to how many children precede them. ''Kofi'' in Akan is the name that corresponds with Friday, the day of which Annan was born.<ref>[http://dictionary.kasahorow.com/en/search/kclient/kofi%20link%3Aak%7C Akan dictionary entry for ''Kofi''] dictionary.kasahorow.com</ref> Annan said that his surname rhymes with "cannon" in English.<ref name="Crossette">{{Cite news|last=Crossette|first=Barbara|title=New U.N.

From 1954 to 1957, Annan attended the elite [[Mfantsipim]], an all-boys [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[boarding school]] in [[Cape Coast]] founded in the 1870s. Annan said that the school taught him that "suffering anywhere, concerns people everywhere".<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/un/life/map1.html ''Kofi Annan – Center of the Storm''. Life Map. "A Chief's Son"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011183402/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/un/life/map1.html |date=11 October 2017 }}, PBS.</ref> In 1957, the year Annan graduated from Mfantsipim, the Gold Coast gained independence from the UK and began using the name "Ghana".

In 1958, Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology, now the [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana]]. He received a [[Ford Foundation]] grant, enabling him to complete his undergraduate studies in economics at [[Macalester College]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]], United States, in 1961. Annan then completed a ''diplôme d'études approfondies'' [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] degree in International Relations at [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1961 to 1962. After some years of work experience, he studied at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/mitlist/?page=full|title=The MIT 150: 150 Ideas, Inventions, and Innovators that Helped Shape Our World|work=The Boston Globe|date=15 May 2011|access-date=8 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519002514/http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/mitlist/?page=full|archive-date=19 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (1971–72) in the [[Sloan Fellows]] program and earned a [[Master of Business Administration|master's degree]] in management.

==Career==

In 1962, Annan started working as a budget officer for the [[World Health Organization]], an agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN).<ref>Stanley Meisner (2007).

When Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] established the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO) in 1992, Annan was appointed to the new department as Deputy to then Under-Secretary-General [[Marrack Goulding]].<ref name=TheUNSec>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSsiAQAAIAAJ|title=The UN Secretariat: a brief history (1945–2006)|author=Thant Myint-U, Amy Enid Scott, International Peace Academy|publisher=International Peace Academy|year=2007|page=88|access-date=19 August 2018|isbn=9780937722992}}</ref> Annan was subsequently appointed in March 1993 as [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General]] of that department.<ref name=Reut>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-crisis-annan-idUSL22403320080122/|title=FACTBOX: Career of Kofi Annan, Kenya crisis mediator|work=[[Reuters]]|date=22 January 2008|access-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819214302/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-crisis-annan-idUSL22403320080122/|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On 29 August 1995, while Boutros-Ghali was unreachable on an airplane, Annan instructed United Nations officials to "relinquish for a limited period of time their authority to veto air strikes in [[Bosnia]]." This move allowed [[NATO]] forces to conduct [[Operation Deliberate Force]] and made him a favorite of the United States. According to [[Richard Holbrooke]], Annan's "gutsy performance" convinced the United States that he would be a good replacement for Boutros-Ghali.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFizqu-mHZ0C&pg=PT168|title=To End a War: The Conflict in Yugoslavia—America's Inside Story|last=Holbrooke|first=Richard|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-03-0-776543-7|page=168|author-link=Richard Holbrooke|access-date=18 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915013647/https://books.google.com/books?id=fFizqu-mHZ0C&pg=PT168|archive-date=15 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Criticism===

In 2003, retired Canadian General [[Roméo Dallaire]], who was force commander of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]], claimed that Annan was overly passive in his response to the imminent [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]]. In his book ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda]]'' (2003), Dallaire asserted that Annan held back UN troops from intervening to settle the conflict, and from providing more logistical and material support. Dallaire claimed that Annan failed to provide responses to his repeated faxes asking for access to a weapons depository; such weapons could have helped Dallaire defend the endangered [[Tutsi]]s. In 2004, ten years after the genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed, Annan said, "I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3573229.stm|work=BBC News|title=UN chief's Rwanda genocide regret|date=26 March 2004|access-date=4 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701103806/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3573229.stm|archive-date=1 July 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

In his book ''[[Interventions: A Life in War and Peace]]'', Annan again argued that the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations could have made better use of the media to raise awareness of the [[Rwandan genocide|violence in Rwanda]] and put pressure on governments to provide the troops necessary for an intervention. Annan explained that the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|events in Somalia]] and the collapse of the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UNOSOM II mission]] fostered a hesitation among UN Member states to approve robust peacekeeping operations. As a result, when the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UNAMIR mission]] was approved just days after the battle, the resulting force lacked the troop levels, resources and mandate to operate effectively.<ref>Kofi Annan with Nader Mousavizadeh (2012).

===Appointment===

{{Main|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1996}}

In 1996, Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] ran unopposed for a second term. Although he won 14 of the 15 votes on the Security Council, he was vetoed by the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crossette|first1=Barbara|title=Round One in the U.N.

====Recommendations for UN reform====
[[File:Kofi Annan Portrait.JPG|thumb|upright|Silk carpet portrait of Kofi Annan at the UN headquarters]]
Soon after taking office in 1997, Annan released two reports on management reform. On 17 March 1997, the report ''Management and Organisational Measures'' (A/51/829) introduced new management mechanisms through the establishment of a cabinet-style body to assist him and be grouping the UN's activities in accordance with four core missions. A comprehensive reform agenda was issued on 14 July 1997 entitled ''Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform'' (A/51/950). Key proposals included the introduction of strategic management to strengthen unity of purpose, the establishment of the position of Deputy Secretary-General, a 10-percent reduction in posts, a reduction in administrative costs, the consolidation of the UN at the country level, and reaching out to civil society and the private sector as partners. Annan also proposed to hold a Millennium Summit in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Millennium Assembly and the Millennium Summit|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/sg/report/fact.htm|date=March 2000|access-date=30 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616173400/http://www.un.org/millennium/sg/report/fact.htm|archive-date=16 June 2012}}</ref>
After years of research, Annan presented a progress report, ''[[In Larger Freedom]]'', to the UN General Assembly, on 21 March 2005. Annan recommended Security Council expansion and a host of other [[reform of the United Nations|UN reforms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/|title=In Larger Freedom|access-date=12 December 2006|work=United Nations website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213000423/http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/|archive-date=13 December 2006}}</ref>

On 31 January 2006, Annan outlined his vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN in a policy speech to the [[United Nations Association UK]]. The speech, delivered at [[Westminster Central Hall|Central Hall]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], also marked the 60th Anniversary of the first meetings of the General Assembly and Security Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17358&Cr=Iran&Cr1=nuclear|title=Annan addresses UNA-UK in London|access-date=5 August 2007|work=United Nations website|date=February 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808055700/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17358&Cr=Iran&Cr1=nuclear|archive-date=8 August 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 7 March 2006, he presented to the General Assembly his proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the United Nations Secretariat. The reform report is entitled ''Investing in the United Nations, For a Stronger Organization Worldwide''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/reform/|title=Reforming the United Nations|access-date=12 December 2006|work=United Nations website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212212928/http://www.un.org/reform/|archive-date=12 December 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 30 March 2006, he presented to the General Assembly his analysis and recommendations for updating the entire work programme of the United Nations Secretariat. The reform report is entitled: ''Mandating and Delivering: Analysis and Recommendations to Facilitate the Review of Mandates''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/mandatereview|title=Reforming the United Nations, Mandate Review|access-date=12 December 2006|work=United Nations website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213172029/http://www.un.org/mandatereview/|archive-date=13 December 2006}}</ref>

Regarding the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]], Annan said "declining credibility" had "cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system. Unless we re-make our human rights machinery, we may be unable to renew public confidence in the United Nations itself." However, he did believe that, despite its flaws, the council could do good.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Annan|first=Kofi|title=Kofi Annan: Despite flaws, UN Human Rights Council can bring progress|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/1208/Kofi-Annan-Despite-flaws-UN-Human-Rights-Council-can-bring-progress|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=6 December 2012|date=8 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102153928/http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/1208/Kofi-Annan-Despite-flaws-UN-Human-Rights-Council-can-bring-progress|archive-date=2 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Halvorssen|first=Thor|title=Chavez and Nazarbayev Celebrate Tyrannical Victory at U.N.

The Panel further noted that in order to be effective, UN peacekeeping operations must be properly resourced and equipped, and operate under clear, credible and achievable mandates.<ref name=BahimiReport /> In a letter transmitting the report to the General Assembly and Security Council, Annan stated that the Panel's recommendations were essential to make the United Nations truly credible as a force for peace.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Penketh|first1=Anne|title=Annan rewrites the rules for UN peace-keeping|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/annan-rewrites-the-rules-for-un-peace-keeping-711206.html|access-date=19 August 2018|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 August 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819145955/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/annan-rewrites-the-rules-for-un-peace-keeping-711206.html|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that same year, the Security Council adopted several provisions relating to peacekeeping following the report, in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1327|Resolution 1327]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Security Council, responding to 'Brahimi Report', adopts wide-ranging resolution on peacekeeping operations|publisher=United Nations Press Release SC/6948|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20001113.sc6948.doc.html|date=13 November 2000|access-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026030422/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20001113.sc6948.doc.html|archive-date=26 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Millennium Development Goals====
In 2000, Annan issued a report entitled: "We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the 21st century".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga1uFYKbfdYC&lpg=PA9|title=Globalisation, Poverty and Conflict: A Critical 'Development' Reader |editor=Max Spoor|author=Jan Pronk|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2006|access-date=19 August 2018|isbn=9781402028588|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819182233/https://books.google.be/books?id=ga1uFYKbfdYC&lpg=PA9|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The report called for member states to "put people at the centre of everything we do.<ref name=TNUN>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TMlDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA105|title=The New United Nations: International Organization in the Twenty-First Century |author=John Allphin Moore, Jr |author2=Jerry Pubantz|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2017|page=105|access-date=19 August 2018|isbn=9781317288435|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819182205/https://books.google.be/books?id=6TMlDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA105|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> No calling is more noble, and no responsibility greater, than that of enabling men, women and children, in cities and villages around the world, to make their lives better".<ref name=WTP>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/pastevents/pdfs/We_The_Peoples.pdf|title="We the peoples" — The role of the United Nations in the 21st Century|year=2000|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623053539/http://www.un.org/en/events/pastevents/pdfs/We_The_Peoples.pdf|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|7}}

In the final chapter of the report, Annan called to "free our fellow men and women from the abject and dehumanizing poverty in which more than 1 billion of them are currently confined".{{r|WTP|p=77}}

At the [[Millennium Summit]] in September 2000, national leaders adopted the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]], which was subsequently implemented by the [[United Nations Secretariat]] as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYR2s9xeG4oC&lpg=PP1|title=Millennium Development Goals: Achievements and Prospects of Meeting the Targets in Africa|publisher=African Books Collective|author=F.

====United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS)====

Within the "We the Peoples" document, Annan suggested the establishment of a United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS), a consortium of high-tech [[Volunteering|volunteer]] corps, including [[NetCorps]] Canada and Net Corps America, which [[United Nations Volunteers]] would co-ordinate. In the [https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/docs/2000/e2000-55.pdf Report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology] (22 May 2000) suggesting a [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force|UN ICT Task Force]], the panel welcomed the establishment of UNITeS, and made suggestions on its configuration and implementation strategy, including that ICT4D [[volunteering]] opportunities make mobilizing "national human resources" (local ICT experts) within developing countries a priority, for both men and women. The initiative was launched at the [[United Nations Volunteers]] and was active from February 2001 to February 2005. Initiative staff and volunteers participated in the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in [[Geneva]] in December 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unites.org/|title=UNITeS|access-date=9 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831085541/http://www.unites.org/|archive-date=31 August 2004}}</ref>

====The United Nations Global Compact====
In an address to The World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999, Secretary-General Annan argued that the "goals of the United Nations and those of business can, indeed, be mutually supportive" and proposed that the private sector and the United Nations initiate "a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market".<ref name="uncg_address">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/1999/19990201.sgsm6881.html|title=SECRETARY-GENERAL PROPOSES GLOBAL COMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOUR, ENVIRONMENT, IN ADDRESS TO WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN DAVOS|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205135136/http://www.un.org/press/en/1999/19990201.sgsm6881.html|archive-date=5 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 26 July 2000, the [[United Nations Global Compact]] was officially launched at UN headquarters in New York. It is a principle-based framework for businesses which aims to "Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)".<ref name="unglobalcompact">{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/index.html|title=About the UN Global Compact|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611101210/https://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/index.html|archive-date=11 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Compact established ten core principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption, and under the Compact, companies commit to the ten principles and are brought together with UN agencies, labour groups and civil society to effectively implement them.

====Establishment of The Global Fund====
Towards the end of the 1990s, increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda. In April 2001, Annan issued a five-point "Call to Action" to address the HIV/AIDS [[pandemic]]. Stating it was a "personal priority", Annan proposed the establishment of a [[Global AIDS and Health Fund]], "dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2001/SGSM7779R1.doc.htm|title=SECRETARY-GENERAL PROPOSES GLOBAL FUND FOR FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT AFRICAN LEADERS SUMMIT|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101052503/http://www.un.org/press/en/2001/SGSM7779R1.doc.htm|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV/AIDS crisis.

====Responsibility to Protect====
Following the failure of Annan and the International Community to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda and in Srebrenica, Annan asked whether the international community had an obligation in such situations to intervene to protect civilian populations. In a speech to the General Assembly on 20 September 1999 "to address the prospects for human security and intervention in the next century,"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990920.sgsm7136.html|title=SECRETARY-GENERAL PRESENTS HIS ANNUAL REPORT TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707155757/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990920.sgsm7136.html|archive-date=7 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Annan argued that individual sovereignty—the protections afforded by the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the UN—was being strengthened, while the notion of state sovereignty was being redefined by globalization and international co-operation. As a result, the UN and its member states had to consider a willingness to act to prevent conflict and civilian suffering,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcZvAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA73|title=Humanitarian Intervention and the United Nations|author=Norrie MacQueen|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|access-date=19 August 2018|isbn=9780748687893|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819182247/https://books.google.be/books?id=dcZvAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA73|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> a dilemma between "two concepts of sovereignty" that Annan also presented in a preceding article in ''[[The Economist]]'', on 16 September 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/international/1999/09/16/two-concepts-of-sovereignty|title=BY INVITATION:Two concepts of sovereignty|author=Kofi Annan|newspaper=The Economist|date=16 September 2018|access-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819182414/https://www.economist.com/international/1999/09/16/two-concepts-of-sovereignty|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2001 the Canadian government established an ad hoc committee to address this balance between state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention. The [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] published its final report in 2001, which focused on not on the right of states to intervene but a responsibility to protect populations at risk. The report moved beyond the question of military intervention, arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations.<ref name=":0" />

In 2005, Annan included the doctrine of "[[Responsibility to Protect]]" in his report ''[https://www.un.org/en/events/pastevents/in_larger_freedom.shtml|In Larger Freedom]''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml|title=Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227160640/http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> When that report was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, it amounted to the first formal endorsement by UN Member States of the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/about-rtop/the-un-and-rtop|title=The UN and RtoP|website=www.responsibilitytoprotect.org|access-date=17 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114211759/http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/about-rtop/the-un-and-rtop|archive-date=14 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Iraq====
In the years after 1998 when UNSCOM was expelled by the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] and during the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], in which the United States blamed [[UNSCOM]] and former IAEA director [[Hans Blix]] for failing to properly disarm Iraq, former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector [[Scott Ritter]] blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive to the demands of the Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, severely hampering UNSCOM's ability to co-operate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emperors-clothes.com/analysis/ritter-nuke-sen.htm|title=Transcript of Scott Ritter's September 3, 1998 Senate testimony|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212035901/http://emperors-clothes.com/analysis/ritter-nuke-sen.htm|archive-date=12 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Chief U.N.

He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]] headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/ritter.html|title=The Iraqi Threat: How Real Is It?|access-date=6 January 2011|date=October 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091228/http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/ritter.html|archive-date=11 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the build-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Annan called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the United Nations. In a September 2004 interview on the [[BBC]], when questioned about the legal authority for the invasion, Annan said he believed it was not in conformity with the UN charter and was illegal.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Iraq war illegal, says Annan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134.stm|work=BBC News|date=16 September 2004|access-date=12 December 2006|quote="When pressed on whether he viewed the invasion of Iraq as illegal, he said: 'Yes, if you wish.

====Other diplomatic activities====
In 1998, Annan was deeply involved in supporting the transition from military to civilian rule in [[Nigeria]]. The following year, he supported the efforts of [[East Timor]] to secure independence from Indonesia. In 2000, he was responsible for certifying Israel 's withdrawal from Lebanon, and in 2006, he led talks in New York between the presidents of [[Cameroon]] and Nigeria which led to a settlement of the dispute between the two countries over the [[Bakassi]] peninsula.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stateless in Bakassi: How a Changed Border Left Inhabitants Adrift|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stateless-bakassi-how-changed-border-left-inhabitants-adrift|website=Open Society Foundations|language=en|access-date=18 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819052557/https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stateless-bakassi-how-changed-border-left-inhabitants-adrift|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Annan and Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] disagreed sharply on Iran's nuclear program, on an Iranian exhibition of cartoons mocking the Holocaust, and on the then upcoming [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]], an Iranian [[Holocaust denial]] conference in 2006.<ref name="cbc.ca">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2006/09/03/annan-iran.html|work=[[CBC News]]|title=Iranian PM snubs Annan over nuclear program|date=3 September 2006|access-date=24 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117154024/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2006/09/03/annan-iran.html|archive-date=17 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> During a visit to Iran instigated by continued Iranian uranium enrichment, Annan said "I think the tragedy of the Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact and we should really accept that fact and teach people what happened in World War II and ensure it is never repeated."<ref name="cbc.ca"/>

Beginning in 1998, Annan convened an annual UN "Security Council Retreat" with the 15 States' representatives of the council. It was held at the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] (RBF) Conference Center at the [[Rockefeller family]] estate in [[Pocantico Hills, New York]], and was sponsored by both the RBF and the UN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbf.org/grants/programs/pocconference_2005_F.html|title=Pocantico Conferences 2005|access-date=12 December 2006|work=[[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001030415/http://www.rbf.org/grants/programs/pocconference_2005_F.html|archive-date=1 October 2006}}</ref>

====Lubbers sexual-harassment investigation====
In June 2004, Annan was given a copy of the [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS) report on the complaint brought by four female workers against [[Ruud Lubbers]], [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]], for [[sexual harassment]], abuse of authority, and retaliation. The report also reviewed a long-serving staff member's allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter, Director of UNHCR Personnel. The investigation found Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment; no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official, or two subsequent complaints filed later that year. In the course of the official investigation, Lubbers wrote a letter which some considered was a threat to the female worker who had brought the charges.<ref>{{Cite news|title=UN report slams Lubbers for 'regular sexual harassment'|url=http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=17094&name=UN+report+slams+Lubbers+over+sexual+harassment|work=Expatica|date=18 February 2005|access-date=12 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514235934/http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=17094&name=UN+report+slams+Lubbers+over+sexual+harassment|archive-date=14 May 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 15 July 2004, Annan cleared Lubbers of the accusations, saying they were not substantial enough legally.<ref>{{cite news|author=FIONA FLECK and WARREN HOGE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/world/annan-clears-refugee-chief-of-harassment-accusations.html|title=Annan Clears Refugee Chief Of Harassment Accusations|work=Nytimes.com|date=16 July 2004|access-date=29 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514094354/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/world/annan-clears-refugee-chief-of-harassment-accusations.html|archive-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The internal UN-OIOS report on Lubbers was leaked, and sections accompanied by an article by [[Kate Holt]] were published in a British newspaper.

====Oil-for-Food scandal====
In December 2004, reports surfaced that the Secretary-General's son [[Kojo Annan]] received payments from the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, which had won a lucrative contract under the UN [[Oil-for-Food Programme]]. Kofi Annan called for an investigation to look into the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Laurence|first1=Charles|last2=Gilmore|first2=Inigo|title=Kofi Annan calls for full oil-for-food 'scandal' inquiry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1457428/Kofi-Annan-calls-for-full-oil-for-food-scandal-inquiry.html|access-date=19 August 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820074557/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1457428/Kofi-Annan-calls-for-full-oil-for-food-scandal-inquiry.html|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On 11 November 2005, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' agreed to apologise and pay a substantial sum in damages to Kojo Annan, accepting that the allegations were untrue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/11/sundaytimes.pressandpublishing|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Sunday Times pays out over Annan story|date=11 November 2005|access-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819214239/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/11/sundaytimes.pressandpublishing|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In his first interview with the Inquiry Committee, Annan denied having had a meeting with Cotecna. Later in the inquiry, he recalled that he had met with Cotecna's chief executive Elie-Georges Massey twice. In a final report issued on 27 October, the committee found insufficient evidence to indict Kofi Annan on any illegal actions, but did find fault with [[Benon Sevan]], an [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian-Cypriot]] national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years. Appointed by Annan to the Oil-For-Food role, Sevan repeatedly asked Iraqis for allocations of oil to the African Middle East Petroleum Company. Sevan's behavior was "ethically improper", Volcker said to reporters. Sevan repeatedly denied the charges and argued that he was being made a "[[Scapegoating|scapegoat]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243909,00.html|title=Former U.N.

===Nobel Peace Prize===
{{see also|List of honours and awards received by Kofi Annan}}
In 2001, its centennial year, the [[Nobel Committee]] decided that the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace Prize]] was to be divided between the UN and Annan. They were awarded the Peace Prize "for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world,"<ref name=NobelLaur /> having revitalized the UN and for having given priority to human rights. The Nobel Committee also recognized his commitment to the struggle to containing the spread of HIV in Africa and his declared opposition to international terrorism.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Doubek |first1=James |title=Kofi Annan, Former U.N.

On 19 September 2006, Annan gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the [[United Nations headquarters|UN headquarters]] in New York, in anticipation of his retirement on 31 December. In the speech he outlined three major problems of "an unjust world economy, world disorder, and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law", which he believed "have not resolved, but sharpened" during his time as Secretary-General. He also pointed to violence in Africa, and the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] as two major issues warranting attention.<ref>{{cite news|first=Evelyn|last=Leopold|title=UN's Annan depicts polarized world in farewell speech|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-09-19T173615Z_01_N19388437_RTRUKOC_0_US-UN-ASSEMBLY-ANNAN.xml&archived=False&src=091906_1412_ARTICLE_PROMO_also_on_reuters |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20110216014707/http://www.reuters.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 February 2011|work=Reuters|date=16 September 2006|access-date=12 December 2006}}</ref>

==Post-UN career==
After his service as UN Secretary-General, Annan took up residence in [[Geneva]] and worked in a leading capacity on various international humanitarian endeavors.<ref>{{cite news|title=Annan fühlte sich in der Schweiz zu Hause|url=https://www.derbund.ch/ausland/annan-fuehlte-sich-in-der-schweiz-zu-hause/story/12259977|access-date=18 August 2018|work=[[Der Bund]]|date=18 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818165331/https://www.derbund.ch/ausland/Annan-fuehlte-sich-in-der-Schweiz-zu-Hause/story/12259977|archive-date=18 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Kofi Annan Foundation===
{{main|Kofi Annan Foundation}}
In 2007, Annan established the [[Kofi Annan Foundation]], an independent, not-for-profit organization that works to promote better global governance and strengthen the capacities of people and countries to achieve a fairer, more peaceful world.<ref>{{cite web |title=How we work: Towards a fairer, more peaceful world |url=https://www.kofiannanfoundation.org/our-work/#our-areas-of-work |publisher=Kofi Annan Foundation |access-date=19 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818095114/https://www.kofiannanfoundation.org/our-work/#our-areas-of-work |archive-date=18 August 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The organisation was founded on the principles that fair and peaceful societies rest on three pillars: Peace and Security, Sustainable Development, and Human Rights and the Rule of Law, and they have made it their mission to mobilise the leadership and the political resolve needed to tackle threats to these three pillars ranging from violent conflict to flawed elections and climate change, with the aim of achieving a fairer, more peaceful world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://kofiannanfoundation.org/foundation/mission-statement|website=Kofi Annan Foundation|access-date=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316001041/http://kofiannanfoundation.org/foundation/mission-statement|archive-date=16 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Foundation provides the analytical, communication and co-ordination capacities needed to ensure that these objectives are achieved. Annan's contribution to peace worldwide is delivered through mediation, political mentoring, advocacy and advice. Through his engagement, Annan aimed to strengthen local and international conflict resolution capabilities. The Foundation provides the analytical and logistical support to facilitate this in co-operation with relevant local, regional and international actors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/kofi-annan-foundation|title=Kofi Annan Foundation – GPPlatform|access-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101052503/http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/kofi-annan-foundation|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Foundation works mainly through [[private diplomacy]], where Annan provided informal counsel and participated in discreet diplomatic initiatives to avert or resolve crises by applying his experience and inspirational leadership. He was often asked to intercede in crises, sometimes as an impartial independent mediator, sometimes as a special envoy of the international community.

In 2018, before Annan's death, Myanmar's civilian government, under the direction of State Councilor [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], made a gesture of acceptance of the Annan commission's recommendations by convening another board – the [[Advisory Commission on Rakhine State|Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State]] – ostensibly to implement the Annan commission's proposed reforms, but never actually implemented them. Some of the international representatives resigned – notably the panel's Secretary, [[Thailand]]'s former foreign minister [[Surakiart Sathirathai]], and former U.S. ambassador to the U.N.
