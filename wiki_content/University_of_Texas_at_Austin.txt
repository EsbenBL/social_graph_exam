The '''University of Texas at Austin''' ('''UT Austin''', '''UT''', or '''Texas''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Austin, Texas]], founded in 1883. The University of Texas was included in the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1929. The institution is composed of over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and over 24,000 faculty and staff.

It is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures totaling $679.8&nbsp;million for fiscal year 2018.<ref name="nsf_2018"/><ref name="utsystem.edu" /> The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|LBJ Presidential Library]] and the [[Blanton Museum of Art]], and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the [[J. J. Pickle Research Campus]] and the [[McDonald Observatory]]. As of November 2020, 13 Nobel Prize winners, four [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, two Turing Award winners, two Fields medalists, two [[Wolf Prize]] winners, and [[Abel Prize|two Abel prize winners]] have been affiliated with the school as alumni, faculty members or researchers. The university has also been affiliated with three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] winners, and as of 2021 its students and alumni have earned a total of [[List of American universities with Olympic medals|155 Olympic medals]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Texas Athletics completes Tokyo Olympics with 9 total medals, including 5 gold|url=https://texassports.com/news/2021/8/9/texas-athletics-texas-completes-tokyo-olympics-with-9-total-medals-including-5-gold.aspx|access-date=2021-08-21|website=University of Texas Athletics|language=en}}</ref>

Student-athletes compete as the [[Texas Longhorns]]. The Longhorns have won four [[NCAA Division I]] National Football Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball Championships, thirteen NCAA Division I National Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, and has claimed more titles in men's and women's sports than any other school in the former Big 12.

==History==
{{Main|History of the University of Texas at Austin}}

===Establishment===
The first mention of a public university in Texas can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. Although Title 6, Article 217 of the Constitution promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/constitcoatex.htm|title=Sons of Dewitt County, The Constitution of Coahuila and Texas|access-date=January 31, 2015|publisher=Wallace L. McKeehan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321034845/http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/constitcoatex.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> no action was taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its [[Texas Declaration of Independence|independence]] from Mexico in 1836, the Texas Congress adopted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas|Constitution of the Republic]], which, under Section 5 of its General Provisions, stated "It shall be the duty of Congress, as soon as circumstances will permit, to provide, by law, a general system of education."<ref name="TX_const_1836">{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1836/general_provisions|title=Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836)|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=Tarlton Library, Jamail Center for Legal Research, [[University of Texas School of Law|School of Law]], University of Texas at Austin|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104954/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1836/general_provisions|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>

On April 18, 1838, "An Act to Establish the University of Texas" was referred to a special committee of the [[Texas Legislature|Texas Congress]], but was not reported back for further action.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=John J.|title=History of Education in Texas|publisher=United States Bureau of Economics|date=1903|page=124}}</ref> On January 26, 1839, the Texas Congress agreed to set aside fifty [[league (unit)|leagues]] of land—approximately {{Convert|288000|acre}}—towards the establishment of a publicly funded university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6726/m1/139/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822–1897 Volume 2|year=1898|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202185416/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6726/m1/139/|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, {{convert|40|acre}} in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill".<ref name="TSHA" /> (The term "Forty Acres" is colloquially used to refer to the University as a whole.

In 1845, Texas was [[Texas Annexation|annexed]] into the United States. The state's Constitution of 1845 failed to mention higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1845|title=Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1845)|access-date=January 31, 2015|publisher=Tarlton Library, Jamail Center for Legal Research, [[University of Texas School of Law|School of Law]], University of Texas at Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219162409/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1845|archive-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> On February 11, 1858, the Seventh Texas Legislature approved O.B. 102, an act to establish the University of Texas, which set aside $100,000 in United States [[bond (finance)|bonds]] toward construction of the state's first publicly funded university<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1024/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822–1897 Volume 4|year=1898|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201043224/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1024/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> (the $100,000 was an allocation from the $10&nbsp;million the state received pursuant to the [[Compromise of 1850]] and Texas's relinquishing claims to lands outside its present boundaries). The legislature also designated land reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction toward the university's endowment. On January 31, 1860, the state legislature, wanting to avoid raising taxes, passed an act authorizing the money set aside for the University of Texas to be used for frontier defense in west Texas to protect settlers from the alleged attacks of Native peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1395/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822–1897 Volume 4|year=1898|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201043230/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1395/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Texas's [[secession]] from the Union and the [[American Civil War]] delayed repayment of the borrowed monies. At the end of the Civil War in 1865, The University of Texas's endowment was just over $16,000 in warrants<ref>{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Charles Ray|title=The Early Years of the Permanent University Fund from 1836 to 1937|publisher=UMI (UMI Number 3284727)|date=2006|page=32}}</ref> and nothing substantive had been done to organize the university's operations. This effort to establish a University was again mandated by Article 7, Section 10 of the [[Constitution of Texas|Texas Constitution of 1876]] which directed the legislature to "establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and direction of a university of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people of this State, and styled "The University of Texas".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1876/a7|title=Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1876)|access-date=January 31, 2015|publisher=Tarlton Library, Jamail Center for Legal Research, [[University of Texas School of Law|School of Law]], University of Texas at Austin|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001624/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1876/a7|archive-date=February 1, 2015 }}</ref>

Additionally, Article 7, Section 11 of the 1876 Constitution established the [[Permanent University Fund]], a sovereign wealth fund managed by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas and dedicated to the maintenance of the university. Because some state legislators perceived an extravagance in the construction of academic buildings of other universities, Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature from using the state's general revenue to fund construction of university buildings. Funds for constructing university buildings had to come from the university's endowment or from private gifts to the university, but the university's operating expenses could come from the state's general revenues.
[[File:Old Main Building at The University of Texas at Austin .jpg|right|thumb|The university's Old Main building in 1903]]

The 1876 Constitution also revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858, but dedicated {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} of land, along with other property appropriated for the university, to the Permanent University Fund. This was greatly to the detriment of the university as the lands the Constitution of 1876 granted the university represented less than 5% of the value of the lands granted to the university under the Act of 1858 (the lands close to the railroads were quite valuable, while the lands granted the university were in far west Texas, distant from sources of transportation and water).<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=John J.|title=History of Education in Texas|publisher=United States Bureau of Economics|date=1903|page=144}}</ref> The more valuable lands reverted to the fund to support general education in the state (the Special School Fund).

On April 10, 1883, the legislature supplemented the Permanent University Fund with another {{Convert|1000000|acre|ha}} of land in west Texas granted to the Texas and Pacific Railroad but returned to the state as seemingly too worthless to even survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/379/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822–1897 Volume 9|year=1898|access-date=January 30, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201020004/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/379/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The legislature additionally appropriated $256,272.57 to repay the funds taken from the university in 1860 to pay for frontier defense and for transfers to the state's General Fund in 1861 and 1862.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Charles Ray|title=The Early Years of the Permanent University Fund from 1836 to 1937|publisher=UMI (UMI Number 3284727)|date=2006|page=24}}</ref> The 1883 grant of land increased the land in the Permanent University Fund to almost 2.2&nbsp;million acres. Under the Act of 1858, the university was entitled to just over {{Convert|1000|acre|ha}} of land for every mile of railroad built in the state. Had the 1876 Constitution not revoked the original 1858 grant of land, by 1883, the university lands would have totaled 3.2&nbsp;million acres,<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=John J.|title=History of the University of Texas: Based on Facts and Records|publisher=Henry Hutchings, Texas State Printer|date=1891|page=77}}</ref> so the 1883 grant was to restore lands taken from the university by the 1876 Constitution, not an act of munificence.

On March 30, 1881, the legislature set forth the university's structure and organization and called for an election to establish its location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/173/|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822–1897 Volume 9|year=1898|access-date=February 2, 2015|publisher=H.P.N Gammel of Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204003959/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6729/m1/173/|archive-date=February 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> By popular election on September 6, 1881,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the UT System Board of Regents|url=https://www.utsystem.edu/board-of-regents/history-ut-system-board-regents|website=The University of Texas System|date=June 18, 2018|access-date=July 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720051656/https://www.utsystem.edu/board-of-regents/history-ut-system-board-regents|archive-date=July 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Austin (with 30,913 votes) was chosen as the site.

University President [[Ashbel Smith]], presiding over the ceremony, prophetically proclaimed "Texas holds embedded in its earth rocks and minerals which now lie idle because unknown, resources of incalculable industrial utility, of wealth and power. Smite the earth, smite the rocks with the rod of knowledge and fountains of unstinted wealth will gush forth."<ref>{{cite book|last=Silverthorne|first=Elizabeth|title=Ashbel Smith of Texas: Pioneer, Patriot, Statesman, 1805–1886|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|date=1982|page=219}}</ref> The University of Texas officially opened its doors on September 15, 1883.

===Expansion and growth===
In 1890, [[George Washington Brackenridge]] donated $18,000 for the construction of a three-story brick mess hall known as Brackenridge Hall (affectionately known as "B.Hall"), one of the university's most storied buildings and one that played an important place in university life until its demolition in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|title=UT's most storied building uncovered|url=https://www.utexas.edu/know/2010/07/15/brackenridge_hall_history/|access-date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329014354/http://www.utexas.edu/know/2010/07/15/brackenridge_hall_history/|archive-date=March 29, 2015|url-status=dead }}</ref>

The old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building]] served as the central point of the campus's {{convert|40|acre|adj=on}} site, and was used for nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

In 1910, George Washington Brackenridge again displayed his philanthropy, this time donating {{convert|500|acre|ha}} on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] to the university. A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing. Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract. The [[Brackenridge Field Laboratory]] was established on {{convert|82|acre|ha}} of the land in 1967.
[[File:UT architecture library.jpg|thumb|UT Architecture Library]]
In 1916, Gov. [[James E. Ferguson]] became involved in a serious quarrel with the University of Texas. The controversy grew out of the board of regents' refusal to remove certain faculty members whom the governor found objectionable. When Ferguson found he could not have his way, he vetoed practically the entire appropriation for the university. Without sufficient funding, the university would have been forced to close its doors. In the middle of the controversy, Ferguson's critics brought to light a number of irregularities on the part of the governor. Eventually, the Texas House of Representatives prepared 21 charges against Ferguson, and the Senate convicted him on 10 of them, including misapplication of public funds and receiving $156,000 from an unnamed source. The Texas Senate removed Ferguson as governor and declared him ineligible to hold office.<ref>{{cite HOT|first=Ralph W.|last=Steen|title=Ferguson, James Edward|id=ffe05|date=February 24, 2016|orig-year=June 12, 2010}}</ref>

In 1921, the legislature appropriated $1.35&nbsp;million for the purchase of land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well<ref>{{cite HOT|title=Santa Rita Oil Well|id=dos01|first=Julia Cauble|last=Smith|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> and the discovery of [[petroleum|oil]] on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income from Permanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, which allowed the legislature to address funding for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as [[Texas A&M University]]).

===1966 shooting===

{{Main|University of Texas tower shooting}}
On August 1, 1966, Texas student [[Charles Whitman]] barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building. Armed with multiple firearms, he killed 14 people on campus, 11 from the observation deck and below the clocks on the tower, and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two others inside the observation deck. The massacre ended when Whitman was shot and killed by police after they breached the tower.

After the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower dedicated to those affected by the tragedy.

===Recent history===
The first [[presidential library]] on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971, with former [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]], [[Lady Bird Johnson]] and then-President [[Richard Nixon]] in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] is one of 13 presidential libraries administered by the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

A statue of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was unveiled on campus in 1999 and subsequently vandalized.<ref name="deconstructingracismslattery">{{cite journal|last=Slattery|first=Patrick|title=Deconstructing Racism One Statue at a Time: Visual Culture Wars at Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin|journal=Visual Arts Research|volume=32|issue=2|pages=28–31|jstor=20715415|date=2006 }}</ref> By 2004, John Butler, a professor at the [[McCombs School of Business]] suggested moving it to [[Morehouse College]], a historically black college, "a place where he is loved".<ref name="deconstructingracismslattery" />

The University of Texas at Austin has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the [[Blanton Museum of Art]].<ref>The University of Texas at Austin Visitor's Guide, 2008, p. 21</ref> In August 2008, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, [[Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium]] was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of Texas at the time.

On January 19, 2011, the university announced the creation of a 24-hour television network in partnership with [[ESPN]], dubbed the [[Longhorn Network]]. ESPN agreed to pay a $300&nbsp;million guaranteed rights fee over 20 years to the university and to IMG College, the school's multimedia rights partner. The network covers the university's intercollegiate athletics, music, cultural arts, and academics programs.

===Admission===
The University of Texas at Austin is one of the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin is second to [[Rice University]] in selectivity according to a ''[[American City Business Journals|Business Journal]]'' study weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT. The University of Texas at Austin was ranked as the 18th most selective in the South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/12/vanderbilt-duke-sit-atop-souths.html?appSession=661298019421031|title=The colleges in the South with the toughest admission standards – The Business Journals|publisher=Bizjournals.com|access-date=December 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216175329/http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/12/vanderbilt-duke-sit-atop-souths.html?appSession=661298019421031|archive-date=December 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> As a state public university, UT Austin was subject to [[Texas House Bill 588]], which guaranteed Texas high school seniors graduating in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT Austin (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university currently admits the top 6 percent.<ref>{{cite web|title=The University of Texas at Austin to Automatically Admit Top 8 Percent of High School Graduates for 2011|url=https://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/09/16/top8_percent/|access-date=April 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419073139/http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/09/16/top8_percent/|archive-date=April 19, 2010|url-status=dead }}</ref> Furthermore, students admitted under [[Texas House Bill 588]] are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only guaranteed admission to the university as a whole.

===Endowment===
[[File:Nhb utexas.jpg|thumb|The Norman Hackerman Building]]
{{Main|Permanent University Fund}}
Thirty percent of the university's endowment comes from [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF), with nearly $15&nbsp;billion in assets {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.<ref>[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html As required by the Texas Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123143431/http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html|date=November 23, 2005 }}</ref> The University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the ''Available University Fund'', the name of the annual distribution of PUF's income.

By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, UT gets 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service [[bond (finance)|bonds]], some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus.<ref>[https://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101111529/http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf|date=November 1, 2005}}</ref> The Regents can change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share to goes to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.

Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas' two university systems, the University of Texas System and the [[Texas A&M University System]]; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2&nbsp;billion to the university's total endowment.

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs.

On June 12, 2020, UT student-athletes banded together with their #WeAreOne statement on Twitter. Among the list of changes included: renaming certain campus buildings, replacing statues, starting outreach programs, and replacing "The Eyes of Texas." UT Interim President Jay Hartzell released a statement on July 13, 2020, announcing the changes to be implemented in light of these demands from UT student-athletes. Hartzell said the university would make a multi-million dollar investment to programs that recruit, retain and support Black students; rename the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and Astronomy Building; honor Heman M. Sweatt in numerous ways, including placing a statue of Sweatt near the entrance of  T.S. Painter Hall; honor the Precursors''',''' the first Black undergraduates to attend The University of Texas at Austin, by commissioning a new monument on the East Mall; erect a statue for [[Julius Whittier]], the Longhorns’ first Black football letterman, at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium; and more. However, one of the most controversial topics on the list – replacing "The Eyes of Texas" as UT's alma mater – remained untouched.<ref>{{Cite web|title=University of Texas announces numerous changes among student-athletes requests, keeps 'The Eyes of Texas'|url=https://www.kvue.com/article/sports/ncaa/longhorns/texas-longhorns-ut-austin-changes-athletes-eyes-of-texas-stays/269-85fd1b0c-c5dd-4d7e-818f-ec5750d3f8ea|access-date=July 20, 2020|website=kvue.com|language=en-US}}</ref>
