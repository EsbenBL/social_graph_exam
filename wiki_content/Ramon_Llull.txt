'''Ramon Llull'''{{efn|[[Anglicised]] as ''Raymond Lully'', ''Raymond Lull''; [[Onomastic Latinization|Latinized]] as ''Raimundus'', or ''Raymundus Lullus'', or ''Raimundo Lulio'', or ''Lullius''}} {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Third Order of Saint Francis|TOSF]]}} ({{IPA-ca|rəˈmoɲ ˈʎuʎ|lang}}; c. 1232<ref>Born 1232 per Mark D. Johnston in ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge, 1998. Older sources (such as versions of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' at least up to 1955) give 1235; the current ''Britannica'' gives 1232/33.</ref> – c. 1315/16) was a Spanish [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], [[poet]], [[missionary]], and Christian apologist from the [[Kingdom of Majorca]].

He invented a philosophical system known as the ''Art'', conceived as a type of universal logic to prove the truth of Christian doctrine to interlocutors of all faiths and nationalities. The ''Art'' consists of a set of general principles and combinatorial operations. It is illustrated with diagrams.

Considered one of the fathers of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] literature, he is thought to be the first to use a vernacular language to express philosophical, scientific, and technical ideas. He wrote in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Latin]], and possibly [[Arabic]] (although no texts in Arabic survive). Some of his books were translated into [[Occitan]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Castilian]] during his lifetime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Badia |first1=Lola |last2=Santanach |first2=Joan |last3=Soler |first3=Albert |title=Ramon Llull as a Vernacular Writer: Communicating a New Kind of Knowledge |date=2016 |publisher=Tamesis |location=Woodbridge}}</ref>

Posthumously he has enjoyed a varied reputation. In [[Catalonia]] he is considered a saint, but he has also been condemned as a heretic. In the 20th century he figured in a great deal of literature and art, and became known as a precursor of the computer and pioneer of [[computation theory]].<ref name="Philosophy, Vol 1958"/><ref name="artandlogic">{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlH7yaAQHEoC&pg=PA290|author=Anthony Bonner |title=The art and logic of Ramon Llull|page=290|isbn=978-90-04-16325-6|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|year=2007}}</ref><ref name="knuth">{{citation|title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]]: Generating all trees|author=Donald Knuth|author-link=Donald Knuth|page=56|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional  |volume=4-4|year=2006|isbn=978-0-321-33570-8}}</ref>

==Life==
===Early life and family===
[[File:LifeOfRaymondLull14thCentury.JPG|thumb|Life of Raymond Lull; 14th-century manuscript]]
Llull was born into a wealthy family of [[Barcelona]] patricians who had come to the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] in 1229 with the conquering armies of [[James I of Aragon]]. James I had conquered the formerly [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]]-ruled Majorca as part of a larger move to integrate the territories of the  [[Balearic Islands]] (now part of [[Spain]]) into the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Llull was born there a few years later, in 1232 or 1233. Muslims still constituted a large part of the population of Majorca and Jews were present in cultural and economic affairs.{{sfn|Bonner 2007, p. 1}}

In 1257 Llull married Blanca Picany, with whom he had two children, Domènec and Magdalena. Although he formed a family, he lived what he would later call the licentious and wordly life of a [[troubadour]].

===Religious calling===
In 1263 Llull experienced a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]]. He narrates the event in his autobiography ''Vita coaetanea'' ("A Contemporary Life"):

{{quote|Ramon, while still a young man and Seneschal to the King of Majorca, was very given to composing worthless songs and poems and to doing other licentious things. One night he was sitting beside his bed, about to compose and write in his vulgar tongue a song to a lady whom he loved with a foolish love; and as he began to write this song, he looked to his right and saw our Lord [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] on the Cross, as if suspended in mid-air.<ref>Bonner, "Historical Background and Life" (an annotated ''Vita coaetanea'') at 10–11, in Bonner (ed.), ''Doctor Illuminatus'' (1985).</ref>}}

The vision came to Llull five times in all and inspired in him three intentions: to give up his soul for the sake of God’s love and honor, to convert the ‘Saracens’ to Christianity, and write the best book in the world against the errors of the unbelievers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Llull |first1=Ramon |title=A Contemporary Life, Edited and translated by Anthony Bonner |date=2010 |publisher=Tamesis |location=Barcelona/Woodbridge |isbn=9781855661998 |pages=33–35}}</ref>

Following his visions he sold his possessions on the model of Saint  [[Francis of Assisi]] and set out on pilgrimages to the shrines of Saint Mary of [[Rocamadour]], [[James the Great|Saint James]], and other places, never to come back to his family and profession. When he returned to Majorca he purchased a Muslim slave in order to learn Arabic from him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Llull |first1=Ramon |title=A Contemporary Life, Edited and translated by Anthony Bonner |date=2010 |publisher=Tamesis |location=Barcelona/Woodbridge |isbn=9781855661998 |pages=37–39}}</ref> For the next nine years, until 1274, he engaged in study and contemplation in relative solitude. He read extensively in both Latin and Arabic, learning both Christian and Muslim theological and philosophical thought.<ref>Churchill, Leigh (2004). The Age of Knights & Friars, Popes & Reformers. Milton Keynes: Authentic Media. {{ISBN|1-84227-279-9}}, 9781842272794. p. 190</ref>

Between 1271 and 1274 Llull wrote his first works, a compendium of the Muslim thinker [[Al-Ghazali]]'s logic and the ''Llibre de contemplació en Déu'' (''Book on the Contemplation of God''), a lengthy guide to finding truth through contemplation.

In 1274, while staying at a hermitage on [[Puig de Randa]], the form of the great book Llull was to write was finally given to him through divine revelation: a complex system that he named his ''Art'', which would become the motivation behind most of his life's efforts.

===Missionary work and education===

About 1291 he went to Tunis, preached to the Saracens, disputed with them in philosophy, and after another brief sojourn in Paris, returned to the East as a missionary.<ref name=Turner>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12670c.htm Turner, William.

He returned in 1308, reporting that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force. He finally achieved his goal of linguistic education at major universities in 1311 when the [[Council of Vienne]] ordered the creation of chairs of [[Hebrew]], [[Arabic]] and Chaldean ([[Aramaic]]) at the universities of [[Bologna]], [[Oxford]], Paris, and [[Salamanca]] as well as at the Papal Court.<ref name="Classen2018" />

===Death===
[[File:Llull4.jpg|thumb|Llull's tomb in Palma]]
In 1314, at the age of 82, Llull traveled again to Tunis, possibly prompted by the correspondence between [[James II of Aragon|King James II of Aragon]] and [[Abd al-Wahid Zakariya ibn al-Lihyani|al-Lihyani]], the [[Hafsid]] [[caliphate|caliph]], indicating that the caliph wished to convert to Christianity. Whereas Llull had been met with difficulties during his previous visits to North Africa, he was allowed to operate this time without interference from the authorities due to the improved relations between Tunis and Aragon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lower |first1=Michael |title=Ibn al-Lihyani: sultan of Tunis and would-be Christian convert (1311–18) |journal=Mediterranean Historical Review |date=2009 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=17–27 |doi=10.1080/09518960903000744|s2cid=161432419 }}</ref>

His last work is dated December 1315 in Tunis. The circumstances of his death remain unknown. He probably died sometime between then and March 1316, either in Tunis, on the ship on the return voyage, or in Majorca upon his return.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Llull |first1=Ramon |title=A Contemporary Life, Edited and translated by Anthony Bonner |date=2010 |publisher=Tamesis |location=Barcelona/Woodbridge |isbn=9781855661998 |pages=10–11}}</ref> Llull's tomb, created in 1448, is in the Franciscan church in Palma, Majorca.<ref>[https://www.illesbalears.travel/tourist-resource/en/mallorca/church-basilica-sant-francesc "Basilica Sant Francesc", Illes Balears]</ref>

==Works==

===Llull’s ''Art''===

Llull’s ''Art'' (in Latin ''Ars'') is at the center of his thought and undergirds his entire corpus. It is a system of universal logic based on a set of general principles activated in a combinatorial process. It can be used to prove statements about God and Creation (i.e. God is a Trinity). Often the ''Art'' formulates these statements as questions and answers (i.e., Q: Is there a Trinity in God? A: Yes.). It works cumulatively through an iterative process; statements about God's nature must be proved for each of His essential attributes in order to prove the statement true for God (i.e., Goodness is threefold, Greatness is threefold, Eternity is threefold, Power is threefold, etc.).

What sets Llull's system apart is its unusual use of letters and diagrams, giving it an algebraic or algorithmic character. He developed the ''Art'' over the course of many decades, writing new books to explain each new version. The ''Art'''s trajectory can be divided into two main phases, although each phase contains numerous variations. The first is sometimes called the Quaternary Phase (1274 - 1290) and the second the Ternary Phase (1290 - 1308).<ref>This terminology was coined by Anthony Bonner: {{cite book |last1=Bonner |first1=Anthony |title=The Art and Logic of Ramon Llull: A User's Guide |date=2007 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden}}</ref> 

====Quaternary Phase====

The two main works of the Quaternary Phase are the ''Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem'' (ca. 1274) and the ''Ars demonstrativa'' (ca. 1283).<ref>Bonner, 2007, 26.</ref> The ''Ars demonstrativa'' has twelve main figures. A set of sixteen principles, or 'dignities' (divine attributes) comprise the general foundation for the system's operation. These are contained in the first figure (Figure A) and assigned letters (B through R). The rest of the figures enable the user to take these principles and elaborate to demonstrate the truth of statements. Figure T is important because it contains "relational principles"(i.e. minority, majority, equality), also assigned letters. The ''Art'' then lists combinations of letters as a sort of visual aid for the process of working through every possible combination of principles. Figure S displays the Augustinian powers of the soul (will, intellect, and memory) and their acts (willing, understanding, remembering). Figure S was eliminated from the ''Art'' after 1290. Even in subsequent versions of the ''Art'' Llull maintained that the powers of the soul needed to be in alignment for a proper operation of the ''Art''. This differentiates Llull's system from Aristotelian logic. Because classical logic did not take the powers of the soul into account it was ill-equipped to handle theological issues, in Llull's view.

====Ternary Phase====

Llull inaugurated the Ternary Phase with two works written in 1290: the ''Ars inventiva veritatis'' and the ''Art amativa''.<ref>Bonner, 2007, 121.</ref> The culmination of this phase came in 1308 with a finalized version of the ''Art'' called the ''Ars generalis ultima''. In the same year Llull wrote an abbreviated version called the ''Ars brevis''. In these works Llull revised the ''Art'' to have only four main figures. He reduced the number of divine principles in the first figure to nine (goodness, greatness, eternity, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth, glory). Figure T also now has nine relational principles (difference, concordance, contrariety, beginning, middle, end, majority, equality, minority), reduced from fifteen. Llull kept the combinatorial aspect of the process.

====Correlatives====

Lull introduced an aspect of the system that called the "correlatives" just before the final transition to the Ternary Phase. The correlatives first appear in a work called the ''Lectura super figuras Artis demonstrativae'' (c.1285-7) and came to undergird his formulation of the [[ontology|nature of being]].<ref>Gayà, Jordi (1979). “La teoría luliana de los correlativos. Historia de su formación conceptual.” Universität Freiburg im Breisgau.</ref> The doctrine of correlatives stipulates that everything, at the level of being, has a threefold structure: agent, patient, act. For example, the divine principle "goodness" consists of "that which does good" (agent), "that which receives good" (patient), and "to do good" (act). Llull developed a system of Latin suffixes to express the correlatives, i.e. ''bonitas'' (goodness); ''bonificans'', ''bonificatus'', ''bonificare''. This became the basis for proving that the divine principles are distinct yet equivalent in God (each principle has the same underlying threefold structure, yet retains its own unique correlatives). This supports the combinatorial operation of the ''Art'' (i.e., this means that in God goodness ''is'' greatness and greatness ''is'' goodness, goodness ''is'' eternity and eternity ''is'' goodness, etc.), the Lullian proof of the [[Trinity]] (each divine principle has the three correlatives and together the principles comprise the Godhead, therefore the Godhead is threefold) and the [[Incarnation]] (the active and passive correlatives are equivalent to matter and form, and the trinitarian unfolding of being occurs on all levels of reality).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pring-Mill |first1=R.D.F. |title=The Trinitarian World Picture of Ramon Lull |journal=Romanistisches Jahrbuch |date=1955 |volume=7 |pages=229–256}}</ref>

===Other Works===

====Influence of Islam and Early Works====

It has been pointed out that the ''Art'''s combinatorial mechanics bear a resemblance to [[zairja]], a device used by medieval Arab astrologers.<ref name="link">Link, David (2010). "Scrambling T-R-U-T-H: Rotating Letters as a Material Form of Thought", in: ''Variantology 4. On Deep Time Relations of Arts, Sciences and Technologies in the Arabic–Islamic World'', eds. Siegfried Zielinski and Eckhard Fürlus (Cologne: König, 2010): 215–266</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lohr |first1=Charles |title=Christianus arabicus, cuius nomen Raimundus Lullus |journal=Freiburger Zeitschrift für Philosophie und Theologie |date=1984 |volume=31 |pages=64-65}}</ref> The Art's reliance on divine attributes also has a certain similarity to the contemplation of the [[Names of God in Islam|ninety-nine Names of God]] in the Muslim tradition.<ref>Lohr, 1984, 63.</ref> Llull's familiarity with the Islamic intellectual tradition is evidenced by the fact that his first work (1271-2) was a compendium of [[Al-Ghazali]]'s logic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lohr |first1=Charles |title=Raimundus Lullus' Compendium Logicae Algazelis. Quellen, Lehre und Stellung in der Geschichte der Logik |date=1967 |publisher=Thesis, Freiburg im Breisgau |pages=93-130}}</ref>

====Dialogues====

From early in his career Llull composed dialogues to enact the procedure of the ''Art''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Friedlein |first1=Roger |title=Der Dialog bei Ramon Llull: Literarische Gestaltung als apologetische Strategie |date=2004 |publisher=M. Niemeyer |location=Tübingen |isbn=3484523182}}</ref> This is linked to the missionary aspect of the ''Art''. Llull conceived it as an instrument to convert all peoples of the world to Christianity and experimented with more popular genres to make it easier to understand. His earliest and most well known dialogue is the ''[[Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men]]'', written in Catalan the 1270s and later translated into Latin. It is framed as a meeting of three wise men (a Muslim, a Jew, and a Christian) and a Gentile in the woods. They learn about the Lullian method when they encounter a set of trees with leaves inscribed with Lullian principles. Lady Intelligence appears and informs them of the properties of the trees and the rules for implementing the leaves. The wise men use the trees to prove their respective Articles of Faith to the Gentile (although some of the Islamic tenets cannot be proved with the Lullian procedure) and in the end the Gentile is converted to Christianity.
Llull also composed many other dialogues. Later in his career when he became concerned with heretical activity in the Arts Faculty of the University of Paris, he wrote "disputations" with philosophers as interlocutors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Steenberghen |first1=Fernand |title=La signification de l’oeuvre anti-averroiste de Raymond Lull |journal=Estudios Lulianos |date=1960 |volume=4 |pages=113–28}}</ref><ref>Imbach, Ruedi (1987). “Lulle face aux Averroïstes parisiens,” in ''Raymond Lulle et le pays d’Oc''. Toulouse: Privat, pp. 261–82.</ref> He also created a character for himself and he stars in many of these dialogues as the Christian wise man (for instance: ''Liber de quaestione valde alta et profunda'', composed in 1311).

====Trees====

Llull structured many of his works around trees. In some, like the ''Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men'', the "leaves" of the trees stand for the combinatorial elements (principles) of the ''Art''. In other works a series of trees shows how the ''Art'' generates all ("encyclopedic") knowledge. The ''[[Tree of Science (Ramon Llull)|Tree of Science]]'' (1295-6) comprises sixteen trees ranging from earthly and moral to divine and pedagogical.<ref> English translation by Yanis Dambergs: https://lullianarts.narpan.net/TreeOfScience/TreeOfScience-1.pdf and https://lullianarts.narpan.net/TreeOfScience/TreeOfScience2.pdf</ref> Each tree is divided into seven parts (roots, trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruits). The roots always consist of the Lullian divine principles and from there the tree grows into the differentiated aspects of its respective category of reality.<ref>Anthony Bonner, "The structure of the Arbor scientiae". Arbor Scientiae: der Baum des Wissens von Ramon Lull. Akten des Internationalen Kongresses aus Anlass des 40-jährigen Jubiläums des Raimundus-Lullus-Instituts der Universität Freiburg i. Br., ed. Fernando Domínguez Reboiras, Pere Villalba Varneda and Peter Walter, "Instrumenta Patristica et Mediaevalia. Subsidia Lulliana" 1 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2002), pp. 21-34.</ref>

====Novels====

Llull also wrote narrative prose drawing on the literary traditions of his time ([[Epic poetry|epic]], [[Chivalric romance|romance]]) to express the ''Art''. These works were intended to communicate the potentially complex operations of the ''Art'' to a lay audience. ''[[Blanquerna]]'' (c.1276-83) is his most well known novel. ''Felix'' (1287-9) is also notable, although it was not widely circulated during his lifetime and only available in Catalan. It is formulated as a sort of ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' in which Felix, the main character, begins on a journey at the instigation of his father who has written the "Book of Wonders". The book is divided into ten chapters (echoing the encyclopedic range of the Tree of Science) as Felix gains knowledge: God, angels, heavens, elements, plans, minerals, animals, man, Paradise, and Hell. It turns out to be a [[metafiction]], as Felix's journey ends at a monastery where he relates the "Book of Wonders" now embellished and fused with the account of his own adventures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dominguez |first1=Fernando |title=Felix Summary |url=http://www.ub.edu/llulldb/bo.asp?bo=II%2EB%2E15 |website=Ramon Llull Database |access-date=14 August 2021}}</ref>

==Reception==
{{See also|Lullism}}
===Medieval===
====Academic Theology====
According to Llull's autobiographical ''Vita'', his ''Art'' was not received well at the University of Paris when he first presented it there in the 1280s. This experience supposedly is what led him to revise the ''Art'' (creating the tertiary version). Llull's ''Art'' was never adopted by mainstream academia of the thirteenth and early-fourteenth centuries, but it did accrue quite a bit of interest. A significant number of Lullian manuscripts were collected by the [[Carthusians|Carthusian]] monks of Paris at Vauvert and by several theologians who donated their manuscripts to the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] Library. One disciple, Thomas Le Myésier, went so far as to create elaborate compilations of Llull's works, including a manuscript dedicated to the [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|queen of France]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hillgarth |first1=J.N. |title=Ramon Lull and Lullism in Fourteenth-century France |date=1971 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford}}</ref>
[[File:Ramon Llull, with his disciple Thomas le Myesier, presenting three anthologies to the Queen of France and Navarre.jpg|thumb|Ramon Llull, with his disciple Thomas Le Myésier, presenting three anthologies to the queen]]

====Opposition====
In the 1360s the inquisitor [[Nicholas Eymerich]] condemned Lullism in Aragon. He obtained a Papal Bull in 1376 to prohibit Lullian teaching, although it proved ineffective. In Paris [[Jean Gerson]] also issued a series of polemical writings against Lullism. There was an official document issued to prohibit the Lullian ''Art'' from being taught in the Faculty of Theology.<ref>Hillgarth, 1971, 269.</ref>

===Early Modern===
====Academic Theology====
Llull's most significant early modern proponent was [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. He collected many works by Llull and adapted many aspects of Lullian thought for his own mystical theology.<ref>Colomer, Eusebio (1961). Nikolaus von Kues und Raimund Llull. Berlin: De Gruyter.</ref> There was also growing interest in Lullism in Catalonia, Italy, and France.   [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] published eight of Llull's books in 1499, 1505, and 1516. Lefèvre was therefore responsible for the first significant circulation of Llull's work in print outside of Catalonia.<ref>Hillgarth, 1971, 284</ref> It is thought that the influence of Lullian works in Renaissance Italy (coinciding with the rise of [[Platonism in the Renaissance|neoplatonism]]) contributed to a development in metaphysics, from a static Artistotelian notion of being to reality as a dynamic process.<ref>Lohr, Charles (1988). “Metaphysics.” In The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy, edited by C. B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner, Eckhard Kessler, and Jill Kraye, 537–638. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> In Northern and Central Europe Lullism was adopted by Lutherans and Calvinists interested in promoting programs of theological humanism. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] was exposed to these currents during his years in Mainz, and Llull's ''Art'' clearly informed his ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]''.<ref> Ramis Barceló, Rafael (2019). "Academic Lullism from the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth Century," in A Companion to Ramon Llull and Lullism. Leiden: Brill, p. 458.</ref>

====Pseudo-Llull and Alchemy<!--'Pseudo-Llull' redirects here-->====
There is a significant body of alchemical treatises falsely attributed to Llull. The two fundamental works of the corpus are the ''Testamentum'' and the ''Liber de secretis naturae seu de quinta essentia'' which both date to the fourteenth century.<ref>Pereira, Michela (1990). "Lullian Alchemy: Aspects and Problems of the corpus of Alchemical Works Attributed to Ramon Llull." Catalan Review, Vol. IV, 1-2: 41-54.</ref> Occultists such as [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] and [[Giordano Bruno]] were drawn to these works.<ref> Yates, Frances (1964). Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition. Chicago: Chicago University Press.</ref> Despite Llull's growing identification with alchemy and Neoplatonic mysticism, others (such as [[Giulio Pace]] and [[Johann Heinrich Alsted]] were still interested in the Lullian ''Art'' as a universal logic, even in the seventeenth century when [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Petrus Ramus|Ramus]] proposed competing systems.<ref>Hillgarth 1971, 297.</ref>

====Iberian Revival and Canonization====

Meanwhile in Spain, the Cardinal [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]], Archbishop of Toledo, had taken up Lullism for his project of reform. Cisneros mobilized various intellectuals and editors, founding chairs at universities and publishing Llull's works.<ref>Rubí, L. B. (2018). " Lullism among French and Spanish Humanists of the Early 16th Century". In A Companion to Ramon Llull and Lullism. Leiden: Brill.</ref> Founded in 1633, the Pontifical College of La Sapiencia on Majorca became the epicenter for teaching Lullism. The Franciscans from La Sapiencia were the ones to seek Llull's canonization at Rome in the seventeenth century. These efforts were renewed in the eighteenth century, but never succeeded.<ref>Ramis Barceló, R. (2018). "Chapter 12 Academic Lullism from the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth Century". In A Companion to Ramon Llull and Lullism. Leiden: Brill.</ref> Llull was [[beatification|beatified]] in 1847 by [[Pope Pius IX]]. His [[feast day]] was assigned to 30 June and is celebrated by the [[Third Order of St. Francis]].<ref name="habig">Habig, Marion. (Ed.). (1959). ''The Franciscan Book of Saints''.

===Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries===
====Scholarship====
Llull is now recognized by scholars as significant in both the history of Catalan literature as well as intellectual history. From 1906 to 1950 the Comissió Editora Lul·liana led a project to edit Llull's works written in Catalan. This series was called the Obres de Ramon Llull (ORL). In 1957 the Raimundus-Lullus-Institut was founded in Freiburg, Germany to begin the work of editing Llull's Latin works. This series is called the Raimundi Lulli Opera Latina (ROL) and is still ongoing.<ref>{{cite web |title=RAIMVNDI LVLLI Opera latina |url=https://www.theol.uni-freiburg.de/disciplinae/dqtm/forschung/raimundus-lullus/kritische-edition |access-date=11 September 2021}}</ref> In 1990 the work on the Catalan texts was restarted with the Nova Edició de les Obres de Ramon Llull (NEORL).<ref>{{cite web |title=Nova Edició de les Obres de Ramon Llull (NEORL) |url=https://manicula.narpan.net/nova-edicio-de-les-obres-de-ramon-llull-neorl |access-date=11 September 2021}}</ref> In the world of English-language scholarship the work of [[Frances Yates]] on memory systems (''[[The Art of Memory]]'', published 1966) brought new interest to Ramon Llull as a figure in the history of cognitive systems.

====Art and Fiction====
Llull has appeared in the art and literature of the last century, especially in the genres of [[surrealism]], philosophical fantasy, and metafiction. [[Salvador Dalí]]'s alchemical thought was influenced by Ramon Llull and Dalí incorporated the diagrams from the Lullian ''Art'' into his work called ''Alchimie des Philosophes''.<ref>{{cite web |title=SALVADOR DALÍ: ALCHIMIE DES PHILOSOPHES |url=https://libmedia.willamette.edu/hfma/omeka/exhibits/show/salvador-dali--alchimie-des-ph |access-date=11 September 2021}}</ref> In 1937 [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a snippet called "Ramon Llull' s Thinking Machine" proposing the Lullian ''Art'' as a device to produce poetry.<ref>"Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine" in {{cite book |last1=Borges |first1=Jorge Luis |title=Selected Non-fictions |date=1999 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |pages=155-159}}</ref>
Other notable references to Ramon Llull are: [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] short story "The Death of Lully", a fictionalized account aftermath of Llull's stoning in Tunis, set aboard the Genoese ship that returned him to Mallorca.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|title=Limbo|publisher=Chatto & Windus|year=1920}}</ref> [[Paul Auster]] refers to Llull (as Raymond Lull) in his memoir ''[[The Invention of Solitude]]'' in the second part, ''The Book of Memory''. Llull is also a major character in ''[[The Box of Delights]]'', a children's novel by poet [[John Masefield]].

====Other Recognition====
Llull's ''Art'' is sometimes recognized as a precursor to [[computer science]] and computation theory.<ref>Sales, Ton (2011). “Llull as Computer Scientist, or Why Llull Was One of Us.” In Ramon Llull. From the Ars Magna to Artificial Intelligence, edited by Alexander Fido and Carles Sierra. Barcelona: Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, 25–38.</ref>
With the discovery in 2001 of his lost manuscripts, ''Ars notandi'', ''Ars eleccionis'', and ''Alia ars eleccionis'', Llull is also given credit for creating an [[electoral system]] now known as the [[Borda count]] and [[Condorcet criterion]], which [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet|Nicolas de Condorcet]] independently proposed centuries later.<ref name=Hagele>{{cite journal |author1=G.
