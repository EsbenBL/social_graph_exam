'''Elizabeth F. Cohen''' is an American political scientist. She is a professor of [[political science]] at the  [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]] and a senior research associate at the Campbell Public Affairs Institute.<ref name=profile/> She is a political theorist who studies citizenship, immigration, and value of time in politics.

== Education ==
Cohen attended [[Swarthmore College]], graduating with a B.A. degree in Philosophy and Sociology.<ref name=profile>{{cite web |url=https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/psc/Cohen,_Elizabeth_F_/ |title=Elizabeth F. Cohen |publisher=Syracuse University |access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref> She then attended graduate school at [[Yale University]], where she earned an M.A., an M.Phil., and a Ph.D. in political science in 2003.<ref name=profile/>

== Career ==
In 2004, Cohen joined the political science faculty at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.<ref name=profile/> In summer 2010 she was a Visiting Fellow at the Wagner School of Public Service at [[New York University]], and she was a 2014–2015 Visiting Scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]].<ref name=profile/>

In 2009, Cohen published the book ''Semi‐citizenship in Democratic Politics''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Camille |last=Hamidi |title=Review Semi-Citizenship in Democratic Politics |journal=Revue française de science politique |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=154–156 |date=1 February 2011}}</ref> In ''Semi‐citizenship in Democratic Politics'', Cohen studies the idea that people can be only partially citizens, by being granted only some of the rights of citizens.<ref name=bolzendahl>{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Bolzendahl |title=Review Semi-Citizenship in Democratic Politics |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=301–303 |date=July 2010 |doi=10.1086/655640}}</ref> She examines the different types of semi-citizens, splitting their rights into two major categories: autonomous rights, which are useful in any political context, and relative rights, such as the right to property, which are useful only in some political arrangements.<ref name=bolzendahl/> Cohen uses this subtler picture of citizenship to challenge the narrative that modern liberal democracies contain one category of partial citizens and another category of full citizens, and that people who have previously been granted only partial citizenship can assemble a collection of rights that will ultimately make them complete citizens; rather, she argues that different citizens have always enjoyed complicated combinations of rights and that there is no one coherent category of total citizenship.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Lawrie |last=Balfour |title=Review Semi-Citizenship in Democratic Politics |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=1190–1191 |date=1 December 2010 |doi=10.1017/S1537592710002379|s2cid=145809115 }}</ref>

In 2018, Cohen published the book ''The Political Value of Time: Citizenship, Duration, and Democratic Justice''. ''The Political Value of Time'' studies how time shapes and is incorporated into politics, like the relationship between space and politics that is studied in the field of [[political geography]].<ref name=lazar20>{{cite journal |first=Nomi Claire |last=Lazar |title=Review The Political Value of Time: Citizenship, Duration, and Democratic Justice |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=614–615 |date=June 2020 |doi=10.1017/S1537592720000432|s2cid=225828239 }}</ref> Cohen shows that time is embedded into many of the most fundamental processes in democratic politics, such as the 18 years that it takes for a person to be able to vote in many countries, and the 3 to 5-year span that is a common waiting time for [[naturalization]] of new citizens.<ref name=lazar20/> She studies the difference between these circumstances and ones in which a political status is imposed which will never expire, such as the permanent [[disfranchisement]] of some felons, and she compares and evaluates the timespans and deadlines that are attached to various political situations.<ref name=lazar20/> ''The Political Value of Time'' won the Best Book Award for 2019 from the Migration and Citizenship section of the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/2019-apsa-organized-section-awards/0AB2943B3604C9CAD07DB2B194BC3B4C/core-reader |title=Best Book Award |year=2019 |access-date=18 June 2020 |publisher=American Political Science Association}}</ref>

Cohen was also the coauthor of the 2019 book ''Citizenship'' with Cyril A. Ghosh.<ref name=profile/> In 2020, Cohen published ''Illegal: America's Lawless Immigration Regime and How it Threatens Us All''. In ''Illegal'' Cohen studies United States immigration policy, how it's enforced by agencies like [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and how treatment of immigrants interacts with trends like [[white nationalism]] in American politics and has implications for the possible treatment of everyone in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/elizabeth-f-cohen/illegal-cohen/ |title=Review Illegal: America's Lawless Immigration Regime and How it Threatens Us All |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |year=2020 |access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref>
