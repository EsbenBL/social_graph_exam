'''Loïc J.&nbsp;D. Wacquant''' ({{IPA-fr|lo'ik va'kɑ̃|lang}};<ref name=pronounce>{{cite web |url=https://forvo.com/word/lo%C3%AFc_wacquant/ |title=How to pronounce Loïc Wacquant |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 21, 2014 |website=Forvo.com |access-date=January 18, 2017 }}</ref> born 1960) is a [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[social anthropologist]], specializing in [[urban sociology]], [[poverty|urban poverty]], [[Race and inequality in the United States|racial inequality]], [[Human body|the body]], [[social theory]] and [[ethnography]].

Wacquant is currently a Professor of Sociology and Research Associate at the Earl Warren Legal Institute, [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he is also affiliated with the Program in Medical Anthropology and the Center for Urban Ethnography, and Researcher at the 'Centre de sociologie européenne' in Paris. He has been a member of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]], a [[MacArthur Prize|MacArthur Prize Fellow]], and has won numerous grants including the [[Fletcher Foundation]] Fellowship and the Lewis Coser Award of the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Career and education==

Wacquant was born and grew up in [[Montpellier]] in the Southern France, and he received his training in [[economics]] and sociology in France and the United States. He was a student and close collaborator of [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also worked closely with [[William Julius Wilson]] at the [[University of Chicago]], where he received his PhD in sociology in 1994. Wacquant has published more than a hundred articles in journals of sociology, [[anthropology]], [[urban studies]], social theory and [[philosophy]]. He is also co-founder and editor of the interdisciplinary journal ''Ethnography'' as well as a collaborator of [[Le Monde Diplomatique]]. His primary research has been conducted in the ghettos of South [[Chicago]], in the Paris [[banlieue]], and in jails of the United States and [[Brazil]].

== Research ==
{{BLP primary sources|section|date=August 2011}}
Wacquant's work explores and links together diverse areas of research on the human body, urban inequality, ghettoization, and the development of punishment as an institution aimed at poor and stigmatized populations. His interest in these topics stems from his experience in the black ghetto as a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the mid-1980s. Commenting on this experience in ''The New York Times'' in 2003, he said "I had never seen such scenes of desolation. I remember thinking: It's like Beirut. Or Dresden after the war. It was really a shock."<ref>Emily Eakin (November 8, 2003). [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/08/books/a-professor-who-refuses-to-pull-his-punches.html?pagewanted=2 A Professor Who Refuses To Pull His Punches]. ''The New York Times.'' Retrieved January 16, 2015.</ref> His intellectual trajectory and interests are dissected in the article "The Body, the Ghetto, and the Penal State" (2008)<ref>{{Citation | last = Wacquant | first = Loïc | title = The Body, the Ghetto and the Penal State | journal = Qualitative Sociology | volume = 32 | pages = 101–129| date = June 2007 | doi = 10.1007/s11133-008-9112-2| s2cid = 53955994 | access-date = <!-----30 November 2009----->}}</ref>

In his work, "Deadly symbiosis: when ghetto and prison meet and mesh" in ''[[Punishment and Society]]'' 3(1) (pp 95–134),  he offers a "middle-range" theory, relevant mainly to [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|American racism against blacks]] in contemporary society. According to Wacquant, African-Americans now live "in the first prison society of history" (p.&nbsp;121). The 'hyperghetto' constitutes the fourth stage in the development of 'peculiar institutions', following (sequentially) slavery, [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]], and the early ghettos. According to him, the ghetto and the prison are for all practical purposes indistinguishable, reinforcing each other to ensure the exclusion of African-Americans from general society, with governmental encouragement. As Wacquant vividly characterizes it, the prison should be viewed as a "judicial ghetto" and the ghetto as an "extrajudicial prison". Taken together, these constitute part of a "carceral continuum".  To understand this concept, Wacquant argues for a single analytical frame unifying expansive "prisonfare" and attenuating workfare, resulting in a deepening marginalisation and social and political subordination of stigmatized and defamed "surplus" populations. Inspired by [[Bourdieu]], Wacquant analyzes the structural constraints and consequences, and, like Bourdieu, endeavours to provide a more nuanced analysis than, for example, a reductionist Marxian economic analysis (cf. Rusche and Kirchheimer's ''[[Punishment and Social Structure]]'', referenced by Wacquant in his ''Punishing the Poor'' (2009)).

The ghetto and the prison are now locked in a whirlpool, when it is no longer clear which is the egg and which is the chicken: the two look the same and have the same function (p.&nbsp;115). The life in the ghetto almost necessarily leads to more criminal behavior, yet Wacquant presents statistics that show that the distribution of crime between black and white has not changed. Instead he shows that a black, young, man is now "equated with 'probable cause' justifying the arrest" (p.&nbsp;117). And in the prisons, a black culture is being reinforced by "professional" inmates, a culture which later affects the street.

In his book ''Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer'', Wacquant denounces popular mainstream conceptions of the [[underclass]] and argues that the boxing gym is one of the many institutions that is contained within, and opposed to, the ghetto. He also explores, through an account of his own experiences as an apprentice boxer in a black ghetto of Chicago, the elaborate process by which the "body capital" of these athletes is formed and managed, and in doing so, building upon the work of his mentor Pierre Bourdieu, he argues for the development of a 'carnal sociology'.
