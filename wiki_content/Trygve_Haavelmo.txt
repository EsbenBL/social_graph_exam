'''Trygve Magnus Haavelmo''' (13 December 1911 – 28 July 1999), born in [[Skedsmo]], [[Norway]], was an [[economist]] whose research interests centered on [[econometrics]]. He received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1989.

== Biography ==
After attending [[Oslo Cathedral School]],<ref>{{cite web | title =Oslo Katedralskole - en skole med tradisjoner | work =Om skolen | publisher =Oslo katedralskole | url =http://www.oslo-katedral.vgs.no/skolen/ | access-date =19 April 2014 | language =no | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140419221551/http://www.oslo-katedral.vgs.no/skolen/ | archive-date =19 April 2014 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> Haavelmo received a degree in [[economics]] from the University of Oslo in 1930 and eventually joined the Institute of Economics with the recommendation of [[Ragnar Frisch]]. Haavelmo was Frisch's assistant for a period of time until he was appointed as head of computations for the institute. In 1936, Haavelmo studied statistics at [[University College London]] while he subsequently traveled to Berlin, Geneva, and Oxford for additional studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trygve Haavelmo|url=http://www.sv.uio.no/econ/english/about/facts-and-figures/nobel-prize-winners/haavelmo/|publisher=University of Oslo|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> Haavelmo assumed a lecturing position at the University of Aarhus in 1938 for one year and then in the subsequent year was offered an academic scholarship to travel abroad and study in the United States. During World War II he worked with [[Nortraship]] in the Statistical Department in New York City. He received his PhD in 1946 for his work on The Probability Approach in Econometrics.

He was a professor of economics and statistics at the [[University of Oslo]] between 1948–79 and was the trade department head of division from 1947–48. Haavelmo acquired a prominent position in modern economics through his logical critique of a series of custom conceptions in mathematical analysis.

In 1989, Haavelmo was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] "for his clarification of the [[probability theory]] foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures."<ref>{{cite news|last=Prokesch|first=Steven|title=Norwegian Wins Nobel For His Work in Economics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/12/business/norwegian-wins-nobel-for-his-work-in-economics.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 October 1989}}</ref>

Haavelmo resided at Østerås in [[Bærum]].<ref name=ntb>{{cite news|title=Sky Nobelpros-vinner stakk fra pressen|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=11 October 1989|language=no}}</ref> He died on 28 July 1999 in Oslo.

[[Judea Pearl]] wrote "Haavelmo was the first to recognize the capacity of economic models to guide policies" and "presented a mathematical procedure that takes an arbitrary model and produces quantitative answers to policy questions". According to Pearl, "Haavelmo's paper, 'The Statistical Implications of a System of Simultaneous Equations',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haavelmo|first1=T.|title=The statistical implications of a system of simultaneous equations|journal=Econometrica|date=1943|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–43|series=Reprinted in D.F.

consensus of what an economic model stands for, as attested by profound disagreements among econometric textbooks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Bryant |last2=Pearl |first2=Judea |title=Regression and Causation: A Critical Examination of Six Econometrics Textbooks|journal=Real-World Economics Review|volume=65|pages=2–20|year=2013|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r395.pdf}}</ref>
