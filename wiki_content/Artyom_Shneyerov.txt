'''Artyom Shneyerov''' is a  [[Microeconomy|microeconomist]] working at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. He is also an associate editor of the ''International Journal of Industrial Organization''.<ref>[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/505551/editorialboard/ The International Journal of Industrial Organization]</ref> His current research is in the fields of [[game theory]], [[industrial organization]] and applied [[econometrics]]. His contributions to these and other areas of economics include the following:

}}</ref> he introduced an approach for the estimation of counterfactual revenues in a [[common value auction]] without the need to identify model primitives. He showed that for any given [[reserve price]], equilibrium bids from [[sealed first-price auction|first-price auctions]] can be used to identify the expected revenues in [[Vickrey auction]] with the same reserve price. In addition, he derived an explicit bound on expected revenue for [[English auction]]s. His approach is based on the revenue ranking theorem of [[Paul Milgrom|Milgrom]] and Weber.<ref>

}}</ref> This means that in a given meeting, the buyer knows the minimum the seller is willing to accept for the item, and the  seller knows the maximum the buyer is willing to pay. This assumption is often violated in reality. Satterthwaite and Shneyerov have shown that the dynamic matching and bargaining market is nevertheless approximately competitive as the time between matches becomes progressively smaller.
