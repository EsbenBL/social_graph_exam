Standing's best-known book is ''The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class'', published in 2011.<ref name=Precariat>{{cite book |last=Standing |first=Guy |title=The precariat |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=City |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84966-455-4}}</ref> In it, he blames [[globalisation]] for having plunged more and more people into the [[precariat]], which he analyses as a new emerging social class.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Standing |first1=Guy |title=Britain's labour figures hide the real hours we work every day |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/19/britian-labour-figures-hide-real-workload |access-date=4 July 2014 |publisher=The Guardian &#124; Comment is free |date=19 August 2012}}</ref> According to Standing, the precariat is not only suffering from [[job insecurity]] but also identity insecurity and lack of time control, not least due to [[workfare]] social policies.

Standing describes the precariat as an agglomerate of several different social groups, notably immigrants, young educated people, and those who have fallen out of the old-style industrial working class.<ref name=Youthful>{{cite news |last1=Smoczyński |first1=Wawrzyniec |title=Youthful members of the full-time precariat |url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/article/953511-youthful-members-full-time-precariat |access-date=4 July 2014 |publisher=Vox Europ &#124; Polityka &#124; Economy &#124; Social Issues &#124; Economic Crisis |date=15 September 2011}}</ref>

Standing calls on politicians to make ambitious social reforms towards ensuring financial security as a right. He argues for an unconditional basic income as an important step to a new approach,<ref>{{YouTube | id= 4WaA8zqjBSk&feature=plcp |  title= Why the precariat requires a basic income (Prof. Guy Standing) (ENG)}} ''Conference in Ljubljana.''
