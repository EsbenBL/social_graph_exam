He is also known as the inventor of the [[Nolan Chart]],<ref>Doherty, Brian.  "Radicals for Capitalism" p. 32.  PublicAffairs.</ref> an attempt to improve on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] versus [[Right-wing politics|right]] political taxonomy by separating the issues of economic freedom and social freedom and presenting them on a two-dimensional plane instead of the traditional line. Decades after its introduction, it continues to be popular, with millions of copies having been distributed, including by the group Advocates for Self-Government as the "[[World's Smallest Political Quiz]]".

== Career ==
[[File:Nolan-chart.svg|thumb|150px|right|While the traditional political "left-right" [[Political spectrum|spectrum]] is a line, the [[Nolan Chart]], created by David Nolan, is a plane, situating libertarianism in a wider gamut of political thought.]]
[[File:NolanwithNolanChart1996.jpg|thumb|150px|Nolan pictured with his eponymous chart at the 1996 Libertarian National Convention.]]
Nolan was a member of [[Young Americans for Freedom]] in 1969 when more than 300 libertarians organized to take control of the organization from conservatives. Many walked out after a physical confrontation sparked by the [[Draft-card burning|burning of a draft card]] in protest to a conservative proposal against draft resistance. While sympathizing with the radicals, Nolan remained with the organization.<ref>Rebecca E.

[[File:David Nolan.jpg|thumb|125px|David Nolan during his 2010 Senate campaign]]
Nolan believed that in August 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]]'s imposition of wage and price controls and closing the foreign gold window along with his belief that the Vietnam War was both ill-considered and illegal,<ref name="DMartinNYT11222010" /> were three of the final straws for Nolan and his group of initial founders of the Libertarian Party.  Nolan and his group had initiated a Committee the previous July, [[Committee to Form a Libertarian Party]], and joined forces with a previous demonstration Libertarian Party project and non-partisan political efforts of the now [[Liberty International (organization)|Liberty International]]. The group organized among a number of libertarians, including the International Society for Individual Liberty, which had been formed by dissident members of Young Americans for Freedom and European libertarians.  They officially founded the Libertarian Party on December 11, 1971.<ref name="Doherty" />

He ran unsuccessfully as a Libertarian for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[2006 Arizona's 8th congressional district election]] and received 1.9% of the vote. He also ran as the Libertarian candidate in the [[2010 United States Senate election in Arizona]], and received 63,000 votes,<ref>Clayton R. Norman [http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_69682c47-39f1-5104-bd90-4913f7890112.html David Nolan, a founder of Libertarian Party, dies], ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', November 22, 2010.</ref> 4.7% of the total.

In the last few years of his life, especially after much of the Libertarian Party's platform was deleted in an organized "no confidence" effort by "reformers" in 2006, Nolan was sharply critical of the direction the party had taken, accusing party leaders of abandoning its radical roots and being "absorbed with minutia" and too focused on winning elections. "They're afraid to say anything that might scare people, because that might keep people from voting for them," he told [[Lew Rockwell]] in a December 2008 radio interview. "It's become a very timid organization in the last six or eight years."<ref>Lew Rockwell Show [https://secure.lewrockwell.com/assets/podcast/2008-12-16_085_david_nolan_what_happened_to_the_libertarian_party.mp3 "David Nolan: What Happened to the Libertarian Party"]</ref>

In 2009, Nolan publicly endorsed the [[Free State Project]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freestateproject.org/about/endorsements#nolan |title=David Nolan endorsement of the Free State Project |access-date=August 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218115424/http://freestateproject.org/about/endorsements/#nolan |archive-date=February 18, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> an attempt to move 20,000 Libertarians to New Hampshire to experience "Liberty in their Lifetimes".

Nolan died of a stroke in [[Tucson, Arizona]] on November 21, 2010.<ref>Dylan Smith, [http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/112110_nolan_obit David Nolan, Libertarian founder, dies at 66], TucsonSentinel.com, November 21, 2010.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131230105859/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-26802180.html "OUR VIEW: Great defender of freedom passes on (poll)."] ''The Gazette''.
