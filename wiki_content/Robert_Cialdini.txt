==Work==
He is best known for his 1984 book on [[persuasion]] and [[marketing]], ''[[Influence:_Science_and_Practice | Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion]]''.  It was based on three "undercover"{{clarify|date=October 2021}} years applying for and training at used car dealerships, fund-raising organizations, and [[telemarketing]] firms to observe real-life situations of persuasion. He found that influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, [[social proof]], authority, liking, scarcity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cialdini |first=Robert |date=2009 |title=Influence: Science and Practice |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-205-60999-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/influencescience00cial_1 }}</ref> In 2016 he proposed a seventh principle. He called it the unity principle. The more we identify ourselves with others, the more we are influenced by these others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade|last=Cialdini|first=R.
