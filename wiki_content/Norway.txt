Norway has a total area of {{convert|385,207|km2|sqmi}}<ref name="kart_2019" /> and had a population of 5,385,300 in November 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Statistics Norway|date=23 November 2020|title=Population 3rd quarter 2020|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde|access-date=26 December 2020}}</ref> The country shares a long eastern border with [[Sweden]] at a length of [[List of countries and territories by land borders|1,619 km or 1,006&nbsp;mi]]. It is bordered by [[Finland]] and [[Russia]] to the north-east and the [[Skagerrak]] strait to the south, on the other side of which are [[Denmark]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the [[Barents Sea]]. The maritime influence dominates Norway's climate, with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts; the interior, while colder, is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. Even during [[polar night]] in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country.

[[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]] of the [[House of Glücksburg]] is the current [[Monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]]. [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] has been prime minister since 2021, replacing [[Erna Solberg]].  As a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[sovereign state]] with a [[constitutional monarchy]], Norway [[Separation of powers|divides state power]] between the [[Storting|parliament]], the [[Council of State (Norway)|cabinet]] and the [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court]], as determined by the [[Constitution of Norway|1814 constitution]]. The kingdom was established in 872 as a merger of many [[Petty kingdoms of Norway|petty kingdoms]] and has existed continuously for 1,{{age|1872}} years. From 1537 to 1814, Norway was a part of the Kingdom of [[Denmark–Norway]], and from 1814 to 1905, it was in a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with the Kingdom of Sweden. Norway was neutral during the [[World War I|First World War]] and remained so until April 1940 when the country was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] and [[German occupation of Norway|occupied]] by Germany until the end of [[World War II]].

Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels: [[Counties of Norway|counties]] and [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipalities]]. The [[Sámi people]] have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the [[Sámi Parliament of Norway|Sámi Parliament]] and the [[Finnmark Act]]. Norway [[Norway–European Union relations|maintains close ties]] with both the [[European Union]] and the [[United States-Norway relations|United States]]. Norway is also a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[European Free Trade Association]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], and the [[Nordic Council]]; a member of the [[European Economic Area]], the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], and the [[OECD]]; and a part of the [[Schengen Area]]. In addition, the Norwegian languages share [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

Norway has two official names: ''Norge'' in [[Bokmål]] and ''Noreg'' in [[Nynorsk]]. The English name Norway comes from the [[Old English]] word ''Norþweg'' mentioned in 880, meaning "northern way" or "way leading to the north", which is how the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s referred to the coastline of [[Atlantic]] Norway<ref name="Nomino-NRK">{{Cite episode |title=Nomino 6:6 |url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/nomino/DVFJ63000615/sesong-2/episode-6#t=22m18s |access-date= 5 October 2016 |series=Nomino |station=[[NRK]] |date= 4 October 2016 |season=2 |time=22:18 |language=no}}</ref><ref name="Tvil-Forskning">{{cite web |url = http://forskning.no/historie-sprak/2016/02/sar-tvil-om-norges-opphav |title= Sår tvil om Norges opphav |date= 29 February 2016 |publisher=Forskning.no for [[Universitetet i Agder]] |language = no}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Skre|first=Dagfinn|url=https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/23221|title=Rulership in 1st to 14th century Scandinavia|date=2020|publisher=De Gruyter|pages=3, 5–10|language=English}}</ref> similar to leading theory about the origin of the Norwegian language name.<ref>Krag, Claus, 2003: "The early unification of Norway."

There is some disagreement about whether the native name of Norway originally had the same etymology as the English form. According to the traditional dominant view, the first component was originally [[:wikt:norðr|''norðr'']], a [[cognate]] of English ''north'', so the full name was ''Norðr [[wikt:vegr|vegr]]'', "the way northwards", referring to the sailing route along the Norwegian coast, and contrasting with ''suðrvegar'' "southern way" (from [[Old Norse]] [[:wikt:suðr|suðr]]) for (Germany), and ''austrvegr'' "eastern way" (from [[:wikt:austr|austr]]) for the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. In the translation of [[Orosius]] for Alfred, the name is ''Norðweg'', while in younger Old English sources the ð is gone.<ref name="Eldar Heide"/> In the 10th century many Norsemen settled in Northern France, according to the sagas, in the area that was later called [[Normandy]] from ''norðmann'' (Norseman or Scandinavian<ref>Stenton, F.

Volume 1 of ''Vestlandets historie'' (edited by Knut Helle). Bergen: Vigmostad og Bjørke, 2006.</ref>

According to another theory, the first component was a word ''nór'', meaning "narrow" (Old English ''nearu''), referring to the inner-[[archipelago]] sailing route through the land ("narrow way"). The interpretation as "northern", as reflected in the English and Latin forms of the name, would then have been due to later [[folk etymology]]. This latter view originated with philologist Niels Halvorsen Trønnes in 1847; since 2016 it is also advocated by language student and activist Klaus Johan Myrvoll and was adopted by [[philology]] professor [[Michael Schulte (professor)|Michael Schulte]].<ref name="Nomino-NRK"/><ref name="Tvil-Forskning"/> The form ''Nore'' is still used in placenames such as the village of [[Nore, Norway|Nore]] and lake [[Norefjorden]] in [[Buskerud]] county, and still has the same meaning.<ref name="Nomino-NRK"/><ref name="Tvil-Forskning"/> Among other arguments in favour of the theory, it is pointed out that the word has a long vowel in Skaldic poetry and is not attested with <<nowiki/>ð> in any native Norse texts or inscriptions (the earliest runic attestations have the spellings ''nuruiak'' and ''nuriki''). This resurrected theory has received some pushback by other scholars on various grounds, e.&nbsp;g. the uncontroversial presence of the element ''norðr'' in the ethnonym ''norðrmaðr'' "Norseman, Norwegian person" (modern Norwegian ''nordmann''), and the adjective ''norrǿnn'' "northern, Norse, Norwegian", as well as the very early attestations of the Latin and Anglo-Saxon forms with <<nowiki/>th>.<ref name="Eldar Heide">Heide, Eldar, 2017: "[http://ojs.novus.no/index.php/NON/article/view/1333 Noregr tyder nok vegen mot nord, likevel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222105940/http://ojs.novus.no/index.php/NON/article/view/1333 |date=22 February 2017 }}".''Namn og nemne'', 2016.

The adjective ''Norwegian'', recorded from c. 1600, is derived from the [[Middle Latin|latinisation]] of the name as ''Norwegia''; in the adjective ''Norwegian'', the Old English spelling '-weg' has survived.<ref>Dieserud, J.: Norse and Norseman versus Norwegian.

After Norway had become Christian, ''Noregr'' and ''Noregi'' had become the most common forms, but during the 15th century, the newer forms ''Noreg(h)'' and ''Norg(h)e'', found in medieval Icelandic manuscripts, took over and have survived until the modern day.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Prehistory ===
{{Main|Scandinavian prehistory}}
The first inhabitants were the [[Ahrensburg culture]] (11th to 10th millennia BC), which was a late [[Upper Paleolithic]] culture during the Younger Dryas, the last period of cold at the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The culture is named after the village of [[Ahrensburg]], {{convert|25|km|2|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Hamburg]] in the [[Schleswig-Holstein|German state of Schleswig-Holstein]], where wooden arrow shafts and clubs have been excavated.<ref name="Genetics">{{Cite journal|pmid = 12173029|year = 2002|last1 = Passarino|first1 = G|title = Different genetic components in the Norwegian population revealed by the analysis of mtDNA and Y chromosome polymorphisms|journal = European Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 10|issue = 9|pages = 521–529|last2 = Cavalleri|first2 = G.

The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9,500 to 6,000 BC, discovered in [[Finnmark]] ([[Komsa culture]]) in the north and [[Rogaland]] ([[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]]) in the south-west. However, theories about two altogether different cultures (the Komsa culture north of the [[Arctic Circle]] being one and the Fosna culture from [[Trøndelag]] to [[Oslofjord]] being the other) were rendered obsolete in the 1970s.

More recent finds along the entire coast revealed to archaeologists that the difference between the two can simply be ascribed to different types of tools and not to different cultures. Coastal fauna provided a means of livelihood for fishermen and hunters, who may have made their way along the southern coast about 10,000 BC when the interior was still covered with ice. It is now thought that these so-called "Arctic" peoples came from the south and followed the coast northward considerably later.

In the southern part of the country are dwelling sites dating from about 5,000 BC. Finds from these sites give a clearer idea of the life of the hunting and fishing peoples. The implements vary in shape and mostly are made of different kinds of stone; those of later periods are more skilfully made. [[Rock carvings]] (i.e. petroglyphs) have been found, usually near hunting and fishing grounds. They represent game such as [[deer]], [[reindeer]], [[Moose|elk]], bears, birds, [[Earless seal|seals]], whales, and fish (especially [[salmon]] and [[halibut]]), all of which were vital to the way of life of the coastal peoples. The [[rock carvings at Alta]] in Finnmark, the largest in Scandinavia, were made at sea level from 4,200 to 500 BC and mark the progression of the land as the sea rose after the last ice age ended.

=== Bronze Age ===
{{Main|Nordic Bronze Age}}
[[File:Bronze Age boats.png|thumb|right|[[Nordic Bronze Age]] [[rock carvings]] at [[Steinkjer]], [[Central Norway]]]]
Between 3000 and 2500 BC, new settlers ([[Corded Ware culture]]) arrived in [[eastern Norway]]. They were [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[farmers]] who grew grain and kept cows and sheep. The hunting-fishing population of the west coast was also gradually replaced by farmers, though hunting and fishing remained useful secondary means of livelihood.

From about 1500 BC, [[bronze]] was gradually introduced, but the use of stone implements continued; Norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods, and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford. Huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as [[Harstad]] and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period. The motifs of the rock carvings differ slightly from those typical of the [[Stone Age]]. Representations of the Sun, animals, trees, weapons, ships, and people are all strongly stylised.

Thousands of [[rock carving]]s from this period depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as [[stone ship]]s, suggest that ships and seafaring played an important role in the culture at large. The depicted ships most likely represent sewn plank built canoes used for warfare, fishing and trade. These ship types may have their origin as far back as the neolithic period and they continue into the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as exemplified by the [[Hjortspring boat]].<ref>Ling 2008.

=== Iron Age ===
{{Main|Iron Age Scandinavia}}

Little has been found dating from the early [[Iron Age]] (the last 500 years BC). The dead were cremated, and their graves contain few burial goods. During the first four centuries AD, the people of Norway were in contact with Roman-occupied [[Gaul]]. About 70 Roman bronze cauldrons, often used as burial urns, have been found. Contact with the civilised countries farther south brought a knowledge of [[runes]]; the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the 3rd century. At this time, the amount of settled area in the country increased, a development that can be traced by coordinated studies of [[topography]], [[archaeology]], and place-names. The oldest root names, such as nes, vik, and bø ("cape," "bay," and "farm"), are of great antiquity, dating perhaps from the Bronze Age, whereas the earliest of the groups of compound names with the suffixes vin ("meadow") or heim ("settlement"), as in Bjǫrgvin (Bergen) or Sǿheim (Seim), usually date from the 1st century AD.

[[File:Jordanes, Norway tribes.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Locations of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes described by [[Jordanes]] in Norway]]

Archaeologists first made the decision to divide the Iron Age of Northern Europe into distinct pre-Roman and [[Roman Iron Age]]s after Emil Vedel unearthed a number of Iron Age artefacts in 1866 on the island of [[Bornholm]].<ref>Vedel, ''Bornholms Oldtidsminder og Oldsager'', (Copenhagen 1886).</ref> They did not exhibit the same permeating Roman influence seen in most other artefacts from the early centuries AD, indicating that parts of northern Europe had not yet come into contact with the Romans at the beginning of the [[Iron Age]].

=== Migration period ===
{{Main|Migration period}}
{{See also|Petty kingdoms of Norway}}
The destruction of the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Germanic peoples]] in the 5th century is characterised by rich finds, including [[tribal chief]]s' graves containing magnificent weapons and gold objects.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Hill forts were built on precipitous rocks for defence. Excavation has revealed stone foundations of farmhouses {{convert|18|to|27|m|ft}} long—one even {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=off}} long—the roofs of which were supported on wooden posts. These houses were family homesteads where several generations lived together, with people and cattle under one roof.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

These states were based on either clans or tribes (e.g., the [[Horder]] of [[Hordaland]] in [[western Norway]]). By the 9th century, each of these small states had [[Thing (assembly)|''things'']] (local or regional assemblies) for negotiating and settling disputes. The ''thing'' meeting places, each eventually with a [[hörgr]] (open-air sanctuary) or a [[heathen hof]] (temple; literally "hill"), were usually situated on the oldest and best farms, which belonged to the chieftains and wealthiest farmers. The regional ''things'' united to form even larger units: assemblies of deputy yeomen from several regions. In this way, the ''lagting'' (assemblies for negotiations and lawmaking) developed. The Gulating had its meeting place by [[Sognefjord]] and may have been the centre of an aristocratic confederation{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} along the western fjords and islands called the Gulatingslag. The Frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the [[Trondheimsfjord]] area; the [[Earls of Lade]], near [[Trondheim]], seem to have enlarged the Frostatingslag by adding the coastland from [[Romsdalsfjord]] to [[Lofoten]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

From the 8th to the 10th century, the wider Scandinavian region was the source of [[Viking]]s. The looting of the monastery at [[Lindisfarne]] in Northeast England in 793 by [[North Germanic peoples|Norse people]] has long been regarded as the event which marked the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://loststory.net/node/91 |title=Age of the vikings |publisher=loststory|access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref> This age was characterised by expansion and emigration by Viking [[seafarer]]s. They [[colonise]]d, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. Norwegian Viking explorers discovered [[Iceland]] by accident in the 9th century when heading for the [[Faroe Islands]], and eventually came across [[Vinland]], known today as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in Canada. The Vikings from Norway were most active in the northern and western [[British Isles]] and eastern North America isles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://naturalhistory.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/archeo.html|title=Vinland Archeology|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|access-date=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308031025/https://naturalhistory.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/archeo.html|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to tradition, [[Harald Fairhair]] unified them into one in 872 after the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]] in [[Stavanger]], thus becoming the first king of a united Norway.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 83.</ref> Harald's realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state. Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas, many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland, the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and Ireland. The modern-day Irish cities of [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] were founded by Norwegian settlers.<ref>[[R. F. Foster (historian)|Foster, R. F.]] (2001) ''The Oxford History of Ireland''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|019280202X}}</ref>

[[Norse mythology|Norse traditions]] were replaced slowly by [[Christian mythology|Christian ones]] in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. One of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf Haraldsson, king of Norway circa 1015 to 1028.<ref>Jones, Gwyn, A history of the Vikings (Oxford 2001).</ref> This is largely attributed to the missionary kings [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olav]]. [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon the Good]] was Norway's first Christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected. Born sometime in between 963 and 969, Olav Tryggvasson set off raiding in England with 390 ships. He attacked London during this raiding. Arriving back in Norway in 995, Olav landed in [[Moster (island)|Moster]]. There he built a church which became the first [[Old Moster Church|Christian church]] ever built in Norway. From Moster, Olav sailed north to [[Trondheim]] where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 95.</ref>

[[Feudalism]] never really developed in Norway or Sweden, as it did in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The [[Hanseatic League]] forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real [[burgher (title)|burgher]] class existed in Norway.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 201.</ref>

{{See also|Greater Norway|Civil war era in Norway}}
[[File:Norwegian Hereditary Empire excluding Greenland.png|thumb|[[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)|Norwegian Kingdom]] at its greatest extent, 13th century]]
From the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.<ref>Stenersen: 36</ref>  In 1130, the [[civil war era in Norway|civil war era]] broke out on the basis of [[line of succession to the Norwegian throne|unclear succession laws]], which allowed all the king's sons to rule jointly. For periods there could be peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings.<ref>Stenersen: 38</ref> The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the church's influence of the king. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of [[Håkon Håkonsson]], who introduced clear law of succession.<ref>Stenersen: 39</ref>

From 1000 to 1300, the population increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300, seventy percent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times and not being able to repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century, about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.<ref>Stenersen: 37</ref>

The 14th century is described as Norway's [[Golden Age]], with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British Islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the [[High Middle Ages]], the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.<ref>Stenersen: 41</ref>

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] spread to Norway and had within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more [[animal husbandry]]. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,<ref>Stenersen: 44</ref> and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus, reducing some to mere farmers. High [[tithe]]s to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the [[Norwegian Council of State|Council of State]].<ref name=s45>Stenersen: 45</ref>
[[File:Bryggen, Bergen3.JPG|thumb|[[Bryggen]] in [[Bergen]], once the center of trade in Norway under the [[Hanseatic League]] trade network, now preserved as a [[World Heritage Site]]]]
The [[Hanseatic League]] took control over Norwegian trade during the 14th century and established a trading center in [[Bergen]]. In 1380, [[Olaf II of Denmark|Olaf Haakonsson]] inherited both the Norwegian and Danish thrones, creating a union between the two countries.<ref name=s45 /> In 1397, under [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]], the [[Kalmar Union]] was created between the three Scandinavian countries. She waged war against the Germans, resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegian goods, which resulted in [[Engelbrekt rebellion|a rebellion]]. However, the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union.<ref name=s46>Stenersen: 46</ref>

Margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark, because it had a greater population than Norway and Sweden combined.<ref>Derry p. 75</ref> Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of [[Lübeck]] in Bergen in return for recognition of her right to rule, and these hurt the Norwegian economy. The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations.<ref>Derry pp. 77–78</ref> Even worse were the pirates, the "[[Victual Brothers]]", who launched three devastating raids on the port (the last in 1427).<ref>Derry p. 77</ref>

Norway slipped ever more to the background under the [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg dynasty]] (established 1448). There was one revolt under [[Knut Alvsson]] in 1502.<ref>Derry pp. 81–82</ref> Norwegians had some affection for [[Christian II of Denmark|King Christian II]], who resided in the country for several years. Norway took no part in the events which led to Swedish independence from Denmark in the 1520s.<ref>Derry pp. 83–84</ref>

=== Kalmar Union ===
{{Main|Kalmar Union}}
Upon the death of [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] (King of Norway) in 1319, [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Erikson]], at just three years old, inherited the throne as King Magnus VII of Norway. At the same time, a movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful, and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles, Thus, with his election to the throne of Sweden, both Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII.<ref name=larsen>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 192.</ref>

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] radically altered Norway, killing between 50% and 60% of its population<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid = 2197762|year = 1990|last1 = Oeding|first1 = P|title = The black death in Norway|journal = Tidsskrift for den Norske Laegeforening|volume = 110|issue = 17|pages = 2204–08}}</ref> and leaving it in a period of social and economic decline.<ref name=enc>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67758/Black-Death |title=Black Death (pandemic) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref> The plague left Norway very poor.

King Magnus VII ruled Norway until 1350, when his son, Haakon, was placed on the throne as [[Haakon VI of Norway|Haakon VI]].<ref name=autogenerated3>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 195</ref> In 1363, Haakon VI married [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret]], the daughter of King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]].<ref name="enc"/> Upon the death of Haakon VI, in 1379, his son, [[Olaf II of Denmark|Olaf IV]], was only 10 years old.<ref name="enc"/> Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark on 3 May 1376.<ref name="enc"/> Thus, upon Olaf's accession to the throne of Norway, Denmark and Norway entered [[personal union]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 197</ref> Olaf's mother and Haakon's widow, Queen Margaret, managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during the minority of Olaf IV.<ref name="enc"/>

Margaret was working toward a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway by having Olaf elected to the Swedish throne.

On 2 February 1388, Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret.<ref name=enc/> Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. She settled on [[Eric of Pomerania]], grandson of her sister. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries. Thus, royal politics resulted in personal unions between the [[Nordic countries]], eventually bringing the thrones of Norway, [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]] under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the [[Kalmar Union]].

=== Union with Denmark ===
{{Main|Denmark–Norway}}
After Sweden broke out of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1521, Norway tried to follow suit, {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until 1814, a total of 434 years. During the [[Romantic nationalism|national romanticism]] of the 19th century, this period was [[Nicolai Wergeland|by some]] referred to as the "400-Year Night", since all of the kingdom's royal, intellectual, and administrative power was centred in [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark. In fact, it was a period of great prosperity and progress for Norway, especially in terms of shipping and foreign trade, and it also secured the country's revival from the demographic catastrophe it suffered in the [[Black Death]]. Based on the respective natural resources, Denmark–Norway was in fact a very good match since Denmark supported Norway's needs for grain and food supplies, and Norway supplied Denmark with timber, metal, and fish.

With the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|introduction of Protestantism]] in 1536, the archbishopric in Trondheim was dissolved, and Norway lost its independence, and effectually became a colony of Denmark. The Church's incomes and possessions were instead redirected to the court in Copenhagen. Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olav]] at the [[Nidaros]] shrine, and with them, much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of Europe.

Eventually restored as a kingdom (albeit in legislative union with Denmark) in 1661, Norway saw its land area decrease in the 17th century with the loss of the provinces [[Bohuslän|Båhuslen]], [[Jämtland|Jemtland]], and [[Härjedalen|Herjedalen]] to Sweden, as the result of a number of disastrous wars with Sweden. In the north, however, its territory was increased by the acquisition of the northern provinces of [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]], at the expense of Sweden and Russia.

[[File:Eidsvoll riksraad 1814.jpeg|thumb|The 1814 constitutional assembly, painted by [[Oscar Wergeland]].]]

After Denmark–Norway was attacked by the United Kingdom at the 1807 [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]], it entered into an alliance with [[Napoleon]], with the war leading to dire conditions and mass [[starvation]] in 1812. As the Danish kingdom found itself on the losing side in 1814, it was forced, under terms of the [[Treaty of Kiel]], to cede Norway to the king of Sweden, while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown.<ref>[[Treaty of Kiel]], 14 January 1814.</ref> Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on [[United States Constitution|American]] and [[Constitution of France|French]] models, and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway, [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian Frederick]], as king on 17 May 1814. This is the famous [[Norwegian Constitution Day|Syttende mai]] (Seventeenth of May) holiday celebrated by Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans alike. ''Syttende mai'' is also called ''Norwegian Constitution Day''.

Norwegian opposition to the great powers' decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the [[Swedish–Norwegian War (1814)|Norwegian–Swedish War]] to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means. As Sweden's military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright, and Norway's treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war, and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast,<ref>{{cite book|last = Nicolson|first = Harold|title = The Congress of Vienna; a study in allied unity, 1812–1822|publisher = Constable & co. ltd|year = 1946|page =295|quote=The British Government sought to overcome this reluctance by assisting Russia in blockading the coast of Norway}}</ref> the belligerents were forced to negotiate the [[Convention of Moss]]. According to the terms of the convention, Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorised the [[Parliament of Norway]] to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the [[personal union]] that Norway was forced to accept. On 4 November 1814, the Parliament (Storting) elected [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] as king of Norway, thereby establishing the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 572.</ref> Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions, though it shared a common monarch and common foreign policy with Sweden. Following the recession caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], economic development of Norway remained slow until economic growth began around 1830.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 423.</ref>

[[File:Havreskjering Fossheim Lindahl.jpeg|thumb|Harvesting of oats in [[Jølster]], {{circa}} 1890]]

This period also saw the rise of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]], as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character. The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature ([[Henrik Wergeland]] [1808–1845], [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] [1832–1910], [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] [1812–1845], [[Jørgen Moe]] [1813–1882]), painting ([[Hans Gude]] [1825–1903], [[Adolph Tidemand]] [1814–1876]), music ([[Edvard Grieg]] [1843–1907]), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today's two official written forms for Norwegian: [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]].

[[Charles XIV John of Sweden|King Charles III John]], who came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818, was the second king following Norway's break from Denmark and the union with Sweden. Charles John was a complex man whose long reign extended to 1844. He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]]. As such, he was regarded as a liberal monarch for that age. However, he was ruthless in his use of paid informers, the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform—especially the Norwegian national independence movement.<ref>Franklin D. Scott, ''Sweden: the Nation's History'' ([[University of Minnesota Press]]: Minneapolis, 1977) p. 380.</ref>

The [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]] that followed the reign of King Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms. In 1854, women won the right to inherit property in their own right, just like men. In 1863, the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed. Furthermore, women were then eligible for different occupations, particularly the common school teacher.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 432.</ref> By mid-century, Norway's democracy was limited by modern standards: Voting was limited to officials, property owners, leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 431.</ref>

[[File:Saami Family 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sámi people|Sámi]] family in Norway, {{circa}} 1900]]

Still, Norway remained a conservative society. Life in Norway (especially economic life) was "dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government".<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 412.</ref> There was no strong bourgeosie class in Norway to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control of the economy.<ref name="Marx Engels">See "The Civil War in Switzerland" by Frederick Engels contained in Marx & Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) p. 368.</ref> Thus, even while revolution swept over most of the countries of Europe in 1848, Norway was largely unaffected by revolts that year.<ref name="Marx Engels"/>

[[Marcus Thrane]] was a [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]]. He made his appeal to the labouring classes urging a change of social structure "from below upwards." In 1848, he organised a labour society in [[Drammen]]. In just a few months, this society had a membership of 500 and was publishing its own newspaper. Within two years, 300 societies had been organised all over Norway, with a total membership of 20,000 persons. The membership was drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas; for the first time these two groups felt they had a common cause.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 433.</ref> In the end, the revolt was easily crushed; Thrane was captured and in 1855, after four years in jail, was sentenced to three additional years for crimes against the safety of the state. Upon his release, Marcus Thrane attempted unsuccessfully to revitalise his movement, but after the death of his wife, he migrated to the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/593569/Marcus-Moller-Thrane|title=Marcus Møller Thrane – Norwegian journalist and socialist|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

In 1898, all men were granted [[universal suffrage]], followed by all [[Women's suffrage|women]] in 1913.

=== Dissolution of the union ===
{{Main|Norwegian union dissolution referendum, 1905|label 1=Union dissolution referendum|Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden}}
[[Christian Michelsen]], a shipping magnate and statesman, and Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905. A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim descent from medieval royalty. In European tradition, [[Royal descent|royal]] or "blue" blood is a precondition for laying claim to the throne.

The government then offered the throne of Norway to Prince Carl of Denmark, a prince of the Dano-German royal [[house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]] and a distant relative of several of Norway's medieval kings. After centuries of close ties between Norway and Denmark, a prince from the latter was the obvious choice for a European prince who could best relate to the Norwegian people. Following the plebiscite, he was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]], the first king of a fully independent Norway in 508 years (1397: [[Kalmar Union]]); he took the name [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]]. In 1905, the country welcomed the prince from neighbouring Denmark, his wife [[Maud of Wales]] and their young son to re-establish Norway's royal house.

=== First and Second World Wars ===
{{See also|German occupation of Norway|Reichskommissariat Norwegen|Quisling regime}}
[[File:Battle of Norway.jpg|right|thumb|Scenes from the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940]]

Throughout the [[World War I|First World War]], Norway was in theory a neutral country; however, diplomatic pressure from the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] meant that it heavily favored the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] during the war. During the war, Norway exported fish to both Germany and Britain, until an [[ultimatum]] from the British government and [[anti-German sentiment]]s as a result of [[U-boat|German submarines]] [[Unrestricted submarine warfare|targeting]] Norwegian merchantmen led to a termination of trade with Germany. 436 Norwegian merchantmen were sunk by the ''[[Imperial German Navy|Kaiserliche Marine]]'' during the war, with 1,150 Norwegian sailors losing their lives.<ref>* Riste, Olav. ''The Neutral Ally: Norway's relations with belligerent powers in the First World War'' (1995)</ref>

Norway also proclaimed its neutrality during the [[World War II|Second World War]], but despite this, it was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by German forces]] on 9 April 1940. Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see: [[Battle of Drøbak Sound]], [[Norwegian Campaign]], and [[Invasion of Norway]]), military and naval resistance lasted for two months. Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the [[Battles of Narvik]], until they were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]].

[[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government escaped to [[Rotherhithe]] in London. Throughout the war they sent inspirational radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions in Norway against the Germans. On the day of the invasion, the leader of the small National-Socialist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], [[Vidkun Quisling]], tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority, [[Reichskommissar]] [[Josef Terboven]]. Quisling, as ''minister president'', later formed a [[Quisling regime|collaborationist government under German control]]. Up to 15,000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units, including the [[Waffen-SS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuav.net/volunter.html |title=Norwegian volunteers in the Wehrmacht and SS |publisher=Nuav.net |date=9 April 1940 |access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>

The fraction of the Norwegian population that supported Germany was traditionally smaller than in Sweden, but greater than is generally appreciated today.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It included a number of prominent personalities such as the Nobel-prize winning novelist [[Knut Hamsun]]. The concept of a "Germanic Union" of member states fit well into their thoroughly nationalist-patriotic ideology.

[[File:Ole Friele Backer norske flygere.jpg|thumb|right|Norwegian fighter pilots in the United Kingdom during World War II]]

Many Norwegians and persons of Norwegian descent joined the Allied forces as well as the [[Free Norwegian Forces]]. In June 1940, a small group had left Norway following their king to Britain. This group included 13 ships, five aircraft, and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy. By the end of the war, the force had grown to 58 ships and 7,500 men in service in the Royal Norwegian Navy, 5 squadrons of aircraft (including Spitfires, Sunderland flying boats and Mosquitos) in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force, and land forces including the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] and 5 Troop as well as No. 10 [[British Commandos|Commandos]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

During the five years of [[German occupation of Norway|German occupation]], Norwegians built a [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance movement]] which fought the German occupation forces with both civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of [[Norsk Hydro]]'s [[heavy water]] plant and stockpile of heavy water at [[Vemork]], which crippled the German nuclear programme (see: ''[[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]''). More important to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however, was the role of the Norwegian [[Merchant Navy|Merchant Marine]]. At the time of the [[invasion]], Norway had the fourth-largest merchant marine fleet in the world. It was led by the Norwegian shipping company [[Nortraship]] under the Allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation of Dunkirk]] to the [[Normandy landings]]. Every December Norway gives a [[Christmas tree]] to the United Kingdom as thanks for the British assistance during the Second World War.

=== Post-World War II history ===
From 1945 to 1962, the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] held an absolute majority in the parliament. The government, led by prime minister [[Einar Gerhardsen]], embarked on a programme inspired by [[Keynesian economics]], emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and [[employers' organisation]]s. Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the [[rationing]] of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price controls and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.
[[File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg|thumb|Since the 1970s oil production has helped to expand the Norwegian economy and finance the Norwegian state. ([[Statfjord oil field]])]]
The wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States was continued in the post-war years. Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy, the Labour Party distanced itself from the Communists, especially after the Communists' seizure of power in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the US. Norway received [[Marshall Plan]] aid from the United States starting in 1947, joined the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) one year later, and became a founding member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949.

The first oil was discovered at the small Balder field in 1967, but production only began in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norskolje.museum.no/balder/|title=Balder – Norsk Oljemuseum|website=www.norskolje.museum.no|access-date=6 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007021055/http://www.norskolje.museum.no/balder/|archive-date=7 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1969, the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] discovered petroleum resources at the [[Ekofisk oil field|Ekofisk]] field west of Norway. In 1973, the Norwegian government founded the State oil company, [[Statoil]]. Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment that was required to establish the country's petroleum industry. Around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. Since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.

Norway was a founding member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Norway was twice invited to join the [[European Union]], but ultimately declined to join after referendums that failed by narrow margins in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20830201|title=Norwegian minister Espen Eide urges UK caution on quitting EU |date=23 December 2012 |publisher=BBC |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref>
[[File:2011 Norway attacks flower march 2.jpg|thumb|Town Hall Square in Oslo filled with people with roses mourning the victims of the [[2011 Norway attacks#Utøya massacre|Utøya massacre]] of 22 July 2011]]
In 1981, a [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] government led by [[Kåre Willoch]] replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the [[stagflation|stagflated economy]] with tax cuts, economic liberalisation, deregulation of markets, and measures to curb record-high inflation (13.6% in 1981).

Norway's first female prime minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] of the Labour Party continued many of the reforms of her Conservative predecessor, while backing traditional Labour concerns such as [[social security]], high taxes, the industrialisation of nature, and feminism. By the late 1990s, Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a [[sovereign wealth fund]]. Since the 1990s, a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend, and how much it should save.

In 2011, Norway suffered [[2011 Norway attacks|two terrorist attacks]] on the same day conducted by [[Anders Behring Breivik]] which struck the [[Regjeringskvartalet|government quarter]] in Oslo and a summer camp of the Labour party's [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|youth movement]] at [[Utøya]] island, resulting in 77 deaths and 319 wounded.

The [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election]] brought a more conservative government to power, with the Conservative Party and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] winning 43% of the electorate's votes. In the [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|Norwegian parliamentary election 2017]] the centre-right government of Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] won re-election.<ref name="reuters.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-election-idUSKCN1BL0J3|title=Norway's right-wing government wins re-election fought on oil, tax|first=Henrik Stolen, Joachim|last=Dagenborg|newspaper=Reuters|date=12 September 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref> The [[2021 Norwegian parliamentary election]] saw a big win for the left-wing opposition in an election fought on climate change, inequality, and oil.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Buli|first1=Nora|last2=Klesty|first2=Victoria|date=14 September 2021|title=Norway's left-wing opposition wins in a landslide, coalition talks next|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-opposition-expected-win-election-fought-oil-inequality-2021-09-13/|access-date=19 October 2021}}</ref> On 14 October 2021, [[Jonas Gahr Støre]], the leader of Norway’s center-left Labor Party, was sworn in as new Prime Minister of Norway.

The land is mostly made of hard [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] rock, but [[slate]], [[sandstone]], and [[limestone]] are also common, and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits. Because of the [[Gulf Stream]] and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. The northernmost part has a mostly maritime [[Subarctic climate]], while Svalbard has an [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] climate.

Because of the large latitudinal range of the country and the varied topography and climate, Norway has a larger number of different [[habitat]]s than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and viruses). The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Norwegian_Shelf_large_marine_ecosystem|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101005147/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Norwegian_Shelf_large_marine_ecosystem|archive-date=1 November 2012 |title=Norwegian Shelf ecosystem |publisher=Eoearth.org |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Precipitation normal Norway.jpg|thumb|Map of Norway showing the normal precipitation (annual average). Period 1961–1990.]]
The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts. Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a [[rain shadow]], and have lower rain and snow totals than the west. The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest  summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime. The sunniest weather is along the south coast, but sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny -  the sunniest month with 430 sunhrs was recorded in Tromsø.<ref name=Norwegian-Meteorological-Institute>{{cite web|url=https://met.no/English/Climate_in_Norway/|title=Climate in Norway(English)|last=Met.no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320232734/https://met.no/English/Climate_in_Norway/|archive-date=20 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=Book-Climate>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=az3qCAAAQBAJ&q=koppen+climate+norway&pg=PA5|title=Selected climatic data for a global set of standard stations for vegetation|isbn=978-9400980402|date=6 December 2012|last1=Muller|first1=M. J.}}</ref>

Because of Norway's high [[latitude]], there are large seasonal variations in daylight. From late May to late July, the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (hence Norway's description as the "Land of the [[Midnight sun]]"), and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day. Conversely, from late November to late January, the sun never rises above the horizon in the north, and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country.

The coastal climate of Norway is exceptionally mild compared with areas on similar latitudes elsewhere in the world, with the [[Gulf Stream]] passing directly offshore the northern areas of the Atlantic coast, continuously warming the region in the winter. Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional, with southern Lofoten and [[Bø, Nordland|Bø]] having all monthly means above freezing (lacking a meteorological winter) in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle. The very northernnmost coast of Norway would thus be ice-covered in winter if not for the Gulf Stream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/|title=The Gulf Stream Myth|website=ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu}}</ref> Norway east of the mountain chan, like Oslo has more of a continental climate. The mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates. There is also higher rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic, especially the western slopes of the mountain ranges and areas close, such as Bergen. The valleys east of the mountain ranges are the driest; some of the valleys are sheltered by mountains in most directions. [[Saltdal]] (81 m) in Nordland is the driest place with {{convert|211|mm|abbr=off}} precipitation annually (1991-2020). In southern Norway, [[Skjåk]] in Innlandet get {{convert|295|mm|abbr=off}} precipitation. [[Finnmarksvidda]] and some interior valleys of [[Troms]] receive around {{convert|400|mm|abbr=off}} annually, and the high Arctic [[Longyearbyen]] {{convert|217|mm|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/artikkel/norske-steder-blant-de-torreste-i-europa-1.13096592|title=Norske steder blant de tørreste i Europa (Places in Norway among the driest in Europe)|last=NRK|date=21 August 2016|publisher=[[NRK]]|access-date=26 August 2016}}</ref>

Parts of southeastern Norway including parts of [[Mjøsa]] have a [[humid continental climate]]s ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Dfb), while the southern and western coasts and also the coast north to Bodø have a [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb), while the outer coast further north almost to North Cape have a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). Further inland in the south and at higher altitudes, and also in much of Northern Norway, the [[subarctic climate]] (Dfc) dominates. A small strip of land along the coast east of North Cape (including Vardø) earlier had [[Polar climate|tundra/alpine/polar climate]] (ET), but this is mostly gone with the updated 1991-2020 climate normals, making this also subarctic. Large parts of Norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus, and about one third of the land is above the treeline and thus exhibit [[Tundra climate|tundra/alpine/polar climate]] (ET).<ref name="Norwegian-Meteorological-Institute"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/country/38/|title=Climate of Norway: Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Norway|publisher=Climate-Data.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Updated world map of the Koppen-Geiger climate classification|last=A study behind the updated maps of Köppen-Geiger climate classification|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|year=2007|volume=11|issue=5|pages=1633–1644|doi=10.5194/HESS-11-1633-2007|bibcode=2007HESS...11.1633P|s2cid=9654551|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Book-Climate"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm|title=World map of Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–263|last=Website with maps|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405164155/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm|archive-date=5 April 2017|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K|year=2006|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130}}</ref>

According to the [[Constitution of Norway]], which was adopted on 17 May 1814<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web|url=https://stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |title=The Constitution – Complete text |work=The Storting's Information Corner |year=2011 |access-date=9 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829055430/http://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |archive-date=29 August 2011}}</ref> and inspired by the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and [[French Revolution]] of 1776 and 1789, respectively, Norway is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] of government, wherein the [[Monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]] is the [[head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of Norway|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]]. Power is separated among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, as defined by the Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.

The [[Norwegian Royal Family|monarch]] officially retains executive power. But following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c27300/seksjonstekst/vis.html?tid=29977|title=The King's constitutional role |publisher=The Royal Court of Norway |access-date=24 April 2009}}</ref> such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other ministers in the executive government. Accordingly, the Monarch is [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]], and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity. [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]] of the [[House of Glücksburg|House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]] was crowned King of Norway in 1991, the first since the 14th century who has been born in the country.<ref name="norway.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/monarchy/ |title=The Monarchy |publisher=Norway.org |date=24 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222042421/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/monarchy/ |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway]], is the legal and rightful heir to the throne and the Kingdom.

In practice, the Prime Minister exercises the executive powers. Constitutionally, legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway, but the latter is the supreme legislature and a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/storting/ |title=The Storting |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126212450/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/storting/ |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref> Norway is fundamentally structured as a [[representative democracy]]. The Parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the 169 representatives, who are elected on the basis of [[proportional representation]] from 19 constituencies for four-year terms.

150 are elected directly from the 19 constituencies, and an additional 19 seats ("levelling seats") are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties. A 4% election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in Parliament.<ref name="Election threshold">{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/norway.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |first=Wolfram |last=Nordsieck |publisher=parties-and-elections.de |year=2011 |quote=Storting, 4-year term, 4% threshold (supplementary seats) |access-date=10 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903220240/http://parties-and-elections.de/norway.html |archive-date=3 September 2011}}</ref> There are a total of 169 members of parliament.

The Parliament of Norway, called the ''[[Parliament of Norway|Stortinget]]'' (meaning Grand Assembly), ratifies national [[treaty|treaties]] developed by the executive branch. It can [[impeachment|impeach]] members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional. If an indicted suspect is impeached, Parliament has the power to remove the person from office.

The position of [[Prime Minister of Norway|prime minister]], Norway's head of government, is allocated to the member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament, usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a government on its own. Norway has often been ruled by minority governments.

The prime minister nominates the cabinet, traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/government |title=The Government |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903135300/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/government/ |archive-date=3 September 2010}}</ref> Norway has a state church, the Lutheran [[Church of Norway]], which has in recent years gradually been granted more internal autonomy in day-to-day affairs, but which still has a special constitutional status. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the Church of Norway, meaning at least ten out of the 19 ministries. This rule was however removed in 2012. The issue of [[separation of church and state]] in Norway has been increasingly controversial, as many people believe it is time to change this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] at [[Strasbourg]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-81356#{"itemid":["001-81356"]} |title= Case of Folgerø and Others v. Norway |date=29 June 2007 |access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref> in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dagen.no/dagensdebatt/lederartikkel/P%C3%A5-statskirkens-siste-dag-429116|title=På statskirkens siste dag|newspaper=Dagen.no|language=no|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205111011/http://www.dagen.no/dagensdebatt/lederartikkel/P%C3%A5-statskirkens-siste-dag-429116|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Through the [[Norwegian Council of State|Council of State]], a [[privy council]] presided over by the monarch, the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] and formally consult the Monarch. All government bills need the formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to Parliament. The Council reviews and approves all of the monarch's actions as head of state. Although all government and parliamentary acts are decided beforehand, the privy council is an example of symbolic gesture the king retains.<ref name="norway.org"/>

Members of the Storting are directly elected from [[party-list proportional representation|party-lists]] [[proportional representation]] in nineteen [[plurality voting system|plural-member]] constituencies in a national [[multi-party system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/general/ |title=Form of Government |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120222042417/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/general/ |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> Historically, both the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] have played leading political roles. In the early 21st century, the Labour Party has been in power since the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 election]], in a [[Red–Green Coalition]] with the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.123independenceday.com/norway/political-system.html |title=Political System of Norway |publisher=123independenceday.com |access-date=27 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225175552/http://www.123independenceday.com/norway/political-system.html |archive-date=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since 2005, both the Conservative Party and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] have won numerous seats in the Parliament, but not sufficient in the [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 general election]] to overthrow the coalition. Commentators have pointed to the poor co-operation between the opposition parties, including the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]]. [[Jens Stoltenberg]], the leader of the Labour Party, continued to have the necessary majority through his multi-party alliance to continue as PM until 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/ |title=Political System |publisher=Norway.org |date=18 November 2009 |access-date=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412142148/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/ |archive-date=12 April 2010}}</ref>

In national elections in September 2013, voters ended eight years of Labor rule. Two political parties, [[Høyre]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Fremskrittspartiet]], elected on promises of tax cuts, more spending on infrastructure and education, better services and stricter rules on immigration, formed a government. Coming at a time when Norway's economy is in good condition with low unemployment, the rise of the right appeared to be based on other issues. [[Erna Solberg]] became prime minister, the second female prime minister after [[Gro Harlem Brundtland|Brundtland]] and the first conservative prime minister since [[Jan P. Syse|Syse]]. Solberg said her win was "a historic election victory for the right-wing parties".<ref>{{cite web|author=Bevanger, Lars |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24014551 |title=Norway election: Erna Solberg to form new government |publisher=BBC |date=10 September 2013 |access-date=15 February 2014}}</ref> Her center-right government won re-election in [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|Norwegian 2017 parliamentary election]].<ref name="reuters.com"/> Norway’s new center-left cabinet under Prime Minister [[Jonas Gahr Støre|Jonas Gahr Stoere]], the leader of Norway’s center-left Labor Party, took office on 14 October 2021 The previous center-right government was ousted in the Sept. 13 [[2021 Norwegian parliamentary election|election]] after two four-year terms.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2021-10-14/norways-prime-minister-present-his-new-government</ref>

Norway, a [[unitary state]], is divided into eleven first-level administrative [[county|counties]] (''fylke''). The counties are administered through directly elected county assemblies who elect the County Governor. Additionally, the [[Norwegian Royal Family|King]] and government are represented in every county by a [[County governor (Norway)|fylkesmann]], who effectively acts as a Governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/local/ |title=Local Government |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |access-date=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231520/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/local/ |archive-date=11 June 2010}}</ref> As such, the Government is directly represented at a local level through the County Governors' offices. The counties are then sub-divided into 356 second-level municipalities (''kommuner''), which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet. The capital of [[Oslo]] is considered both a county and a municipality. Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland: [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]], the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Introduction to Norway » Government & Politics |url=https://www.lifeinnorway.net/about-norway/government/ |website=Life in Norway|date=5 February 2017 }}</ref>

[[File:Nye fylker - regjeringen.no.svg|thumb|left|Administrative divisions of Norway after the June 2017 reform.]]
96 settlements have [[List of towns and cities in Norway|city]] status in Norway. In most cases, the city borders are coterminous with the borders of their respective municipalities. Often, Norwegian city municipalities include large areas that are not developed; for example, Oslo municipality contains large forests, located north and south-east of the city, and over half of Bergen municipality consists of mountainous areas.

=== Judicial system and law enforcement ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Norway}}
Norway uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the [[Courts of justice of Norway]]. It consists of the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]] of 20 permanent judges and a [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway|Chief Justice]], [[appellate court]]s, city and [[Courts of justice of Norway#District courts|district courts]], and [[conciliation councils]].<ref name="norway">{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/judiciary/ |title=The Judiciary |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126212439/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/judiciary/ |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref> The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches. While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office, their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch in the Council of State. Usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.

The Courts' strict and formal mission is to regulate the Norwegian judicial system, interpret the Constitution, and as such implement the legislation adopted by Parliament. In its judicial reviews, it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation.<ref name="norway"/>

The [[Law enforcement in Norway|law is enforced in Norway]] by the [[Norwegian Police Service]]. It is a Unified National Police Service made up of 27 Police Districts and several specialist agencies, such as [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]], known as ''Økokrim''; and the [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|National Criminal Investigation Service]], known as ''Kripos'', each headed by a chief of police. The Police Service is headed by the [[National Police Directorate]], which reports to the Ministry of Justice and the Police. The Police Directorate is headed by a National Police Commissioner. The only exception is the [[Norwegian Police Security Service|Norwegian Police Security Agency]], whose head answers directly to the Ministry of Justice and the Police.

Norway abolished the death penalty for regular criminal acts in 1902. The legislature abolished the death penalty for high treason in war and war-crimes in 1979. [[Reporters Without Borders]], in its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, ranked Norway at a shared first place (along with Iceland) out of 169 countries.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100507002549/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2007%2C34.html Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007], Reporters Without Borders.</ref>

In general, the legal and institutional framework in Norway is characterised by a high degree of transparency, accountability and integrity, and the perception and the occurrence of corruption are very low.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013-Norway|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=norway|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021022145/http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=norway|archive-date=21 October 2014|publisher=Transparency International|access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref> Norway has ratified all relevant international anti-corruption conventions, and its standards of implementation and enforcement of anti-corruption legislation are considered very high by many international anti-corruption working groups such as the OECD Anti-Bribery Working Group. However, there are some isolated cases showing that some municipalities have abused their position in public procurement processes.

Norwegian prisons are humane, rather than tough, with emphasis on rehabilitation. At 20%, Norway's re-conviction rate is among the lowest in the world.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35813470 Anders Breivik: Just how cushy are Norwegian prisons?] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

The Norwegian economy is an example of a [[mixed economy]]; a prosperous capitalist [[welfare state]] it features a combination of [[free market]] activity and large state ownership in certain key sectors, influenced by both [[Liberal Party (Norway)|liberal]] governments from the late 19th century and later by [[Labour Party (Norway)|social democratic]] governments in the postwar era.

The state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors, such as the strategic petroleum sector ([[Statoil]]), hydroelectric energy production ([[Statkraft]]), aluminium production ([[Norsk Hydro]]), the largest Norwegian bank ([[DNB ASA|DNB]]), and telecommunication provider ([[Telenor]]). Through these big companies, the government controls approximately 30% of the stock values at the Oslo Stock Exchange. When non-listed companies are included, the state has even higher share in ownership (mainly from direct oil licence ownership). Norway is a major shipping nation and has the world's 6th largest [[Ship transport|merchant fleet]], with 1,412 Norwegian-owned merchant vessels.

[[File:EU and EFTA.svg|thumb|Members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (green) participate in the [[European Single Market]] and are part of the [[Schengen Area]].]]
By referendums in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]], Norwegians rejected proposals to join the European Union (EU). However, Norway, together with [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], participates in the European Union's single market through the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty between the European Union countries and the EFTA countries—transposed into Norwegian law via "EØS-loven"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19921127-109.html |title=EØS-loven – EØSl. Lov om gjennomføring i norsk rett av hoveddelen i avtale om Det europeiske økonomiske samarbeidsområde (EØS) m.v. (EØS-loven) |publisher=Lovdata.no |access-date=14 February 2009}}</ref>—describes the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the other EFTA countries. Norway is a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. Some sectors, such as agriculture, oil and fish, are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the [[Schengen Agreement]] and several other intergovernmental agreements among the EU member states.

The country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum, [[hydropower]], fish, [[forestry|forests]], and minerals. Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s, which led to a boom in the economy. Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population. In 2011, 28% of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry.<ref>"[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3421.htm Norway]," U.S. Department of State</ref>

Norway is the first country which banned cutting of trees (deforestation), in order to prevent rain forests from vanishing. The country declared its intention at the UN Climate Summit in 2014, alongside Great Britain and Germany. Crops, that are typically linked to forests' destruction are timber, soy, palm oil and beef. Now Norway has to find a new way to provide these essential products without exerting negative influence on its environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/europe/norway-deforestation/index.html|title=Norway first in world to ban deforestation|author=Farida Fawzy|website=CNN|date=8 June 2016}}</ref>

;Oil industry
[[File:Heidrun, Norskehavet (28276260560).jpg|thumb|Oil production has been central to the Norwegian economy since the 1970s, with a dominating [[state ownership]] ([[Heidrun oil field]])]]
Export revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20% of the GDP.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Statistics Norway]] |chapter-url=http://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/this-is-norway/ |title=This is Norway |chapter=Secondary Industries |page=75 |date=14 October 2019 |access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of [[OPEC]]. In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund ([[The Government Pension Fund of Norway|"Government Pension Fund – Global"]]), which would be funded with oil revenues, including taxes, dividends, sales revenues and licensing fees. This was intended to reduce overheating in the economy from oil revenues, minimise uncertainty from volatility in oil price, and provide a cushion to compensate for expenses associated with the ageing of the population.

The government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields (with approximately 62% ownership in [[Statoil]] in 2007) and the fully state-owned [[Petoro]], which has a market value of about twice Statoil, and [[State's Direct Financial Interest|SDFI]]. Finally, the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields. The fund invests in developed financial markets outside Norway. Spending from the fund is constrained by the budgetary rule (''Handlingsregelen''), which limits spending over time to no more than the real value yield of the fund, originally assumed to be 4% a year, but lowered in 2017 to 3% of the fund's total value.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/the-economy/economic-policy/economic-policy/id418083/ |title=The Norwegian Fiscal Policy Framework |date=20 March 2019 |publisher=Government.no |access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref>

;Oil fields
Between 1966 and 2013, Norwegian companies drilled 5085 oil wells, mostly in the [[North Sea]].<ref name="NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells">Ole Mathismoen (5 August 2013) ''Aftenposten'' p. 5</ref> Of these 3672 are ''utviklingsbrønner'' (regular production);<ref name="NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells"/> 1413 are ''letebrønner'' (exploration); and 1405 have been terminated (''avsluttet'').<ref name="NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells"/>

The Norwegian Central Bank operates investment offices in London, New York, and Shanghai. Guidelines implemented in 2007 allow the fund to invest up to 60% of the capital in shares (maximum of 40% prior), while the rest may be placed in bonds and real-estate. As the stock markets tumbled in September 2008, the fund was able to buy more shares at low prices. In this way, the losses incurred by the market turmoil was recuperated by November 2009.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Other nations with economies based on natural resources, such as Russia, are trying to learn from Norway by establishing similar funds. The investment choices of the Norwegian fund are directed by [[Socially responsible investing|ethical guidelines]]; for example, the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons. Norway's highly [[transparency (market)|transparent]] investment scheme<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbim.no/en/transparency/|title=Transparency|website=www.nbim.no|language=en-GB|access-date=22 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121103940/https://www.nbim.no/en/transparency/|archive-date=21 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> is lauded by the international community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b6e0e756-e87c-11e1-8397-00144feab49a|title=Investment: Norway's nest egg|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=22 November 2018}}</ref> The future size of the fund is closely linked to the price of oil and to developments in international financial markets.

In 2000, the government sold one-third of the state-owned oil company Statoil in an [[Initial public offering|IPO]]. The next year, the main telecom supplier, [[Telenor]], was listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]]. The state also owns significant shares of Norway's largest bank, [[DNB ASA|DnB NOR]] and the airline [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]. Since 2000, economic growth has been rapid, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s (unemployment in 2007: 1.3%). The international financial crisis has primarily affected the industrial sector, but unemployment has remained low, and was at 3.3% (86,000 people) in August 2011. In contrast to Norway, Sweden had substantially higher actual and projected unemployment numbers as a result of the recession. Thousands of mainly young Swedes migrated to Norway for work during these years, which is easy, as the labour market and social security systems overlap in the Nordic Countries. In the first quarter of 2009, the GNP of Norway surpassed Sweden's for the first time in history, although its population is half the size.

The [[Sámi people]] are indigenous to the Far North and have traditionally inhabited central and northern parts of Norway and Sweden, as well as areas in northern Finland and in Russia on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. Another national minority are the [[Kven people]], descendants of Finnish-speaking people who migrated to northern Norway from the 18th up to the 20th century. From the 19th century up to the 1970s, the Norwegian government tried to assimilate both the Sámi and the Kven, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion.<ref>Eivind Bråstad Jensen. 1991.

Until 2012 parliamentary officials were required to be members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Norway, and at least half of all government ministers had to be a member of the state church. As state church, the Church of Norway's clergy were viewed as state employees, and the central and regional church administrations were part of the state administration.

Most Norwegians are registered at baptism as members of the Church of Norway, which has been Norway's [[state church]] since its establishment. In recent years the church has been granted increasing internal autonomy, but it retains its special constitutional status and other special ties to the state, and the constitution requires that the reigning monarch must be a member and states that the country's values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage. Many remain in the church to participate in the community and practices such as [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], marriage and burial rites. About 70.6% of Norwegians were members of the Church of Norway in 2017. In 2017, about 53.6% of all newborns were baptised and about 57.9% of all 15-year-old persons were [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmed]] in the church.<ref>[http://www.ssb.no/en/kultur-og-fritid/statistikker/kirke_kostra/aar Church of Norway, 2017] 4 June 2018 Statistics Norway</ref>

==== Indigenous religions ====
As in other Scandinavian countries, the ancient Norse followed a form of native [[Germanic paganism]] known as [[Norse paganism]]. By the end of the 11th century, when Norway had been [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianised]], the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited. Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names, referential names of cities and locations, the days of the week, and other parts of everyday language. Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of pagan religious practices in the form of ''[[Germanic Neopaganism|Åsatru]].'' The Norwegian ''[[Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost]]'' formed in 1996; in 2011, the fellowship had about 300 members. ''Foreningen Forn Sed'' was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the Norwegian government.

The Sámi minority retained their [[Sámi shamanism|shamanistic religion]] well into the 18th century, when most converted to Christianity under the influence of Dano-Norwegian Lutheran [[missionaries]]. Although some insist that "indigenous Sámi religion had effectively been eradicated,'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm |title=The Decline of the Sámi People's Indigenous Religion |last=Holloway |first=Alan |website=Sami Culture |access-date=23 March 2017}}</ref> anthropologist [[Gutorm Gjessing]]'s ''Changing Lapps'' (1954) argues that the Sámi's "were outwardly and to all practical purposes converted to Christianity, but at the subconscious and unconscious level, the shamistic frenzy survived, more or less latent, only awaiting the necessary stimulus to break out into the open."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Changing Lapps: A Study in Culture Relations in Northernmost Norway |last=Gjessing |first=Gutorm |publisher=Ejnar Munksgaard |year=1954 |location=Copenhagen |page=27}}</ref> Today there is a renewed appreciation for the Sámi traditional way of life, which has led to a revival of ''[[Noaidevuohta]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2792-shamanism-approved-as-a-religion-in-norway |title=Shamanism Approved as a Religion in Norway |publisher=Tnp.no |date=15 March 2012 |access-date=12 October 2013}}</ref> Some Norwegian and Sámi celebrities are reported to visit [[shamans]] for guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kjendis.no/2012/05/08/kjendis/sjaman/geir_kvarme/mari_maurstad/21498916/ |title=Geir Kvarme gikk til sjaman for å få balanse |publisher=Kjendis.no |access-date=22 September 2012 |date=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715005848/http://www.kjendis.no/2012/05/08/kjendis/sjaman/geir_kvarme/mari_maurstad/21498916/ |archive-date=15 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=AV: ellen kongsnes |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/Samisk-sjaman-skapte-oljefeber-2927059.html |title=Samisk sjaman skapte oljefeber |publisher=Aftenbladet.no |access-date=22 September 2012}}</ref>

Norway was awarded first place according to the UN's [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) for 2013.<ref>{{cite book|last1=United Nations|title=Human Development Report 2013|publisher=United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)|isbn=978-9211263404|date=November 2012}}</ref> In the 1800s, by contrast, poverty and [[communicable disease]]s dominated in Norway together with [[famine]]s and epidemics. From the 1900s, improvements in public health occurred as a result of development in several areas such as social and [[living condition]]s, changes in disease and medical outbreaks, establishment of the health care system, and emphasis on public health matters. [[Vaccination]] and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements within the Norwegian population. Improved hygiene and better nutrition were factors that contributed to improved health.

The disease pattern in Norway changed from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases and chronic diseases as [[cardiovascular disease]]. Inequalities and social differences are still present in public health in Norway today.<ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 – 2014">{{cite web|last1=Nordhagen|first1=R|last2=Major|first2=E|last3=Tverdal|first3=A|last4=Irgens|first4=L|last5=Graff-Iversen|first5=S|title=Folkehelse i Norge 1814–2014|url=http://www.fhi.no/artikler/?id=110607|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140904132346/http://www.fhi.no/artikler/?id=110607|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 September 2014|publisher=Folkehelseinstituttet|access-date=2 September 2014|year=2014}}</ref>

====Norwegian====
Norwegian is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language descended from [[Old Norse]]. It is the main national language of Norway and is spoken throughout the country. Norwegian is spoken natively by over 5 million people mainly in Norway, but is generally understood throughout [[Scandinavia]] and to a lesser degree other [[Nordic countries]]. It has two official written forms, ''[[Bokmål]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]''. Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media. Bokmål is the written language used by a large majority of about 85%. Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages. All Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible, although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle to understand certain phrases and pronunciations in some other dialects.

Norwegian is closely related to and generally mutually intelligible with its neighbour [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]]; [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and the three main Scandinavian languages thus form both a [[dialect continuum]] and a larger language community with about 25 million speakers. All three languages are commonly employed in communication among inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries. As a result of the co-operation within the [[Nordic Council]], inhabitants of all Nordic countries always have the right to communicate with Norwegian authorities in Danish or Swedish as equal alternatives to Norwegian.<ref>{{Cite web|date=26 January 2017|title=Interesting Facts About the Norwegian Language (Norsk)|url=https://www.nordictrans.com/blog/interesting-facts-norwegian-language/|access-date=17 November 2020|website=Nordictrans.com|language=en-US}}</ref> In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Norwegian language was subject to [[Norwegian language conflict|strong political and cultural controversies]]. This led to the development of Nynorsk in the 19th century and to the formation of alternative spelling standards in the 20th century.

====Sámi and Kven====
Several [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] Sámi languages, which are related but not generally mutually intelligible, are traditionally spoken by the Sámi people primarily in Northern Norway and to much lesser extent in some parts of Central Norway. Around 15,000 people have officially registered as Sámi in the Sámi census (''Samemanntallet''), but the number of people of recent Sámi heritage is often estimated at around 50,000 people. The number of people who have some knowledge of Northern Sámi, including as a second language, is estimated at around 25,000 people, but only a minority are native speakers. The other Sámi languages are heavily endangered and spoken by at most a few hundred people. Most people of Sámi heritage are today native speakers of Norwegian as a result of past assimilation policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eplads.norden.org/nordenssprak/kap2/2c/01.asp |title=Nordens språk med røtter og føtter–Samiske språk |publisher=Eplads.norden.org |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> Speakers have a right to be educated and to receive communication from the government in their own language in a special ''forvaltningsområde'' (administrative area) for Sámi languages.<ref>[http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1987-06-12-56#KAPITTEL_3 "Lov om Sametinget og andre samiske rettsforhold (sameloven) – Lovdata"]. lovdata.no.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/nouer/1995/nou-1995-18/35/2/6.html?id=337330 |publisher=Kunnskapsdepartementet |title=NOU 1995: 18 – Ny lovgivning om opplæring |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027205706/http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/nouer/1995/nou-1995-18/35/2/6.html?id=337330 |archive-date=27 October 2014|date=4 July 1995 }}</ref> The [[Kven people|Kven]] minority historically spoke the Uralic [[Kven language]] (considered a separate language in Norway, but generally perceived as a Finnish dialect in Finland).

Students who are children of immigrant parents are encouraged to learn the Norwegian language. The Norwegian government offers language instructional courses for immigrants wishing to obtain Norwegian citizenship. With increasing concern about assimilating immigrants, since 1 September 2008, the government has required that an applicant for Norwegian citizenship give evidence of proficiency in either Norwegian or in one of the Sámi languages, or give proof of having attended classes in Norwegian for 300 hours, or meet the language requirements for university studies in Norway (that is, by being proficient in one of the Scandinavian languages).

The primary foreign language taught in Norwegian schools is English, considered an international language since the post-WWII era. The majority of the population is fairly fluent in English, especially those born after World War II. German, French and Spanish are also commonly taught as second or, more often, third languages. Russian, Japanese, Italian, [[Latin]], and rarely [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese (Mandarin)]] are offered in some schools, mostly in the cities. Traditionally, English, German and French were considered the main foreign languages in Norway. These languages, for instance, were used on [[Norwegian passport]]s until the 1990s, and university students have a general right to use these languages when submitting their theses.

{{Main|Culture of Norway}}
[[File:Wilhelmine Seippel.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Norwegian farmer's costumes, known as ''folkedrakt'', and modern costumes inspired by those costumes, known as ''[[bunad]]'', are widely used on special occasions.]]
The Norwegian farm culture continues to play a role in contemporary Norwegian culture. In the 19th century, it inspired a strong [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|romantic nationalistic]] movement, which is still visible in the [[Norwegian language]] and [[:Category:Mass media in Norway|media]]. Norwegian culture blossomed with nationalist efforts to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music. This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556517_4/norway.html |title="Norway's Culture", ''Encarta'' |publisher=Webcitation.org |access-date=15 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028211352/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556517_4/Norway.html |archive-date=28 October 2009 }}</ref>

=== Human rights ===
{{main|Human rights in Norway}}
Norway has been considered a progressive country, which has adopted legislation and policies to support women's rights, minority rights, and [[LGBT rights in Norway|LGBT rights]]. As early as 1884, 171 of the leading figures, among them five Prime Ministers for the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, co-founded the [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]].<ref>Aslaug Moksnes. ''Likestilling eller særstilling? Norsk kvinnesaksforening 1884–1913'' (p. 35), [[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]], 1984, {{ISBN|8205153566}}</ref> They successfully campaigned for women's [[right to education]], [[women's suffrage]], the [[right to work]], and other gender equality policies. From the 1970s, gender equality also came high on the state agenda, with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality, which evolved into the [[Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud]]. Civil society organisations also continue to play an important role, and the women's rights organisations are today organised in the [[Norwegian Women's Lobby]] umbrella organisation.

In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was amended to grant [[absolute primogeniture]] to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child. The Norwegian constitution Article 6 states that "For those born before the year 1990 it shall...be the case that a male shall take precedence over a female."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |title=The Constitution – Complete text |publisher=Stortinget.no |access-date=23 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190647/http://stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |archive-date=29 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Norwegian literature}}
{{See also|List of Norwegian writers}}
[[File:Sigrid Undset 1928.jpg|thumb|311x311px|[[Sigrid Undset]]]]
The history of Norwegian literature starts with the [[Norse paganism|pagan]] [[Poetic Edda|Eddaic poems]] and [[skald]]ic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries, with poets such as [[Bragi Boddason]] and [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]]. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, [[hagiography]] and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include ''[[Historia Norwegiæ]]'', ''[[Þiðrekssaga]]'' and ''[[Konungs skuggsjá]]''.

Little Norwegian literature came out of the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387–1814), with some notable exceptions such as [[Petter Dass]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]]. In his play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', Ibsen characterised this period as "Twice two hundred years of darkness/brooded o'er the race of monkeys." The first line of this couplet is frequently quoted. During the union with Denmark, the government imposed using only written Danish, which decreased the writing of Norwegian literature.
[[File:Ibsen photography.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henrik Ibsen]]|317x317px]]
Two major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature: in 1811 a Norwegian university was established in [[Oslo|Christiania]]. Secondly, seized by the spirit of revolution following the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions, the Norwegians created their first [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]] in 1814. Strong authors were inspired who became recognised first in Scandinavia, and then worldwide; among them were [[Henrik Wergeland]], [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]], [[Jørgen Moe]] and [[Camilla Collett]].

By the late 19th century, in the [[Golden Age]] of Norwegian literature, the so-called "Great Four" emerged: [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], [[Alexander Kielland]], and [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]]. Bjørnson's "peasant novels", such as ''Ein glad gut'' (A Happy Boy) and ''Synnøve Solbakken'', are typical of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] of their day. Kielland's novels and short stories are mostly naturalistic. Although an important contributor to early romantic nationalism, (especially ''[[Peer Gynt]]''), [[Henrik Ibsen]] is better known for his pioneering realistic dramas such as ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' and ''[[A Doll's House]].'' They caused an uproar because of his candid portrayals of the middle classes, complete with infidelity, unhappy marriages, and corrupt businessmen.

In the 20th century, three Norwegian novelists were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] in 1903, [[Knut Hamsun]] for the book ''[[Growth of the Soil|Markens grøde]]'' ("Growth of the Soil") in 1920, and [[Sigrid Undset]] (known for ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter|Kristinlavransdatter]]'') in 1928. Writers such as the following also made important contributions: [[Dag Solstad]], [[Jon Fosse]], [[Cora Sandel]], [[Olav Duun]], [[Olav H. Hauge]], [[Gunvor Hofmo]], [[Stein Mehren]], [[Kjell Askildsen]], [[Hans Herbjørnsrud]], [[Aksel Sandemose]], [[Bergljot Hobæk Haff]], [[Jostein Gaarder]], [[Erik Fosnes Hansen]], [[Jens Bjørneboe]], [[Kjartan Fløgstad]], [[Lars Saabye Christensen]], [[Johan Borgen]], [[Herbjørg Wassmo]], [[Jan Erik Vold]], [[Rolf Jacobsen (poet)|Rolf Jacobsen]], [[Olaf Bull]], [[Jan Kjærstad]], [[Georg Johannesen]], [[Tarjei Vesaas]], [[Sigurd Hoel]], [[Arnulf Øverland]], [[Karl Ove Knausgård]] and [[Johan Falkberget]].

[[File:Urnesstavkirke.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The [[Urnes Stave Church]] has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].]]
With expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood. Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/culture/architecture/norwegian/ |title=The evolution of Norwegian architecture |publisher=The official site of Norway |access-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606075917/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/culture/architecture/norwegian/ |archive-date=6 June 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Dalen Hotell IMG 4773.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dalen Hotel]] in [[Telemark]] built in [[dragestil|Dragon Style]], a style of design architecture that originated during the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]
With Norway's conversion to Christianity some 1,000 years ago, churches were built. Stonework architecture was introduced from Europe for the most important structures, beginning with the construction of [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]], wooden [[stave church]]es were constructed throughout Norway. Some of them have survived; they represent Norway's most unusual contribution to architectural history. A fine example, [[Urnes Stave Church]] in inner [[Sognefjord]], is on [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage List]]. Another notable example of wooden architecture is the buildings at [[Bryggen]] Wharf in Bergen, also on the list for World Cultural Heritage sites, consisting of a row of tall, narrow wooden structures along the quayside.
[[File:Hyttklokka.jpg|thumb|The 17th-century town of [[Røros]], designated in 1980 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has narrow streets and wooden houses.]]
In the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities and villages such as [[Kongsberg]] and [[Røros]] were established. The city Kongsberg had a church built in the Baroque style. Traditional wooden buildings that were constructed in Røros have survived.

After Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. The architect [[Christian Heinrich Grosch|Christian H. Grosch]] designed the earliest parts of the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]], and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of [[Ålesund]] was rebuilt in the [[Art Nouveau]] style, influenced by styles of France. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the [[Sámi Parliament of Norway|Sámi Parliament]] in [[Karasjok|Kárášjohka]], designed by [[Stein Halvorson]] and [[Christian Sundby]]. Its debating chamber, in timber, is an abstract version of a ''lavvo,'' the traditional tent used by the nomadic [[Sámi people]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leslieburgher.co.uk/portfolio/Other/norway.htm |title=Norwegian Architecture |author=Burgher, Leslie |publisher=Leslie Burgher website |access-date=30 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012161831/http://www.leslieburgher.co.uk/portfolio/Other/norway.htm |archive-date=12 October 2010 }}</ref>

For an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen. It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes. [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857), originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time."<ref name="HFG">{{cite book |author= Haverkamp, Frode |title = Hans Fredrik Gude: From National Romanticism to Realism in Landscape |language = no}}</ref>
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|[[The Scream]] by [[Edvard Munch]], 1893]]
Norway's newly found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [[Kitty Lange Kielland|Kitty Kielland]], a female painter who studied under [[Hans Gude]], and [[Harriet Backer]], another pioneer among female artists, influenced by [[impressionism]]. [[Frits Thaulow]], an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was [[Christian Krohg]], a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/nationalities/Norwegian.html |title=Norwegian Artists |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref>

Of particular note is [[Edvard Munch]], a symbolist/expressionist painter who became world-famous for ''[[The Scream]]'' which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man. Other notable works from Munch includes [[The Sick Child (Munch)|The Sick Child]], [[Madonna (Munch)|Madonna]] and [[Puberty (Munch)|Puberty]].

Other artists of note include [[Harald Sohlberg]], a neo-romantic painter remembered for his paintings of [[Røros]], and [[Odd Nerdrum]], a figurative painter who maintains that his work is not art, but [[kitsch]].

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Norwegian cuisine}}
[[:Category:Norwegian cuisine|Norway's culinary traditions]] show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with [[salmon]] (fresh and cured), [[herring]] (pickled or marinated), [[trout]], [[cod]]fish, and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as [[brunost]], [[Jarlsberg cheese]], and [[gamalost]]), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).

[[Lefse]] is a Norwegian potato flatbread, usually topped with large amounts of butter and sugar, most commonly eaten around Christmas. Traditional Norwegian dishes include [[lutefisk]], [[smalahove]], [[pinnekjøtt]], [[raspeball]], and [[fårikål]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Norway.html |title=Countries and Their Cultures, Norway |publisher=Everyculture.com |date=4 September 2010 |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref> A Norwegian speciality is rakefisk, which is fermented trout, consumed with thin flatbread (flatbrød, not lefse) and sour cream. The most popular pastry is vaffel; it is different from the Belgian vaffel in taste and consistency and is served with sour cream, brown cheese, butter and sugar, or strawberry or raspberry jam, which can all be mixed or eaten separately.

The main attractions of Norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the [[Arctic Circle]]. It is famous for its fjord-indented coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. Popular tourist destinations in Norway include [[Oslo]], [[Ålesund]], [[Bergen]], [[Stavanger]], [[Trondheim]], [[Kristiansand]] and [[Tromsø]]. Much of the nature of Norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. The fjords, mountains and waterfalls in [[Western Norway|Western]] and [[Northern Norway]] attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. In the cities, cultural idiosyncrasies such as the [[Holmenkollen ski jump]] attract many visitors, as do landmarks such as Bergen's [[Bryggen]] and Oslo's [[Vigeland Sculpture Park]].
