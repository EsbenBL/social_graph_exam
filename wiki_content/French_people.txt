The '''French people''' ({{lang-fr|Français}}) are an [[ethnic group]] primarily located in [[Western Europe]] and [[nation]] that shares a common [[Culture of France|French culture]], [[history]], the [[French language]] and is identified with the country of [[France]].

The French people, especially the native speakers of [[langues d'oïl]] from northern and central France, are primarily the descendants of [[Gauls]] (including the [[Belgae]]) and [[Roman people|Romans]] (or [[Gallo-Romans]], western European [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Italic peoples]]), as well as [[Germanic peoples]] such as the [[Franks]], the [[Visigoths]], the [[Suebi]] and the [[Burgundians]] who settled in [[Gaul]] from east of the Rhine after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], as well as various later waves of lower-level irregular migration that have continued to the present day. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] also settled in [[Normandy]] in the 10th century and contributed ancestry to the [[Normans]]. Furthermore, regional ethnic minorities also exist within France that have distinct lineages, languages and cultures such as [[Bretons]] in [[Brittany]], [[Occitans]] in [[Occitania]], [[Basques]] in the [[French Basque Country]], [[Catalans]] in [[northern Catalonia]], [[Germans]] in [[Alsace]] and [[Flemings]] in [[French Flanders]].<ref name="The Genetic History of France">{{cite bioRxiv |last1=Saint Pierre |first1=Aude |last2=Giemza |first2=Joanna |last3=Karakachoff| first3= Matilde |last4=Alves| first4= Isabel |last5=Amouyel |first5=Philippe |last6=Dartigues| first6=Jean-Francois |last7=Tzourio| first7=Christophe |last8=Monteil |first8=Martial

France has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences, and while most French people still speak the [[French language]] as their [[mother tongue]], languages like [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Poitevin-Saintongeais]], [[Franco-Provencal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Auvergnat language|Auvergnat]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[French Flemish]], [[Lorraine Franconian]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], and [[Breton language|Breton]] remain spoken in their respective regions. [[Varieties of arabic|Arabic]] is also widely spoken, arguably the largest minority language in France as of the 21st century (a spot previously held by [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=To count or not to count|url=https://www.economist.com/node/13377324|access-date=26 May 2018|work=The Economist|language=en}}</ref>

==Citizenship and legal residence==
To be French, according to the first article of the French [[French Constitution of 1958|Constitution]], is to be a citizen of France, regardless of one's origin, race, or religion (''sans distinction d'origine, de race ou de religion'').<ref name=Const58>"France shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion", [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp Constitution of 4 October 1958]</ref> According to its principles, France has devoted itself to the destiny of a ''proposition nation'', a generic territory where people are bounded only by the [[French language]] and the assumed willingness to live together, as defined by [[Ernest Renan]]'s "''plébiscite de tous les jours''" ('everyday plebiscite') on the willingness to live together, in Renan's 1882 essay "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]").

The debate concerning the integration of this view with the principles underlying the [[European Community]] remains open.<ref>One point of friction can be the status of minority languages. However, though almost extinct, such regional languages are preserved in France and one can learn them at school as a second language (''enseignement de langue regionale'').</ref>

France has been historically open to immigration, although this has changed in recent years.<ref name=Drinkwater2>{{cite encyclopedia |title=People |encyclopedia=France (Britannica Guide to Countries of the European Union)| editor-last=Ray |editor-first=Michael | last=Drinkwater |first=John F. |year=2013 |publisher=Rosen Educational Services |isbn=978-1615309641 |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/France/People |access-date=29 January 2020| pages=28–29}}</ref> Referring to this perceived openness, [[Gertrude Stein]], wrote: "America is my country but Paris is my home".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stein |first1=Gertrude |title=What are masterpieces? |date=1940 |page=63}}</ref> Indeed, the country has long valued its [[openness]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the quality of services available.<ref>For instance, the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the "best overall health care" in the world [https://www.who.int/whr/2000/media_centre/press_release/en/ World Health Organization Assesses the World's Health Systems]</ref> Application for [[French citizenship]] is often interpreted as a renunciation of previous state [[allegiance]] unless a [[dual citizenship]] agreement exists between the two countries (for instance, this is the case with [[Switzerland]]: one can be both French and Swiss). The [[European treaties]] have formally permitted movement and European citizens enjoy formal rights to employment in the state sector (though not as trainees in reserved branches, e.g., as [[magistrates]]).

Seeing itself as an inclusive nation with universal values, France has always valued and strongly advocated [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]]. However, the success of such assimilation has recently been called into question. There is increasing dissatisfaction with, and within, growing [[Ethnic enclave|ethno-cultural enclaves]] (''[[communitarianism|communautarisme]]''). The [[2005 French riots]] in some troubled and impoverished suburbs (''les quartiers sensibles'') were an example of such tensions. However they should not be interpreted as [[ethnic conflict]]s (as appeared before in other countries like the US and the UK) but as [[social conflict]]s born out of [[Economic inequality|socioeconomic problems]] endangering proper integration.<ref>Hughes LAGRANGES, ''Emeutes, renovation urbaine et alienation politique'', Observatoire sociologique du changement, Paris, 2007 [http://osc.sciences-po.fr/publication/nd_2007_05.pdf]</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of France}}

Historically, the heritage of the French people is mostly of [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Gauls|Gallic]], Latin ([[Ancient Rome|Romans]]) origin, descending from the ancient and medieval populations of [[Gauls]] or [[Celts]] from the Atlantic to the [[Rhone Alps]], Germanic tribes that settled [[France]] from east of the [[Rhine]] and [[Belgium]] after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] such as the [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], [[Allemanni]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Suebi]], [[Italic peoples|Latin]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tribes such as [[Ligurians]] and [[Gallo-Romans]], [[Norsemen|Norse]] populations largely settling in [[Normandy]] at the beginning of the 10th century and "[[Bretons]]" (Celtic Britons) settling in [[Brittany]] in Western [[France]].<ref name="Ligures, Ibères 2008, p. 261" />

The name "France" etymologically derives from the word [[Francia]], the territory of the [[Franks]]. The Franks were a Germanic tribe that [[Migration Period|overran]] Roman Gaul at the end of the [[Roman Empire]].

===Celtic and Roman Gaul===
[[File:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Map of Gaul before complete Roman conquest (circa 58 [[Common Era|BCE]]) and its five main regions : [[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]], [[Gallia Belgica|Belgica]], [[Gallia Cisalpina|Cisalpina]], [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonensis]] and [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]].]]
{{Main|Celts|Gaul|Gauls|Roman Empire}}

In the pre-Roman era, [[Gaul]] (an area of Western Europe that encompassed all of what is known today as France, Belgium, part of Germany and Switzerland, and Northern Italy) was inhabited by a variety of peoples who were known collectively as the [[List of peoples of Gaul|Gaulish tribes]]. Their ancestors were [[Celts]] who came from Central Europe in the 7th century [[Common Era|BCE]] or earlier,<ref>{{cite book|first = Venceslas|last = Kruta|title= Les Celtes : Histoire et dictionnaire|language = fr|date = 2000|publisher = Robert Laffont|isbn = 978-2221056905}}</ref> and non-Celtic peoples including the [[Ligures]], [[Aquitanians]] and [[Vascones|Basques]] in Aquitaine. The [[Belgae]], who lived in the northern and eastern areas, may have had Germanic admixture; many of these peoples had already spoken [[Gaulish]] by the time of the Roman conquest.

Gaul was militarily conquered in 58–51 BCE by the [[Roman legions]] under the command of General [[Julius Caesar]], except for the south-east which had already been conquered about one century earlier. Over the next six centuries, the two cultures intermingled, creating a hybridized [[Gallo-Roman culture]]. In the late Roman era, in addition to [[Coloniae|colonists from elsewhere in the Empire]] and Gaulish natives, Gallia also became home to some immigrant populations of Germanic and Scythian origin, such as the [[Alans]].

The [[Gaulish language]] is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture.<ref name=Helix>{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|isbn=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7|quote=Le déclin du Gaulois et sa disparition ne s'expliquent pas seulement par des pratiques culturelles spécifiques: Lorsque les Romains conduits par César envahirent la Gaule, au 1er siecle avant J.-C., celle-ci romanisa de manière progressive et profonde.

The Vulgar Latin in the region of Gallia took on a distinctly local character, some of which is attested in graffiti,<ref name=Adams/> which evolved into the [[Gallo-Romance]] dialects which include French and its closest relatives.

===Frankish Kingdom===
{{Main|Franks|Frankish Kingdom}}
With the decline of the Roman Empire in Western Europe, a federation of Germanic peoples entered the picture: the [[Franks]], from which the word "French" derives. The Franks were Germanic pagans who began to settle in northern Gaul as ''[[laeti]]'' during the Roman era. They continued to filter across the [[Rhine River]] from present-day [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] between the 3rd and 7th centuries. Initially, they served in the Roman army and obtained important commands. Their language is still spoken as a kind of Dutch ([[French Flemish]]) in northern France ([[French Flanders]]). The [[Alemanni|Alamans]], another Germanic people immigrated to [[Alsace]], hence the [[Alemannic German]] now spoken there. The Alamans were competitors of the Franks, and their name is the origin of the French word for "German": ''Allemand''.

By the early 6th century the Franks, led by the [[Merovingian]] king [[Clovis I]] and his sons, had consolidated their hold on much of modern-day France. The other major Germanic people to arrive in France, after the [[Burgundians]] and the [[Visigoths]], were the [[Norsemen]] or [[Viking expansion#West Francia and Middle Francia|Northmen]]. Known by the shortened name "[[Norman people|Norman]]" in France, these were [[Viking]] raiders from modern [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. They settled with Anglo-Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons from the [[Danelaw]] in the region known today as [[Normandy]] in the 9th and 10th centuries. This later became a fiefdom of the Kingdom of France under King [[Charles the Simple|Charles III]]. The Vikings eventually intermarried with the local people, converting to [[Christianity]] in the process. It was the Normans who, two centuries later, would go on to [[Norman conquest|conquer]] England and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Southern Italy]].

Eventually, though, the largely autonomous [[Duchy of Normandy]] was incorporated back into the [[crown lands of France|royal domain]] (i. e. the territory under direct control of the French king) in the [[France in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. In the crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], founded in 1099, at most 120,000 Franks, who were predominantly [[French language|French]]-speaking Western Christians, ruled over 350,000 Muslims, Jews, and native Eastern Christians.<ref>Benjamin Z.

[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis XIV of France]] "The Sun-King"]]
Unlike elsewhere in Europe, France experienced relatively low levels of emigration to the [[Americas]], with the exception of the [[Huguenots]], due to a lower birthrate than in the rest of Europe. However, significant emigration of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the Province of [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)]] and [[Louisiana]], all (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and [[Africa]].

On 30 December 1687, a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in [[South Africa]]. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of [[New France]]. Encouraging settlement was difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1763 New France only had a population of some 65,000.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=British North America: 1763–1841 |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563379_21/canada.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031124234/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563379_21/Canada.html |archive-date=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> From 1713 to 1787, 30,000 colonists immigrated from France to the [[Saint-Domingue]].

By the beginning of the 17th century, some 20% of the total male population of [[Catalonia]] was made up of French immigrants.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&pg=PA26 |title=The revolt of the Catalans: a study in the decline of Spain (1598–1640)|author=John Huxtable Elliott|year=1984 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=26|isbn=0-521-27890-2}}</ref>
In the 18th century and early 19th century, a small migration of French emigrated by official invitation of the [[Habsburgs]] to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], now the nations of [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~banatdata/genealogy/Documents/NewOnTheList.htm |title=French villages in Banat |publisher=RootsWeb.com |last = Deschu|first = Cath}}</ref> Some of them, coming from French-speaking communes in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] or being [[French Swiss]] ''Walsers'' from the [[Valais]] canton in [[Switzerland]], maintained for some generations the French language and a specific ethnic identity, later labelled as [[Banat]] (French: ''Français du Banat'').

===French Republic===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by Eugène Delacroix]]
The [[French First Republic]] appeared following the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. It replaced the ancient kingdom of France, ruled by the [[divine right of kings]].

Hobsbawm highlighted the role of [[conscription]], invented by Napoleon, and of the 1880s public instruction laws, which allowed mixing of the various groups of France into a [[nationalist]] mold which created the French citizen and his consciousness of membership to a common nation, while the various regional [[languages of France]] were progressively eradicated.

The 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which led to the short-lived [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, was instrumental in bolstering [[patriotic]] feelings; until [[World War I]] (1914–1918), French politicians never completely lost sight of the disputed [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which played a major role in the definition of the French nation and therefore of the French people.

The [[Crémieux decrees|decrees of 24 October 1870]] by [[Adolphe Crémieux]] granted automatic and massive French citizenship to all [[Jewish people]] of Algeria.

===20th century===
Successive waves of immigrants during the 19th and 20th centuries were rapidly assimilated into French culture. France's population dynamics began to change in the middle of the 19th century, as France joined the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The pace of industrial growth attracted millions of European [[immigrants]] over the next century, with especially large numbers arriving from [[Poland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]].<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA22&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. III. French Government and the Refugees]''". American Philosophical Society, James E. Hassell (1991). p.22. {{ISBN|0-87169-817-X}}</ref>

In the period from 1915 to 1950, many immigrants came from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. Small but significant numbers of Frenchmen in the North and Northeast regions have relatives in [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]].

Between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African [[Jews]] from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco also immigrated to France due to the decline of the French empire and following the Six-Day War. Hence, by 1968, Jews of North African origin comprised the majority of the Jewish population of France. As these new immigrants were already culturally French they needed little time to adjust to French society.<ref>[[Esther Benbassa]], ''The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 1999</ref>

French law made it easy for thousands of [[settlers]] (''colons'' in French), national French from former colonies of North and East [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[Indochina]] to live in mainland France. It is estimated that 20,000 settlers were living in [[Saigon]] in 1945, and there were 68,430 European settlers living in [[Madagascar]] in 1958.<ref>"''The educated African: a country-by-country survey of educational development in Africa''".

In the 1960s, a second wave of immigration came to France, which was needed for reconstruction purposes and for cheaper labour after the devastation brought on by [[World War II]]. French entrepreneurs went to [[Maghreb]] countries looking for cheap labour, thus encouraging work-immigration to France. Their settlement was officialized with [[Jacques Chirac]]'s family regrouping act of 1976 (''regroupement familial''). Since then, immigration has become more varied, although France stopped being a major immigration country compared to other European countries. The large impact of [[North African]] and [[Arab]] immigration is the greatest and has brought [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], socio-cultural and [[religious]] questions to a country seen as [[wiktionary:Homogenous|homogenous]]ly European, French and [[Christians|Christian]] for thousands of years. Nevertherless, according to [[Justin Vaïsse]], professor at [[Sciences Po Paris]], integration of Muslim immigrants is happening as part of a background evolution<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vaisse20060112-1.pdf|title = Unrest in France, November 2005: Immigration, Islam and the Challenge of Integration|url-status = live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914183643/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vaisse20060112-1.pdf |archive-date =14 September 2018 |author-link =Justin Vaïsse|last = Vaïsse|first = Justin |date = 10–12 January 2006|location =Washington, DC |publisher= Brookings Institution}}</ref> and recent studies confirmed the results of their assimilation, showing that "North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration reflected in a relatively high propensity to [[exogamy]]" with rates ranging from 20% to 50%.<ref>"Compared with the Europeans, the Tunisians belong to a much more recent wave of migration and occupy a much less favourable socioeconomic position, yet their pattern of marriage behaviour is nonetheless similar (...). Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have a higher propensity to exogamy than Asians or Portuguese but a much weaker labour market position. (...) Confirming the results from other analyses of immigrant assimilation in France, this study shows that North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration (reflected in a relatively high propensity to exogamy, notably for Tunisians) that contrasts with a persistent disadvantage in the labour market.", [http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=POPE_802_0239 Intermarriage and assimilation: disparities in levels of exogamy among immigrants in France], Mirna Safi, Volume 63 2008/2</ref> According to [[Emmanuel Todd]] the relatively high exogamy among French Algerians can be explained by the colonial link between France and Algeria.<ref>[[Emmanuel Todd]], ''Le destin des immigrés: assimilation et ségrégation dans les démocraties occidentales'', Paris, 1994, p.307</ref>

A small French descent group also subsequently arrived from [[Latin America]] ([[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]) in the 1970s.

Most French people speak the [[French language]] as their [[mother tongue]], but certain languages like [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Occitan language]]s, [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Basque language|Euskara]], [[French Flemish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] remain spoken in certain regions (see [[Language policy in France]]). There have also been periods of history when a majority of French people had other first languages (local languages such as [[Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[West Flemish]], [[Lorraine Franconian]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Picard language|Picard]] or Ch'timi and [[Arpitan]]). Today, many immigrants speak another tongue at home.

According to historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], "the French language has been essential to the concept of 'France'," although in 1789, 50 percent of the French people did not speak it at all, and only 12 to 13 percent spoke it fairly well; even in [[oïl languages]] zones, it was not usually used except in cities, and even there not always in the [[faubourgs|outlying districts]].<ref>[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990; {{ISBN|0-521-43961-2}}) chapter II "The popular protonationalism", pp.80–81 French edition ([[Gallimard]], 1992). According to Hobsbawm, the base source for this subject is [[Ferdinand Brunot]] (ed.), ''Histoire de la langue française'', Paris, 1927–1943, 13 volumes, in particular the tome IX. He also refers to [[Michel de Certeau]], Dominique Julia, Judith Revel, ''Une politique de la langue: la Révolution française et les patois: l'enquête de l'abbé Grégoire'', Paris, 1975. For the problem of the transformation of a minority official language into a mass national language during and after the [[French Revolution]], see Renée Balibar, ''L'Institution du français: essai sur le co-linguisme des Carolingiens à la République'', Paris, 1985 (also ''Le co-linguisme'', [[PUF]], [[Que sais-je?]], 1994, but out of print) ("The Institution of the French language: essay on colinguism from the [[Carolingian]] to the [[French Republic|Republic]]"). Finally, Hobsbawm refers to Renée Balibar and Dominique Laporte, ''Le Français national: politique et pratique de la langue nationale sous la Révolution'', Paris, 1974.</ref>

===Abroad===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|The [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] has two French mottos: [[Dieu et mon droit]] and [[Honi soit qui mal y pense]].]]

Abroad, the [[French language]] is spoken in many different countries – in particular the [[French colonial empires|former French colonies]]. Nevertheless, speaking French is distinct from being a French citizen. Thus, ''[[francophonie]]'', or the speaking of French, must not be confused with French citizenship or ethnicity. For example, French speakers in [[Switzerland]] are not "French citizens".

Native English-speaking Blacks on the island of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint-Martin]] hold French nationality even though they do not speak French as a first language, while their neighbouring French-speaking Haitian immigrants (who also speak a French-creole) remain foreigners. Large numbers of people of French ancestry outside Europe speak other first languages, particularly English, throughout most of North America (except French Canada), Spanish or Portuguese in southern [[South America]], and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]].

The adjective "French" can be used to mean either "French citizen" or "French-speaker", and usage varies depending on the context, with the former being common in France. The latter meaning is often used in Canada, when discussing matters internal to Canada.

==Nationality, citizenship, ethnicity==
Generations of settlers have migrated over the centuries to France, creating a variegated grouping of peoples. Thus the historian [[John F. Drinkwater]] states, "The French are, paradoxically, strongly conscious of belonging to a single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge."<ref name=Drinkwater>{{cite encyclopedia |title=People |encyclopedia=France (Britannica Guide to Countries of the European Union)| editor-last=Ray |editor-first=Michael | last=Drinkwater |first=John F. |year=2013 |publisher=Rosen Educational Services |isbn=978-1615309641 |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/France/People |access-date=29 January 2020| page=21}}</ref>

According to [[Dominique Schnapper]], "The classical conception of the nation is that of an entity which, opposed to the ethnic group, affirms itself as an open community, the will to live together expressing itself by the acceptation of the rules of a unified public domain which transcends all particularisms".<ref name="Schnapper">[[Dominique Schnapper]], "La conception de la nation", "Citoyenneté et société", ''Cahiers Francais'', n° 281, mai-juin 1997</ref> This conception of the nation as being composed by a "will to live together," supported by [[What is a Nation?|the classic lecture]] of [[Ernest Renan]] in 1882, has been opposed by the French [[far-right]], in particular the [[nationalism|nationalist]] ''[[National Front (France)|Front National]]'' ("National Front" – FN / now ''[[National Rally (France)|Rassemblement National]]'' - "National Rally" - RN) party which claims that there is such a thing as a "French ethnic group". The discourse of ethno-nationalist groups such as the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN), however, advances the concept of ''Français de souche'' or "indigenous" French.

The conventional conception of French history starts with Ancient Gaul, and French national identity often views the Gauls as national precursors, either as biological ancestors (hence the refrain ''nos ancêtres les Gaulois''), as emotional/spiritual ancestors, or both.<ref name="WhatFrench?">{{cite web|title=What Is France?

However, despite its occasional nativist usage, the Gaulish identity has also been embraced by French of non-native origins as well: notably, [[Napoleon III]], whose family was ultimately of Corsican and Italian roots, identified France with Gaul and Vercingetorix,<ref name="AncientAlesia">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19167600|title=France's ancient Alesia dispute rumbles on|author=Hugh Schofield|work=BBC News|date=26 August 2012}}</ref> and declared that "New France, ancient France, Gaul are one and the same moral person."

It has been noted that the French view of having Gallic origins has evolved over history. Before the French Revolution, it divided social classes, with the peasants identifying with the native Gauls while the aristocracy identified with the Franks. During the early nineteenth century, intellectuals began using the identification with Gaul instead as a unifying force to bridge divisions within French society with a common [[National myth|national origin myth]]. Myriam Krepps of the University of Nebraska-Omaha argues that the view of "a unified territory (one land since the beginning of civilization) and a unified people" which de-emphasized "all disparities and the succession of waves of invaders" was first imprinted on the masses by the unified history curriculum of French textbooks in the late 1870s.<ref name="VercingeVatel"/>

Since the beginning of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), the state has not categorized people according to their alleged ethnic origins. Hence, in contrast to the [[United States Census]], French people are not asked to define their ethnic appartenance, whichever it may be. The usage of ethnic and racial categorization is avoided to prevent any case of discrimination; the same regulations apply to religious membership data that cannot be compiled under the French Census. This classic French republican non-[[Essentialism|essentialist]] conception of nationality is officialized by the [[French Constitution]], according to which "French" is a [[French nationality law|nationality]], and not a specific ethnicity.

===Genetics===
France sits at the edge of the European peninsula and has seen waves of migration of groups that often settled owing to the presence of physical barriers preventing onward migration.<ref name="Drinkwater" /> This has led to language and regional cultural variegation, but the extent to which this pattern of migrations showed up in population genetics studies was unclear until the publication of a study in 2019 that used genome wide data. The study identified six different genetic clusters that could be distinguished across populations. The study concluded that the population genetic clusters correlate with linguistic and historical divisions in France and with the presence of geographic barriers such as mountains and major rivers. A population bottleneck was also identified in the fourteenth century, consistent with the timing for the [[Black Death]] in Europe.<ref name="The Genetic History of France"/>

===Nationality and citizenship===
{{Further|Nationality|Citizenship}}

French nationality has not meant automatic citizenship. Some categories of French people have been excluded, throughout the years, from full citizenship:
* [[Women's suffrage|Women]]: until the Liberation, they were deprived of the [[right to vote]]. The [[provisional government of the French Republic|provisional government]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] accorded them this right by 21 April 1944 prescription. However, women are still under-represented in the political class. The 6 June 2000 law on parity attempted to address this question by imposing a de facto quota system for women in French politics.<ref>{{cite French law|number or usual name=n<sup>o</sup> 2000-493|date in French=6 juin 2000|full name=tendant à favoriser l'égal accès des femmes et des hommes aux mandats électoraux et fonctions électives|language=French|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000400185&dateTexte=&categorieLien=id}}</ref>
* [[French Army|Military]]: for a long time, it was called "''la grande muette''" ("the great mute") in reference to its prohibition from interfering in political life. During a large part of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), the Army was in its majority [[republicanism|anti-republican]] (and thus [[counterrevolutionary]]). The [[Dreyfus Affair]] and the [[Seize Mai|16 May 1877 crisis]], which almost led to a [[monarchist]] ''[[coup d'état]]'' by [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|MacMahon]], are examples of this anti-republican spirit. Therefore, they would only gain the right to vote with the 17 August 1945 prescription: the contribution of De Gaulle to the interior [[French Resistance]] reconciled the Army with the Republic. Nevertheless, militaries do not benefit from the whole of public liberties, as the 13 July 1972 law on the general statute of militaries specify.
* Young people: the July 1974 law, voted at the instigation of president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], reduced from 21 to 18 the [[age of majority]].
* [[Naturalization|Naturalized foreigners]]: since the 9 January 1973 law, foreigners who have acquired French nationality do not have to wait five years after their naturalization to be able to vote anymore.
* [[French colonial empires|Inhabitants of the colonies]]: the 7 May 1946 law meant that soldiers from the "Empire" (such as the ''[[tirailleurs]]'') killed during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] were not citizens.<ref name="Citizenship">{{cite web| author=B. Villalba| title=Chapitre 2 – Les incertitudes de la citoyenneté| access-date=3 May 2006| publisher=Catholic University of [[Lille]], Law Department| url=http://droit.univ-lille2.fr/enseignants/villalba/cours_PSC/Psc_chap_citoyen.html| language=fr| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116061353/http://droit.univ-lille2.fr/enseignants/villalba/cours_PSC/Psc_chap_citoyen.html| archive-date=16 November 2006| df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* The special case of [[European Union citizen|foreign citizens of an EU member state]] who, even if not French, are allowed to vote in French local elections if living in France, and may turn to any French consular or diplomatic mission if there is no such representations of their own country.

France was one of the first countries to implement [[denaturalization]] laws. Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] has pointed out this fact that the 1915 French law which permitted denaturalization with regard to naturalized citizens of "enemy" origins was one of the first example of such legislation, which [[Nazi Germany]] later implemented with the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref>See [[Giorgio Agamben]], ''[[Homo Sacer]]: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press (1998), {{ISBN|0-8047-3218-3}}.</ref>

Furthermore, some authors who have insisted on the "crisis of the nation-state" allege that nationality and citizenship are becoming separate concepts. They show as example "international", "[[Supranational union|supranational]] citizenship" or "[[world citizenship]]" (membership to [[international nongovernmental organization]]s such as [[Amnesty International]] or [[Greenpeace]]). This would indicate a path toward a "[[postnational]] citizenship".<ref name="Citizenship"/>

Beside this, modern citizenship is linked to [[civic participation]] (also called [[positive freedom]]), which implies voting, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], [[petition]]s, [[activism]], etc. Therefore, [[social exclusion]] may lead to deprivation of citizenship. This has led various authors ([[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Jean-Marc Ferry]], [[Alain Caillé]], [[André Gorz]]) to theorize a [[guaranteed minimum income]] which would impede exclusion from citizenship.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} P. Hassenteufel, "Exclusion sociale et citoyenneté", "Citoyenneté et société", ''Cahiers Francais'', n° 281, mai-juin 1997), quoted by B. Villalba of the Catholic University of Lille, ''op.cit.''</ref>

===Multiculturalism versus universalism===
[[File:AlfredAmedeeDodds.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Alfred-Amédée Dodds]], a mixed-race French general and colonial administrator born in Senegal]]
In France, the conception of citizenship teeters between [[Moral universalism|universalism]] and [[multiculturalism]]. French citizenship has been defined for a long time by three factors: integration, [[individualism|individual adherence]], and the primacy of the soil (''[[jus soli]]''). Political integration (which includes but is not limited to [[racial integration]]) is based on voluntary policies which aims at creating a common identity, and the interiorization by each individual of a common cultural and historic legacy. Since in France, the state preceded the nation, voluntary policies have taken an important place in the creation of this common [[cultural identity]].<ref>See [[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''op.cit.''</ref>

On the other hand, the interiorization of a common legacy is a slow process, which B. Villalba compares to [[acculturation]]. According to him, "integration is therefore the result of a double will: the nation's will to create a common culture for all members of the nation, and the communities' will living in the nation to recognize the legitimacy of this common culture".<ref name="Citizenship"/> Villalba warns against confusing recent processes of integration (related to the so-called "second generation immigrants", who are subject to [[discrimination]]), with older processes which have made modern France. Villalba thus shows that any democratic nation characterize itself by its project of transcending all forms of particular memberships (whether biological – or seen as such,<ref>Even the biological conception of sex may be questioned: see [[gender theory]]</ref> ethnic, historic, economic, social, religious or cultural). The citizen thus emancipates himself from the particularisms of identity which characterize himself to attain a more "universal" dimension. He is a citizen, before being a member of a community or of a [[social class]]<ref>It may be interesting to refer to [[Michel Foucault]]'s description of the [[Philosophy of history|discourse of "race struggle"]], as he shows that this medieval discourse – held by such people as [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]] in Great Britain, and, in France, by [[Nicolas Fréret]], [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] -, tended to identify the French noble classes to a Northern and foreign race, while the "people" was considered as an [[Indigenous peoples|aborigine]] – and "inferior" races. This historical discourse of "race struggle", as isolated by Foucault, was not based on a biological conception of race, as would be latter [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialism]] (aka "[[scientific racism]]")</ref>

Therefore, according to Villalba, "a democratic nation is, by definition, multicultural as it gathers various populations, which differs by their regional origins (Auvergnats, Bretons, Corsicans or Lorrains...), their national origins (immigrant, son or grandson of an immigrant), or religious origins (Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Agnostics or Atheists...)."<ref name="Citizenship"/>

===Ernest Renan's ''What is a Nation?'' (1882)===
[[Ernest Renan]] described this republican conception in his famous 11 March 1882 conference at the [[Sorbonne]], ''Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?'' ("[[What is a Nation?]]").<ref>[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bib_lisieux/nation01.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216031848/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bib_lisieux/nation01.htm |date=16 February 2008}}</ref> According to him, to belong to a [[nation]] is a [[subjectivity|subjective]] act which always has to be repeated, as it is not assured by [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] criteria. A [[nation-state]] is not composed of a single homogeneous ethnic group (a community), but of a variety of individuals willing to live together.

Renan's non-essentialist definition, which forms the basis of the French Republic, is diametrically opposed to the [[German people|German]] ethnic conception of a nation, first formulated by [[Fichte]]. The German conception is usually qualified in France as an "exclusive" view of nationality, as it includes only the members of the corresponding ethnic group, while the Republican conception thinks itself as [[universalist]], following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideals officialized by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. While Ernest Renan's arguments were also concerned by the debate about the disputed [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region, he said that not only one [[referendum]] had to be made in order to ask the opinions of the Alsatian people, but also a "daily referendum" should be made concerning all those citizens wanting to live in the French nation-state. This ''plébiscite de tous les jours'' ('everyday plebiscite') might be compared to a [[social contract]] or even to the classic definition of [[consciousness]] as an act which repeats itself endlessly.<ref>See [[John Locke]]'s definition of consciousness and of identity. Consciousness is an act accompanying all thoughts (I am conscious that I am thinking this or that...), and which therefore doubles all thoughts. Personal identity is composed by the repeated consciousness, and thus extends so far in time (both in the past and in the future) as I am conscious of it (''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689), Chapter XXVII "Of Identity and Diversity", available here [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/l#a2447])</ref>

Henceforth, contrary to the German definition of a nation based on objective criteria, such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnic group]], which may be defined by the existence of a common [[language]], among other criteria, the people of France is defined as all the people living in the French nation-state and willing to do so, i.e. by its citizenship. This definition of the French nation-state contradicts the [[doxa|common opinion]], which holds that the concept of the French people identifies with one particular [[ethnic group]]. This contradiction explains the seeming paradox encountered when attempting to identify a "French [[ethnic group]]": the French conception of the nation is radically opposed to (and was thought in opposition to) the German conception of the ''[[Volk]]'' ("ethnic group").

This universalist conception of citizenship and of the nation has influenced the French model of [[colonialism|colonization]]. While the [[British empire]] preferred an [[indirect rule]] system, which did not mix the colonized people with the colonists, the French Republic theoretically chose an integration system and considered parts of its [[French colonial empires|colonial empire]] as France itself and its population as French people.<ref>See e.g. [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), second part on "Imperialism"</ref> The ruthless [[French rule in Algeria|conquest of Algeria]] thus led to the integration of the territory as a [[Département]] of the French territory.

This ideal also led to the ironic sentence which opened up history textbooks in France as in its colonies: "Our ancestors the Gauls...". However, this universal ideal, rooted in the 1789 French Revolution ("bringing liberty to the people"), suffered from the [[racism]] that impregnated colonialism. Thus, in Algeria, the [[Adolphe Crémieux|Crémieux decrees]] at the end of the 19th century gave French citizenship to north African Jews, while Muslims were regulated by the 1881 Indigenous Code. Liberal author [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] himself considered that the British model was better adapted than the French one and did not balk before the cruelties of [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud de la Piconnerie|General Bugeaud]]'s conquest. He went as far as advocating [[racial segregation]] there.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison|title=Torture in Algeria: Past Acts That Haunt France – Liberty, Equality and Colony|publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = June 2001| url=http://mondediplo.com/2001/06/11torture2|author-link=Olivier LeCour Grandmaison}}</ref>

This paradoxical tension between the universalist conception of the French nation and the racist attitudes intermingled into colonization is most obvious in Ernest Renan himself, who went as far as advocating a kind of [[eugenics]]. In a 26 June 1856 letter to [[Arthur de Gobineau]], author of ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) and one of the first theoreticians of "[[scientific racism]]", he wrote:

<blockquote> You have written a remarkable book here, full of vigour and originality of mind, only it's written to be little understood in France or rather it's written to be misunderstood here. The French mind turns little to ethnographic considerations: France has little belief in race, [...]

The fact of race is huge originally; but it's been continually losing its importance, and sometimes, as in France, it happens to disappear completely. Does that mean total decadence? Yes, certainly from the standpoint of the stability of institutions, the originality of character, a certain nobility that I hold to be the most important factor in the conjunction of human affairs. But also what compensations! No doubt if the noble elements mixed in the blood of a people happened to disappear completely, then there would be a demeaning equality, like that of some Eastern states and in some respects China. But it is in fact a very small amount of noble blood put into the circulation of a people that is enough to ennoble them, at least as to historical effects; this is how France, a nation so completely fallen into commonness, in practice plays on the world stage the role of a gentleman. Setting aside the quite inferior races whose intermingling with the great races would only poison the human species, I see in the future a homogeneous humanity.<ref>[[Ernest Renan]]'s 26 June 1856 letter to [[Arthur de Gobineau]], quoted by Jacques Morel in ''[http://perso.wanadoo.fr/jacques.morel67/ccfo/crimcol/node60.html Calendrier des crimes de la France outre-mer]'', [[L'esprit frappeur]], 2001 (Morel gives as source: Ernest Renan, ''Qu'est-ce qu'une nation? et autres textes politiques'', chosen and presented by Joël Roman, Presses Pocket, 1992, p 221.)</ref></blockquote>

===''Jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis''===
{{Main|French nationality law}}

During the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (before the 1789 French revolution), ''[[jus soli]]'' (or "right of territory") was predominant. Feudal law recognized personal allegiance to the [[Monarch|sovereign]], but the subjects of the sovereign were defined by their birthland. According to the 3 September 1791 Constitution, those who are born in France from a foreign father and have fixed their residency in France, or those who, after being born in a foreign country from a French father, have come to France and have sworn their civil oath, become French citizens. Because of the war, distrust toward foreigners led to the obligation on the part of this last category to swear a civil oath in order to gain French nationality.

However, the [[Napoleonic Code]] would insist on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' ("right of blood"). [[Paternity (law)|Paternity]], against Napoléon Bonaparte's wish, became the principal criterion of nationality, and therefore broke for the first time with the ancient tradition of ''jus soli'', by breaking any residency condition toward children born abroad from French parents. However, according to [[Patrick Weil]], it was not "ethnically motivated" but "only meant that family links transmitted by the pater familias had become more important than subjecthood".<ref>"In eighteenth-century Europe, jus soli was the dominant criterion of nationality law in the two most powerful kingdoms : France and United Kingdom. It was the transfer of a feudal tradition to the state level : human beings were linked to the lord who held the land where they were born. The French Revolution broke from this feudal tradition. Because jus soli connoted feudal allegiance, it was decided, ''against Napoléon Bonaparte's wish'', that the new Civil Code of 1804 would grant French nationality at birth only to a child born to a French father, either in France or abroad . It was not ethnically motivated; it only meant that family links transmitted by the pater familias had become more important than subjecthood", [[Patrick Weil]], [http://www.patrick-weil.com/Fichiers%20du%20site/2001%20-%20Access%20to%20citizenship.doc Access to citizenship : A comparison of twenty five nationality laws ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501102440/http://www.patrick-weil.com/Fichiers%20du%20site/2001%20-%20Access%20to%20citizenship.doc |date=1 May 2011}}, dans T. Alexander Aleinikoff and Douglas Klusmeyer (ed.), Citizenship Today: Global Perspectives and Practices, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington DC, 2001, p.17-35.</ref>

With the 7 February 1851 law, voted during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848–1852), "double ''jus soli''" was introduced in French legislation, combining birth origin with paternity. Thus, it gave French nationality to the child of a foreigner, if both are born in France, except if the year following his coming of age he reclaims a foreign nationality (thus prohibiting [[dual nationality]]). This 1851 law was in part passed because of [[conscription]] concerns. This system more or less remained the same until the 1993 reform of the Nationality Code, created by 9 January 1973 law.

The 1993 reform, which defines the [[French Nationality law|Nationality law]], is deemed controversial by some. It commits young people born in France to foreign parents to solicit French nationality between the ages of 16 and 21. This has been criticized, some arguing that the principle of equality before the law was not complied with, since French nationality was no longer given automatically at birth, as in the classic "double ''jus soli''" law, but was to be requested when approaching adulthood. Henceforth, children born in France from French parents were differentiated from children born in France from foreign parents, creating a hiatus between these two categories.

The 1993 reform was prepared by the [[Charles Pasqua|Pasqua laws]]. The first Pasqua law, in 1986, restricts residence conditions in France and facilitates [[Deportation|expulsion]]s. With this 1986 law, a child born in France from foreign parents can only acquire French nationality if he or she demonstrates his or her will to do so, at age 16, by proving that he or she has been schooled in France and has a sufficient command of the French language. This new policy is symbolized by the expulsion of 101 [[Mali]]ans by [[charter airlines|charter]].<ref name="Citizenship"/>

The second Pasqua law on "immigration control" makes regularisation of illegal aliens more difficult and, in general, residence conditions for foreigners much harder. Charles Pasqua, who said on 11 May 1987: "Some have reproached me of having used a plane, but, if necessary, I will use trains", declared to ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 2 June 1993: "France has been a country of immigration, it doesn't want to be one anymore. Our aim, taking into account the difficulties of the economic situation, is to tend toward 'zero immigration' ("''immigration zéro''")".<ref name="Citizenship"/>

Therefore, modern French nationality law combines four factors: paternality or 'right of blood', birth origin, residency and the will expressed by a foreigner, or a person born in France to foreign parents, to become French.

===European citizenship===
{{Main|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[Citizenship of the European Union|European citizenship]], which comes in addition to national citizenships.

===Citizenship of foreigners===
By definition, a "[[alien (law)|foreigner]]" is someone who does not have French nationality. Therefore, it is ''not'' a synonym of "[[immigration|immigrant]]", as a foreigner may be born in France. On the other hand, a Frenchman born abroad may be considered an immigrant (e.g. former prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] who lived the majority of his life abroad). In most of the cases, however, a foreigner is an immigrant, and vice versa. They either benefit from legal sojourn in France, which, after a residency of ten years, makes it possible to ask for [[naturalisation]].<ref>This ten-year clause is threatened by Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s law proposition on immigration.</ref> If they do not, they are considered "[[alien (law)|illegal aliens]]". Some argue that this privation of nationality and citizenship does not square with their contribution to the national economic efforts, and thus to [[economic growth]].

In any cases, rights of foreigners in France have improved over the last half-century:
* 1946: right to elect [[trade union]] representative (but not to be elected as a representative)
* 1968: right to become a trade-union delegate
* 1972: right to sit in [[works council]] and to be a delegate of the workers at the condition of "knowing how to read and write French"
* 1975: additional condition: "to be able to express oneself in French"; they may vote at ''prud'hommes elections'' ("industrial tribunal elections") but may not be elected; foreigners may also have administrative or leadership positions in tradeunions but under various conditions
* 1982: those conditions are suppressed, only the function of ''conseiller prud'hommal'' is reserved to those who have acquired French nationality. They may be elected in workers' representation functions (Auroux laws). They also may become administrators in public structures such as [[Social security]] banks (''caisses de sécurité sociale''), OPAC (which administers [[HLM]]s), Ophlm...

The [[INSEE]] does not collect data about language, religion, or ethnicity – on the principle of the secular and unitary nature of the French Republic.<ref>[http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2003/april/ethrellangroups Ethnic, Religious and Language Groups: Towards a Set of Rules for Data Collection and Statistical Analysis], Werner Haug</ref>

Nevertheless, there are some sources dealing with just such distinctions:

*The [[CIA World Factbook]] defines the ethnic groups of France as being "Celtic and Latin with Teutonic, Slavic, North African, Sub-Saharan African, Indochinese, and Basque minorities. Overseas departments: black, white, mulatto, East Indian, Chinese, Amerindian".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/france/ |title=CIA Factbook – France |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=12 November 2011 }}</ref> Its definition is reproduced on several Web sites collecting or reporting demographic data.<ref>[http://www.nationbynation.com/France/Population.html France Population] – Nation by Nation</ref>
*The U.S. Department of State goes into further detail: "Since prehistoric times, France has been a crossroads of trade, travel, and invasion. Three basic [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[ethnic]] stocks – Celtic, Latin, and Teutonic (Frankish) – have blended over the centuries to make up its present population. . . . Traditionally, France has had a high level of immigration. . . . In 2004, there were over 6 million Muslims, largely of North African descent, living in France. France is home to both the largest Muslim and Jewish populations in Europe."<ref name="Department of State">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3842.htm Background Notes: France] – U.S. Department of State</ref>
*The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] says that "the French are strongly conscious of belonging to a single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge", and it mentions as part of the population of France the [[Basques]], the [[Celts]] (called [[Gauls]] by Romans), and the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] (Teutonic) peoples (including the [[Norsemen]] or [[Vikings]]). France also became "in the 19th and especially in the 20th century, the prime recipient of foreign immigration into Europe. . . ."<ref name=Drinkwater/>

It is said by some{{who|date=May 2012}} that France adheres to the ideal of a single, homogeneous national culture, supported by the absence of hyphenated identities and by avoidance of the very term "ethnicity" in French discourse.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/glc/events/race/Fredrickson.pdf Race, Ethnicity, and National Identity in France and the United States: A Comparative Historical Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208020244/http://www.yale.edu/glc/events/race/Fredrickson.pdf |date=8 December 2003}} George M.

===Immigration===
{{Main|Immigration to France}}
As of 2008, the French national institute of statistics [[INSEE]] estimated that 5.3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6.5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in [[metropolitan France]] (62.1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5.5 million are of [[Europe]]an origin and 4 million of North African origin.<ref name="insee.fr">[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=ip1287 Être né en France d'un parent immigré], Insee Première, n°1287, mars 2010, Catherine Borrel et Bertrand Lhommeau, Insee</ref><ref name="Insee_1">[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=immigrespaysnais Répartition des immigrés par pays de naissance 2008], Insee, October 2011</ref>

Quebec is home to vibrant French-language arts, media, and learning. There are sizable [[French-Canadian]] communities scattered throughout the other provinces of Canada, particularly in [[Ontario]], which has about 1 million people with French ancestry (400 000 who have French as their mother tongue), [[Manitoba]], and [[New Brunswick]], which is the only fully [[bilingual]] province and is 33 percent [[Acadian]].

===United States===
{{See also|French American}}

The United States is home to an estimated 13 to 16 million people of [[French American|French descent]], or 4 to 5 percent of the US population, particularly in [[Louisiana]], [[New England]] and parts of the [[Midwest]]. The French community in Louisiana consists of the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], the descendants of the French settlers who arrived when Louisiana was a French colony, and the [[Cajuns]], the descendants of [[Acadia]]n refugees from the [[Great Upheaval]]. Very few creoles remain in New Orleans in present times. In New England, the vast majority of French immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries came not from France, but from over the border in Quebec, the [[Quebec diaspora]]. These French Canadians arrived to work in the timber mills and textile plants that appeared throughout the region as it industrialized. Today, nearly 25 percent of the population of [[New Hampshire]] is of French ancestry, the highest of any state.

English and Dutch colonies of pre-Revolutionary America attracted large numbers of French [[Huguenots]] fleeing religious persecution in France. In the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] that later became New York, northern New Jersey, and western [[Connecticut]], these French Huguenots, nearly identical in religion to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], assimilated almost completely into the Dutch community. However, large it may have been at one time, it has lost all identity of its French origin, often with the translation of names (examples: ''de la Montagne'' &gt; ''Vandenberg'' by translation; ''de Vaux'' &gt; ''DeVos'' or ''Devoe'' by phonetic respelling). Huguenots appeared in all of the English colonies and likewise assimilated. Even though this mass settlement approached the size of the settlement of the French settlement of Quebec, it has assimilated into the English-speaking mainstream to a much greater extent than other French colonial groups and has left few traces of cultural influence. [[New Rochelle, New York]] is named after [[La Rochelle]], France, one of the sources of Huguenot emigration to the Dutch colony; and [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz, New York]], is one of the few non-urban settlements of Huguenots that did not undergo massive recycling of buildings in the usual redevelopment of such older, larger cities as New York City or New Rochelle.

===Argentina===
{{See also|French Argentine}}

French Argentines form the third largest ancestry group in [[Argentina]], after Italian and Spanish Argentines. Most of French immigrants came to Argentina between 1871 and 1890, though considerable immigration continued until the late 1940s. At least half of these immigrants came from Southwestern France, especially from the Basque Country, Béarn (Basses-Pyrénées accounted for more than 20% of immigrants), Bigorre and Rouergue but also from Savoy and the Paris region. Today around 6.8&nbsp;million Argentines have some degree of French ancestry or are of partial or wholly of French descent (up to 17% of the total population).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.canalacademie.com/Les-merveilleux-francophiles,1009.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605035505/http://www.canalacademie.com/Les-merveilleux-francophiles,1009.html|url-status=live|title=Canal Académie: Les merveilleux francophiles argentins|archive-date=5 June 2009}}</ref> French Argentines had a considerable influence over the country, particularly on its architectural styles and literary traditions, as well as on the scientific field. Some notable Argentines of French descent include writer [[Julio Cortázar]], physiologist and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Bernardo Houssay]] or activist [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]].
With something akin to Latin culture, the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Argentine society.

===Uruguay===
{{Main|French Uruguayan}}

French Uruguayans form the third largest ancestry group in [[Uruguay]], after Italian and Spanish Uruguayans. During the first half of the 19th century, [[Uruguay]] received mostly French immigrants to [[South America]]. It constituted back then the second receptor of French immigrants in the [[New World]] after the [[United States]]. Thus, while the [[United States]] received 195,971 French immigrants between 1820 and 1855, 13,922 Frenchmen, most of them from the [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] and [[Béarn]], left for Uruguay between 1833 and 1842.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://ecrivainsargentins.viabloga.com/news/l-immigration-francaise-en-argentine-1850-1930 |title=L'immigration française en Argentine, 1850–1930 |quote=L'Uruguay capta seulement 13.922 [immigrants français] entre 1833 et 1842, la plupart d'entre eux originaires du Pays Basque et du Béarn.}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|French British}}

[[French migration to the United Kingdom]] is a phenomenon that has occurred at various points in history. Many British people have French ancestry, and French remains the foreign language most learned by British people. Much of the UK's mediaeval [[aristocracy]] was descended from [[France|Franco]]-[[Normans|Norman]] migrants at the time of the [[Norman Conquest of England]], and also during the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenet]] dynasty.

According to a study by [[Ancestry.com|Ancestry.co.uk]], 3 million British people are of French descent.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7578817/Britons-can-trace-French-ancestry-after-millions-of-records-go-online.html |title=Britons can trace French ancestry after millions of records go online|quote=The documents disclose that despite our rivalry with our continental counterparts, 3 million Britons – one in 20 – can trace their ancestry back to France. | location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Murray |last=Wardrop |date=12 April 2010}}</ref> Among those are television presenters [[Davina McCall]] and [[Louis Theroux]].

Due to [[World War II]], a group of exiled French (mostly soldiers and families orphaned) migrated to the country.<ref name="fr-cri">[http://www.genealogia.or.cr/docs/revistas/accg_revista012.pdf Los franco-ticos la genealogía y la paz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524080817/http://www.genealogia.or.cr/docs/revistas/accg_revista012.pdf |date=24 May 2015}} October 2008, {{ISSN|1659-3529}}.</ref>

===Mexico===
{{See also|French immigration to Mexico}}

In [[Mexico]], a sizeable population can trace its ancestry to France. After Spain, this makes France the second largest European ethnicity in the country. The bulk of French immigrants arrived in Mexico during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

From 1814 to 1955, inhabitants of [[Barcelonnette]] and the surrounding [[Ubaye Valley]] emigrated to Mexico by the dozens. Many established textile businesses between Mexico and France. At the turn of the 20th century, there were 5,000 French families from the Barcelonnette region registered with the French Consulate in Mexico. While 90% stayed in Mexico, some returned, and from 1880 to 1930, built grand mansions called ''Maisons Mexicaines'' and left a mark upon the city. Today the descendants of the Barcelonettes account for 80,000 descendants distributed around Mexico.

In the 1860s, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]] ruled by Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]—which was part of [[Napoleon III]]'s scheme to create a Latin empire in the New World (indeed responsible for coining the term of "Amérique latine", "Latin America" in English)-- many French soldiers, merchants, and families set foot upon Mexican soil. Emperor Maximilian's consort, [[Charlotte of Belgium|Carlota of Mexico]], a Belgian princess, was a granddaughter of [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French|Louis-Philippe of France]].

Many Mexicans of French descent live in cities or states such as [[Zacatecas]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Monterrey]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], and the capital, [[Mexico City]], where French surnames such as Chairez/Chaires, Renaux, Pierres, Michel, Betancourt, Alaniz, Blanc, Ney, Jurado (Jure), Colo (Coleau), Dumas, or Moussier can be found. Today, Mexico has more than 3 million people of full and partial French descent. mainly living in the capital, Puebla, Guadalajara, Veracruz and Querétaro.

===Chile===

The French came to Chile in the 18th century, arriving at [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] as merchants, and in the mid-19th century to cultivate vines in the [[haciendas]] of the [[Central Valley of Chile|Central Valley]], the homebase of world-famous [[Chilean wine]]. The [[Araucanía Region]] also has an important number of people of French ancestry, as the area hosted settlers arrived by the second half of the 19th century as farmers and shopkeepers. With something akin to [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin culture]], the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Chilean society.

From 1840 to 1940, around 25,000 Frenchmen immigrated to Chile. 80% of them were coming from Southwestern France, especially from [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Basses-Pyrénées]] ([[Northern Basque Country|Basque country]] and [[Béarn]]), [[Gironde]], [[Charente-Maritime|Charente-Inférieure]] and [[Charente]] and regions situated between [[Gers]] and [[Dordogne]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://alhim.revues.org/index1252.html |title=La emigración francesa en Chile, 1875–1914 |journal=Amérique Latine Histoire et Mémoire.

===Scandinavia===
During the great power era, about 100 French families came to Sweden. They had mainly emigrated to Sweden as a result of religious oppression. These include the Bedoire, De Laval and De Flon families. Several of whom worked as merchants and craftsmen. In Stockholm, the French Lutheran congregation was formed in 1687, later dissolved in 1791, which was not really an actual congregation but rather a series of private gatherings of religious practice.
