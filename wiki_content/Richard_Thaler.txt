== Academic career ==
After completing his studies, Thaler began his career as a professor at the University of Rochester.

Between 1977 and 1978, Thaler spent a year at Stanford University collaborating and researching with [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]], who provided him with the theoretical framework to fit many of the economic anomalies that he had identified, such as the [[endowment effect]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-04-30/business/ct-biz-0430-executive-profile-thaler-20120430_1_economics-daniel-kahneman-cost-fallacy/2|title=Profile: Richard Thaler, University of Chicago Booth School of Business professor|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en}}</ref>

From 1978 to 1995, he was a faculty member at the [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management|SC Johnson College of Business]] at [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/10/playful-nobel-prize-winner-laid-groundwork-his-field-cornell|title=A 'playful' Nobel Prize winner laid groundwork for his field at Cornell|website=news.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>

After gathering some attention with a regular column in the respected ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' (which ran between 1987 and 1990) and the publication of these columns by ''[[Princeton University Press]]'' (in 1992), Thaler was offered a position at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Booth School of Business]] in 1995, where he has taught ever since.

== Writings ==
=== Books ===
Thaler has written a number of books intended for a lay reader on the subject of [[behavioral economics]], including ''Quasi-rational Economics'' and ''The Winner's Curse'', the latter of which contains many of his ''Anomalies'' columns revised and adapted for a popular audience.  One of his recurring themes is that market-based approaches are incomplete: he is quoted as saying, "conventional economics assumes that people are highly-rational—super-rational—and unemotional.  They can calculate like a computer and have no [[self-control]] problems."<ref>{{cite book |last= Orrell |first= David |author-link=David Orrell|date= 2012|title= Economyths: How the Science of Complex Systems is Transforming Economic Thought |publisher= Icon Books |page=123 | isbn= 978-1848312197|title-link= Economyths }}</ref>

Thaler is coauthor, with [[Cass Sunstein]], of ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' (Yale University Press, 2008). ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. "People often make poor choices—and look back at them with bafflement!" Thaler and Sunstein write. "We do this because, as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine [[bias]]es that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself." Thaler and his co-author coined the term "[[choice architecture]]."<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Designing better choices |date=April 2, 2008 |first1=Richard H. |last1=Thaler |first2=Cass R. |last2=Sunstein |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/02/opinion/oe-thalerandsunstein2 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref>

Thaler advocates for libertarian paternalism, which describes public and private social policies that lead people to make good and better decisions through "nudges" without depriving them of the freedom to choose or significantly changing their economic incentives.<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Thaler}|title=Richard Thaler-American Economist|access-date=November 12, 2019}} </ref> An example of this can be seen in ''Nudge'' through defaults in organ donation. In the United States, citizens must opt in to donate their organs, while in Australia, citizens must opt out if they do not wish to donate. Consequently, Australia has much higher rates of organ donation than does the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thaler|first1=Richard|last2=Sunstein|first2=Cass|title=Nudge: Improving Decisions on Health, Wealth, and Happiness|publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref>

In 2015 Thaler wrote ''[[Misbehaving (book)|Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics]]'', a history of the development of behavioral economics, "part memoir, part attack on a breed of economist who dominated the academy—particularly, the Chicago School that dominated economic theory at the University of Chicago—for the much of the latter part of the 20th century."<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=In "Misbehaving," an Economics Professor Isn't Afraid to Attack His Own |first=Jonathon A. |last=Knee |date=May 5, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/business/dealbook/book-review-misbehaving-by-richard-thaler.html |access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref>

=== Other writings ===
Thaler gained some attention in the field of mainstream economics for publishing a regular column in the ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' from 1987 to 1990 titled ''Anomalies'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/richard.thaler/research/Anomalies.htm |title=Anomalies |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829235306/http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/richard.thaler/research/Anomalies.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2006}}</ref> in which he documented individual instances of economic behavior that seemed to violate traditional [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] theory.<ref>Multiple sources:

As a columnist for ''The New York Times'' News Service, Thaler has begun a series of economic solutions for some of America's financial woes, beginning with "Selling parts of the radio spectrum could help pare US deficit," with references to [[Thomas Hazlett]]'s ideas for reform of the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and making television broadcast frequency available for improving wireless technology, reducing costs, and generating revenue for the US government.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Thayer |date=February 28, 2010 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2010/02/28/2003466801 |title=Selling parts of the radio spectrum could help pare US deficit |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]]  |access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref>

== Nobel Prize ==
[[File:Richard H. Thaler EM1B8783 (38891871821).jpg|thumb|Richard H. Thaler during Nobel Prize press conference in Stockholm, December 2017]]
Thaler was the 2017 recipient of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] for "incorporat[ing] psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. By exploring the consequences of ''limited rationality'', ''social preferences'', and ''lack of self-control'', he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes."<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 9, 2017 |title=The Prize in Economic Sciences 2017 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2017/press.html |publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences}}</ref>

Immediately following the announcement of the 2017 prize, Professor [[Peter Gärdenfors]], Member of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee, said in an interview that Thaler had "made economics more human".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2017/announcement.html|title=The Prize in Economic Sciences 2017 - Prize Announcement|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>

After learning that he had won the Nobel Prize, Thaler said that his most important contribution to economics "was the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that."<ref>{{cite news |last=Isaac |first=Anna |title='Nudge' guru Richard Thaler wins the Nobel prize for economics |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=October 9, 2017 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/10/09/nobel-prize-awarded-us-behavioural-economist-richard-thaler/ |access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref> In a nod to the sometimes-unreasonable behavior he has studied so extensively, he also joked that he intended to spend the prize money "as irrationally as possible."<ref>{{cite news |last=Partington |first=Richard |title=Nobel prize in economics awarded to Richard Thaler: Pioneer of behavioural economics is best known for 'nudge' theory, which has influenced politicians and policymakers |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=October 9, 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/nobel-prize-in-economics-richard-thaler}}</ref>

[[Paul Krugman]], the 2008 winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], [[tweeted]] "Yes!

In chronicling Thaler's path to Nobel laureate, John Cassidy notes that although Thaler's "nudge" theory may not overcome every shortcoming of traditional economics, it has at least grappled with them "in ways that have yielded important insights in areas ranging from finance to international development".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-making-of-richard-thalers-economics-nobel|title=The Making of Richard Thaler's Economics Nobel|last=Cassidy|first=John|date=2017-10-10|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>
