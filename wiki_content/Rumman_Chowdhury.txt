=== Current Career ===
Chowdhury is currently a director for the Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency and Accountability ('''META''') team with [[Twitter]]. META’s goal is to study and improve the [[Machine learning|ML systems]] used within Twitter, this includes biased [[Algorithm|algorithms]] that may cause harm to the user.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introducing our Responsible Machine Learning Initiative|url=https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative|access-date=2021-11-17|website=blog.twitter.com|language=en-us}}</ref> [[Biased algorithms]] have been an issue since [[Artificial intelligence|artifical intelligence]] ('''AI''') has been introduced to the world; traits such as gender, sex, race, or social class hold potential [[Segregate|segregation]] that may result in unfair decisions, META strives avoid this by making Twitter better, fair, accountable, and more transparent for its users.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Introducing our Responsible Machine Learning Initiative|url=https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative|access-date=2021-11-17|website=blog.twitter.com|language=en-us}}</ref> Most projects that META teams do involve research and data analysis, which is why the team is made from Researchers and Engineers.<ref>{{Cite web|title="A 'building the plane as you fly it' moment": Q&A with Twitter's ethical AI lead Rumman Chowdhury|url=https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/06/21/building-plane-fly-moment-qa-twitters-ethical-ai-lead-rumman-chowdhury|access-date=2021-11-17|website=Morning Brew|language=en-us}}</ref> AI is constantly changing and becoming greater, so the META teams have a similar process where they are learning inside and outside of the app and applying that knowledge to build a better Twitter. Future changes that will impact Twitter will be having the algorithms used explainable to the users making the app more transparent, eventually leading to the users customizing or creating the algorithms by themselves. This means that the Twitter community will play an important role to making Twitter a stronger app.<ref name=":3" /> 

== Awards ==
In 2017 she was included in the [[100 Women (BBC)]] . In 2018 she was named One of Five who are Shaping AI by Forbes<ref>{{Cite web|last=Team|first=Insights|title=Forbes Insights: 5 People Building Our AI Future|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2018/11/29/5-people-building-our-ai-future/|access-date=2021-11-17|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>.
