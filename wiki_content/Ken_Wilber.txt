'''Kenneth Earl Wilber II''' (born January 31, 1949) is an American philosopher and writer on [[transpersonal psychology]] and his own [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]],<ref>Mark Der Forman, ''A guide to integral psychotherapy: complexity, integration, and spirituality in practice,'' [[SUNY Press]] 2010, p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3023-2}}</ref> a philosophy which suggests the synthesis of all human knowledge and experience.<ref name="wilber-intro" />

==Life and career==
Wilber was born in 1949 in Oklahoma City. In 1967 he enrolled as a [[pre-medical|pre-med]] student at [[Duke University]].<ref>[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Tony Schwartz]], ''What Really Matters: Searching for Wisdom in America'', Bantam, 1996, {{ISBN|0-553-37492-3}}, p. 348.</ref> He became interested in Eastern literature, particularly the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. He left Duke and enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska at Lincoln]], but after a few years dropped out of university and began studying his own curriculum and writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|title=Ken Wilber – Teachers – Spirituality & Practice|work=spiritualityandpractice.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131218/http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/teachers/teachers.php?id=310|archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref>

In 1973 Wilber completed his first book, ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'',<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wvw9pzzp1C0C | title = The Spectrum of Consciousness | isbn = 9780835606950 | last1 = Wilber | first1 = Ken | year = 1993}}</ref> in which he sought to integrate knowledge from disparate fields. After rejections by more than 20 publishers it was accepted in 1977 by [[Quest Books]], and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing. He also helped to launch the journal ''ReVision'' in 1978.<ref>Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', p. 27.</ref>

In 1982, New Science Library published his anthology ''The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes'',<ref>''The Holographic Paradigm and other paradoxes'', 1982, {{ISBN|0-87773-238-8}}</ref> a collection of essays and interviews, including one by [[David Bohm]]. The essays, including one of his own, looked at how [[holography]] and the [[holographic paradigm]] relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism, and science.

In 1983, Wilber married Terry "Treya" Killam who was shortly thereafter diagnosed with breast cancer. From 1984 until 1987, Wilber gave up most of his writing to care for her. Killam died in January 1989; their joint experience was recorded in the 1991 book ''Grace and Grit''.

In 1987, Wilber moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where he worked on his Kosmos trilogy and supervised the work and functioning of the [[Integral Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Ken Wilber|url=https://www.famouspsychologists.org/ken-wilber/|url-status=live|archive-date=August 30, 2021|website=Famous Psychologists}}</ref> 

Wilber wrote ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]'' (1995), the first volume of his ''Kosmos Trilogy''. ''A Brief History of Everything'' (1996) was the popularised summary of ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'' in interview format. ''The Eye of Spirit'' (1997) was a compilation of articles he had written for the journal ''ReVision'' on the relationship between science and religion. Throughout 1997, he had kept journals of his personal experiences, which were published in 1999 as ''One Taste'', a term for [[Cosmic consciousness|unitary consciousness]]. Over the next two years his publisher, [[Shambhala Publications]], released eight re-edited volumes of his ''Collected Works''. In 1999, he finished ''Integral Psychology'' and wrote ''[[A Theory of Everything]]'' (2000). In ''A Theory of Everything'' Wilber attempts to bridge business, politics, science and spirituality and show how they integrate with theories of developmental psychology, such as [[Spiral Dynamics]]. His novel, ''[[Boomeritis]]'' (2002), attempts to expose what he perceives as the [[egotism]] of the [[baby boomers|baby boom generation]]. Frank Visser's ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'' (2003), a guide to Wilber's thought, was praised by Edward J. Sullivan<ref name="Sullivan">{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Edward J.|date=Winter 2005–06|title=REVIEW: Sullivan/Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion|url=https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&context=jaepl|journal=JAEPL|volume=11|pages=97–99}}</ref> and Daryl S. Paulson, with the latter calling it "an outstanding synthesis of Wilber's published works through the evolution of his thoughts over time. The book will be of value to any transpersonal humanist or integral philosophy student who does not want to read all of Wilber's works to understand his message."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paulson|first=Daryl S.|date=2004|title=Review of Thought as passion.|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-08755-007|journal=Journal of Transpersonal Psychology|volume=36|pages=223–227|via=APA PsycNet}}</ref>

In 2012, Wilber joined the [[advisory board]] of the [[International Simultaneous Policy Organization]] which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues through an international simultaneous policy.<ref name="About Simpol-UK">About Simpol-UK: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 uk.simpol.org&nbsp;– About Simpol-UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729182456/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 |date=July 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="Endorsements">Endorsements: [http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 Simpol.org&nbsp;– Endorsements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729191229/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=11 |date=July 29, 2013 }}</ref>

All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL, pron. "ah-qwul") is the basic framework of integral theory. It models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective". According to Wilber, it is a comprehensive approach to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.<ref name="wilber-intro">Rentschler, Matt. [http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf "AQAL Glossary,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228172258/http://iniciativaintegral.es/Documentos%20P%C3%BAblicos/1.-%20Teor%C3%ADa/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf |date=December 28, 2017 }} "AQAL: Journal of Integral Theory and Practice," Fall 2006, Vol. 1, No. 3. Retrieved on December 28, 2017.</ref>

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which do not fit into these four concepts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fiandt | first1 = K. | last2 = Forman | first2 = J. | last3 = Erickson Megel | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2003 | title = Integral nursing: an emerging framework for engaging the evolution of the profession | url = http://www.nursingoutlook.org/article/S0029-6554(03)00080-0/abstract | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 130–137 | doi=10.1016/s0029-6554(03)00080-0| pmid = 12830106 }}</ref> "Levels" are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal.

Edward (ed.), ''The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology'', Vol. 2, 4. ed., Wiley 2010, pp. 830 ff. {{ISBN|978-0-470-17026-7}}</ref> In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called "integral". In the essay, "Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together", Wilber describes AQAL as "one suggested architecture of the Kosmos".<ref>{{cite web | title=Excerpt C: The Ways We Are In This Together | work=Ken Wilber Online | url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm | access-date=December 26, 2005 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223205255/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm/ | archive-date=December 23, 2005 }}</ref>

The model's apex is formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", which is equated with a range of "ultimates" from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories&nbsp;— quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types&nbsp;– describe the relative truth of the [[two truths doctrine]] of [[Buddhism]]. According to Wilber, none of them are true in an absolute sense. Only formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being",<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Simple Feeling of Being|publisher=Shambala Publications|year=2004|isbn=9781590301517}}</ref> exists absolutely.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Madhyamaka]] two truths doctrine discerns two epistemological truths, namely conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the truth of phenomenal appearances and causal relations, our daily common-sense world. Ultimate truth is the recognition that no-"thing" exists inherently; every-"thing" is empty, [[sunyata]] of an unchanging "essence". It also means that there is no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence. "Formless awareness" belongs to another strand of Indian thinking, namely Advaita and Buddha-nature, which are ontological approaches, and ''do'' posit such a transcendental, unchanging reality, namely "awareness" or "consciousness." Wilber seems to be mixing, or confusing, these two different approaches freely, in his attempt to integrate "everything" into one conceptual scheme.}}

==Other ideas==

===Mysticism and the great chain of being===
One of Wilber's main interests is in mapping what he calls the "neo-perennial philosophy", an integration of some of the views of [[mysticism]] typified by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' with an account of cosmic [[evolution]] akin to that of the Indian mystic [[Sri Aurobindo]]. He rejects most of the tenets of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]] and the associated anti-evolutionary view of history as a regression from past ages or [[yuga]]s.<ref>"I have not identified myself with the perennial philosophy in over fifteen years ... Many of the enduring perennial philosophers—such as [[Nagarjuna]]—were already using postmetaphysical methods, which is why their insights are still quite valid. But the vast majority of perennial philosophers were caught in metaphysical, not critical, thought, which is why I reject their methods almost entirely, and accept their conclusions only to the extent they can be reconstructed"{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 14, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322225146/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/habermas/index.cfm |archive-date=March 22, 2006 }}</ref> Instead, he embraces a more traditionally Western notion of the [[great chain of being]]. As in the work of [[Jean Gebser]], this great chain (or "nest") is ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout this material manifestation, although to Wilber "... the 'Great Nest' is actually just a vast [[Morphic field|morphogenetic field]] of potentials ..." In agreement with Mahayana Buddhism, and [[Advaita Vedanta]], he believes that reality is ultimately a [[nondual]] union of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] and [[substantial form|form]], with form being innately subject to development over time.

Wilber believes that the mystical traditions of the world provide access to, and knowledge of, a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] reality which is [[Perennial philosophy|perennial]], being the same throughout all times and cultures. This proposition underlies the whole of his conceptual edifice, and is an unquestioned assumption.{{refn|group=note|The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity".{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}} Mainstream academia favor a constructivist approach, which is rejected by Wilber as a dangerous relativism. See also [[Mysticism|Perennialism versus constructionism]].}} Wilber juxtaposites this generalisation to plain materialism, presenting this as the main paradigma of regular science.<ref name="mystics" />{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "Are the mystics and sages insane? Because they all tell variations on the same story, don't they? The story of awakening one morning and discovering you are one with the All, in a timeless and eternal and infinite fashion. Yes, maybe they are crazy, these divine fools. Maybe they are mumbling idiots in the face of the Abyss. Maybe they need a nice, understanding therapist. Yes, I'm sure that would help. But then, I wonder. Maybe the evolutionary sequence really is from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a greater depth and greater consciousness and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of evolution, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity—a total embrace of the entire Kosmos—a [[cosmic consciousness|Kosmic consciousness]] that is Spirit awakened to its own true nature. It's at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the [[scientific materialism]] story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane?"<ref name="mystics">Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', pp. 42–3</ref>}}

In his later works, Wilber argues that manifest reality is composed of four domains, and that each domain, or "quadrant", has its own truth-standard, or test for validity:<ref>{{cite book  | last = Wilber  | first = Ken  | title = The Eye of Spirit | publisher = [[Shambhala]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1998  | pages = 12–18  | isbn = 1-57062-345-7 }}</ref>

===Pre/trans fallacy===
Wilber believes that many claims about non-rational states make a mistake he calls the pre/trans fallacy. According to Wilber, the non-rational stages of consciousness (what Wilber calls "pre-rational" and "trans-rational" stages) can be easily confused with one another. In Wilber's view, one can reduce trans-rational spiritual realization to pre-rational regression, or one can elevate pre-rational states to the trans-rational domain.<ref>[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm Introduction to the third volume of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615012815/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm/ |date=June 15, 2009 }}</ref> For example, Wilber claims that Freud and Jung commit this fallacy. [[Freud]] considered mystical realization to be a [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to [[infantile]] oceanic states. Wilber alleges that Freud thus commits a fallacy of reduction. Wilber thinks that [[Jung]] commits the converse form of the same mistake by considering pre-rational myths to reflect divine realizations. Likewise, pre-rational states may be misidentified as post-rational states.<ref>Wilber, Ken. ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality''. Shambhala Publications, 2000, pp 211 f. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-744-6}}</ref> Wilber characterizes himself as having fallen victim to the pre/trans fallacy in his early work.<ref>{{cite web|title=The introduction to Volume 1 of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber |work=Ken Wilber Online |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319023750/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev1_intro.cfm/ |archive-date=March 19, 2009 }}</ref>

===Wilber on science===
Wilber describes the current state of the "hard" sciences as limited to "narrow science", which only allows evidence from the lowest realm of consciousness, the [[wikt:sensorimotor|sensorimotor]] (the five senses and their extensions). Wilber sees science in the broad sense as characterized by involving three steps:<ref name="RothbergKelly1998-p12">{{cite book|author1=Donald Jay Rothberg|author2=Sean M. Kelly|author3=Sean Kelly|title=Ken Wilber in Dialogue: Conversations with Leading Transpersonal Thinkers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1GUlPmlPD0C&pg=PA12|date=February 1, 1998|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-0766-7|pages=12}}</ref><ref name="Howard2005-p2-3">{{cite book|author=Lew Howard|title=Introducing Ken Wilber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svCgg2VVR5oC&pg=PA2|date=May 17, 2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4634-8193-3|pages=2–3}}</ref>
* specifying an experiment,
* performing the experiment and observing the results, and
* checking the results with others who have competently performed the same experiment.
He has presented these as "three strands of valid knowledge" in Part III of his book ''[[The Marriage of Sense and Soul]]''.<ref name="Wilber2011-p187">{{cite book|author=Ken Wilber|title=The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQGmVyPN6rUC&pg=PT187|date=August 3, 2011|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79956-2|pages=187}}</ref>

What Wilber calls "broad science" would include evidence from [[logic]], mathematics, and from the [[symbol]]ic, [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]], and other realms of [[consciousness]]. Ultimately and ideally, broad science would include the testimony of [[meditation|meditators]] and [[spiritual practice|spiritual practitioners]]. Wilber's own conception of science includes both narrow science and broad science, e.g., using [[electroencephalogram]] machines and other technologies to test the experiences of meditators and other spiritual practitioners, creating what Wilber calls "integral science".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

According to Wilber's theory, narrow science trumps narrow religion, but broad science trumps narrow science. That is, the natural sciences provide a more inclusive, accurate account of reality than any of the particular [[exoteric]] religious traditions. But an integral approach that uses intersubjectivity to evaluate both religious claims and scientific claims will give a more complete account of reality than narrow science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Wilber has referred to [[Stuart Kauffman]], [[Ilya Prigogine]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and others to articulate his [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] and [[Teleology|teleological]] understanding of reality, which is deeply at odds with the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]].<ref name="SC"/>{{refn|group=quote|Wilber: "I am not alone in seeing that chance and natural selection by themselves are not enough to account for the emergence that we see in evolution. Stuart Kaufman{{sic}} and many others have criticized mere change and natural selection as not adequate to account for this emergence (he sees the necessity of adding self-organization). Of course I understand that natural selection is not acting on mere randomness or chance—because natural selection saves previous selections, and this reduces dramatically the probability that higher, adequate forms will emerge. But even that is not enough, in my opinion, to account for the remarkable emergence of some of the extraordinarily complex forms that nature has produced. After all, from the big bang and dirt to the poems of William Shakespeare is quite a distance, and many philosophers of science agree that mere chance and selection are just not adequate to account for these remarkable emergences. The universe is slightly tilted toward self-organizing processes, and these processes—as Prigogine was the first to elaborate—escape present-level turmoil by jumping to higher levels of self-organization, and I see that "pressure" as operating throughout the physiosphere, the biosphere, and the noosphere. And that is what I metaphorically mean when I use the example of a wing (or elsewhere, the example of an eyeball) to indicate the remarkableness of increasing emergence. But I don't mean that as a specific model or actual example of how biological emergence works! Natural selection carries forth previous individual mutations—but again that just isn't enough to account for creative emergence (or what Whitehead called "the creative advance into novelty," which, according to Whitehead, is the fundamental nature of this manifest universe)."<ref name="SC">Ken Wilber, ''[http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 Re: Some Criticisms of My Understanding of Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907151307/http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/390 |date=September 7, 2011 }}''</ref>}}

===Current work===
In 2005, at the launch of the Integral Spiritual Center, a branch of the [[Integral Institute]], Wilber presented a 118-page rough draft summary of his two forthcoming books.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Integral Spirituality? |work=Integral Spiritual Center |url=http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%20Spirituality.pdf |access-date=December 26, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125133004/http://integralspiritualcenter.org/Integral%2BSpirituality.pdf |archive-date=November 25, 2005 |url-status=dead }} (1.3 MB [[portable document format|PDF]] file)</ref> The essay is entitled "What is Integral Spirituality?", and contains several new ideas, including Integral post-metaphysics and the Wilber-Combs lattice. In 2006, he published "Integral Spirituality", in which he elaborated on these ideas, as well as others such as Integral Methodological Pluralism and the developmental conveyor belt of religion.

"Integral post-metaphysics" is the term Wilber has given to his attempts to reconstruct the world's [[spirituality|spiritual]]-religious traditions in a way that accounts for the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[post-modern]] criticisms of those traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The Wilber-Combs Lattice is a conceptual model of [[consciousness]] developed by Wilber and [[Allan Combs]]. It is a grid with sequential [[states of consciousness]] on the x axis (from left to right) and with developmental structures, or [[Overlapping hierarchy|levels]], of consciousness on the y axis (from bottom to top).

Wilber attracted a lot of controversy from 2011 to the present day by supporting [[Marc Gafni]].

==Influences==
Wilber's philosophy has been influenced by [[Madhyamaka]] [[Buddhism]], particularly as articulated in the philosophy of [[Nagarjuna]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Kosmos According to Ken Wilber: A Dialogue with Robin Kornman | date=September 1996 | work=Shambhala Sun | url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2059 | access-date=June 14, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813160309/http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2059 | archive-date=August 13, 2006 }}</ref> Wilber has practiced various forms of Buddhist meditation, studying (however briefly) with a number of teachers, including [[Dainin Katagiri]], [[Taizan Maezumi]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]] [[Rinpoche]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Penor Rinpoche]] and [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]]. [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Kaśmir Śaivism|Trika (Kashmir) Shaivism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Ramana Maharshi]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]] can be mentioned as further influences.  Wilber has on several occasions singled out [[Adi Da]]'s work for the highest praise while expressing reservations about Adi Da as a teacher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |title=The Case of Adi Da |work=Ken Wilber Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213072728/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |archive-date=February 13, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adidawilber.com/ |title=Adi Da and The Case of Ken Wilber |quote=I mention Master Da (along with Christ, Krishna) as being the Divine Person as World Event. – Ken Wilber, Up From Eden, 1981 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124109/http://www.adidawilber.com/ |archive-date=March 3, 2011 }}</ref> In ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'', Wilber refers extensively to [[Plotinus]]' philosophy, which he sees as nondual.

According to Frank Visser, Wilber's conception of four quadrants, or dimensions of existence is very similar to [[E. F. Schumacher]]'s conception of four fields of knowledge.<ref>Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 194</ref> Visser finds Wilber's conception of levels, as well as Wilber's critique of science as one-dimensional, to be very similar to that in [[Huston Smith]]'s ''Forgotten Truth''.<ref>Frank Visser, ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', 78</ref> Visser also writes that the esoteric aspects of Wilber's theory are based on the philosophy of [[Sri Aurobindo]] as well as other theorists including [[Adi Da]].<ref>Visser, 276</ref>

==Reception==
Wilber has been categorized as [[New Age]] due to his emphasis on a [[transpersonal]] view<ref>[[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]], ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', SUNY, 1998, pp. 70 (''"Ken Wilber ... defends a transpersonal worldview which qualifies as 'New Age'"'').</ref> and, more recently, as a philosopher.<ref>Marian de Souza (ed.), ''International handbook of the religious, moral and spiritual dimensions in education'', Dordrecht: Springer 2006, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4803-6}}.</ref> ''Publishers Weekly'' has called him "the Hegel of Eastern spirituality".<ref>[{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053719/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59030-151-7 |date=April 30, 2014 }} "The Simple Feeling of Being: Visionary, Spiritual and Poetic Writings"], publishersweekly.com, June 4, 2014.]</ref>

Frank Visser writes that Wilber's 1977 book ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'' was praised by [[Transpersonal psychology|transpersonal psychologists]], but also that support for him "even in transpersonal circles" had waned by the early 1990s.<ref name=Sullivan/> Edward J. Sullivan argued, in his review of Visser's guide ''Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion'', that in the field of composition studies "Wilber's melding of life’s journeys with abstract theorizing could provide an eclectic and challenging model of 'personal-academic' writing", but that "teachers of writing may be critical of his all-too-frequent totalizing assumptions".<ref name="Sullivan" /> Sullivan also said that Visser's book overall gave an impression that Wilber "should think more and publish less."<ref name="Sullivan" />

[[Steve McIntosh]] praises Wilber's work but also argues that Wilber fails to distinguish "philosophy" from his own Vedantic and Buddhist religion.<ref name=McIntosh>Steve McIntosh, ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'', Paragon House, St Paul Minnesota, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55778-867-2}} pp. 227f.</ref> Christopher Bache is complimentary of some aspects of Wilber's work, but calls Wilber's writing style glib.<ref>Notes to Chapter 6 of ''Dark Night Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind'' SUNY Press, 2000</ref>

Psychiatrist [[Stanislav Grof]] has praised Wilber's knowledge and work in the highest terms;{{refn|group=note|... Ken has produced an extraordinary work of highly creative synthesis of data drawn from a vast variety of areas and disciplines ... His knowledge of the literature is truly encyclopedic, his analytical mind systematic and incisive, and the clarity of his logic remarkable. The impressive scope, comprehensive nature, and intellectual rigor of Ken's work have helped to make it a widely acclaimed and highly influential theory of transpersonal psychology.<ref>Stanislav Grof, [http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm "Ken Wilber's Spectrum Psychology"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209054241/http://primal-page.com/grofken.htm |date=December 9, 2009 }}</ref>}} however, Grof has criticized the omission of the [[Pre- and perinatal psychology|pre- and peri-natal domains]] from Wilber's spectrum of consciousness, and Wilber's neglect of the psychological importance of biological birth and death.<ref>Grof, ''Beyond the Brain'', 131–137</ref> Grof has described Wilber's writings as having an "often aggressive polemical style that includes strongly worded ''[[ad personam]]'' attacks and is not conducive to personal dialogue."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716130649/http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Grof, "A Brief History of Transpersonal Psychology"|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Wilber's response is that the world religious traditions do not attest to the importance that Grof assigns to the perinatal.<ref>Visser, 269</ref>
