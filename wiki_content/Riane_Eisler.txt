'''Riane Tennenhaus Eisler''' (born 22 July 1931) is an Austrian-born American [[Systems scientists|systems scientist]] and author who writes about the effect of gender politics historically on society. She is most known for her 1987 book ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'', in which she coined the terms "partnership" and "dominator."<ref>https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-chalice-and-the-blade-riane-eisler?variant=32203950424098 {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/books/l-the-chalice-and-the-blade-219387.html</ref>

==Life==
Eisler was born in [[Vienna]] in 1931 before her family fled from the [[Nazis]] in 1939 to [[Cuba]]. She and her parents lived in a slum in Havanna for seven years, after which they emigrated to the United States, to Miami, New York, and Chicago before finally settling in Los Angeles.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}
Eisler has degrees in sociology and law from the [[University of California]]. She is an attorney, legal scholar and author. She has published thirteen books, including one memoir, ''The Gate'', published in 2000. Her first book, published in 1977, was ''Dissolution: Dissolution: No-Fault Divorce, Marriage, and the Future of Women''. Her second book, published in 1979, was on the Equal Rights Amendment.<ref>https://rianeeisler.com/authored/</ref>

In her third book ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'', published in 1987, she coined the terms "partnership" and "dominator" to describe the two underlying forms of society. Partnership societies are characterized by gender equality, peace, sustainability, caring, while dominator societies are characterized by sexism, chronic war, ecological destruction, and unsustainability. According to her research, which references the work of archaeologists Marija Gimbutas and James Mellaart, among others, for millennia human societies were built on partnership, in which human capacity to give, nurture and sustain life was held in the highest regard, and shared responsibility was the gold standard. The fall into domination occurred around 6,500 years ago.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=0062502891|title=The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future|last1=Eisler|first1=Riane|date=21 September 1988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissarowley/2021/08/04/youve-met-the-fathers-of-capitalism-and-socialism-now-meet-the-mother-of-partnerism/|title=You've Met the Fathers of Capitalism and Socialism—Now Meet the Mother of Partnerism|website=[[Forbes]]}}</ref>

''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'' has sold over 500,000 copies and been translated into around 25 languages.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lin|first=Tao|title=Partnership Before Sexism and War|url=https://tankmagazine.com/issue-89/features/tao-lin|magazine=Tank Magazine|date=November 18, 2021|access-date=November 18, 2021}}</ref>

Eisler has argued that the switch from partnership to dominator has led to gender biased monogamy, prostitution and illegitimacy, women's dependence and the acceptance of chronic war.<ref name=noncoi>{{Cite journal|last=Mercati|first=Stefano|date=June 2015|title=Glossary for Cultural Transformation: The Language of Partnership and Domination|url=https://pubs.lib.umn.edu/index.php/ijps/article/download/89/83/255|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies|volume=1}}</ref>

She is editor-in-chief of the ''Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies'' at the [[University of Minnesota]].

==The Center for Partnership Studies==
In 1987, Eisler founded The Center for Partnership Studies, which was later renamed The Center for Partnership Systems. The organization is "dedicated to research, education, and building tools to construct economic and social systems that support human beings and the planet that sustains us."<ref name=nobetterrefyet>{{Cite web|title=CPS Team|url=https://centerforpartnership.org/about/cps-team/|access-date=10 July 2021|website=The Center for Partnership Systems|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Influence==
Philosopher [[Terence McKenna]] referenced Eisler's work throughout his writings and talks, including in ''The Archaic Revival.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinethemind.com/dominator-vs-partnership/|title = "Dominator" vs. "Partnership" Cultures: A Profound Re-Telling of Human History|date = 14 January 2015}}</ref> Eisler's term [[dominator culture]] has been used by writers ranging from [[bell hooks]] to [[Tao Lin]].

Ashley Montagu called her book ''The Chalice and the Blade'' “The most important book since Darwin’s ''Origin of Species''." Isabel Allende said of the book: "Some books are like revelations, they open the spirit to unimaginable possibilities."
