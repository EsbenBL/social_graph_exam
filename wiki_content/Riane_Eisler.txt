'''Riane Tennenhaus Eisler''' (born 22 July 1931) is an Austrian-born American [[Systems scientists|systems scientist]] and author who writes about the effect of gender politics historically on society. She is most known for her 1987 book ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'', in which she coined the terms "partnership" and "dominator."<ref>https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-chalice-and-the-blade-riane-eisler?variant=32203950424098</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/books/l-the-chalice-and-the-blade-219387.html</ref>

==Life==
Eisler was born in [[Vienna]] in 1931 before her family fled from the [[Nazis]] to [[Cuba]].  She later emigrated to the United States.  She has degrees in sociology and law from the [[University of California]]. She is an attorney, legal scholar and author. She is the founder of her "Center for Partnership Systems".<ref name=nobetterrefyet>{{Cite web|title=CPS Team|url=https://centerforpartnership.org/about/cps-team/|access-date=10 July 2021|website=The Center for Partnership Systems|language=en-US}}</ref>

She has published thirteen books, including one memoir, ''The Gate'', published in 2000. Her first book was ''Dissolution: Dissolution: No-Fault Divorce, Marriage, and the Future of Women''. Her second book was on the Equal Rights Amendment.<ref>https://rianeeisler.com/authored/</ref>

In her third book ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'', published in 1987, she coined the terms "partnership" and "dominator" to describe the two underlying forms of society. Partnership societies are characterized by gender equality, peace, sustainability, caring, while dominator societies are characterized by sexism, chronic war, ecological destruction, and unsustainability. According to her research, which references the work of archaeologists Marija Gimbutas and James Mellaart, among others, for millennia human societies were built on partnership, in which human capacity to give, nurture and sustain life was held in the highest regard, and shared responsibility was the gold standard. The fall into domination occurred around 6,500 years ago. <ref>{{Cite book|isbn=0062502891|title=The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future|last1=Eisler|first1=Riane|date=21 September 1988}}</ref><ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissarowley/2021/08/04/youve-met-the-fathers-of-capitalism-and-socialism-now-meet-the-mother-of-partnerism/</ref>

Eisler has argued that the switch from partnership to dominator has led to gender biased monogamy, prostitution and illegitimacy, women's dependence and the acceptance of war.<ref name=noncoi>{{Cite journal|last=Mercati|first=Stefano|date=June 2015|title=Glossary for Cultural Transformation: The Language of Partnership and Domination|url=https://pubs.lib.umn.edu/index.php/ijps/article/download/89/83/255|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies|volume=1}}</ref>

==Influence==
Philosopher [[Terence McKenna]] referenced Eisler's work throughout his writings and talks, including in ''The Archaic Revival.''<Ref>https://www.refinethemind.com/dominator-vs-partnership/</ref> Eisler's term [[dominator culture]] has been used by writers ranging from [[bell hooks]] to [[Tao Lin]].
