The '''University of Cambridge''' is a [[collegiate university|collegiate]] [[research university]] in [[Cambridge|Cambridge, United Kingdom]]. Founded in 1209<ref name="Early records">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/early-records|title=Early records|date=28 January 2013|website=University of Cambridge|language=en|access-date=5 December 2019}}</ref> and granted a [[royal charter]] by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the [[English-speaking world]] and the world's [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|fourth-oldest surviving university]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sager |first=Peter|date= 2005|title= Oxford and Cambridge: An Uncommon History}}</ref> The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the [[University of Oxford]] after a dispute with the townspeople.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/records.html|title=A Brief History: Early records|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=17 August 2008}}</ref> The two English [[ancient university|ancient universities]] share many common features and are often jointly referred to as ''[[Oxbridge]]''.

Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include [[colleges of the University of Cambridge|31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges]] and [[List of institutions of the University of Cambridge#Schools, Faculties, and Departments|over 150 academic departments, faculties and other institutions organised into six schools]]. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. The university does not have a main campus, and its colleges and central facilities are scattered throughout the city. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate teaching]] at Cambridge centres on weekly small-group [[Tutorial system|supervisions]] in the colleges in groups of typically 1–4 students. This intensive method of teaching is widely considered the 'jewel in the crown' of an Oxbridge undergraduate education.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-007-0047-5_6|chapter=The Tutorial System: The Jewel in the Crown|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0047-5_6|access-date=7 June 2021|title=Oxford, the Collegiate University|series=Higher Education Dynamics|year=2011|last1=Tapper|first1=Ted|last2=Palfreyman|first2=David|volume=34|pages=95–115|isbn=978-94-007-0046-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/brainwaves82/|title=What should students expect from their College and the University?|date=December 2017|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=7 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sckool.org/edited-by-david-palfreyman.html?page=2|title=The Jewel in the Crown?|publisher=David Palfreyman|access-date=7 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cetl.hku.hk/conf2016/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jewel-in-the-Crown-double-spaced-submitted-paper-19082016.pdf|title='Jewel in the crown?'

[[Postgraduate education|Postgraduate teaching]] is provided predominantly centrally.

[[Cambridge University Press & Assessment]] combines the oldest university press in the world with one of the world's leading examining bodies, which provides assessment to over eight million learners globally every year. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], as well as a [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden|botanic garden]]. [[Libraries of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge's libraries]], of which there are over 100, hold a total of around 16&nbsp;million books, around nine&nbsp;million of which are in [[Cambridge University Library]], a [[legal deposit library]]. The university is home to, but independent of, the [[Cambridge Union]] – the world's oldest debating society.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Cambridge}}
By the late 12th century, the Cambridge area already had a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation, due to monks from the nearby bishopric church of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]. However, it was an incident at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] which is most likely to have led to the establishment of the university: three Oxford scholars were hanged by the town authorities for the death of a woman, without consulting the ecclesiastical authorities, who would normally take precedence (and pardon the scholars) in such a case, but were at that time in conflict with [[John, King of England|King John]]. Fearing more violence from the townsfolk, scholars from the University of Oxford started to move away to cities such as [[Paris]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], and [[Cambridge]]. Subsequently, enough scholars remained in Cambridge to form the nucleus of a new university when it had become safe enough for academia to resume at Oxford.<ref name="Early records"/><ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9158000/9158705.stm |title = 'To lick a Lord and thrash a cad': Oxford 'Town & Gown' |last = Davies |first = Mark |publisher = BBC |date = 4 November 2010 |website = BBC News |access-date= 3 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvScOaG7mHYC|title=A Concise History of the University of Cambridge|last=Leedham-Green|first=Elisabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|page=3|isbn=978-0-521-43978-7|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> In order to claim precedence, it is common for Cambridge to trace its founding to the 1231 charter from [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]] granting it the right to discipline its own members (''ius non-trahi extra'') and an exemption from some taxes; Oxford was not granted similar rights until 1248.<ref>{{cite web |work=British History Timeline |title=Middle Ages |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/middleages_timeline_noflash.shtml |publisher=BBC |access-date=7 September 2013 }}</ref>

A [[Papal bull|bull]] in 1233 from [[Pope Gregory IX]] gave graduates from Cambridge the right to teach "everywhere in [[Christendom]]".<ref>{{Cite book|first=Hilde|last=de Ridder-Symoens|title=A History of the University in Europe: Universities in the Middle Ages|volume=1|year=2003|editor=Cambridge University Press|page=89|isbn=978-0-521-54113-8}}</ref> After Cambridge was described as a ''[[studium generale]]'' in a letter from [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1290,<ref name=Hackett>{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=M.B.|title=The original statutes of Cambridge University: The text and its history|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1970|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7og8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA178|access-date=2 September 2012|isbn=978-0-521-07076-8}}</ref> and confirmed as such in a [[papal bull|bull]] by [[Pope John XXII]] in 1318,<ref>{{cite journal|author-link=David Willey (journalist)|first=David|last=Willey|title=Vatican reveals Cambridge papers|journal=Cam|volume=66|date=2012|page=5}}</ref> it became common for researchers from other European [[medieval universities]] to visit Cambridge to study or to give lecture courses.<ref name=Hackett />

===Foundation of the colleges===
The [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|colleges]] at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the system. No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some traces, such as the name of Garret Hostel Lane.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Charles Henry|last=Cooper|title=Memorials of Cambridge|volume=1|publisher=W. Metcalfe|year=1860|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bQWAAAAIAAJ|access-date=9 September 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Peterhouse_Chapel.jpg|thumb|[[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]], Cambridge's first college, was founded in 1284]] 
[[Hugh Balsham]], [[Bishop of Ely]], founded [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]], Cambridge's first college, in 1284. Many colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, but colleges continued to be established until modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]] in 1596 and that of [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing]] in 1800. The most recently established college is [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson]], built in the late 1970s. However, [[Homerton College, Cambridge|Homerton College]] only achieved full university college status in March 2010, making it the newest full college (it was previously an "Approved Society" affiliated with the university).

In [[medieval]] times, many colleges were founded so that their members would [[Prayer|pray]] for the [[soul]]s of the founders, and were often associated with chapels or [[abbey]]s. The colleges' focus changed in 1536 with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered the university to disband its Faculty of [[Canon Law]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Helmholtz|first=R.H.|year=1990|title=Roman Canon Law in Reformation England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|series=Cambridge Studies in English Legal History|pages=35,153|isbn=978-0-521-38191-8}}</ref> and to stop teaching "[[scholastic philosophy]]". In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law, and towards the [[classics]], the Bible, and mathematics.

Nearly a century later, the university was at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals and even commoners saw the ways of the [[Church of England]] as too similar to the Catholic Church, and felt that it was used by the Crown to usurp the rightful powers of the counties. [[East Anglia]] was the centre of what became the [[Puritan]] movement. In Cambridge, the movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine's Hall, Sidney Sussex and [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]].<ref>Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629–1640, Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994, 19.</ref> They produced many "non-conformist" graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who left for [[New England]] and especially the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]] decade of the 1630s. [[Oliver Cromwell]], Parliamentary commander during the English Civil War and head of the English Commonwealth (1649–1660), attended [[Sidney Sussex]].

===Mathematics and mathematical physics===
[[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Examination in mathematics]] was once compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the main first degree at Cambridge in both arts and sciences. From the time of [[Isaac Newton]] in the later 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on [[applied mathematics]], particularly [[mathematical physics]]. The exam is known as a [[Tripos]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=A. R.|last=Forsyth|title=Old Tripos days at Cambridge|year=1935|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|volume=19|issue=234|pages=162–179|jstor=3605871|doi=10.2307/3605871}}</ref> Students awarded [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] after completing the mathematics Tripos are termed [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]], and the top student among them is the [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]]. The [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] is competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/about/history/|title=The History of Mathematics in Cambridge|publisher=Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|access-date=9 September 2012}}</ref> However, some famous students, such as [[G. H. Hardy]], disliked the system, feeling that people were too interested in accumulating marks in exams and not interested in the subject itself.

Pure mathematics at Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, but also missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. Pure mathematical research at Cambridge finally reached the highest international standard in the early 20th century, thanks above all to G. H. Hardy, his collaborator [[J. E. Littlewood]] and [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. In geometry, [[W. V. D. Hodge]] brought Cambridge onto the international mainstream in the 1930s.

Although diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. Cambridge alumni have won six [[Fields Medal]]s and one [[Abel Prize]] for mathematics, while individuals representing Cambridge have won four Fields Medals.<ref>The six alumni are [[Michael Atiyah]] (Abel Prize and Fields Medal), [[Enrico Bombieri]], [[Simon Donaldson]], [[Richard Borcherds]], [[Timothy Gowers]], [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] and the four official representatives were [[John G. Thompson]], [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]], [[Richard Borcherds]], [[Timothy Gowers]] (see also {{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FieldsMedal.html|title=Fields Medal|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|access-date=3 December 2009}})</ref>

===Modern period===
[[File:Selwyn_College_Old_Court,_Cambridge,_UK_-_Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College]] was founded in 1882]]
After the [[Cambridge University Act 1856]] formalised the organisational structure of the university, the study of many new subjects was introduced, such as theology, history and [[modern languages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/19-20/88/contents|title=Cambridge University Act 1856|editor=The National Archives|access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref> Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture and [[archeology|archaeology]] were donated by [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam|Viscount Fitzwilliam]], of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], who also founded the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/hiddenhistories/biographies/bio/love/fitzwilliam_biography.html|title=Biography – The Hon.

Albert used his position as Chancellor to campaign successfully for reformed and more modern university curricula, expanding the subjects taught beyond the traditional mathematics and classics to include modern history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]] sold part of its land to build the ''[[Downing Site]]'', with new scientific laboratories for [[anatomy]], [[genetics]] and [[Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge|Earth sciences]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1994|p=22}}</ref> During the same period, the ''[[New Museums Site]]'' was erected, including the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], which has since moved to the [[West Cambridge Site]], and other [[Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge|departments for chemistry]] and medicine.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Cambridge University Physics Society|title=A Hundred Years and More of Cambridge Physics|editor=Cambridge University Physics Society|year=1995|isbn=978-0-9507343-1-6}}</ref>

The University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century. The first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.<ref>John Aldrich – [http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/Doc1.htm "The Maths PhD in the UK: Notes on its History – Economics"]</ref>

In the [[First World War]], 13,878 members of the university served and 2,470 were killed. Teaching, and the fees it earned, came almost to a stop and severe financial difficulties followed. As a consequence the university first received systematic state support in 1919, and a [[Royal Commission]] appointed in 1920 recommended that the university (but not the colleges) should receive an annual grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=The Revived University of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|editor=University of Cambridge|access-date=7 August 2014|date=28 January 2013}}</ref> Following the [[Second World War]], the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places; this was partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/post1945.html|title=A Brief History: The University after 1945|publisher=University of Cambridge|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804082343/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/post1945.html|archive-date=4 August 2008|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>

====Parliamentary representation====
{{Main|University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)}}

The university was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the [[Parliament of England]] and was later one of eight represented in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The constituency was created by a [[Royal Charter]] of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950, when it was abolished by the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].

The constituency was not a geographical area. Its electorate consisted of the graduates of the university. Before 1918 the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree.

===Women's education===
[[File:Cambridge Newnham.JPG|thumb|[[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] is one of two existing women's colleges]]
For its first several centuries only male students were enrolled into the university. The first colleges for women were [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] (founded by [[Emily Davies]]) in 1869 and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in 1872 (founded by [[Anne Clough]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), followed by [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]] in 1885 (founded by [[Elizabeth Phillips Hughes]] as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women), [[Murray Edwards College]] (founded by [[Rosemary Murray]] as [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]]) in 1954, and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish College]] in 1965. The first women students were examined in 1882 but attempts to make women full members of the university did not succeed until 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chambers|first=Suzanna|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/at-last-a-degree-of-honour-for-900-cambridge-women-1157056.html|title=At last, a degree of honour for 900 Cambridge women|work=[[The Independent]]|date=31 May 1998|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> Women were allowed to study courses, sit examinations, and have their results recorded from 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the twentieth century, this allowed the "[[steamboat ladies]]" to receive ''[[ad eundem gradum|ad eundem]]'' degrees from the [[University of Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trinitynews.ie/trinity-halls-steamboat-ladies/|title=Trinity Hall's Steamboat Ladies|publisher=Trinity news|date=14 March 2012|access-date=9 September 2012}}</ref>

From 1921 women were awarded diplomas which "conferred the Title of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts". As they were not "admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts" they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], the first wholly graduate college of the university, matriculated both men and women students from its inception in 1964 – and elected a mixed fellowship. Of the undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare and King's Colleges, the former men's colleges began to admit women between 1972 and 1988. One of the female-only colleges, Girton, also began to admit male students from 1979, but the other female-only colleges did not do likewise. As a result of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]], ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining United Kingdom university with female-only colleges (Newnham and Murray Edwards).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1520628/St-Hilda%27s-to-end-113-year-ban-on-male-students.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202175950/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1520628/St-Hilda%27s-to-end-113-year-ban-on-male-students.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 December 2008|title=St Hilda's to end 113-year ban on male students|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |access-date=8 September 2008 | first=Nicole | last=Martin | date=8 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |title=Single-sex colleges: a dying breed? |publisher=HERO |date=June 2007 |access-date=20 April 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612072113/http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |archive-date = 12 June 2008}}</ref> In the academic year 2004–5, the university's student sex ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/special/19/|title=Special No 19|work=Cambridge University Reporter|access-date=8 September 2008}}</ref>

===Myths, legends and traditions===
[[File:Queens'_College_-_Mathematical_Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Mathematical Bridge]] over the River Cam (at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]])]]
{{main|University of Cambridge legends}} {{see also|Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge}}
As an institution with such a long history, the university has developed a large number of myths and legends. The vast majority of these are untrue, but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.

A discontinued tradition is that of the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]], the 'prize' awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit. This made it harder to ascertain who was "entitled" to the spoon (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.

Each Christmas Eve, BBC radio and television broadcasts [[Nine Lessons and Carols|The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]] sung by the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]]. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas tradition since it was first transmitted in 1928 (though the festival has existed since 1918). The radio broadcast is carried worldwide by the [[BBC World Service]] and is also syndicated to hundreds of radio stations in the US. The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|title=Choir that sings to the world|publisher=BBC |access-date=8 September 2008 | date=24 December 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6840413/Carols-from-Kings-Cambridge-prepares-for-Christmas.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 December 2009|title=Carols from King's: Cambridge prepares for Christmas|first=Elizabeth|last=Baxter}}</ref>

The university occupies a central location within the city of [[Cambridge]], with the students taking up a significant proportion (nearly 20%) of the town's population and heavily affecting the age structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/3B0B3A7B-E448-4D61-A853-0B5A1A467969/0/CambridgeCityDistrictReport2011.pdf|title=Cambridge City: Annual demographic and socio-economic report|publisher=Cambridgeshire County Council|access-date=4 September 2012|date=April 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828063418/http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/3B0B3A7B-E448-4D61-A853-0B5A1A467969/0/CambridgeCityDistrictReport2011.pdf | archive-date=28 August 2013}}</ref> Most of the older colleges are situated nearby the city centre and [[river Cam]], along which it is traditional to [[Punt (boat)|punt]] to appreciate the buildings and surroundings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgerivertour.co.uk/history.php|title=A brief history of Punting|publisher=Cambridge River Tour|access-date=4 September 2012}}</ref>

The university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] where students in medicine undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html|title=School of Clinical Medicine: History of the School|publisher=University of Cambridge|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209023135/http://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html|archive-date=9 December 2012|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> while the West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host a new sports development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v4/drawmap.cgi?mp=main;xx=400;yy=480;sx=4;;tl=West%20Cambridge%20Site |title=West Cambridge site |publisher=University of Cambridge |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184712/http://www.cam.ac.uk///map/v4/drawmap.cgi?mp=main%3Bxx%3D400%3Byy%3D480%3Bsx%3D4%3B%3Btl%3DWest%20Cambridge%20Site |archive-date=13 March 2012 |access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> In addition, the [[Judge Business School]], situated on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses since 1990 and is consistently ranked within the top 20 business schools globally by the [[Financial Times]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/university-of-cambridge-judge|title=Business school rankings: University of Cambridge, Judge Business School|work=[[Financial Times]]|access-date=3 January 2013}}</ref>

Given that the sites are in relative close proximity to each other and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle: a fifth of the journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits, except under special circumstances.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Laker|first=Laura|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2011/aug/17/cambridge-model-cycling-city|title=What makes Cambridge a model cycling city?|work=The Guardian|date=17 August 2011|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>

==='Town and gown'===
{{Main|Town and gown}}
The relationship between the university and the city has not always been positive. The phrase ''town and gown'' is employed to differentiate inhabitants of Cambridge from students at the university, who historically wore [[academic dress|academical dress]]. There are many stories of ferocious rivalry between the two categories. During the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, strong clashes brought about attacks and [[looting]] of university properties while locals contested the privileges granted by the government to the academic staff, the university's ledgers being burned in [[Market Hill, Cambridge|Market Square]] to the rallying cry [["Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!"]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Crisis of Truth: Literature and Law in Ricardian England.|last=Firth Green|first=Richard|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8122-1809-1|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> Following these events, the Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute the criminals and re-establish order in the city. Attempts to reconcile the two groups followed over time, and in the 16th century agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the [[plague (disease)|plague]] hit Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to help those affected by the disease by locking their sites.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Shepard|first1=Alexandra|last2=Phil |first2=Withington|title=Communities in Early Modern England: Networks, Place, Rhetoric|editor=Manchester University Press|year=2000|pages=216–234|isbn=978-0-7190-5477-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLkULGOljPsC|access-date=4 September 2012}}</ref>

Nowadays, these conflicts have somewhat subsided and the university has become an opportunity for employment among the population, providing an increased level of wealth in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bringham|first=Allan|url=http://www.colc.co.uk/cambridge/tours/article2.htm|title=Is Town v Gown a thing of the past?|date=7 October 2008|newspaper=[[Cambridge Evening News]]|via=Cambridge Online|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> The enormous growth in the number of [[high-tech]], [[biotech]], providers of services and related firms situated near Cambridge has been termed the ''Cambridge Phenomenon'': the addition of 1,500 new, registered companies and as many as 40,000 jobs between 1960 and 2010 has been directly related to the presence of the university as a source of employment for Cambridge residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgephenomenon.com/what-phenomenon/|title=What is the Cambridge Phenomenon?|publisher=Cambridge Phenomenon|access-date=4 September 2012}}</ref>

==Organisation and administration==
{{see also|List of Institutions of the University of Cambridge}}
[[File:Cam colls from johns.jpg|thumb|right|View over [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] towards [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] Chapel, seen from [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] chapel whereas on the left, just in front of King's College chapel, is the university [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]]]]

Cambridge is a [[collegiate university]], meaning that it is made up of self-governing and independent colleges, each with its own property and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines, and within each faculty, school or department within the university, academics from many different colleges are present.

The faculties are responsible for ensuring that lectures are given, arranging seminars, performing research and determining the syllabi for teaching, overseen by the General Board. Together with the central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], they make up the entire Cambridge University. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the university (the [[Cambridge University Library]]), by the Faculties (Faculty libraries such as the Squire Law Library), and by the individual colleges (all of which maintain a multi-discipline library, generally aimed mainly at their undergraduates).

Legally, the university is an [[exempt charity]] and a common law [[corporation]] with the corporate title "The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-03-21 |title=The University as a charity |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/the-university-as-a-charity |access-date=2021-04-12 |website=University of Cambridge |language=en}}</ref>

===Colleges===
{{main|Colleges of the University of Cambridge}}

The colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisions—small-group teaching sessions, often with just one student—within the colleges (though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in the areas concerned). Each college appoints its own teaching staff and [[fellow]]s, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.

Cambridge has 31 colleges, of which two, [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]], admit women only. The other colleges are [[Mixed-sex education|mixed]], though most were originally all-male. [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin]] was the first college to admit both men and women, while [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]], [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare]], and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates, in 1972. [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]] became the last all-male college to accept women, in 1988.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,976477,00.html | title = Obituary – Professor Sir Bernard Williams|work=The Guardian |location=UK | access-date =8 May 2009 | date = 13 June 2003 | first=Jane | last=O'Grady}}</ref> Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]], [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge|St Edmund's]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson]] admit only [[mature student|mature]] (i.e. 21 years or older on date of [[matriculation]]) students, encompassing both undergraduate and graduate students. [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]], which was previously a women-only mature college, announced that they would admit men and women from the age of 18 from 2021 onwards.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Bayliss |first=Chloe |url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/17319 |title=Lucy Cavendish to become mixed-gender college, admitting students from age 18 |newspaper=[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]] |publisher=<!--Varsity Publications Ltd (omitted as substantially similar to newspaper name)--> |location=Cambridge, UK |date=11 March 2019 |access-date=22 December 2020}}</ref> All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students with no age restrictions.

Colleges are not required to admit students in all subjects, with some colleges choosing not to offer subjects such as architecture, history of art or theology, but most offer close to the complete range. Some colleges maintain a bias towards certain subjects, for example with [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]] leaning towards the sciences and engineering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/the_college/info/|title=Information about Churchill College|publisher=Churchill College|access-date=7 January 2008}}</ref> while others such as [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's]] aim for a balanced intake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/stcatharines/|title=About St. Catharine's College|access-date=8 September 2008|publisher=University of Cambridge}}</ref> Others maintain much more informal reputations, such as for the students of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] to hold left-wing political views,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/prospective/prospectus/alternativeprospectus.pdf |title=Alternative Prospectus|publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union|access-date=8 September 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327202836/http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/prospective/prospectus/alternativeprospectus.pdf | archive-date=27 March 2009}}</ref> or [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson]]'s and [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]]'s attempts to minimise their environmental impact.<ref>{{cite news|last=Drage|first=Mark|url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuecs/current_projects/LT/downloads/07-08/VARSITY_LTarticle08.JPG|title=Survey ranks colleges by green credentials|date=7 March 2008|newspaper=[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910064557/http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuecs/current_projects/LT/downloads/07-08/VARSITY_LTarticle08.JPG|archive-date=10 September 2008|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>

There are also several theological colleges in Cambridge, separate from Cambridge University, including [[Westcott House, Cambridge|Westcott House]], [[Westminster College, Cambridge|Westminster College]] and [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge|Ridley Hall Theological College]], that are, to a lesser degree, affiliated to the university and are members of the [[Cambridge Theological Federation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westcott.cam.ac.uk/about/partners.html |title=Westcott House – Partner Universities |publisher=Westcott.cam.ac.uk |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>

In addition to the 31 colleges, the university is made up of over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates and other institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/colleges-and-departments|title= Cambridge – Colleges and departments|access-date=27 November 2013|publisher= University of Cambridge|date= 24 January 2013}}</ref> Members of these are usually also members of one of the colleges and responsibility for running the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.

The university also has a department dedicated to providing [[continuing education]], the [[Institute of Continuing Education]], which is primarily based in [[Madingley Hall]], a 16th-century manor house in [[Cambridgeshire]]. Its award-bearing programmes range from Undergraduate Certificates through to part-time master's degrees.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ireland|first=Paul|date=2016-06-29|title=Personal enrichment|url=https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/why-cambridge/personal-enrichment|access-date=2021-10-05|website=www.ice.cam.ac.uk|language=en}}</ref>

A "School" in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body—the "Council" of the school—comprising representatives of the constituent bodies. There are six schools:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/deptdirectory/moreinfo.html|title=About the Schools, Faculties & Departments|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref>

Teaching and research in Cambridge is organised by faculties. The faculties have different organisational sub-structures which partly reflect their history and partly their operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. In addition, a small number of bodies called 'Syndicates' have responsibilities for teaching and research, e.g. [[UCLES|Cambridge Assessment]], the [[Cambridge University Press|University Press]], and the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]].

{{see also|List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge}}
The office of [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor]] of the university, for which there are no term limits, is mainly ceremonial and is held by [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville]], following the retirement of the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the official Nomination Board to succeed him,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2011051901 |title=Home – News – University of Cambridge |publisher=Admin.cam.ac.uk |access-date=4 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626082048/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2011051901 |archive-date=26 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and Abdul Arain, owner of a local grocery store, [[Brian Blessed]] and [[Michael Mansfield]] were also nominated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cambridgetab.co.uk/news/booming-blessed-to-bloom-as-chancellor |title=Update: Booming Blessed To Bloom As Chancellor?

The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by its own members,<ref>''Statute and Ordinances'', Historical Note: "The University is&nbsp;... consisting of a Chancellor, Masters and Scholars who from time out of mind have had the government of their members"</ref> with very little external representation on its governing body, the Regent House (though there is external representation on the Audit Committee, and there are four external members on the [[Cambridge University Council|University's Council]], who are the only external members of the Regent House).<ref>Grace 2 5 December 2007</ref>

====Senate and the Regent House====

[[File:20130808_Castle_End_from_Kings_Bridge.jpg|thumb|Old Court, [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]]]]
The Senate consists of all holders of the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree or higher degrees. It elects the Chancellor and the High Steward, and elected two members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] until the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]] was abolished in 1950. Prior to 1926, it was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that the [[Regent House]] fulfils today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/senate.html|title=How the University works: The Senate|publisher=University of Cambridge|date=20 June 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217095022/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/senate.html|archive-date=17 February 2013|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> The Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, together with the Chancellor, the [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]], the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.<ref>Statutes and Ordinances, 2007–2008</ref> The public representatives of the Regent House are the two [[Proctor]]s, elected to serve for one year, on the nomination of the Colleges.

====Council and the General Board====
Although the [[Cambridge University Council|University Council]] is the principal executive and policy-making body of the university, it must report and be accountable to the [[Regent House]] through a variety of checks and balances. It has the right of reporting to the university, and is obliged to advise the Regent House on matters of general concern to the university. It does both of these by causing notices to be published by authority in the ''[[Cambridge University Reporter]]'', the official journal of the university. Since January 2005, the membership of the council has included two external members,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/weekly/5984/1.html|title=Annual Report of the Council for 2003–04|work=Cambridge University Reporter|date=15 December 2004|access-date=8 September 2008}}</ref> and the Regent House voted for an increase from two to four in the number of external members in March 2008,<ref>Grace 2 5 December 2008</ref><ref>Acta in the ''Reporter'', No 6107, publishing Results of Ballot</ref> and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2007-08/weekly/6119/2.html|title=Statutes approved: Notice|work=Cambridge University Reporter|date=23 July 2008|access-date=8 September 2008}}</ref>

Faculty Boards are responsible to the General Board; other Boards and Syndicates are responsible either to the General Board (if primarily for academic purposes) or to the council. In this way, the various arms of the university are kept under the supervision of the central administration, and thus the Regent House.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

===Finances===

====Benefactions and fundraising====
In 2000, [[Bill Gates]] of [[Microsoft]] donated US$210&nbsp;million through the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] to endow the [[Gates Scholarships]] for students from outside the UK seeking postgraduate study at Cambridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatescambridge.org/programme|title=The programme|last=jim.smith|date=16 August 2018|website=Gates Cambridge|language=en|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>

In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, had a total income of £2.192&nbsp;billion, of which £592.4&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts.<ref name="cam.ac.uk"/>

Over the past decade to 2019, Cambridge has received an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.<ref name="cam.ac.uk"/>

The '[[Stormzy]] Scholarship for Black UK Students' covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-16|title=Stormzy announces second year of 'The Stormzy Scholarship', a student funding scheme with Cambridge University|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/stormzy-announces-second-year-of-the-stormzy-scholarship-a-student-funding-scheme-with-cambridge|access-date=2021-01-24|website=University of Cambridge|language=en}}</ref>

In October 2021, the University paused the £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing the claims of the Arab nation’s involvement in the controversial hacking using the [[NSO Group]]'s [[Pegasus (spyware)|Pegasus]] software. As per the reports, the Emirates was the major country involved in the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to the British. The University’s outgoing Vice-Chancellor, [[Stephen Toope]] said the decision to reconsider plans with the UAE was caused by further revelations about the Pegasus software hacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/14/cambridge-university-halts-400m-deal-with-uae-over-pegasus-spyware-claims|title=Cambridge University halts £400m deal with UAE over Pegasus spyware claims|accessdate=14 October 2021|website=The Guardian|date=14 October 2021}}</ref>

====Bonds====
The University of Cambridge borrowed £350&nbsp;million by issuing a 40-year security bond in October 2012.<ref name=CN2012oct11ib>[http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/news/0019543-cambridge-issues-its-first-350m-bond.html Cambridge university issues its first £350m bond] L. Tidy, The Cambridge Student, News, 11 October 2012</ref> Its interest rate is about 0.6 percent higher than a British government 40-year bond. Vice-Chancellor [[Leszek Borysiewicz]] hailed the success of the issue.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/cambridge-university-issues-first-bond Cambridge university issues first bond] G.

====Procedure====
Undergraduate applications to Cambridge must be made through [[UCAS]] in time for the early deadline, currently mid-October in the year before starting. Until the 1980s candidates for all subjects were required to sit special entrance examinations,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms8OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA202 |page=202 |title=Life in Public Schools |last=Walford |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-416-37180-2 |access-date=2 February 2009 |first=Geoffrey}}</ref> since replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and the Cambridge Law Test.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/tests/ | title = Undergraduate Study – Admissions tests | publisher = University of Cambridge | access-date = 20 May 2013}}</ref> The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9828740/Cambridge-University-entrance-exam-to-make-a-comeback.html | title = Cambridge University entrance exam to make a comeback | last=Henry|first=Julie| newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 23 January 2013}}</ref> The university gave offers of admission (typically conditional on exam results) to 33.5% of its applicants in 2016, the 2nd lowest amongst the [[Russell Group]], behind Oxford (an effect of Cambridge's average offer conditions being higher than that of Oxford).<ref>{{Cite web|title=What are my chances of getting into Oxford or Cambridge?|url=https://oxbridgeapplications.com/blog/what-are-my-chances-of-getting-into-oxford-or-cambridge/|access-date=2021-03-03|website=Oxbridge Applications|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Which elite universities have the highest offer rates |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/10/19/which-elite-universities-have-the-highest-offer-rates/|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2016|date=19 October 2016|last1=Gurney-Read|first1=Josie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bonetti|first=Lisa|date=2020-08-25|title=Exam results: What next?|url=https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/exam-results-what-next|access-date=2021-03-03|website=www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Cole|first=Lizzy|date=2019-04-15|title=Oxford vs Cambridge: Which is better?|url=https://www.uniadmissions.co.uk/oxford-vs-cambridge/|access-date=2021-03-03|website=UniAdmissions: The Oxbridge Experts|language=en-GB}}</ref> The acceptance rate for students in the 2018–2019 cycle was 18.8%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics|title=Application statistics|website=www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/files/publications/ug_admissions_statistics_2018_cycle.pdf |title=Undergraduate Admissions Statistics |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=25 August 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2021, Cambridge introduced an 'over-subscription' clause to its offers, which allows it to withdraw places if too many students meet its entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of 'circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university'. It was introduced due to a record number of [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] pupils getting the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] in the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Yeomans|first=Emma|date=|title=Cambridge to withdraw places if oversubscribed|language=en|work=[[The Times]]|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cambridge-to-withdraw-places-if-oversubscribed-xzx2jttw2|access-date=2021-02-05|issn=0140-0460}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-03|title=Cambridge offer-holders told their places may be withdrawn if their course is over-subscribed|url=https://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2021/02/03/cambridge-to-withdraw-offers-145887|access-date=2021-02-05|website=University of Cambridge|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Most applicants who are called for interview will have been predicted at least three A-grade [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or the equivalent in other qualifications, such as getting at least 7,7,6 for higher-level subjects at [[International Baccalaureate|IB]]. The A* A-level grade (introduced in 2010) now plays a part in the acceptance of applications, with the university's standard offer for most courses being set at A*AA,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/#alevels |title=Entrance requirements |publisher=Cam.ac.uk |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7946675.stm|title=Cambridge entry level is now A*AA|work=BBC News | date=16 March 2009 | access-date=27 May 2010}}</ref> with A*A*A for sciences courses. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, the interview process is needed for distinguishing between the most able candidates. The interview is performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity.<ref name="intguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/publications/interviews.pdf |title=Cambridge Interviews: the facts|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=11 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218144807/http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/publications/interviews.pdf | archive-date=18 February 2011}}</ref> For exceptional candidates, a ''Matriculation Offer'' was sometimes previously offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. In 2006, 5,228 students who were rejected went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 63% of all applicants rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/11/table3_1.pdf|title=Special No 11|work=Cambridge University Reporter|access-date=8 September 2008}}</ref> The [[Sutton Trust]] maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46470838 Oxbridge 'over-recruits from eight schools'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

Strong applicants who are not successful at their chosen college may be placed in the [[Winter Pool]], where they can be offered places by other colleges. This is in order to maintain consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.

Graduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department relating to the applicant's subject. When an offer is made, this effectively guarantees admission to a college—though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/next.html|title=Board of Graduate Studies admissions flowchart|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=8 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908011440/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/next.html|archive-date=8 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Public debate in the United Kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from [[State school#United Kingdom|state schools]] are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry.

Critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on [[Oxbridge]]'s reputation for many years, and the university has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for Cambridge to help redress the imbalance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/apr/04/highereducation.accesstouniversity|title=Number of Cambridge state school students falls|work=The Guardian|date=4 April 2008|access-date=3 September 2012}}</ref> Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf|title=Report by the Sutton Trust|publisher=Sutton Trust|access-date=8 September 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211305/http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf |archive-date = 24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-113479553|title=A bias against excellence|work=The Spectator |location=UK |access-date=8 September 2008 | first=Rachel | last=Johnson | year=2002 }}</ref> The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, and such applicants now form a (very large) minority (43%)<ref name="bbc08" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7036891.stm|title=Call for more university links|publisher=BBC |access-date=8 September 2008 | date=10 October 2007}}</ref> of the intake.

With the release of admissions figures, a 2013 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was hence criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination by stating the figures did not take into account "other variables".<ref name="Guardian20130226">{{cite news

|title=Cambridge University medicine admissions show race gap
|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/13/cambridge-university-medicine-admissions-race}}</ref>

There are a number of educational consultancies that offer support with the applications process. Some make claims of improved chances of admission but these claims are not independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated to or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all important information regarding the application process is public knowledge and none of these services is providing any inside information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/applying/interviews|title=Interviews|first=Lisa|last=Bonetti|date=21 February 2018|website=Undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref>

Cambridge University has been criticised because many colleges admit a low proportion of black students though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge 6 admitted fewer than 10 black or mixed race students from 2012 to 2016.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/03/cambridge-colleges-poor-record-on-diversity-highlighted-by-report Cambridge University's poor diversity record highlighted by report] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> Figures from 2019 show that 2% of students were white and 'working class'.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2019-02-14|title=Half of universities have fewer than 5% poor white students|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-47227157|access-date=2021-02-08}}</ref>

===Teaching===
[[File:Mathmo results.jpg|thumb|upright|Results for the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] are read out inside [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]] and then tossed from the balcony]]
The academic year is divided into three academic terms, determined by the statutes of the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Cambridge Term dates |work=University of Cambridge |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/termdates.html |access-date=19 April 2010 }}</ref> [[Michaelmas term]] lasts from October to December; [[Lent term]] from January to March; and [[Easter term]] from April to June.

Within these terms undergraduate teaching takes place within eight-week periods called [[Full Term]]s. According to the university statutes, it is a requirement that during this period all students should live within 3 miles of the [[Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge|Church of St Mary the Great]]; this is defined as ''Keeping term''. Students can graduate only if they fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) when obtaining a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when studying for a [[Master's degree|Master]] of Science, Engineering or Mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge 2009|editor=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2009|author=University of Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSi0S7aH320C|access-date=2 September 2012|pages=179–180|isbn=978-0-521-13745-4}}</ref>

These terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hepi.ac.uk/downloads/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325200828/http://www.hepi.ac.uk/downloads/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf | archive-date=25 March 2009 |title=The Academic Experience of Students in English Universities (2007 report) | publisher=Higher Education Policy Institute|last1=Sastry |first1=Tom|last2=Bekhradnia|first2=Bahram |date=25 September 2007|pages=footnote 14|access-date=4 November 2007|quote=Even within Russell Group institutions, it is remarkable how consistently Oxford and Cambridge appear to require more effort of their students than other universities. On the other hand, they have fewer weeks in the academic year than other universities, so the extent to which this is so may be exaggerated by these results.}}</ref> Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter and Long Vacations).

[[Tripos]]es involve a mixture of lectures (organised by the university departments), and [[Supervision system|supervisions]] (organised by the colleges). Science subjects also involve laboratory sessions, organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students (usually between one and three) meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of the supervision, which they will discuss with the supervisor during the session, along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week's lectures. The assignment is often an essay on a subject set by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students might receive between one and four supervisions per week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/teaching.html|title=Undergraduate Study – How will I be taught|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=9 September 2012}}</ref> This [[Tutorial system|pedagogical system]] is often cited as being unique to Oxford (where "supervisions" are known as "[[tutorial]]s")<ref>{{cite news|last=Shepherd|first=Jessica|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/25/cambridge-may-end-individual-tuition|title=Cambridge considers end to one-to-one tuition|work=The Guardian|date=25 January 2011|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> and Cambridge.

===Research===
{{see also|Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge}}
The University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines. All research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are in charge of giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues on a number of sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.em.admin.cam.ac.uk/what-we-do/development-estate/building-projects|title=Building Projects|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=26 January 2018|date=2015-04-07}}</ref>

Cambridge also has a research partnership with [[MIT]] in the United States: the [[Cambridge–MIT Institute]].

===Graduation===
[[File:Cambridge University graduation enter Senate House.jpg|thumb|left|Graduands enter the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]] at a graduation ceremony]]
Unlike in most universities, the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Cambridge Master of Arts]] is not awarded by merit of study, but by right, six years and one term after matriculation.

At the University of Cambridge, each graduation is a separate act of the university's governing body, the [[Regent House]], and must be voted on as with any other act. A formal meeting of the Regent House, known as a [[Congregation (university)|''Congregation'']], is held for this purpose.<ref name=Ceremony>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/students/studentregistry/current/newstud/graduation/ceremony.html|title=Graduation: The Ceremony|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=3 September 2012}}</ref>
This is the common last act at which all the different university procedures (for: undergraduate and graduate students; and the different degrees) land. After degrees are approved, to have them conferred candidates must ask their Colleges to be presented during a Congregation.

[[File:Cam degree ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|upright|University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into the Senate House]]
Graduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|academic dress]] that they were entitled to before graduating: for example, most students becoming Bachelors of Arts wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a postgraduate degree (e.g. PhD or Master's) wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating, only if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree is from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive, the BA gown without the strings if they are under 24 years of age, or the MA gown without strings if they are 24 and over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/current-students/graduation/dress-code/|title=Graduation dress code|publisher=[[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]]|access-date=3 September 2012}}</ref> Graduates are presented in the Senate House college by college, in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the royal colleges.

During the congregation, graduands are brought forth by the [[Praelector]] of their college, who takes them by the right hand, and presents them to the vice-chancellor for the degree they are about to take. The Praelector presents graduands with the following [[Latin]] statement (the following forms were used when the vice-chancellor was female), substituting "____" with the name of the degree:

{{Quotation|"{{lang|la|Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum _____; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.}}

(Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.)"

and female graduands with the following:

"{{lang|la|Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hanc mulierem quam scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneam ad gradum assequendum ____; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.}}

(Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this woman whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.)"

After presentation, the graduand is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement—the [[Trinitarian formula]] ({{lang|la|in nomine Patris}}...) may be omitted at the request of the graduand:

"{{lang|la|Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum ____, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.}}

(By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of ____, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.)"}}

The now-graduate then rises, bows and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door, where he or she receives his or her certificate, into [[Senate House Passage]].<ref name=Ceremony/>

===Student Unions===
{{Main|Cambridge Students' Union}}
All students at the University of Cambridge are represented by [[Cambridge Students' Union]]. The SU was founded in 2020 as a merger of two existing Student Unions in Cambridge: CUSU (the Cambridge University Students‘ Union) and the GU (the Graduate Union). CUSU previously represented all University students, and the GU solely represented graduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gradunion.cam.ac.uk/|publisher=Cambridge University Graduate Union|access-date=4 July 2018|title=Graduate Union}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/union/|title=About the Union|publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union|date=27 June 2012|access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref>

The eight most important positions in the SU are occupied by [[sabbatical officer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridgesu.co.uk/yourunion/officers/|title=Officers|publisher=Cambridge Students' Union|date=1 July 2021|access-date=9 September 2021}}</ref> In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.<ref>{{cite web|last= Bayliss, Killeen & Lally |first=Chloe, Molly & Catherine|title=Live: Cambridge SU election results

In 2021, Cambridge Students' Union started a petition against the financial collaboration between the university and the government of the United Arab Emirates worth £400m. The Union cited the cause of the petition as the warning of the "values gap" and threat to "academic freedom and institutional autonomy" reviewed in the internal documents. Citing the grave history of violating the international law of human rights, the Cambridge UCU warned of the university staff of being vulnerable to the repression of gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridgesu.co.uk/news/article/jobs/Statement-on-the-Universitys-proposed-partnership-with-the-UAE/|title=Statement on the University's proposed partnership with the UAE|access-date=6 August 2021|website=Cambridge SU}}</ref>

[[File:Cambridge boathouses - Goldie.jpg|thumb|right|The boathouse of the [[Cambridge University Boat Club]]]]

[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] is a particularly popular sport at Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges, notably the [[bumps race]]s, and against Oxford, the [[Boat Race]]. There are also [[Varsity match]]es against Oxford in many other sports, ranging from [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|cricket]] and [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|rugby]], to [[chess]] and [[tiddlywinks]]. Athletes representing the university in certain sports are entitled to apply for a [[Cambridge Blue]] at the discretion of the ''Blues Committee'', consisting of the captains of the thirteen most prestigious sports. There is also the self-described "unashamedly elite" [[Hawks' Club]], which is for men only, whose membership is usually restricted to Cambridge Full Blues and Half Blues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawksclub.co.uk/the-club/club-history.aspx|title=Origins of the Cambridge Blue|editor=Hawks' Club|access-date=4 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130420100258/http://www.hawksclub.co.uk/the-club/club-history.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Ospreys are the equivalent female club.

===Societies===
{{See also|List of social activities at the University of Cambridge|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge}}
[[File:Stephen Fry at the Cambridge Union.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stephen Fry]] in the Main Chamber of [[the Cambridge Union]]]]

Numerous student-run societies exist in order to encourage people who share a common passion or interest to periodically meet or discuss. {{as of|2010}}, there were 751 registered societies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/societies/directory/|title=Societies Directory|date=12 January 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union|access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref> In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.

Although technically independent from the university, the [[Cambridge Union]] serves as a focus for debating and public speaking, as the oldest free speech society in the world, and the largest in Cambridge. Drama societies notably include the [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club|Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC)]] and the comedy club [[Footlights]], which are known for producing well-known show-business personalities. The Cambridge University [[Chamber Orchestra]] explores a range of programmes, from popular symphonies to lesser known works; membership of the orchestra is composed of students of the university.

===Newspapers and radio===
{{see also|Category:Publications associated with the University of Cambridge}}

Cambridge's oldest student newspaper is ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''. Established in 1947, notable figures to have edited the paper include [[Jeremy Paxman]], BBC media editor [[Amol Rajan]], and Vogue international editor [[Suzy Menkes]]. It has also featured the early writings of [[Zadie Smith]] (who appeared in Varsity's literary anthology offshoot, ''[[The Mays]]''), [[Robert Webb]], [[Tristram Hunt]], and [[Tony Wilson]].

With a print run of 9,000, ''Varsity'' is the only student paper to go to print on a weekly basis. News stories from the paper have recently appeared in ''The Guardian'', ''The Times'', ''The Sunday Times'', ''The Daily Telegraph'', ''The Independent'', and ''The i''.

Other student publications include ''[[The Cambridge Student]]'', which is funded by Cambridge University Students' Union and goes to print on a fortnightly basis, and ''[[The Tab]]''. Founded by two Cambridge students in 2009, ''The Tab'' is online-only (apart from one print edition in Freshers' Week), and mostly features light-hearted features content.

''[[The Mays]]'' is a literary anthology made up of student prose, poetry, and visual art from both Cambridge and Oxford. Founded in 1992 by three Cambridge students, the anthology goes to print on an annual basis. It is overseen by Varsity Publications Ltd, the same body that is responsible for ''Varsity'', the newspaper.

There are many other journals, magazines, and zines. Another literary journal, ''Notes'', is published roughly two times per term. Many colleges also have their own publications run by students.

The student radio station, [[Cam FM]], is run together with students from Anglia Ruskin university. One of few student radio stations to have an FM licence (frequency 97.2&nbsp;MHz), the station hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.

===JCR and MCR===
[[File:Cambridge - Christ's College - 1479.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Hall at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]]]]

In addition to university-wide representation, students can benefit from their own college student unions, which are known as JCR (''[[Junior Combination Room]]'') for undergraduates and MCR (''Middle Combination Room'') for postgraduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and consists of officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to CUSU, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cusu.co.uk/communities/jcrs-mcrs/|title=JCRs/MCRs|publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref>

===Formal Halls and May Balls===
[[File:Clare Bridge, May Ball 2005.jpg|thumb|left|The bridge over the [[River Cam]] at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] during its 2005 [[May Ball]]]]

One privilege of student life at Cambridge is the opportunity to attend formal dinners at college. These are called [[Formal (university)|Formal Hall]] and occur regularly during term time. Students sit down for a meal in their [[Academic gown|gowns]], while [[Fellow]]s eat separately at ''High Table'': the beginning and end of the function is usually marked with a grace said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for events such as Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sheinman|first=Anna|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/anna-sheinman/cambridge-formals_b_1180791.html|title=Inside Cambridge: Fizz, Fellows and Formal Hall|work=Huffington Post|date=4 January 2012|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>

After the exam period, [[May Week]] is held and it is customary to celebrate by attending [[May Ball]]s. These are all-night long lavish parties held in the colleges where food and drinks are served and entertainment is provided. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] argues that some of the larger May Balls are among the best private parties in the world. ''Suicide Sunday'', the first day of May Week, is a popular date for organising [[Garden party|garden parties]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalog.group.cam.ac.uk/cambridge.html|title=Living in Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge Trainee Librarians' Online Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090224/http://www.catalog.group.cam.ac.uk/cambridge.html|archive-date=12 May 2012|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>
