'''Jeffrey Juris''' (1971 – June 18, 2020)<ref name=home/> was an American professor who taught [[anthropology]] at [[Northeastern University]]. Juris received a Ph.D. in anthropology from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].<ref>[http://www.jeffreyjuris.com/about/ "About"]. Jeffrey S. Juris. Retrieved 2016-10-27.</ref> Beyond being an educator, Juris was an author, political activist, and researcher. Juris specializes in social movements, transnational networks, new media activism, and political protests. He had a number of published books and maintained his own website, where he updated his  publications and political activism.<ref name=home>[http://www.jeffreyjuris.com/<nowiki> "Home"]. Jeffrey S. Juris. Retrieved 2016-11-19.</nowiki>]</ref> Juris was cited and referenced many times for his research on the [[Occupy movement]] and other [[anti-globalization movement]]s.

== Political activity ==

Juris was involved with the [[Occupy Boston|Boston Occupy]] on Dewey Square, both as a protester and as an academic observer.<ref>[http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/pageview/occupy-anthropology/30392<nowiki>"Occupy Anthropology – PageView - Blogs - The Chronicle of Higher Education"]. www.chronicle.com. Retrieved 2016-11-19.</nowiki>]</ref> Juris recalled seeing a large rowdy young crowd of protesters walking the streets and chanting things like 'We are the 99%' and even encouraging bystanders by calling them the 99%. He also recalled seeing police brutality against peaceful veterans who were part of the occupy movement, similar to the violence that followed the disencampment of [[Occupy Wall Street]]. In his article, "Reflections on #Occupy Everywhere", Juris asserted that websites and [[Electronic mailing list|listservs]] were a big part of the inception of Occupy, but the movement took a turn towards a more decentralized, [[social media]] led organization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Juris |first1=Jeffrey S. |title=Reflections on #Occupy Everywhere: Social media, public space, and emerging logics of aggregation: Reflections on #Occupy Everywhere |journal=American Ethnologist |date=May 2012 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=259–279 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01362.x }}</ref> He believed this was for the best as their online presence allows for the movement to maintain some sort of media influence. Juris noted that social media outlets, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], were an important part of organizing movements at the initial stages, but have since slowed their presence on internet platforms. Jeffrey also noted that the modeling of the movement was based on the structure of social media. It was no longer about getting people to join the movement, but rather to bring as many groups of people together for their unique agenda. Juris argued that new radical democracy did not depend on a consensus among everyone, but rather a respect for other people's point of view.<ref>[http://networkcultures.org/geert/inside-networked-movements-interview-with-jeffrey-juris/<nowiki> "Participatory Democracy's Moment"]. Journal of International Affairs. 68.</nowiki> Polletta, Francesca (2014)]</ref> He held the new social media platforms' call for new types of political, social, and economic organizations.<ref>[http://networkcultures.org/geert/inside-networked-movements-interview-with-jeffrey-juris/<nowiki> "Geert | Inside Networked Movements: Interview with Jeffrey Juris"]. networkcultures.org. Retrieved 2016-11-19.</nowiki>]</ref><ref>Alsayyad, Nezar (2012). "The Virtual Square". Harvard International Review.</ref>  Juris had been working on a new project that explores the topic of pirate radio in Mexico City and Beyond. This was  to be based on his 15-months of research both academically and in the field.

== Works ==

Juris was the author of ''Networking Futures: the Movements Against Corporate Globalization'',<ref>Juris, Jeffrey (2008). Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|9780822342694}}.{{pn|date=May 2021}}</ref> co-author of ''Global Democracy and the World Social Forums'',<ref>Smith, Jackie (2007). Global Democracy and the World Social Forums. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781594514210}}.{{pn|date=May 2021}}</ref> co-editor of ''Insurgent Encounters: Transnational Activism, Ethnography, and the Political'',<ref>Juris, Jeffrey (2013). Insurgent Encounters: Transnational Activism, Ethnography, and the Political. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|9780822353621}}.{{pn|date=May 2021}}</ref> and written many more articles on related topics.

His last and most popular work was ''Networking Futures'', which used extensive ethnographic research into the Barcelona-based Movement for Global Resistance.  Along with his first-hand experience, interviews with key actors, social media networking, and involvement in organizing protests, Jeffrey  formulated theories and proposals on why these movements have been successful.<ref>"Networking Futures Review"{{full|date=May 2021}}</ref>

Juris and other OWS activists created a website called Occupy Research that allows researchers to share tools and data sets for the Occupy Movement.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schuessler |first1=Jennifer |title=Academia Occupied by Occupy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/books/academia-becomes-occupied-with-occupy-movement.html |work=The New York Times |date=2012-04-30 }}</ref> The website was taken down for lack of activity, but Juris maintained the records.
