Founded by businessman and [[battery farming]] pioneer [[Antony Fisher]] in 1955, the IEA was one of the first modern think tanks,<ref name=Curtis11/> and promoted [[Thatcherite]] right-wing ideology, and free market and [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies.<ref name="Hafer92">{{cite journal |last1=Hafer |first1=R.W. |title=Monetarist Economics [Review] |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=April 1992 |volume=58 |issue=4 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |page=1131 |doi=10.2307/1060253|jstor=1060253 }}</ref> The IEA has been criticised for operating in a manner closer to that of a [[lobbying]] operation than as a genuine think tank<ref name=obs11nov18>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/11/brexit-whistleblower-shahmir-sanni-taxpayers-alliance-concedes-it-launched-smears|title=TaxPayers' Alliance concedes it launched smears against Brexit whistleblower|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|date=11 November 2018|newspaper=The Observer}}</ref> due to the overtly political nature of the organisation's campaigning, and reluctance to disclose its sources of funding.<ref name=Monbiot18Dark>{{cite news |last1=Monbiot |first1=George |title=Dark money lurks at the heart of our political crisis |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/18/dark-money-democracy-political-crisis-institute-economic-affairs |access-date=15 July 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331124846/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/18/dark-money-democracy-political-crisis-institute-economic-affairs |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=18 July 2018}}</ref>  The IEA publishes an academic journal (''Economic Affairs''), a student magazine (''EA''), books and discussion papers, and holds regular lectures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://iea.org.uk/what-we-do/|title=What we do|publisher=IEA|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref>

==History==
In 1945, [[Antony Fisher]] read an article in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' that was a summary of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' by [[Friedrich Hayek]].<ref name="ieachronology">{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/Chronology.pdf|title=IEA: Chronology|access-date=20 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609131035/http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/Chronology.pdf|archive-date=9 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Curtis11/> Later that year, Fisher visited Hayek at the London School of Economics.  Hayek dissuaded Fisher from embarking on a political and parliamentary career to try to prevent the spread of socialism and [[central planning]].<ref name="ieachronology"/> Instead, Hayek suggested the establishment of a body which could engage in research and reach the intellectuals with reasoned argument.<ref name="ieachronology"/>

In June 1955, ''The Free Convertibility of Sterling'' by George Winder was published, with Fisher signing the foreword as Director of the IEA.<ref name="ieachronology"/> In November 1955, the IEA's Original Trust Deed was signed by Fisher, John Harding and [[Oliver Smedley]]. [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]] (later Lord Harris) began work as part-time General Director in January 1957.<ref name="ieachronology"/> He was joined in 1958 by [[Arthur Seldon]] who was initially appointed Editorial Advisor and became the Editorial Director in 1959.<ref name="ieachronology"/> Smedley wrote to Fisher that it was <blockquote>"imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias. … That is why the first draft [of the IEA's aims] is written in rather cagey terms".<ref name=Curtis11>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/fdb484c8-99a1-32a3-83be-20108374b985 |title=The Curse of Tina |website=BBC |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=London |date=13 September 2011 |last=Curtis |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Curtis |access-date= 18 July 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Social Affairs Unit]] was established in December 1980 as an offshoot of the Institute of Economic Affairs to carry the IEA's economic ideas onto the battleground of sociology.<ref name=Muller/> "Within a few years the Social Affairs Unit became independent from the IEA, acquiring its own premises."<ref name=Muller>{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Christopher |title=The Institute of Economic Affairs: Undermining the Post-War Consensus |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=88–110 [p. 102] |doi=10.1080/13619469608581370 }}</ref> In 1986 the IEA created a Health and Welfare Unit to focus on these aspects of social policy.<ref name="ieachronology"/><ref name=Muller/> Discussing the IEA's increasing influence under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government in the 1980s in relation to the "advent of [[Thatcherism]]" and the privatisation of public services, Dieter Plehwe, a Research Fellow at the [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center]], has written that<blockquote>The arguably most influential think tank in British history... benefited from the close alignment of IEA's [[neoliberal]] agenda with [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]] and the priorities of the Thatcher government.<ref>Academic Identities – Academic Challenges? American and European Experience of the Transformation of Higher Education and Research, Dieter Plehwe, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011, pp. 172–3</ref></blockquote>

In 2007, British journalist [[Andrew Marr]] called the IEA "undoubtedly the most influential think tank in modern British history".<ref>{{cite episode|title=New Britannia|series=[[Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain]]|publisher=[[BBC One]]|number=5|airdate=19 June 2007}}</ref> Damien Cahill, a Professor of Political Economy at the [[University of Sydney]], has characterised the IEA as, "Britain's oldest and leading neoliberal think tank".<ref name="Cahill">[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=GKAiBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=%22Institute+of+Economic+Affairs%22,+%22neoliberal+think+tank%22&hl=ja&sa=X&ei=If52VeO2Oui5mAWj1IPQAQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Institute%20of%20Economic%20Affairs%22%2C%20%22neoliberal%20think%20tank%22&f=false The End of Laissez-Faire?: On the Durability of Embedded Neoliberalism] Damien Cahill, Edward Elgar Pub, 2014, p. 12</ref>

In October 2009, the IEA appointed Mark Littlewood as its Director General with effect from 1 December 2009.<ref name="cherwell">Robert Walmsley, [http://www.cherwell.org/comment/interviews/2014/01/25/interview-mark-littlewood Interview: Mark Littlewood], ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'', 26 January 2014</ref>

==Purpose and aims==
The IEA's director Mark Littlewood said "We want to totally reframe the debate about the proper role of the state and civil society in our country … Our true mission is to change the climate of opinion."<ref name=Monbiot18Dark/>

The IEA has written policy papers arguing against government funding for pressure groups and charities involved in political campaigning.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Snowden|first1=Christopher|title=Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/sock-puppets-how-the-government-lobbies-itself-and-why|publisher=IEA Discussion Paper 39|access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref> This does not violate rules governing funding as the IEA does not receive government funding.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Who-Funds-You-IEA.pdf|title=Who funds you? FAQ|publisher=IEA|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> As a registered charity, the IEA must abide by Charity Commission rules, that state that "an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political". In July 2018 the Charity Commission announced that it was to investigate whether the IEA had broken its rules.<ref name=Monbiot18Dark/>

The conclusion of the investigation found that one of the IEA's report on Brexit was too political; the regulator told the IEA to remove the report from its website in early November 2018, and issued an official warning in February 2019, requiring trustees to provide written assurances that the IEA would not engage in campaigning or political activity contravening legal or regulatory requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Regulator issues warning to Institute of Economic Affairs over Brexit report |last=Ricketts |first=Andy |website=ThirdSector |date=5 February 2019 |url= https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/regulator-issues-warning-institute-economic-affairs-brexit-report/governance/article/1524900}}</ref> The IEA removed the report on 19 November and said it complied with the Commission's other guidance by 23 November. IEA trustees were also required to set up a system whereby research reports and launch plans are signed off by trustees.<ref name=civil/> 

Following the IEA's compliance, the Charity Commission withdrew the official warning in June 2019. A compliance case into the IEA remained open, examining concerns about the trustees' management and oversight of the charity's activities.<ref name=civil>{{Cite web |title=Official warning to Institute of Economic Affairs is withdrawn by Charity Commission |last=Weakley |first=Kirsty |website=CIVILSOCIETY news |date=28 June 2019 |url= https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/charity-commission-withdraws-official-warning-to-institute-of-economic-affairs.html}}</ref>

Since Britain voted to leave the [[European Union]] ([[Brexit]]) by March 2019, the IEA has lobbied consistently for a [[hard Brexit]] without customs and regulatory alignment, etc.; a report it published in July 2018 proposed using Brexit to remove rules protecting agency workers, to deregulate finance, annul the rules on hazardous chemicals and weaken food labelling laws.<ref name=Monbiot18Dark/>

The IEA supports privatising the [[National Health Service]] (NHS); campaigns against controls on junk food; attacks trades unions; and defends [[zero-hour contract]]s, unpaid internships and tax havens.<ref name=Monbiot18Dark/> IEA staff are frequently invited by the BBC and other news media to promote their ideology and policy positions on broadcasts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A thinktank is finally challenged over its funding on Question Time.

In October 2019, ''[[The Guardian]]'' accused the IEA of publishing "at least four books, as well as multiple articles and papers, over two decades suggesting manmade climate change may be uncertain or exaggerated [and that] climate change is either not significantly driven by human activity or will be positive".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/thinktank-climate-science-institute-economic-affairs|title=Revealed: top UK thinktank spent decades undermining climate science|last1=Pegg|first1=David|date=10 October 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 October 2019|last2=Evans|first2=Rob|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The IEA rejected these claims, describing them as "entirely unworthy of the paper’s proud history of inquiry and fair treatment of opponents".<ref name="Mayer">{{cite news |last1=Mayer |first1=Andy |title=IEA declines the Guardian's invitation to delete books |url=https://iea.org.uk/iea-declines-the-guardians-invitation-to-delete-books/ |access-date=17 October 2019 |work=IEA blog |date=7 October 2019}}</ref>

===Concerns about political independence; investigation===
[[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]] and [[Martin Callanan|Lord Callanan]], ministers at the [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] (DExEU) at the time, all recorded meetings with the IEA in the first three months of 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720640/-DExEU_Ministers_Quarterly_Return_Q417.xlsx_-_Meetings.csv_-_COMPLETE_2018-12-06_DExEU_Ministers_Quarterly_Return_Q417.xlsx_-_Meetings.csv.csv/preview |title=Ministerial meetings, January to March 2018|website=UK Government, Department for Exiting the European Union  |date= 28 June 2018}}</ref> ''The Observer'' reported on 29 July 2018 that the director of the IEA was secretly recorded in May and June telling an undercover reporter that funders could get to know ministers on first-name terms and that his organisation was in "the Brexit influencing game". While seeking funding, Littlewood said that the IEA allowed donors to affect the "salience" of reports and to shape "substantial content". The recording was to be given to the Charity Commission on 30 July.<ref name=obs29jul18>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/29/rightwing-thinktank-ministerial-access-potential-us-donors-insitute-of-economic-affairs-brexit |title=Rightwing UK thinktank 'offered ministerial access' to potential US donors |newspaper=The Observer|author= Robert Booth|date= 29 July 2018}}</ref>

The Charity Commission, considering that the allegations raised by the recordings were "of a serious nature", on 20 July 2018  opened a regulatory compliance case into the IEA due to concerns about its political independence, after it became known that it offered potential US donors access to ministers while raising funds for research to promote free-trade deals favoured by proponents of a "hard Brexit". The Commission has powers to examine IEA financial records, legally compel it to provide information, and to disqualify trustees. The IEA denies it has breached charity law.<ref name=graun30jl18>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/30/labour-calls-for-inquiry-into-iea-thinktank-over-cash-for-access-claims |title=Thinktank faces double investigation after 'cash for access' claims |newspaper=The Guardian|author1=Robert Booth |author2=Rajeev Syal|date= 30 July 2018}}</ref>

The [[Lobbying in the United Kingdom#Regulation|register of lobbyists]] was also considering whether the IEA should be registered. It was also revealed that, after the IEA published a report recommending more [[casino]]s, the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA.<ref name=graun30jl18/>

[[Jon Trickett]], the [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] [[Cabinet Office]] minister, welcoming the investigation into the IEA, said "on the road to Brexit, a small group of establishment figures, funded to the tune of millions, are covertly pursuing a political campaign in favour of extreme free trade, acting in effect as lobbyists for secretive corporate interests...there are serious questions that high-ranking Conservative ministers must now answer about their dealings with the IEA."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/charity-commission-investigation-institute-economic-affairs |title=This thinktank scandal is another sign that our democracy is under attack |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Jon Trickett |date= 31 July 2018}}</ref>

It was also revealed that Jersey Finance, representing financial interests in [[Jersey]], paid for an IEA report saying that  tax havens (such as Jersey) benefited the wider economy, and did not diminish tax  revenues in other countries. The report recommended that their status be protected. The IEA did not disclose the funding from Jersey Finance. A similar IEA report about neighbouring [[Guernsey]] was funded by the financial services industry there. Following this scandal, the IEA said that funding they received never influenced the conclusions of reports, and that their output was independent and free from conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/31/jersey-finance-paid-iea-to-trash-hotbeds-of-tax-evasion-claims |title=Jersey Finance paid for IEA report rubbishing 'hotbeds of tax evasion' claims |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Robert Booth and David Pegg|date= 31 July 2018}}</ref>

The IEA does not disclose their sources of funding, and has been criticised by health charities and by [[George Monbiot]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref name=Monbiot18Dark/> for receiving funds from major tobacco companies whilst campaigning on tobacco industry issues.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/cigarette-packaging-corporate-smokescreen-liberty |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Cigarette packaging: the corporate smokescreen |author=George Monbiot |author-link=George Monbiot |date=15 July 2013 }}</ref> [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT) confirmed it had donated £40,000 to the IEA in 2013,<ref name=ash>{{cite web |title=British American Tobacco's response to ASH |date=June 2014 |url=http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__9d9kcy.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO9DLM9T/$FILE/medMD9KSF99.pdf?openelement |access-date=19 March 2015 }}</ref> £20,000 in 2012 and £10,000 in 2011, and [[Philip Morris International]] and [[Japan Tobacco International]] also confirmed they provide financial support to the IEA.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/01/thinktanks-big-tobacco-funds-smoking |title=Health groups dismayed by news 'big tobacco' funded rightwing thinktanks |last=Doward |first=Jamie |date=1 June 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> In 2002, a leaked letter revealed that prominent IEA member, the right-wing writer [[Roger Scruton]], had authored an IEA pamphlet attacking the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|World Health Organisation's campaign on tobacco]], whilst failing to disclose that he - Scruton - was receiving £54,000 a year from Japan Tobacco International.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/24/advertising.tobaccoadvertising |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Scruton in media plot to promote smoking |author1=Kevin Maguire |author2=Julian Borger |author1-link=Kevin Maguire (journalist) |date=24 January 2002 }}</ref><ref name="bmj">{{cite journal |title=Pro-tobacco writer admits he should have declared an interest |url= |author1=Zosia Kmietowicz |author2=Annabel Ferriman |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7332.257 |pmc=65291 |date=2 February 2002 |volume=324 |issue=7332 |page=257 |pmid=11823350 }}</ref> In response, the IEA said it would introduce an author declaration policy.<ref name="bmj"/> Despite this scandal, the IEA claims that it "accepts no tied funding".<ref name="peer review">{{cite web |title=Peer Review Protocol |url=https://iea.org.uk/peer-review-protocal/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201175327/http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/peer-review-protocol |archive-date=1 February 2016 |url-status=live |publisher=IEA |access-date=23 August 2018 }}</ref>

Think tank [[Transparify]], which is funded by the [[Open Society Foundations]], ranked the IEA as one of the top three least transparent think tanks in the UK in relation to funding.<ref name=sarahneville/><ref name=t2015 /> The IEA responded by saying "it is a matter for individual donors whether they wish their donation to be public or private – we leave that entirely to their discretion", and that it has not "earmarked money for commissioned research work from any company".<ref name=sarahneville>{{cite web |last1=Neville |first1=Sarah |title=British think-tanks 'less transparent about sources of funding' |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6968c4-b5ec-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk |work=[[Financial Times]] |access-date=19 March 2015 }}</ref>

==Reception==
In or about 2019, on national radio station [[LBC]], [[James O'Brien (broadcaster)|James O'Brien]] said that the IEA is a politically motivated lobbying organisation funded by "dark money", of "questionable provenance, with dubious ideas and validity", staffed by people who are not proper experts on their topic. The IEA complained to UK media regulator [[Ofcom]] that those remarks were inaccurate and unfair. In August 2021, Ofcom rejected the complaint.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/aug/09/lbcs-james-obrien-wins-ofcom-battle-with-institute-of-economic-affairs |title=LBC’s James O’Brien wins Ofcom battle with Institute of Economic Affairs |first=Jim |last=Waterson |author-link=Jim Waterson |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 August 2021}}</ref>

In the UK, many IEA titles have become mandatory in university and classroom reading lists.<ref name="IEA-about">{{cite web|url = http://www.iea.org.uk/about|title = about the IEA|publisher = Institute of Economic Affairs|access-date = 29 October 2009}}</ref>

IEA papers are arranged in a series of titles, each with its own 'brand image'. The main series of publications is complemented by the IEA's quarterly journal ''Economic Affairs''.

In September 2008, the institute started the IEA blog.

===Research===
According to the IEA, although not an academic body, the institute's research activities are aided by an international Academic Advisory Council and a panel of Honorary Fellows. The IEA say that their papers are subjected to the same refereeing process used by academic journals,<ref name="peer review" /> and that the views expressed in IEA papers are those of the authors and not of the IEA, its trustees, directors or advisers.

The IEA has also published research in areas including  business ethics, economic development, education, pensions, regulation, taxation and transport.
