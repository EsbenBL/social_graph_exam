She is the author of two books, ''Balkan Tragedy: Chaos and Dissolution after the Cold War'' (Brookings Institution Press, 1995), and ''Socialist Unemployment: The Political Economy of Yugoslavia'' (Princeton Univ. Press, 1995), about which the reviewer in ''Foreign Affairs'' wrote, "Woodward's argument is big and bold, challenging almost every major interpretation, from capitalist assumptions misapplied in a reform socialist context by outside analysis, to explanations of the sources of Yugoslavia's particular dilemmas and failures, to the meaning of Tito's death in the ungluing of the country. It is intellectual discourse at a high level."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ebookg.com/Socialist_Unemployment_37713 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121232854/http://ebookg.com/Socialist_Unemployment_37713 |archivedate=2013-01-21 }}</ref>
