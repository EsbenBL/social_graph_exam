== History ==
The university was chartered on April 17, 1911, by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|southern denomination of the Methodist Episcopal Church]]. At the time of the charter, church leaders saw a need to establish a Methodist institution within a metropolitan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/iwm01|title=METHODIST EDUCATION|date=June 15, 2010|website=Tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051221/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/iwm01|archive-date=December 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Originally, this new institution was intended to be created in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] through a merger between Polytechnic College (now [[Texas Wesleyan University]]) and [[Southwestern University]]. However, the church's education commission instead opted to create a new institution in Dallas to serve this purpose after extensive lobbying by the Dallas Chamber of Commerce.

The effort to establish a new university in Dallas drew the attention of the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] of the Methodist Church, which was seeking to create a new [[Connectionalism|connectional institution]] in the wake of a 1914 [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] decision stripping the church of authority at [[Vanderbilt University]].<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/chancellor/history/|title=History of the Office {{!}} Office of the Chancellor {{!}} Vanderbilt University|website=Vanderbilt.edu|language=en|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051115/https://www.vanderbilt.edu/chancellor/history/|archive-date=December 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The church decided to support the establishment of the new institution while also increasing the size of [[Emory University]] at a new location in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]].

SMU named its first building [[Dallas Hall]] in gratitude for the support of Dallas leaders and local citizens, who had pledged $300,000 to secure the university's location.

[[File:Southern Methodist University July 2016 064 (Gail O. and R. Gerald Turner Pavilion and Blanton Student Services Building).jpg|left|thumb|The Laura Lee Blanton Student Services Building with the Centennial Quadrangle in the foreground]]
Southern Methodist University's [[List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment|endowment]] of $1.664 billion ranks 67th largest among the endowments of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, and makes it one of only 110 with an endowment greater than $1 billion as of June 30, 2019.<ref name=endowment/>

On February 26, 2016, SMU announced that "The Centennial Campaign" which concluded on December 31, 2015 had raised $1.15 billion, the largest fundraising campaign of any institution in [[North Texas]]'s history, the largest total for a private Texas university, and the fourth largest of any university in [[Texas]]. The Centennial Campaign, coinciding with the 100-year anniversary of the university's founding in 1911 and opening in 1915 also made SMU one of only 34 private colleges and universities in the United States to complete a campaign of $1 billion or more.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20160225-1.15b-raised-by-smu-is-largest-total-for-a-private-texas-university.ece|title=$1.15B raised by SMU is largest total for a private Texas university|year=2016|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|access-date=February 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227114404/http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20160225-1.15b-raised-by-smu-is-largest-total-for-a-private-texas-university.ece|archive-date=February 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smu.edu/News/2016/campaign-success-26feb2016/|title=SMU sets record for Texas private university fundraising with $1.15 billion campaign total|year=2016|publisher=SMU News|access-date=September 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913185410/https://www.smu.edu/News/2016/campaign-success-26feb2016/|archive-date=September 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.smu.edu/forum/2015/09/24/smu-reaches-1-billion-second-century-campaign-goal-announcement-made-during-centennial-convocation/|title=SMU reaches $1 billion Second Century Campaign goal; announcement made during Centennial Convocation|year=2015|publisher=SMU Forum for Faculty and Staff|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301042854/http://blog.smu.edu/forum/2015/09/24/smu-reaches-1-billion-second-century-campaign-goal-announcement-made-during-centennial-convocation/|archive-date=March 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20150924-southern-methodist-university-reaches-1-billion-fundraising-goal.ece|title=Southern Methodist University reaches $1 billion fundraising goal|year=2015|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|access-date=January 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127211142/http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20150924-southern-methodist-university-reaches-1-billion-fundraising-goal.ece|archive-date=January 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.smu.edu/apps/100pavers/|title=Crain Family Centennial Promenade|publisher=Southern Methodist University|access-date=December 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730172533/https://sites.smu.edu/apps/100pavers/|archive-date=July 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== University Honors Program ===
First-year undergraduate students admitted to SMU are automatically reviewed for admissions into the highly selective University [[Honors Program]] (UHP).  Generally, first-year students that rank in the top 10% of their incoming class will receive a formal invitation to join the UHP.  Students that do not receive an invitation must have completed at least one full-time semester on campus with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher before formally applying for admissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/StudentResources/UniversityHonors/Admission|title=Admission - Dedman College - SMU|website=Smu.edu|access-date=November 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914022142/https://www.smu.edu/Dedman/StudentResources/UniversityHonors/Admission|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The University Honors Program is a liberal arts honors experience that serves to supplement the basic SMU University Curriculum. Students are required to take honors courses throughout their time at SMU, and the program culminates with a final senior project or experience. Each student's experience can be unique, and students are encouraged to pursue projects in their area of study or about their passions.

After their first year, students have the option of moving into other on-campus housing facilities such as Greek Life houses, SMU Service House, and apartment-style upperclassman housing, such as Moore Hall and Daniel Two. A new SMU-owned apartment building has also been added in 2020 across from Daniel Two on Daniel Avenue. After two years, students are able to live off campus if they would like.

SMU has also temporarily allowed fully virtual students in the first two years to live off-campus during the 2020 school year because of COVID-19. This is to protect any student who wants to be close to campus, yet fears the risks of living in a large dorm.

=== Student organizations ===
Southern Methodist University is home to almost three hundred student organizations, including academic, professional, fraternal, sporting, ethnic themed, religious, service, and political diversity groups. Notable examples include the Feminist Equality Movement (FEM), the service organization Mustang Heroes, one of the largest organizations on campus, and the Embrey Human Rights Program.
Student organizations such as Student Foundation and Program Council frequently sponsor all-student events on various weekdays and weekends as well as boulevard tents. Student Foundation helps put on popular events such as Family Weekend, the Tate lectures, Celebration of Lights, Homecoming, and Perunapalooza.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smu.collegiatelink.net/organizations|title=Orgs@SMU|publisher=CollegiateLink|access-date=December 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221015748/https://smu.collegiatelink.net/Organizations|archive-date=December 21, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Student media ===
''The Daily Campus'' has been the independent student newspaper since 1915. It was published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays during the Fall and Spring semesters. It operates in conjunction with SMU-TV and ''The Daily Update'', a weekday morning news program also produced by students. In recent years the number of publications decreased from four printings a week to three. As of 2018, ''The Daily Campus'' is only available in digital form on their website.

Other student media include:
* ''The Rotunda'', the official SMU [[yearbook]]
* ''SMU-TV'', a student-run television station serving the Park Cities community
* ''The Daily Update'', a weekday morning newscast that airs on SMU-TV and smudailymustang.com
* ''Hilltopics'', a publication sponsored by the University Honors Program that publishes periodically
* ''The Muddler'', a satirical newspaper
* ''SMU LOOK'', a student-run fashion magazine, website, Instagram, Tiktok, and Youtube channel
* ''SMU Style'', a student-run fashion and lifestyle blog
As of May 2018 the newspaper will be put under the control of the school's journalism department.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Hardy, Michael|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/smu-just-lost-its-independent-student-newspaper-is-your-college-next/|title=SMU Just Lost Its Independent Student Newspaper.

SMU delays Greek recruitment until the spring semester, giving prospective members the ability to decide over the course of the fall which organization they would like to join. This allows the prospective members the ability to meet members of the actual fraternities and have a feel of how each of them works and if they would like to try and join. 

There are restrictions in the type of communication affiliated sorority members can have with potential new members throughout the fall semester set in place by the SMU Panhellenic Council. Fraternities place no such communication restrictions on the ability for the men to rush potential members. Formal recruitment occurs in mid-January after the university's winter break. The Panhellenic recruitment process takes place over four days where potential new members visit each house and on the last day they may receive a bid to join a house. After accepting a bid, new members are initiated into their chapter during the course of the spring semester.

Starting in 2010, the NPC sororities began updating and rebuilding their older sorority houses. The first house rebuilt was [[Pi Beta Phi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pibetaphi.org/pibetaphi/smu/|title=Welcome to Pi Beta Phi|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019105525/https://www.pibetaphi.org/pibetaphi/smu/|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> followed by Kappa Kappa Gamma, [[Delta Delta Delta]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trideltasmu.com/|title=Southern Methodist University Tri-Delta|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709135006/http://trideltasmu.com/|archive-date=July 9, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Chi Omega]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smuchiomega.com/|title=SMU Chi Omega - Sorority - Dallas|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821063607/http://www.smuchiomega.com/|archive-date=August 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2014/08/30/why-smus-new-6-5m-sorority-house-went-viral.html|title=Why SMU's new $6.5M sorority house went viral - Dallas Business Journal|date=August 31, 2014|work=Dallas Business Journal|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019105525/http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2014/08/30/why-smus-new-6-5m-sorority-house-went-viral.html|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and Kappa Alpha Theta<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dmagazine.com/home-garden/2016/12/inside-kappa-alpha-thetas-7-3-million-sorority-house-at-smu/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 22, 2020 |archive-date=December 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225024737/https://www.dmagazine.com/home-garden/2016/12/inside-kappa-alpha-thetas-7-3-million-sorority-house-at-smu/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Alpha Chi Omega began renovations in August 2019 and are expected to be complete by Spring 2021.

{{Main|SMU Mustangs}}

Southern Methodist University's athletics teams are known as the Mustangs and participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], with the [[SMU Mustangs football|football team]] competing as a member of [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]].  The football team plays at [[Gerald J. Ford Stadium]] on the SMU campus. Mustangs compete in the [[American Athletic Conference]] (previously named [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]]) for all sports beginning in the 2013–14 season. Prior to that, the Mustangs participated in the now-defunct [[Southwest Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]].

SMU's closest rival in athletics is [[TCU Horned Frogs|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas. In football, SMU and [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] compete annually (with the exception of 2006) for the [[Battle for the Iron Skillet|Iron Skillet]]. In 2005, a nationally unranked SMU beat then 24th-ranked TCU for SMU's first win against a ranked team in 19 years (since October 1986).<ref>Associated Press (Dallas), September 10, 2005.

ESPN.com</ref> SMU also competes annually with [[Rice Owls football|Rice University]] in football for the "Mayor's Cup," a traveling trophy that has been created to enhance the Rice-SMU rivalry, which dates back to 1916. SMU has won seven more games (48-41-1) than Rice in their rivalry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&ID=4394&SnID=2|title=Operation Sellout II Aims for Bigger Season Opener|last=Kaplan|first=David|date=August 27, 1998|publisher=Rice News & Media Relations|access-date=July 23, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123040531/http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&ID=4394&SnID=2|archive-date=November 23, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

From 1980 to 1985, SMU had one of the strongest programs in Division I-A (now FBS). They posted a record of 55–14–1, and finished these seasons ranked No. 21, No. 7, No. 2, No. 19, and No. 8 in the nation. These "winningest" years concluded with the Death Penalty on February 25, 1987 due to repeated violations conducted by boosters. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] administered the [[Death penalty (NCAA)|"death penalty"]] for [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|repeated, flagrant recruiting violations]]. Components included cancellation of the entire 1987 season, a two-year ban from bowl appearances, a two-year ban from television appearances, a limit of seven games, all on road, in the 1988 season, a loss of three assistant coaching positions for two years and a loss of 55 new scholarships over four years. Players were allowed to transfer without sitting out one season, per standard requirement. SMU responded to the combination of these conditions by canceling the 1988 season outright.<ref name="deathpenalty" />

The [[Doak Walker Award]] is an annual collegiate award given to the nation's "most outstanding college running back" for his accomplishments on the field, achievement in the classroom and citizenship in the community. It was established in 1989 and is named after SMU [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Doak Walker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smu.edu/doakwalker/|title=Doak Walker Award|year=2012|website=DoakWalkerAward.com|access-date=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415190855/http://smu.edu/doakwalker/|archive-date=April 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://smu.edu/doakwalker/doak_legends_award.asp|title=PwC Doak Walker Legends Award|year=2012|website=DoakWalkerAward.com|access-date=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525071302/http://smu.edu/doakwalker/doak_legends_award.asp|archive-date=May 25, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
