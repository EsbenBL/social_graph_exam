'''Monroe Nathan Work''' (August 15, 1866 – May 2, 1945)<ref>Kreiger, Caroline (June 30, 2008), [http://www.blackpast.org/aah/work-monroe-nathan-1866-1945 "Work, Monroe Nathan (1866–1945)"], Blackpast.org.</ref> was an [[African-American]] [[sociologist]] who founded the Department of Records and Research at the [[Tuskegee Institute]] in 1908. His published works include the ''[[Negro Year Book]]'' and ''[[A Bibliography of the Negro in Africa and America]]'', a bibliography of approximately seventeen thousand references to African Americans.

==Life==  
Work was born to [[Slavery in the United States|former slave]]s in [[Iredell County, North Carolina]], and moved in 1867 to [[Cairo, Illinois]], where his father pursued farming. At the age of 23, Work entered [[Arkansas City High School (Kansas)]], an [[Racial integration|integrated]] high school in [[Arkansas City, Kansas]]. He graduated 3rd in his class, and after undergoing training at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]], he enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]] to become a [[sociologist]]. He did research on the [[correlation]] between the highest crime rates among blacks and the large proportion living in [[slum]]s. His paper on the subject would become the first article published in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' by an African American.  He finished school in Chicago with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Philosophy]] and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[Sociology]].<ref name=abio/>

After graduating in 1903, Work moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]], to become a professor at [[Georgia College and State University|Georgia State Industrial College]].  He married Florence E. Hendrickson of Savannah on December 27, 1904, and they had no children.<ref name="Jones-Wilson1996">{{cite book|author=Joyce Blackwell-Johnson|editor=Faustine Childress Jones-Wilson|title=Encyclopedia of African-American Education|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ni2qhq1n1d4C&pg=PA525|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28931-6|pages=525–6|chapter=Work, Monroe Nathan}}</ref> In July 1905, Work attended the conference of the [[Niagara Movement]] at the invitation of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].

In 1908, he accepted a proposal by [[Booker T. Washington]] to found the Department of Records and Research at the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. While there, he would begin the ''Negro Year Book'', a publication that incorporated his periodic summation of [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] reports, which resulted in the Tuskegee Institute becoming one of the most quoted and undisputed sources on this form of racial violence.<ref name=abio/> According to Work's biographer, these resources were the largest of their kind in an era when scholarship by and about black Americans was highly inaccessible, and overlooked or ignored by most academics in the US.<ref name=abio>{{cite book |last=McMurry |first=Linda O. |title=Recorder of the Black Experience: A Biography of Monroe Nathan Work |publisher=[[Louisiana State University]] |date=1985 |isbn=978-0807111710}}</ref>

Work received the [[William E. Harmon Foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|Harmon Award]] in Education in 1928 for his research and involvement in the ''Negro Year Book'' and his work on ''A Bibliography of the Negro in Africa and America''.

In 1918, he was elected to the  [[American Negro Academy]], which was the earliest major African-American learned society.

Work died of natural causes in [[Tuskegee]] in 1945.<ref name="Jones-Wilson1996"/>
