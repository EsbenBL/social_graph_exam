Public declarations of claims to a [[Jewish homeland]] in Palestine, including the 1897 [[First Zionist Congress]] and the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], created early tension in the region. At the time, the region had a [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|small minority Jewish population]], although this was growing via significant [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]]. Following the implementation of the [[Mandate for Palestine]], which included a binding obligation on the British government for the "establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people" the tension grew into [[Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|sectarian conflict between Jews and Arabs]].<ref>[http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=history_honproj The Roots of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: 1882–1914]</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=26 October 2020 |title=Balfour Declaration &#124; History & Impact &#124; Britannica |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |location=Chicago |access-date=28 May 2021 |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Balfour-Declaration }}</ref> Attempts to solve the early conflict culminated in the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and the [[1947–1949 Palestine war]], marking the start of the wider [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli [[military occupation]] of the [[Palestinian territories]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

Despite a long-term peace process, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. Progress was made towards a [[two-state solution]] with the 1993–1995 [[Oslo Accords]], but today the Palestinians remain subject to Israeli military occupation in the [[Gaza Strip]] and in [[Palestinian enclaves|165 "islands" across the West Bank]].

The violence of the conflict, in a region rich in sites of historic, cultural and religious interest worldwide, has been the subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security issues and human rights, and has been a factor hampering tourism in and general access to areas that are hotly contested.<ref>Edward Wright, [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/28/travel/tr-34813 'Tourism Curbed in Palestinians Areas,'] ''Los Angeles Times'', 28 May 2000.</ref> Many attempts have been made to broker a [[two-state solution]], involving the creation of an independent [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]] alongside the [[State of Israel]] (after Israel's establishment in 1948).

Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a [[Views of the Arab–Israeli conflict|wide variety of views and opinions]]. This highlights the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within each society. A hallmark of the conflict has been the [[Violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|level of violence witnessed]] for virtually its entire duration.<!-- Long duration also a hallmark, but need a ref. --> Fighting has been conducted by regular armies, paramilitary groups, terror cells, and individuals.

The two parties currently engaged in direct negotiation are the [[Israeli government]], led by [[Naftali Bennett]], and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), headed by [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] (the ''Quartet'') represented by a special [[Diplomatic rank#Multilateral diplomacy|envoy]], that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The [[Arab League]] is another important actor, which has proposed an [[Arab Peace Initiative|alternative peace plan]]. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has [[Foreign relations of Egypt#Relations in the Middle East|historically been a key participant]]. Jordan, having [[Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank|relinquished its claim to the West Bank]] in 1988 and holding a [[Hashemite custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites|special role]] in the Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem, has also been a key participant.

Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)|conflict between two major factions]]: [[Fatah]], the traditionally dominant party, and its later electoral challenger, [[Hamas]], which also operates as a militant organization. After Hamas's electoral victory in 2006, the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] conditioned future foreign assistance to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PA) on the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the State of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected these demands,<ref>CRS Report for Congress, 27 June 2006, [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/68794.pdf ''U.S. Foreign Aid to the Palestinians'']</ref> which resulted in the Quartet's suspension of its foreign assistance program, and the imposition of [[2006–2007 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority|economic sanctions]] by the Israelis.<ref>{{cite book |title=Understanding Israel/Palestine Race, Nation, and Human Rights in the Conflict |publisher=Springer |author=Spangler, Eve |year=2015 |pages=161–162 |isbn=978-94-6300-088-8|doi=10.1007/978-94-6300-088-8 }}</ref> A year later, following Hamas's [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|seizure of the Gaza Strip in June 2007]], the territory officially recognized as the PA was split between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the [[Gaza Strip]]. The division of governance between the parties had effectively resulted in the collapse of bipartisan governance of the PA. However, in 2014, a [[Palestinian unity government of 2014|Palestinian Unity Government]], composed of both Fatah and Hamas, was formed. [[2013 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks|The latest round of peace negotiations]] began in July 2013 and was suspended in 2014. 

In May 2021, amidst rising tensions, the [[2021 Israel–Palestine crisis]] began with protests that escalated into rocket attacks from Gaza and airstrikes by Israel.

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements [[Zionism|among the Jews]] and [[Arab nationalism|among the Arabs]], both geared towards attaining sovereignty for their people in the Middle East.<ref name="SelaConflict" /> The [[Balfour Declaration]] was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.<ref>{{Cite book |first=James |last=Gelvin |author-link=James L.

The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under the emerging leadership of [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], from Damascus to [[Mandatory Palestine]] marked the beginning of [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian Arab nationalist struggle]] towards establishment of a national home for Arabs of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Sela |editor-first=Avraham |editor-link=Avraham Sela |chapter=Palestine Arabs |title=The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East |location=New York |year=2002 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0826414137 |pages=664–673 }}</ref> Amin al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian Arab national movement, immediately marked [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration to Palestine]] as the sole enemy to his cause,<ref name="al-Husseini">{{harvnb|Sela|2002|p=361|loc="al-Husseini, Hajj (Muhammad) Amin"}}<blockquote>"He [Husseini] incited and headed anti-Jewish riots in April 1920. ...

In 1929, a series of violent [[1929 Palestine riots|anti-Jewish riots]] was initiated by the Arab leadership. The riots resulted in massive Jewish casualties in [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron]] and [[1929 Safed riots|Safed]], and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.<ref name="SelaConflict" />

In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam|Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam]] from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936 Arab revolt. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence and the bloodily repressed [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]] against the British and the Jews.<ref name="HistoryPBS" /> In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the British and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership was performed. The revolt led to the establishment of the [[Peel Commission]] towards partitioning of Palestine, though it was subsequently rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish leaders, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[David Ben-Gurion]], accepted the recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders did not like it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Louis |first=William Roger |title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization |year=2006 |publisher=I.B.

The renewed violence, which had sporadically lasted until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the Arab side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs, under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab [[Palestine Regiment]] under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini however tended to cooperation with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. Defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb [[Tel Aviv]]. By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of the Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the [[Yishuv]] and the Palestinian Arab leadership. Immigration quotas were established by the British, while on the other hand illegal immigration and Zionist insurgency against the British was increasing.<ref name="SelaConflict" />

{{Further|Military operations of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
Following the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].<ref name="Baum" /> The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|West Bank]] and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the [[All-Palestine Government]] was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.<ref name="HistoryPBS" />

Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the [[Palestinian Fedayeen]] militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out [[reprisal operations]] in the host countries. The [[1956 Suez Crisis]] resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the [[All-Palestine Government]], which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the [[United Arab Republic]], to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. [[Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip|Gaza Strip]] then was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat.<ref name="Baum" /> It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the [[Arab League]].

The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters in Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the Jordanian army during the [[War of Attrition]], which included the [[Battle of Karameh]]. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the [[Black September in Jordan|Jordanian–Palestinian civil war]] in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon, where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called "Fatahland".

[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon]] peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the [[Coastal Road massacre]] led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as [[Operation Litani]]. Israeli forces, however, quickly withdrew from Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed. In 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the [[1982 Lebanon War]] commenced. The initial results for Israel were successful. Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's decision.<ref name="HistoryPBS" /> However, Israeli intervention in the civil war also led to unforeseen results, including small-scale conflict between Israel and Syria. By 1985, Israel withdrew to a 10&nbsp;km occupied a strip of South Lebanon, while the low-intensity conflict with Shia militants escalated.<ref name="SelaConflict" />{{citation needed span|text= Those Iranian-supported Shia groups gradually consolidated into Hizbullah and Amal, operated against Israel, and allied with the remnants of Palestinian organizations to launch attacks on Galilee through the late 1980s.

The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s, international efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]] led to the [[Oslo Accords]] of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], establishing the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. The peace process also had significant opposition among radical Islamic elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of radical anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Rabin was assassinated]] by an Israeli fanatic who objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, from which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed off.<ref name="SelaConflict" />

Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the [[Second Intifada]] in September 2000.<ref name="HistoryPBS" /> The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the [[Palestinian National Security Forces]] and the [[Israel Defense Forces]], lasted until 2004/2005 and led to approximately [[Operation Days of Penitence Fatalities|130 fatalities]]. In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza.

[[File:Israel and Palestine Peace.svg|thumb|left|A [[peace movement]] poster: [[Flag of Israel|Israeli]] and [[Palestinian flag]]s and the words ''peace'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].]]

In 1993, Israeli officials led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Palestinian leaders from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts, the process took a turning point at the [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin]] and finally unraveled when Arafat and [[Ehud Barak]] failed to reach agreement at Camp David in July 2000. [[Robert Malley]], special assistant to US President [[Bill Clinton]] for Arab–Israeli Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat "the Palestinians' principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own".<ref>Malley, Robert and Hussein Agha.

In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as "bases for negotiation", via the US to the Palestinian President; a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92%<ref group=note>Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 km<sup>2</sup> near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km<sup>2</sup>), and the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 km<sup>2</sup>), which reduces the total to 5,538&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

===Developments following Camp David===
{{Main|The Clinton Parameters}}
Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the [[Second Intifada]] at the end of September.<ref name=JPressman/>

Clinton's plan eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and 94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the plan stated that "the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli." The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a "non-militarized" Palestinian state, and an international force for border security.

===Taba Summit (2001)===
{{Main|Taba Summit}}

The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the [[Taba Summit]] in [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba, Egypt]] in January 2001. The proposition removed the "temporarily Israeli controlled" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: "The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections." The following month the [[Likud]] party candidate [[Ariel Sharon]] defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.<ref name=JPressman/>

===Road Map for Peace===
{{Main|Road map for peace}}
One peace proposal, presented by the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Israel moves to green light 2,200 new settlement units, recognizes outposts |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.684929|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=3 December 2015|date=2015-11-09|last1=Levinson|first1=Chaim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UN: Israeli-Palestinian violence nears 'catastrophe'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/israeli-palestinian-violence-151029060544251.html|publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mapping the dead in latest Israeli-Palestinian violence |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2015/10/mapping-dead-latest-israeli-palestinian-violence-151013142015577.html |publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref>

===Arab Peace Initiative===
{{Main|Arab Peace Initiative}}
The Arab Peace Initiative ({{lang-ar|مبادرة السلام العربية}} ''Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah'') was first proposed by Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] at the [[Beirut Summit]] (2002). The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi Prince al-Faisal tells Haaretz: Desire for peace exists both in Gaza and Ramallah – Israel Conference on Peace TLV|url=http://www.haaretz.com/peace/1.685313|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=3 December 2015|date=2015-11-12}}</ref>

The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut Summit, and agreed upon again in 2007 in the [[2007 Arab League Summit|Riyadh Summit]].

Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out "final-solution" borders based explicitly on the UN borders established before the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the [[Golan Heights]], to recognize "an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian refugees.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3691148,00.html "The Saudi Arabia peace initiative."] ''[[Ynetnews]]''.  23 March 2009.  21 September 2010.</ref>

A number of Israeli officials have responded to the initiative with both support and criticism. The Israeli government has expressed reservations on 'red line,' issues such as the Palestinian refugee problem, homeland security concerns, and the nature of Jerusalem.<ref name=FM>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About%20the%20Ministry/MFA%20Spokesman/2002/Response%20of%20FM%20Peres%20to%20the%20decisions%20of%20the%20Arab "Response of FM Peres to the decisions of the Arab Summit in Beirut."].

Israel has had its settlement growth and policies in the Palestinian territories harshly criticized by the [[European Union]] citing it as increasingly undermining the viability of the two-state solution and running in contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume negotiations.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/eu-report-israeli-settlement-growth |title=EU report calls for action over Israeli settlement growth |work=The Guardian |date=18 January 2012 |access-date=11 February 2012 |author=Harriet Sherwood |location=London}}</ref><ref>See the following:

Britain said that the move was a breach of Israeli commitments under the road map to freeze all settlement expansion in the land captured since 1967.

====Israeli Military Police====
In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, [[Amnesty International]] asserted that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension. The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself "to the highest of professional standards," adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action "where appropriate".<ref>Crispian Balmer,[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-amnesty-idUSBREA1Q00G20140227 'Amnesty says some Israeli West Bank killings may be war crimes,'] [[Reuters]] 26 February 2014.</ref><ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/002/2014/en/ 'Trigger-happy:Israel's use of excessive force in the West Bank,'] [[Amnesty International]], February 2014 p. 10.</ref>

====Public support====
Polling data has produced mixed results regarding the level of support among Palestinians for the two-state solution. A poll was carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University; it indicated that support for a two-state solution was growing among both Israelis and Palestinians. The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state solution based on the [[Clinton Parameters]], compared with 47% of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out. The poll also found that an increasing percentage of both populations supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians and 70% of Israelis expressing their support for an end to violence, an increase of 2% for Israelis and 5% for Palestinians from the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=251311 |title=Support growing for two-state solution |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=28 December 2011 |access-date=10 February 2012 |author=Lidman, Melanie |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152656/http://www.jpost.com/diplomacyandpolitics/article.aspx?id=251311 |archive-date=3 September 2012}}</ref>

===Issues in dispute===
The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a single position. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides include both moderate and [[Extremism|extremist]] bodies as well as [[Political dove|dovish]] and [[War Hawk|hawkish]] bodies.

One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants. Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the peace process. Support among Palestinians for [[Hamas]] is considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction of Israel and [[Palestinian political violence|violence]] remains a threat, [[#Israeli security concerns|security]] becomes a prime concern for many Israelis. The expansion of [[Israeli settlement]]s in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news-basics.com/2011/israel-and-the-palestinians/|title=Overview of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians|work=News Basics|access-date=13 February 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424152450/http://news-basics.com/2011/israel-and-the-palestinians/|archive-date=24 April 2012}}</ref>

====Jerusalem====

The control of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each side asserting claims over the city. The three largest [[Abrahamic religions]]—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an important setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the holiest city for Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples on the [[Temple Mount]] and the capital of the ancient Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site, being the location of Isra and Mi'raj event, and the [[Al-Aqsa mosque]]. For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of [[crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

The Israeli government, including the [[Knesset]] and [[Israeli Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], is located in the "new city" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] declaring "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel."<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Basic_Law_Jerusalem.html "Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel."] [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. 9 April 2008.</ref>

As of 2005, there were more than 719,000 people living in Jerusalem; 465,000 were Jews (mostly living in West Jerusalem) and 232,000 were Muslims (mostly living in East Jerusalem).<ref>Zaritzky, Suzanna. [http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106e.pdf "Press Release."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614014210/http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106e.pdf |date=14 June 2007 }} ''[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]]''. 24 May 2006. 9 April 2006.</ref>

At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–2001, the United States proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to the proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were given to Israel. All archaeological work under the Temple Mount would be jointly controlled by the Israeli and Palestinian governments. Both sides accepted the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately failed.<ref name="SelaJerusalem" />

Israel expresses concern over the security of its residents if neighborhoods of Jerusalem are placed under Palestinian control. Jerusalem has been a prime target for attacks by militant groups against civilian targets since 1967. Many Jewish neighborhoods have been fired upon from Arab areas. The proximity of the Arab areas, if these regions were to fall in the boundaries of a Palestinian state, would be so close as to threaten the safety of Jewish residents.<ref>Nadav Shragai states this idea in his study for the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], "An Israeli security body that was tasked in March 2000 with examining the possibility of transferring three Arab villages just outside Jerusalem – Abu Dis, Al Azaria, and a-Ram – to Palestinian security control, assessed at the time that: 'Terrorists will be able to exploit the short distances, sometimes involving no more than crossing a street, to cause damage to people or property. A terrorist will be able to stand on the other side of the road, shoot at an Israeli or throw a bomb, and it may be impossible to do anything about it. The road will constitute the border.' If that is the case for neighborhoods outside Jerusalem's municipal boundaries, how much more so for Arab neighborhoods within those boundaries.{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/text/shragai_last2.pdf

====Holy sites====
Israel has concerns regarding the welfare of Jewish holy places under possible Palestinian control. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian control, no Jews were allowed to visit the [[Western Wall]] or other Jewish holy places, and the Jewish cemetery on the [[Mount of Olives]] was desecrated.<ref name="SelaJerusalem" /> Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping at [[Joseph's Tomb]], a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims. Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the [[mihrab]]. During the Second Intifada the site was looted and burned.<ref>[[Dore Gold|Gold]].

The most common arguments for opposition are:
* The Israeli government asserts that the Arab refugee problem is largely caused by the refusal of all Arab governments except Jordan to grant citizenship to Palestinian Arabs who reside within those countries' borders. This has produced much of the poverty and economic problems of the refugees, according to MFA documents.<ref name="mfa faq">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/11/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20About%20Israel#refugee "Frequently Asked Questions About Israel;" "Who is Responsible for the Palestinian refugee problem?"] ''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''.  1 November 2001.  16 January 2008.</ref>
* The Palestinian refugee issue is handled by a separate authority from that handling other refugees, that is, by [[UNRWA]] and not the [[UNHCR]]. Most of the people recognizing themselves as Palestinian refugees would have otherwise been assimilated into their country of current residency, and would not maintain their refugee state if not for the separate entities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Elhanan|date=June 2012|title=Palestinian Refugees and the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Negotiations|url=http://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1346247918ICSRAtkinPaperSeries_ElhananMiller.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207232443/http://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1346247918ICSRAtkinPaperSeries_ElhananMiller.pdf|archive-date=7 February 2016|publisher=International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence|quote=To use a trite image, while UNHCR strives to give its refugees fishing rods, UNRWA is busy distributing fish}}</ref>
* Concerning the origin of the Palestinian refugees, the official version of the Israeli government is that during the 1948 War the [[Arab Higher Committee]] and the Arab states encouraged Palestinians to flee in order to make it easier to rout the Jewish state or that they did so to escape the fights by fear.<ref name="mfa faq" /> The Palestinian narrative is that refugees were expelled and dispossessed by Jewish militias and by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]], following a plan established even before the war.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Historians still debate the [[causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus]].
* Since none of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|900,000 Jewish refugees who fled anti-Semitic violence in the Arab world]] was ever compensated or repatriated by their former countries of residence—to no objection on the part of Arab leaders—a precedent has been set whereby it is the responsibility of the nation which accepts the refugees to assimilate them.<ref>[http://wais.stanford.edu/Israel/israel_andthepalestinerightofreturn51603.html "Israel and the Palestine right of return."] World Association of International Studies. 8 April 2008.</ref><ref>Alwaya, Semha.

* According to Karsh the Palestinians were themselves the aggressors in the 1948–1949 war who attempted to "cleanse" a neighboring ethnic community. Had the United Nations resolution of 29 November 1947 recommending partition in Palestine not been subverted by force by the Arab world, there would have been no refugee problem in the first place. He reports of large numbers of Palestinian refugees leaving even before the outbreak of the 1948 war because of disillusionment and economic privation. The British High Commissioner for Palestine spoke of the "collapsing Arab morale in Palestine" that he partially attributed to the "increasing tendency of those who should be leading them to leave the country" and the considerable evacuations of the Arab effendi class. Huge numbers of Palestinians were also expelled by their leadership to prevent them from becoming Israeli citizens and in Haifa and Tiberias, tens of thousands of Arabs were forcibly evacuated on the instructions of the Arab Higher Committee.<ref>{{cite news |last=Karsh |first=Efraim |date=1 May 2001 |title=The Palestinians and the 'Right of Return' |work=Commentary |volume=111 |issue=5 |page=25 |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-palestinians-and-the-right-of-return/}}</ref>

There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the country's security concerns.

====Palestinian violence against other Palestinians====

Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As early as the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1930s revolts in Palestine]], Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], [[As-Sa'iqa|Palestinian baathists]] broke from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and allied with the Shia [[Amal Movement]], [[War of the Camps|fighting a bloody civil war]] that killed thousands of Palestinians.<ref>Syria: A Country Study, [[Federal Research Division]]</ref><ref>Shiloaḥ le-ḥeḳer ha-Mizraḥ ha-tikhon ṿe-Afriḳah, Mekhon.

Google Books.</ref>

In the [[First Intifada]], more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a campaign initiated by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] to crack down on suspected [[Shin Bet|Israeli security service]] informers and collaborators. The [[Palestinian Authority]] was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the [[Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group]], less than 45 percent of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.<ref>Taylor, Catherine. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0522/p01s04-wome.html/(page)/2 "How Israel builds its fifth column."] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.  22 May 2002.</ref>

The policies towards suspected collaborators contravene agreements signed by the Palestinian leadership. Article XVI(2) of the [[Oslo Accords|Oslo II Agreement]] states:<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/THE+ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN+INTERIM+AGREEMENT.htm "The Israeli–Palestinian Interim Agreement."] ''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''.  28 September 1995.</ref>
<blockquote>"Palestinians who have maintained contact with the Israeli authorities will not be subjected to acts of harassment, violence, retribution, or prosecution."</blockquote>

The provision was designed to prevent Palestinian leaders from imposing retribution on fellow Palestinians who had worked on behalf of Israel during the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

In the [[Gaza Strip]], Hamas officials have tortured and killed thousands of [[Fatah]] members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule. During the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]], more than 150 Palestinians died over a four-day period.<ref>[http://www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5698:pchr-publishes-black-days-in-the-absence-of-justice-report-on-bloody-fighting-in-the-gaza-strip-from-7-to-14-june-2007&catid=72:press-releases-security-chaos-&Itemid=213 "PCHR Publishes 'Black Days in the Absence of Justice: Report on Bloody Fighting in the Gaza Strip from 7 to 14 June 2007.'"] [[Palestinian Center for Human Rights]]. 9 October 2007</ref> The violence among Palestinians was described as a civil war by some commentators.

====International status====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Restricted space in the West Bank, Area C.png|thumb|210px|[[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]], controlled by Israel [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|under Oslo Accords]], in blue and red, in December 2011]]

As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the [[Oslo Accords]], signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration ([[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]). Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including [[Oslo II Accord|Oslo II]], [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye River]] and [[Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum|Sharm el-Sheik]]. According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of military significance and of potentially dangerous persons.

The PLO's objective for [[international recognition of the State of Palestine]] is considered by Israel as a provocative "unilateral" act that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

====Water resources====
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories|Water politics in the Jordan River basin}}

In the Middle East, [[water resources]] are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground [[aquifer]]s which continue under the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40&nbsp;million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.532703|title=How many Palestinians actually live in the West Bank? |date=30 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=18 October 2014|last1=Hasson |first1=Nir }}</ref>

While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/en/surveys/palestin/water.pdf |title=Till the Last Drop: The Palestinian Water Crisis in the West Bank, Hydrogeology and Hydropolitics of a Regional Conflict |access-date=29 November 2008 |author=Messerschmid, Clemens |year=2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217111417/http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/en/surveys/palestin/water.pdf |archive-date=17 December 2008 }}</ref>

In the [[Oslo II Accord]], both sides agreed to maintain "existing quantities of utilization from the resources." In so doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a [[Israeli–Palestinian Joint Water Committee|Joint Water Committee]] (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water Committee.<ref name=Oslo2_Annex3>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/process/docs/heskemb4_eng.htm ''Annex III: Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs''], Article 40 and SCHEDULE 8. On the Knesset website</ref> Many Palestinians counter that the Oslo II agreement was intended to be a temporary resolution and that it was not intended to remain in effect more than a decade later.

In 1999, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it continued to honor its obligations under the Interim Agreement.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/The+Water+Issue+in+the+West+Bank+and+Gaza.htm "The Water Issue in the West Bank and Gaza."] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. June 1999.</ref> The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan River system.<ref name=bbc20030616>{{cite news|title=Water war leaves Palestinians thirsty|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2982730.stm|work=BBC News|date=16 June 2003}}</ref>

According to a report of 2008 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/israel/index.stm |title=Israel |year=2008 |work=Aquastat |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |access-date=25 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116204210/http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/israel/index.stm |archive-date=16 January 2013}}</ref>

A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and [[Max Gaylard]], the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the publication: "Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.<ref name="UN Publications">{{cite web|title=Lack of sufficient services in Gaza could get worse without urgent action, UN warns|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42751#.UP35DaF4YZc|publisher=UN News Centre|access-date=22 January 2013|date=27 August 2012}}</ref>

=====Future and financing=====
Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities. It is estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn{{clarify|date=October 2010}} is needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.<ref name="HBS">{{cite journal |author=Heinrich Böll Foundation |title=Water as a human right: The understanding of water in the Arab countries of the Middle East – A four country analysis |year=2004 |url=http://www.emwis.org/countries/fol749974/country045975/countries/PDF/waterbook|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref>

In order to support and improve the water sector in the Palestinian territories, a number of bilateral and multilateral agencies have been supporting many different water and sanitation programs.

There are three large seawater desalination plants in Israel and two more scheduled to open before 2014. When the fourth plant becomes operational, 65% of Israel's water will come from desalination plants, according to Minister of Finance Dr. Yuval Steinitz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/IsraeliEconomy/Economic_News/Desalination_plant_Sorek_23-May-2011.htm|title=One of the biggest desalination plants to be built in Sorek}}</ref>

In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: "Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they face."<ref name="UN Publications"/>

In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem.<ref name=BBC_annexation>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/world/2001/israel_and_palestinians/key_maps/3.stm "Israel & the Palestinians: Key Maps."] [[BBC News]]. 10 April 2007.</ref> Israel has never annexed the West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United Nations has demanded the "[t]ermination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force" and that Israeli forces withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" – the meaning and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242#Interpretations|Interpretations]].

It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts of West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire Gaza Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian State; however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David]], for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] offered Arafat an opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State. The proposed state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two or three areas, followed by: an increase of 86–91% of the West Bank after six to twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some of the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli territory; the entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most settlements.<ref name=Pressman_visions /> Arafat rejected the proposal without providing a counter-offer.

A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered Palestinian sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was similarly rejected with 52 objections.<ref name="nybooks.com"/><ref>Shamir, Shimon.

Some Palestinians claim they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries of this land is open for discussion.<ref name="Eran">{{harvnb|Sela|2002|loc=Eran, Oded. "Arab-Israel Peacemaking" |pp=121–147}}</ref> Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. Other Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, have in the past insisted that Palestinians must control not only the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, but also all of Israel proper. For this reason, Hamas has viewed the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace process]] "as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable".<ref name="SelaHamas">{{harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Hamas"|pp=335–342}}<blockquote>"The PLO's agreement to support the participation of a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Madrid Peace Conferences in late October 1991 further fueled the tension between Fatah and Hamas, which embarked on an intensive campaign against the very idea of territorial compromise and peacemaking with the Jews, as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable" (339).</blockquote></ref>

Former US President George W.

====Gaza blockade====
{{Main|Blockade of the Gaza Strip}}
[[File:Gazaday14.JPG|thumb|Israel's attack on Gaza in 2009]]
The Israeli government states it is justified under international law to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons. The power to impose a naval blockade is established under customary international law and [[Laws of war|Laws of armed conflict]], and a United Nations commission has ruled that Israel's blockade is "both legal and appropriate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=288686 |title=Court extends remand of Israelis aboard Gaza ship |work=Jerusalem Post |access-date=4 November 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mag.idf.il/163-4314-en/patzar.aspx "Position paper on the naval blockade on Gaza."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116231842/http://www.mag.idf.il/163-4314-en/patzar.aspx |date=16 January 2012 }} 8 September 2010.</ref> The Israeli Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to [[collective punishment]] of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<ref>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  [http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/27b79d59eb7b35678525798b005567fa%3FOpenDocument The Humanitarian Monitor.

<blockquote>"The State of Israel has been engaged in an ongoing armed conflict with terrorist organizations operating in the Gaza strip. This armed conflict has intensified after Hamas violently took over Gaza, in June 2007, and turned the territory under its de facto control into a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in southern Israel."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mag.idf.il/592-4071-en/patzar.aspx |title=Interception of the Gaza flotilla-Legal aspects. |publisher=Mag.idf.il |access-date=2 January 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

According to [[Oxfam]], because of an import-export ban imposed on Gaza in 2007, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended. Out of 35,000 people employed by 3,900 factories in June 2005, only 1,750 people remained employed by 195 factories in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/downloads/oxfam_gaza_lowres.pdf |title=The Gaza Strip: A Humanitarian Implosion |access-date=24 September 2010 |publisher=[[Oxfam]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123012503/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/downloads/oxfam_gaza_lowres.pdf |archive-date=23 January 2009 }}</ref> By 2010, Gaza's unemployment rate had risen to 40% with 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day.<ref>Kenyon, Peter.

In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the "culture and experience" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli human rights organization [[Gisha]]'s application to the high court. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.<ref>Hass, Amira.

Starting 7 February 2008, the Israeli Government reduced the electricity it sells directly to Gaza. This follows the ruling of Israel's High Court of Justice's decision, which held, with respect to the amount of industrial fuel supplied to Gaza, that, "The clarification that we made indicates that the supply of industrial diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip in the winter months of last year was comparable to the amount that the Respondents now undertake to allow into the Gaza Strip. This fact also indicates that the amount is reasonable and sufficient to meet the vital humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip." Palestinian militants killed two Israelis in the process of delivering fuel to the [[Nahal Oz]] fuel depot.<ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207649973898&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Murder at the border."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916103736/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207649973898&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=16 September 2011 }} ''[[Jerusalem Post]]''. 9 April 2008. 17 April 2008.</ref>

With regard to Israel's plan, the Court stated that, "calls for a reduction of five percent of the power supply in three of the ten power lines that supply electricity from Israel to the Gaza Strip, to a level of 13.5 megawatts in two of the lines and 12.5 megawatts in the third line, we [the Court] were convinced that this reduction does not breach the humanitarian obligations imposed on the State of Israel in the framework of the armed conflict being waged between it and the Hamas organization that controls the Gaza Strip. Our conclusion is based, in part, on the affidavit of the Respondents indicating that the relevant Palestinian officials stated that they can reduce the load in the event limitations are placed on the power lines, and that they had used this capability in the past."

On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would "expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more – as well as (projects) that are under international supervision."<ref name="Ynet Cabinet">{{cite news|publisher=Ynet news|last1=Benhorin|first1=Yitzhak|last2=Associated Press|title=Cabinet: All non-military items can enter Gaza freely|date=20 June 2010|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3907978,00.html|access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref> Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of [[Ashdod]].<ref name="JTA Reaction mixed">{{Cite news|last=Oster |first=Marcy |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |title=Reaction mixed to Israeli announcement on easing of Gaza blockade |date=21 June 2010 |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/21/2739697/israel-announces-plan-to-ease-gaza-blockade |access-date=21 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806062346/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/21/2739697/israel-announces-plan-to-ease-gaza-blockade |archive-date= 6 August 2011 }}</ref>

Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper ''[[Hürriyet]]'' that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for the May 2010 [[Gaza flotilla raid]] (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered an apology to Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade by Israel.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Economy of the State of Palestine#Israeli–Palestinian relations}}
Since the beginning of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the conflict has been about land.<ref name="100 years of war">{{cite book |last=Gelvin|first=James L.|title=The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: 100 Years of War|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York}}</ref> When [[Israel]] became a state after the war in 1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.<ref name="Nakba book">{{cite book|last=Sa'id & Abu-Lughod |first=Ahmad & Lila|title=Nakba: Palestine, 1948, and the Claims of Memory|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}</ref> Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and fuels Palestine's export economy.<ref name="CERP Memo" /> According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population.<ref name="CERP Memo">{{cite news|title=Agriculture in Palestine: a post-Oslo Analysis|url=http://thecepr.org/images/stories/pdf/memo%20agriculture.pdf|access-date=24 April 2014|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904044734/http://thecepr.org/images/stories/pdf/memo%20agriculture.pdf|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine.

Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including Israeli military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank.<ref name="National Land Bans">{{cite news|title=Palestinians lose billions to Israeli land bans, says World Bank report|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/palestinians-lose-billions-to-israeli-land-bans-says-world-bank-report|access-date=13 April 2014|newspaper=The National|date=8 October 2013}}</ref>

====The West Bank barrier====
[[File:Gate at Masha.jpg|thumb|The barrier between Israel and Palestine and an example of one of the Israeli-controlled checkpoints]]

With the construction of the [[separation barrier]], the Israeli state promised free movement across regions.

====Boycotts====
{{See also|Economy of the Palestinian territories|Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions}}
In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The PA's Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures. There has also been an economic embargo initiated by the west on Hamas-led Palestine, which has decreased the amount of imports and exports from Palestine.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This embargo was brought on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood. As a result, the PA's 160,000 employees have not received their salaries in over one year.<ref name="Embargo Q&A">{{cite news|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Q&A: Palestinian Embargo|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6768931.stm|access-date=30 April 2014|publisher=BBC Jerusalem|date=19 June 2007}}</ref>

===Actions toward stabilizing the conflict===
In response to a weakening trend in Palestinian violence and growing economic and [[security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority]], the Israeli military has removed over 120 check points in 2010 and plans on disengaging from major Palestinian population areas. According to the IDF, terrorist activity in the West Bank decreased by 97% compared to violence in 2002.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=190588 "2009 W.Bank terror activity down by 97% compared to 2002."] ''Jerusalem Post''. 10 July 2010.</ref>

Since the [[Second Intifada]], Israel has banned Jewish Israelis from entering Palestinian cities. However, Israeli Arabs are allowed to enter West Bank cities on weekends.

The Palestinian Authority has petitioned the Israeli military to allow Jewish tourists to visit West Bank cities as "part of an effort" to improve the Palestinian economy. Israeli general [[Avi Mizrahi]] spoke with Palestinian security officers while touring malls and soccer fields in the West Bank. Mizrahi gave permission to allow Israeli tour guides into Bethlehem, a move intended to "contribute to the Palestinian and Israeli economies."<ref>Katz.

Beginning in 1993 with the [[Oslo peace process]], Israel recognizes "the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people", though Israel does not recognize the State of Palestine.<ref>''Facts About Israel''. Jerusalem: Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2010. p. 52.</ref> In return, it was agreed that Palestinians would promote peaceful co-existence, renounce violence and promote recognition of Israel among their own people. Despite Yasser Arafat's official renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel, some Palestinian groups continue to practice and advocate violence against civilians and do not recognize Israel as a legitimate political entity.<ref name="SelaConflict">{{harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Arab-Israel Conflict"|pp=58–121}}</ref><ref name="CaseforIsrael">[[Alan Dershowitz|Dershowitz]].

The [[Palestinian Authority]] is considered corrupt by a wide variety of sources, including some Palestinians.<ref>{{harvnb|Sela|2002|loc="Palestinian Authority"|pp=673–679}}</ref><ref>[[Mitchell G.

====Societal attitudes====
Societal attitudes in both Israel and Palestine are a source of concern to those promoting dispute resolution.

According to a May 2011 poll carried out by the Palestinian Center For Public Opinion that asked Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, "which of the following means is the best to end the occupation and lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state", 5.0% supported "military operations", 25.0% supported non-violent popular resistance, 32.1% favored negotiations until an agreement could be reached, 23.1% preferred holding an international conference that would impose a solution on all parties, 12.4% supported seeking a solution through the United Nations, and 2.4% otherwise. Approximately three-quarters of Palestinians surveyed believed that a military escalation in the Gaza Strip would be in Israel's interest and 18.9% said it would be in Hamas's interest. Regarding the resumption of launching Al-Qassam missiles from Gaza into Israel, 42.5% said "strongly oppose", 27.1% "somewhat oppose", 16.0% "somewhat support", 13.8% "strongly support", and 0.2% expressed no opinion.<ref name=pcpo-poll176>{{cite web|title=Poll No. 176 |url=http://www.pcpo.ps/polls/poll176.htm |publisher=Palestinian Center For Public Opinion |access-date=7 July 2011 |date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027040955/http://www.pcpo.ps/polls/poll176.htm |archive-date=27 October 2011 }}</ref>

The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed concerns that Hamas promote incitement against and overall non-acceptance of Israel, including promotion of violence against Israel.<ref name="MFA headlines"/><ref name="MFA incitement"/>

====Palestinian army====
The Israeli Cabinet issued a statement{{when|date=June 2020}} expressing that it does not wish the Palestinians to build up an army capable of offensive operations, considering that the only party against which such an army could be turned in the near future is Israel itself. However, Israel has already allowed for the creation of a Palestinian police that can conduct police operations and also carry out limited-scale warfare. Palestinians{{Vague|date=April 2008}} have argued that the [[Israel Defense Forces]], a large and modern armed force, poses a direct and pressing threat to the sovereignty of any future Palestinian state, making a defensive force for a Palestinian state a matter of necessity. To this, Israelis claim that signing a treaty while building an army is a show of bad intentions.

Since 2006, the United States has been training, equipping, and funding the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which have been cooperating with Israel at unprecedented levels in the [[West Bank]] to quell supporters of Hamas, the main Palestinian Islamist group that opposes direct negotiations with [[Israel]].<ref name="Nathan Thrall"/> The United States government has spent over 500 million building and training the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.<ref name="Nathan Thrall"/> The IDF maintains that the US-trained forces will soon be capable of "overrunning small IDF outposts and isolated Israeli communities" in the event of a conflict.<ref>Glick, Caroline B.

Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties in [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Israel]].

===Criticism of casualty statistics===
As reported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, since 29 September 2000 a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the 6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate in fighting at the time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis, including 741 civilians. 124 of those killed were minors.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=189392 "B'Tselem: Since 2000, 7,454 Israelis, Palestinians killed."] ''Jerusalem Post''. 27 September 2010.</ref>

The Israeli-based [[International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism]] criticized the methodology of Israeli and Palestinian rights groups, including B'tselem, and questioned their accuracy in classifying civilian/combatant ratios.<ref>Mor, Avi, et al. [http://www.ict.org.il/Portals/0/Articles/ICT_Cast_Lead_Casualties-A_Closer_Look.pdf "Casualties in Operation Cast Lead: A closer look."] Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. 2009. PDF.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/Nixon/TargetedKillings.pdf |title=Targeted Killings: Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Counterterrorism Policy |date=January 2005|access-date=9 August 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3774217,00.html "B'Tselem: 773 of Palestinians killed in Cast Lead were civilians."] ''Ynetnews''. 9 September 2009.</ref>

In a study published by Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, Elihu D. Richter and Dr. Yael Stein examined B'Tselem's methods in calculating casualties during Operation Cast Lead. They argue that B'Tselem's report contains "errors of omission, commission and classification bias which result in overestimates of the ratio of non-combatants to combatants."<ref name=SPME>Richter, Elihu D. and Yael Stein. [http://spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=5980 "Comments on B'Tselem's Civilian Casualty Estimates in Operation Cast Lead." Scholars for Peace in the Middle East]. 13 September 2009.</ref> Stein and Richter claim the high male/female ratios among Palestinians, including those in their mid-to-late teens, "suggests that the IDF classifications are combatant and non-combatant status are probably far more accurate than those of B'Tselem."<ref name=SPME />

In a study on behalf of the [[International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism]], Don Radlauer suggested that "almost all Palestinians killed in this conflict have been male—and absent any other reasonable explanation for such a non-random pattern of fatalities—this suggests that large numbers of Palestinian men and teenaged boys made a choice to confront Israeli forces, even after many of their compatriots had been killed in such confrontations."<ref>Radlauer, Don.

Retrieved 8 March 2013.</ref>

===Land mine and explosive remnants of war casualties===
A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather [[land mine]] and [[explosive remnants of war]] (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian territories.<ref name="unmas">{{cite web|url=http://www.mineaction.org/country.asp?c=138 |title=Country Overviews – Occupied Palestinian Territory |year=2009 |publisher=United Nations Mine Action Service |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926225134/http://mineaction.org/country.asp?c=138 |archive-date=26 September 2010 }}</ref> In 2009, the [[United Nations Mine Action Service|United Nations Mine Action Centre]] reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and that 12 people have been killed and 27 injured since the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]].<ref name="unmas" /> The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from "ERW left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces."<ref name="unmas" /> There are at least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with Jordan. The [[Palestinian National Security Forces]] do not have maps or records of the minefields.<ref name="unmas" />
