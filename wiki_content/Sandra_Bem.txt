'''Sandra Ruth Lipsitz Bem''' (June 22, 1944 – May 20, 2014) was an American psychologist known for her works in [[androgyny]] and [[gender studies]]. Her pioneering work on [[gender role]]s, [[gender polarization]]<ref name=twsDaniels>Polygendered and Ponytailed: The Dilemma of Femininity and the Female Athlete, 2009, Women's Press, Dayna B.

==Influences on the field of psychology==
Bem was an American [[Psychology|psychologist]] known for her works in [[androgyny]] and [[gender studies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/sandrabem.html |title=Sandra Ruth Lipsitz Bem |work=Women's Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society |publisher=Webster.edu |access-date=2012-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704084445/http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/sandrabem.html |archive-date=2012-07-04 }}</ref> Bem and her husband [[Daryl Bem]] advocated egalitarian marriage. The husband-wife team became highly demanded as speakers on the negative impacts of sex role stereotypes on individuals and society. At the time, there was a lack of empirical evidence to support their assertions because this was uncharted territory, and so Sandra Bem became very interested and determined to gather data that would support the detrimental and limiting effects of traditional sex roles.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In her early career, she was heavily involved in [[women's liberation movement]], and she did work on sex-biased job advertising. Her involvement led to being a contributor to landmark cases concerning recruitment of women in the work force against companies such as AT&T and the Pittsburgh Press.<ref name="Ove" />

Early on in Bem's career she created the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] (BSRI), which is an inventory that acknowledges that individuals may exhibit both male and female characteristics.<ref name="George">[http://www.feministvoices.com/sandra-bem/ Psychologist's Feminist Voices. ]</ref> The BSRI is a scale developed to determine what kind of sex role an individual fulfills. It is a self-report inventory that asks participants how well 60 different attributes describe themselves by using a seven-point scale.  These attributes reflect the definition of masculinity (20 questions) and femininity (20 questions), and the remaining 20 questions were merely filler questions (Bem, 1993). In this inventory the feminine and masculine items were chosen on what was culturally appropriate for males and females at that time in the early 1970s. The BSRI was later used to measure [[psychological flexibility]] and behavioral indicators.<ref name="George" /> Bem also developed the [[gender schema theory]]. According to the gender schema theory, "the child learns to evaluate his or her adequacy as a person in terms of the gender schema, to match his or her preferences, attitudes, behaviors, and personal attributes against the prototypes stored within it."<ref>Bem, S.L. (1981).
 Gender schema theory; A cognitive account of sex typing, Psychological Review, 88(4), 354-364</ref> This theory states that an individual uses gender as a way to organize various things in a person's life into categories. Her research questioned the social beliefs and assumptions that sex roles are opposite, bipolar, and mutually exclusive. The data she collected were supportive of a merging of male and female traits to enable a person to be a fully functioning, adaptive human over an emphasis on gender stereotypes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

She asserted that masculine and feminine dimensions could be divided into two spheres, rather than one:   
A person with high masculine and low feminine identification would be categorized as "masculine". 
A person with high feminine identification and low masculine identification, would be categorized as "feminine".  
A person who had high identification with both characteristics would be categorized as "androgynous".  
A person who has low identification with both dimensions would be considered "undifferentiated".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.be-me.org/learningpackages/package2/2.asp |title=Psychologist Sandra Bem |publisher=BE-ME Education |access-date=2012-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304115348/http://www.be-me.org/learningpackages/package2/2.asp |archive-date=2012-03-04 }}</ref>

One of Bem's main arguments was that traditional gender roles are restrictive for both men and women, and can have negative consequences for individuals as well as society as a whole.

As previously mentioned, a person could be categorized as "androgynous" when taking the BSRI. Androgyny is defined as "the integration of both masculinity and femininity in a single individual". Androgyny allows one to freely engage in both masculine and feminine behaviors. According to Bem, people's behavior can demonstrate what she defined as situational appropriateness. Situational appropriateness is demonstrated when behavior is reflective of one's environment. For example, a woman demonstrating knowledge of sports at a basketball game is appropriate. Androgyny may also blend modalities. An example of androgyny blending modalities would be a woman being both assertive and compassionate when firing someone from a job.<ref>Bem,S.L.(1974). The measure of psychological androgyny. Journal of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, 42(2), 155-162</ref>

==Awards and honors==
Sandra Bem received many awards for her research. Her first was the [[American Psychological Association]] Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career contribution to Psychology in 1976. In 1977 she was awarded the Distinguished Publication Award of the Association of Women in Psychology and in 1980 she received the Young Scholar Award of the [[American Association of University Women]] (Makosky, 1990). In 1995, she was selected as an “Eminent Woman in Psychology” by the Divisions of General Psychology and History of Psychology of the American Psychological Association.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bem|first=Sandra|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://psych.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/slb6_vita.pdf|publisher=Cornell University}}</ref> Critics of Bem's work generally argued against the political nature of her theories and her objectivity in the material which she studied.

==Education and career==
Bem attended [[Margaret Morrison Carnegie College]], now known as [[Carnegie–Mellon University]],<ref name="Koesterer">[http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/sandrabem2.htm], Women’s Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society.</ref> (1961–1965) and majored in psychology. She recalls the head of the counseling center, Bob Morgan, encouraging her to study to become a psychiatrist. This was the first time such a high-status career had ever been suggested to her.<ref>{{cite journal |date=1977 |title=Sandra Lipsitz Bem: Early career award. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=88–91 |doi=10.1037/h0078488|last1=No Authorship Indicated }}</ref> Subsequently, she entered the [[University of Michigan]] in 1965 and obtained her Ph.D. in [[developmental psychology]] in 1968.<ref name="Makosky">Parker Makosky, V.,(1990). In, A. O'Connell & W. Felipe Russo (Eds.), Women in psychology: A bio-bibliographic sourcebook,(pp. 30–39). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press Inc.</ref> Her dissertation focused primarily on cognitive processing and problem solving with young children. Her main influence while at the University of Michigan was experimental psychologist David Birch. Her early work focused on the behavior of young children and their ability to solve problems, and utilize self-control and instruction.

After obtaining her Ph.D., Bem got a full-time tenure-track position as a professor at Carnegie-Mellon for three years and then moved on to work at [[Stanford University]], where she worked until 1978. She left Stanford University because her application for tenure was denied. She and husband [[Daryl Bem]] both took tenured teaching positions at [[Cornell University]] in 1978, where she became a psychology professor and the director of the women's studies program.<ref name="Bem 1998"/><ref name="Koesterer"/> While at Cornell, Bem focused research on [[gender schema theory]], sexuality, and [[clinical psychology]] until she retired in 2010.<ref name="George"/>

==Personal life==
Bem was born June 22, 1944 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] to Peter and Lillian Lipsitz. She grew up in a working class family with one younger sister, Beverly. Both of Bem's parents worked throughout her life, so she grew up with the assumption that she would always be working. Her mother encouraged her to be the absolute best that she could be, and that "being just a housewife was not very desirable."<ref name=Makosky />

Bem's first career goal was to be a secretary like her mother, so that she could have her own phone and desk – symbols of autonomy and status that her father never had.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|title=Sandra Lipsitz Bem: Early career award|journal=American Psychologist|date=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=88–91|doi=10.1037/h0078488|last1=No Authorship Indicated}}</ref> Bem was raised by her [[Jewish]] working class parents in a government-subsidized neighborhood for the first eight years of her life. During Bem's childhood, her mother would have violent outburst and fights with her father causing her family much distress.<ref name="Koesterer"/> Her mother was the dominant figure in her parents' relationship, and Bem recalls having a very tumultuous childhood, during which Mrs. Lipsitz would become extremely emotional while upset and throw objects during arguments.<ref>{{cite web|last=George|first=M.|title=Profile of Sandra Bem|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/sandra-bem/|publisher=Psychology's Feminist Voices Multimedia Internet Archive}}</ref> Bem also stated that she was quite unsuccessful in her attempts at flirting and dating with men, and so she internalized a belief that no man would ever want to marry her, which helped to solidify her career ambitions.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

But she eventually married [[Daryl Bem]], also a psychology professor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nussbaum |first1=Emily |date=May–June 1998 |title=Does the exotic become erotic? |journal=Lingua Franca |url=http://www.emilynussbaum.com/lingua_franca/1998/05/does_the_exotic_become_erotic.php |access-date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> The two met when she took his social psychology class at [[Carnegie–Mellon University]]. She was 20 years old at the time. She initially rejected his marriage proposal, having concerns about her own career. The two later agreed on an egalitarian marriage, in which they agreed to share in making decisions, doing household chores, supporting each other's careers, and performing parenting duties – all as equally as possible. With this in place, she consented to the marriage.<ref name="Bem 1998">{{cite book|last=Bem|first=Sandra|title=An Unconventional Family|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300090925}}</ref> After months of dating, the two were married on June 6, 1965. Much of Bem's family, including her mother, would not attend the wedding because it was a non-Jewish affair and they did not agree with this decision.<ref name="Koesterer"/>

The Bems had two children together.<ref name="Koesterer"/> They also had a grandson, Felix Viksne Bem (son of daughter Emily). While they eventually chose to live separately, they remained married until Sandra's death on May 20, 2014.

==Illness and death==
Bem was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, four years after diagnosis and after pursuing experimental treatments, she followed through with her plan to die by  [[Assisted suicide|suicide]] at her home in Ithaca on May 20, 2014.<ref name=Ove>{{cite news|last=Ove|first=Torsten|title=Obituary: Sandra Bem / Psychologist, feminist, pioneer in gender roles|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2014/05/23/Obituary-Sandra-Bem-Psychologist-feminist-pioneer-in-gender-roles/stories/201405230080|access-date=23 May 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=22 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Henig|first1=Robin Marantz|title=The Last Day of Her Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/magazine/the-last-day-of-her-life.html|access-date=May 16, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2015}}</ref> Her husband, Daryl, was present with her when she died.
