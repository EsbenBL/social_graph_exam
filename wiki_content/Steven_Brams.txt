'''Steven J. Brams''' (born November 28, 1940 in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]) is an American [[game theory|game theorist]] and [[political scientist]] at the [[New York University]] Department of Politics. Brams is best known for using the techniques of [[game theory]], [[public choice theory]], and [[social choice theory]] to analyze [[voting systems]] and [[fair division]]. He is one of the independent discoverers of [[approval voting]],<ref>Co-authored with Peter C. Fisburn (1978). "Approval Voting". ''American Political Science Review.'' '''72''' (3): 831-847. do: 10.2307/1955105 (https://doi.org/10.2307/1955105). JSTOR 1955105 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/1955105).</ref> as well as extensions of approval voting to multiple-winner elections to give proportional representation of different interests.<ref>Co-authored with D. Marc Kilgour, and Richard D. Potthoff (2018. "Multiwinner Approval Voting: An Appointment Approach". ''Public Choice'', forthcoming.</ref>

Brams was a co-discoverer, with [[Alan D. Taylor|Alan Taylor]], of the first [[envy-free cake-cutting]] solution for ''n'' people.<ref>Co-authored with Alan D. Taylor (January 1995). "An Envy-Free Cake Division Protocol". ''American Mathematical Monthly''. Mathematical Association of America. '''102'''(1):9-18. doi:10.2307/2974850). JSTOR 2974850 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2974850).</ref>
Previous to the [[Brams-Taylor procedure]], the cake-cutting problem had been one of the most important open problems in contemporary mathematics.<ref>

==Education==
Brams earned his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in Politics, Economics, and Science in 1962. In 1966, he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Political Science]] at [[Northwestern University]].

==Career==
Brams worked briefly in U.S. federal government positions and for the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] before taking an assistant professor position at [[Syracuse University]] in 1967. He moved to [[New York University]] in 1969, where he is professor in the Department of Politics. He has been a visiting professor at the [[University of Rochester]], the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of California, Irvine]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University]].

In 1990-1991 he was president of the Peace Science Society (International);<ref>Peace Science Society (International) http://pss.la.psu.edu {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413215748/http://pss.la.psu.edu/ |date=2011-04-13 }}</ref> in 2004–2006, he was president of the Public Choice Society.<ref>Public Choice Society:  Past Presidents http://www.publicchoicesociety.org/webpages.asp?wpid=2#presidents {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202015157/http://www.publicchoicesociety.org/webpages.asp?wpid=2#presidents |date=2012-12-02 }}</ref>
<ref>Public Choice Society http://www.publicchoicesociety.org</ref> He is a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] (1986–87), an [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] Fellow (1992), and was a [[Russell Sage Foundation]] Visiting Scholar (1998–99).
