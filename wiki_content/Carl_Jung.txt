{{Psychoanalysis}}
'''Carl Gustav Jung''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ʊ|ŋ}} {{Respell|YUUNG}};<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref><ref>{{cite EPD|18}}</ref> born '''Karl Gustav Jung''', {{IPA-de|kaʁl ˈjʊŋ|lang}}; 26 July 1875&nbsp;– 6 June 1961), was a Swiss [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] who founded [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's work has been influential in the fields of [[psychiatry]], anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Darowski|first1=Emily|last2=Darowski|first2=Joseph|date=1 June 2016|title=Carl Jung's Historic Place in Psychology and Continuing Influence in Narrative Studies and American Popular Culture|url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/sahs_review/vol52/iss2/2|journal=Swiss American Historical Society Review|volume=52|issue=2|issn=0883-4814}}</ref> and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous [[Burghölzli]] hospital, under [[Eugen Bleuler]]. During this time, he came to the attention of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]]. The two men conducted a [[The Freud/Jung Letters|lengthy correspondence]] and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.

Freud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his "new science" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to follow his older colleague's doctrine and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis.

Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [[synchronicity]], [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal phenomena]], the [[collective unconscious]], the [[Complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] and [[extraversion and introversion]].

Jung was also an artist, craftsman, builder and a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Life of Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781446218921.n1|work=Carl Gustav Jung|year=2001|pages=1–38|place=1 Oliver's Yard, 55 City Road, London EC1Y 1SP United Kingdom|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|doi=10.4135/9781446218921.n1|isbn=978-0-7619-6238-0|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref>

Paul Jung, Carl's father, was the youngest son of noted German-Swiss professor of Medicine at [[Basel]], [[Karl Gustav Jung]] (1794–1864).<ref>Bair, pp. 8–13.</ref> Paul's hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, and he did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]. Emilie Preiswerk, Carl's mother, had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished [[Basel]] churchman and academic, [[Samuel Preiswerk]] (1799–1871), and his second wife. Samuel Preiswerk was an ''[[Antistes]]'', the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a [[Hebraist]], author, and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at [[Basel University]].<ref name="Wehr"/>{{rp|[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17 17–19]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/17}}

Jung's father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in [[Laufen-Uhwiesen|Laufen]], when Jung was six years old.  At this time, tensions between father and mother had developed. Jung's mother was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom, where she said that spirits visited her at night.<ref name="Memories, Dreams, Reflections">{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections|page=18}}</ref> Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.<ref name="Memories, Dreams, Reflections"/>

Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near [[Basel]] for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with "innate unreliability", whereas "father" meant for him reliability but also powerlessness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|page=5|last=Dunne|first=Claire|publisher=Continuum|year=2002}}</ref> In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the "handicap I started off with. Later, these early impressions were revised: I have trusted men friends and been disappointed by them, and I have mistrusted women and was not disappointed."<ref>''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', p. 8.</ref> After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer. In 1879 he was called to {{ill|Basel-Kleinhüningen|de|lt=Kleinhüningen}}, next to Basel, where his family lived in a parsonage of the church.{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=233}} The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy.<ref>Bair, p. 25.</ref> When he was nine years old, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884–1935) was born.

====Memories of childhood====
Jung was a solitary and introverted child. From childhood, he believed that like his mother,<ref>{{cite web|last=Stepp|first=G|title=Carl Jung: Forever Jung|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-carl-jung/50365.aspx|work=Vision Journal|access-date=19 December 2011}}</ref> he had two personalities—a modern Swiss citizen and a personality more suited to the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections|pages=33–34}}</ref> "Personality Number 1", as he termed it, was a typical schoolboy living in the era of the time. "Personality Number 2" was a dignified, authoritative, and influential man from the past. Although Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith.<ref>Wehr records that Paul Jung's chosen career path was to achieve a doctorate in philology. He was an Arabist, but the family money ran out for his studies. Relief came from a family legacy, however, a condition of the will was that it should only be offered to a family member who intended to study theology and become a pastor. Paul Jung, therefore, had his career determined by a will, not his will. See page 20.</ref>

Some childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.<ref name="art-therapy">{{cite book|last=Malchiodi|first=Cathy A.|title=The Art Therapy Sourcebook|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vno0XgRuRhcC&pg=PA134|isbn=978-0-07-146827-5|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}</ref> He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with [[totem]]s in [[indigenous cultures]], such as the collection of soul-stones near [[Arlesheim]] or the ''[[tjurunga]]s'' of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=22–23}}</ref> His observations about symbols, [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], and the [[collective unconscious]] were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 144</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref>

At the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him—"now you won't have to go to school anymore."<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=30}}</ref> From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had [[epilepsy]]. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]]. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, "was when I learned what a [[neurosis]] is."<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=32}}</ref>

====University studies and early career====
[[File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-035.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Basel]], where Jung studied between 1895 and 1900.]]
Initially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a preacher or minister in his early life. There was a strong moral sense in his household and several of his family members were clergymen as well. For a time, Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach archaeology. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided instead to pursue psychiatry and medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung|title=Carl Jung {{!}} Biography, Theory, & Facts|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=9 April 2019}}</ref> His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.<ref name="jungbio1">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html Carl Jung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120004057/http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html |date=20 January 2018 }}. Retrieved 7 March 2009</ref> In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the [[University of Basel]]. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 57.</ref> During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of [[Goethe]] and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Gerhard|title=Jung: A Biography|year=1987|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston/Shaftesbury, Dorset|isbn=978-0-87773-455-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/jungbiography0000wehr/page/14}}</ref>

In 1900, Jung moved to [[Zürich]] and began working at the [[Burghölzli]] psychiatric hospital under [[Eugen Bleuler]].{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|pp=234, 259}} Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]]. Jung's [[dissertation]], published in 1903, was titled ''On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena.'' It was based on the analysis of the supposed [[mediumship]] of Jung's cousin Hélène Preiswerk, under the influence of Freud's contemporary [[Théodore Flournoy]].<ref>Stevens, Anthony (1994): ''Jung, A very short introduction'', Oxford University Press, Oxford & N.Y.</ref> Jung also studied with [[Pierre Janet]] in Paris in 1902<ref>Gay, p. 198</ref> and later equated his view of the [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] with Janet's ''idée fixe subconsciente''.<ref>Ellenberger, p. 149.</ref> In 1905, Jung was appointed as a permanent 'senior' doctor at the hospital and also became a lecturer ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in the medical faculty of Zurich University.<ref>Wehr, pp. 79–85.</ref> In 1904, he published with [[Franz Riklin]] their ''Diagnostic Association Studies'', of which Freud obtained a copy.<ref>Jung, Carl Gustav & Riklin, Franz Beda: Diagnoistische Assoziationsstudien.

Eventually, a close friendship and a strong professional association developed between the elder [[#Relationship with Freud|Freud and Jung]], which left a sizeable [[Freud-Jung Letters|correspondence]]. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'', which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating that the other was unable to admit he could be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. [[Henri Ellenberger]] called Jung's intense experience a "creative illness" and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called [[neurasthenia]] and [[hysteria]].<ref name="hayman2001">{{cite book|last=Hayman|first=Ronald|title=A Life of Jung|year=2001|edition=1st American|publisher=W.W.

In 1903, Jung married [[Emma Jung|Emma Rauschenbach]], seven years his junior and the elder daughter of a wealthy industrialist in eastern Switzerland, Johannes Rauschenbach-Schenck, and his wife.{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=234}} Rauschenbach was the owner, among other concerns, of [[IWC Schaffhausen]]—the International Watch Company, manufacturers of luxury time-pieces. Upon his death in 1905, his two daughters and their husbands became owners of the business. Jung's brother-in-law—[[Ernst Homberger]]—became the principal proprietor, but the Jungs remained shareholders in a thriving business that ensured the family's financial security for decades.<ref>

She eventually became a noted psychoanalyst in her own right. They had five children: Agathe, Gret, Franz, Marianne, and Helene. The marriage lasted until Emma died in 1955.<ref>Wehr, G. p. 423</ref>

During his marriage, Jung allegedly engaged in extramarital relationships.

===Wartime army service===
During World War I, Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made commandant of an internment camp for British officers and soldiers. The Swiss were neutral and obliged to intern personnel from either side of the conflict who crossed their frontier to evade capture. Jung worked to improve the conditions of soldiers stranded in Switzerland and encouraged them to attend university courses.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Vivianne|title=Jung: A Journey of Transformation|year=1999|publisher=Quest Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/jung00vivi/page/56 56]|isbn=978-0-8356-0782-7|url=https://archive.org/details/jung00vivi/page/56}}</ref>{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=260}}

===Relationship with Freud===

====Meeting and collaboration====

Jung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung's life. Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. In 1900, Jung completed his degree and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] at Burghölzli Hospital.<ref>Wehr, Gerhard. (1987). ''Jung – A Biography''. Boston/Shaftesbury: Shambhala. {{ISBN|0 87773 455 0}}. p.&nbsp;77</ref> It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899). In the early 1900s [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new "psycho-analysis". At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burghölzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. Jung sent Freud a copy of his ''Studies in Word Association'' in 1906.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=July 1990|title=William McGuire, Ed.

In 1909, Jung travelled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst [[Sándor Ferenczi]] to the United States; they took part in a conference at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts. The conference at Clark University was planned by the psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America. This forged welcome links between Jung and influential Americans.<ref name=king>{{Cite book|last=Rosenzwieg |first=Saul |title=Freud, Jung and Hall the King-Maker |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-88937-110-1}}</ref> Jung returned to the United States the next year for a brief visit.

In 1910 Freud proposed Jung, "his adopted eldest son, his crown prince and successor", for the position of lifetime President of the newly formed [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. However, after forceful objections from his Viennese colleagues, it was agreed Jung would be elected to serve a two-year term of office.<ref>{{cite book|last=Makari|first=George|title=Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis|publisher=Duckworth|date=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/revolutioninmind0000maka/page/249 249]|isbn=9780715637593|url=https://archive.org/details/revolutioninmind0000maka/page/249}}</ref>

====Divergence and break====
[[File:Jung 1910-crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jung outside Burghölzli in 1910]]
While Jung worked on his ''Psychology of the Unconscious: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido'', tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of [[libido]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Carl|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections|url=https://archive.org/details/memoriesdreamsre00jung|url-access=registration|year=1963|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoriesdreamsre00jung/page/206 206]}}</ref> Jung {{nowrap|de-emphasized}} the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Heth|title=Psychology: The Science of Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/434 434]|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/434}}</ref>

In 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague [[Ludwig Binswanger]] in [[Kreuzlingen]] without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as "the Kreuzlingen gesture". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the [[Fordham University]] lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' (subsequently republished as ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]''). While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a "psychoanalytical Jung" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless it was their publication which, Jung declared, "cost me my friendship with Freud".<ref name="Gay 2006 225">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Gay|title= Freud: A Life for Our Time|publisher=Norton| date =2006 | pages = 225}}</ref>

Another primary disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.<ref>Mary Williams, "The Indivisibility of the Personal and Collective Unconscious", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'' 8.1, January 1963. See also: Jung, ''Collected Works'' vol. 9.I (1959), "The Concept of the Collective Unconscious" (1936), ¶91 (p. 43).</ref> Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete and unnecessarily negative and inelastic. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jun/06/carl-jung-freud-nazis|title=Carl Jung, part 2: A troubled relationship with Freud – and the Nazis|last=Vernon|first=Mark|date=6 June 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=19 July 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Jung's observations overlap to an extent with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the "[[personal unconscious]]", but his hypothesis is more about a process than a static model and he also proposed the existence of a second, overarching form of the unconscious beyond the personal, that he named the psychoid — a term borrowed from neo-vitalist philosopher and embryologist [[Hans Driesch]] (1867-1941) - but with a somewhat altered meaning.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Addison, Ann|title=Jung, vitalism and the ''psychoid'': an historical reconstruction|journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology|year=2009|volume=54|issue=1|pages=123–42|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5922.2008.01762.x|pmid=19161521}}</ref> The [[collective unconscious]] is not so much a 'geographical location', but a deduction from the alleged ubiquity of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] over space and time.

In November 1912, Jung and Freud met in [[Munich]] for a meeting among prominent colleagues to discuss psychoanalytical journals.<ref name=jones1963>Jones, Ernest, ed. [[Lionel Trilling]] and Steven Marcus. ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'', New York: Anchor Books, 1963.</ref> At a talk about a new psychoanalytic essay on [[Amenhotep IV]], Jung expressed his views on how it related to actual conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement. While Jung spoke, Freud suddenly fainted and Jung carried him to a couch.<ref name="theguardian" />

Jung and Freud personally met for the last time in September 1913 for the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the [[introvert]]ed and [[extravert]]ed type in [[analytical psychology]].

===Midlife isolation===
It was the publication of Jung's book ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' in 1912 that led to the break with Freud. Letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his (posthumous) 1962 autobiography, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', as a "resounding censure". Everyone he knew dropped away except for two of his colleagues. Jung described his book as "an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview." The book was later revised and retitled ''Symbols of Transformation'' in 1922.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====London 1913–14====
Jung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of Constance Long who translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.<ref>McGuire, William. (1995), 'Firm Affinities: Jung's relations with Britain and the United States' in ''Journal of analytical Psychology'', '''40''', p. 301-326.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jung|first=C.

====''The Black Books and The Red Book''====
{{main|Red Book (Jung)|Black Books (Jung)}}
[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|left|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]
In 1913, at the age of thirty-eight, Jung experienced a horrible "confrontation with the unconscious". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was "menaced by a psychosis" or was "doing a schizophrenia". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, a process of "[[active imagination]]". He recorded everything he experienced in small journals, which Jung referred to in the singular as his ''[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Book]]'',<ref name="blackbooks">{{cite book |last1=Jung |first1=Carl |editor1-last=Shamdasani |editor1-first=Sonu |title=The Black Books of C.G.

Jung left no posthumous instructions about the final disposition of what he called the ''Liber Novus'' or the ''[[Red Book (Jung)|Red Book]]''. [[Sonu Shamdasani]], an historian of psychology from London, tried for three years to persuade Jung's resistant heirs to have it published. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it when the necessary additional funds needed were raised through the [[Philemon Foundation]].<ref name="Corbett"/>  Up to mid-September 2008, fewer than two dozen people had ever seen it.

In 2007, two technicians for DigitalFusion, working with New York City publishers [[W. W. Norton & Company]], scanned the manuscript with a 10,200-pixel scanner. It was published on 7 October 2009, in German with a "separate English translation along with Shamdasani's introduction and footnotes" at the back of the book. According to Sara Corbett, reviewing the text for ''[[The New York Times]]'', "The book is bombastic, baroque and like so much else about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an [[antediluvian]] and mystical reality."<ref name="Corbett"/>

The [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York City displayed Jung's ''Red Book'' leather folio, as well as some of his original "Black Book" journals, from 7 October 2009 to 15 February 2010.<ref name="Rubin">{{cite web|url=http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/exhibitions/view/308 |title=The Red Book of C.

===Travels===
Jung emerged from his period of isolation in the late nineteen-teens with the publication of several journal articles, followed in 1921 with ''[[Psychological Types]]'', one of his most influential books. There followed a decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels.

====England (1920, 1923, 1925, 1935, 1938, 1946)====
Constance Long arranged for Jung to deliver a seminar in [[Cornwall]] in 1920. Another seminar was held in 1923, this one organized by Jung's British protégé [[Helton Godwin Baynes]] (known as "Peter") (1882-1943), and another in 1925.<ref name="McGuire"/>

In 1935, at the invitation of his close British friends and colleagues, H. G. Baynes, [[Edward Armstrong Bennet|E. A. Bennet]] and [[Hugh Crichton-Miller]], Jung gave a series of lectures at the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] in London, later published as part of the ''Collected Works''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jung, C.G.|title=Tavistock Lectures, in The Symbolic Life|series= Collected Works, vol.18 |location = London | publisher = Routledge| year =1935|pages=1–182|isbn=0-7100-8291-6|author-link=Carl Jung}}</ref>

In 1938, Jung was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of Oxford]].{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=261}} At the tenth International Medical Congress for Psychotherapy held at Oxford from 29 July to 2 August 1938, Jung gave the presidential address, followed by a visit to [[Cheshire]] to stay with the Bailey family at Lawton Mere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lunding|first1=N.

In 1946, Jung agreed to become the first Honorary President of the newly formed [[Society of Analytical Psychology]] in London, having previously approved its training programme devised by [[Michael Fordham]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kirsch, Thomas B.|title =The Jungians: a Comparative and Historical Perspective|publisher=Routledge|date=2012|page=40|isbn=9781134725519}}</ref>

====United States 1909–1912, 1924–25, 1936–37====
During the period of Jung's [[#Relationship with Freud|collaboration with Freud]], both visited the US in 1909 to lecture at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts<ref name=king/> where both were awarded honorary degrees. In 1912 Jung gave a series of lectures at Fordham University, New York which were published later in the year as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]''.<ref name="Gay 2006 225"/> Jung made a more extensive trip westward in the winter of 1924–5, financed and organized by Fowler McCormick and George Porter.

====East Africa====
In October 1925, Jung embarked on his most ambitious expedition, the "Bugishu Psychological Expedition" to East Africa. He was accompanied by his English friend, [[Helton Godwin Baynes|"Peter" Baynes]] and an American associate, [[George Beckwith (Carl Jung associate)|George Beckwith]]. On the voyage to Africa, they became acquainted with an English woman named Ruth Bailey, who joined their safari a few weeks later. The group traveled through Kenya and Uganda to the slopes of [[Mount Elgon]], where Jung hoped to increase his understanding of "primitive psychology" through conversations with the culturally isolated residents of that area. Later he concluded that the major insights he had gleaned had to do with himself and the European psychology in which he had been raised.<ref>{{cite book|title=Race and White Identity in Southern Fiction: From Faulkner to Morrison|url=https://archive.org/details/racewhiteidentit00duva|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/racewhiteidentit00duva/page/n185 165]|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|first=John N.|last=Duvall|isbn=9780230611825}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Burleson|first=Blake W.|title=Jung in Africa|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8264-6921-2}}</ref>  One of Jung's most famous proposed constructs is kinship libido. Jung defined this as an
instinctive feeling of belonging to a particular group or family and Jung believed it was vital to the human
experience and used this as an endogamous aspect of the libido and what lies amongst the family. This could be a term Jung learned during his trip to Africa and is similar to a Bantu term called Ubuntu that emphasizes humanity and almost the same meaning as kinship libido, which is, "I am because you are."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaughan |first1=A.G |title=African American cultural history and reflections on Jung in the African Diaspora |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |date=2019 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=320–348 |doi=10.1111/1468-5922.12501|pmid=31070251 }}</ref>

====India====
In December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself "under the direct influence of a foreign culture" for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but in India, he was able to converse extensively. Hindu philosophy became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with [[Ramana Maharshi]]. He described Ramana as being absorbed in "the self". Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of [[delirium]] in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bair |first=Deirdre |title= Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-316-07665-4 |pages=417–430}}</ref>

===Later years and death===

Jung became a full professor of medical psychology at the University of Basel in 1943 but resigned after a heart attack the next year to lead a more private life. He became ill again in 1952.{{sfn|Hoerni|Fischer|Kaufmann|2019|p=262}}

Jung continued to publish books until the end of his life, including ''Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies'' (1959), which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of [[UFO]]s.<ref>''The Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', p. 152, by Siegfried M.

==Thought==
Jung's thought was formed by early family influences, which on the maternal side were a blend of interest in the occult and in solid reformed academic theology. On his father's side were two important figures, his grandfather the physician and academic scientist, [[Karl Gustav Jung]] and the family's actual connection with Lotte Kestner, the niece of the German [[polymath]], Johann Wolfgang Goethe's "Löttchen".<ref>Wehr, Gerhard. p.14.</ref>  Although he was a practicing clinician and writer and as such founded [[analytical psychology]], much of his life's work was spent exploring other areas such as [[quantum physics]], [[vitalism]], [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy]] including [[epistemology]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and sociology, as well as literature and the arts. Jung's interest in philosophy and spiritual subjects led many to view him as a mystic, although his preference was to be seen as a man of science; Jung was unlike Freud heavily knowledgeable on philosophical concepts and aimed to link the branch of epistemology to the more modern theories of psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jung's metaphysic and epistemology: Platonism or Phenomenology? |url=http://mlwi.magix.net/jungmetaphysic.htm}}</ref><ref name="Lachmanpage258">{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=Jung the Mystic|year=2010|publisher=Tarcher/Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58542-792-5|page=258}}</ref>

===Key concepts===
Within the field of [[analytical psychology]], a brief survey of major concepts developed by Jung include (alphabetical):<ref>Anthony Stevens (1991) ''On Jung'' London: Penguin Books, pp. 27–53</ref>

* '''[[Anima and animus]]''' – (archetype) the contrasexual aspect of a person's psyche. In a woman's psyche, her inner personal masculine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image, comparably in a man's psyche, his inner personal feminine is conceived both as a complex and an archetypal image.
* '''[[Jungian archetypes|Archetype]]''' –  a concept "borrowed" from [[anthropology]] to denote supposedly universal and recurring mental images or themes. Jung's descriptions of archetypes varied over time.
* '''[[Jungian archetypes|Archetypal images]]''' – universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, often found in religious art, mythology, and fairy tales across cultures.
* '''[[Collective unconscious]]''' – aspects of unconsciousness experienced by all people in different cultures.
* '''[[Complex (psychology)|Complex]]''' – the repressed organisation of images and experiences that governs perception and behaviour.
* '''[[Extraversion and introversion]]''' – personality traits of degrees of openness or reserve contributing to [[psychological type]].<ref>Dicks-Mireaux, M. J. (1964). "Extraversion-Introversion in Experimental Psychology: Examples of Experimental Evidence and their Theoretical Explanations", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 9, 2.</ref>
* '''[[Individuation]]''' – the process of fulfilment of each individual "which negates neither the conscious or unconscious position but does justice to them both".<ref>Anthony Stevens (1991) ''On Jung'' London: Penguin Books, p. 199.</ref>
* '''[[Persona (psychology)|Persona]]''' – element of the personality that arises "for reasons of adaptation or personal convenience" – the "masks" one puts on in various situations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://journalpsyche.org/jungian-model-psyche/|title=The Jungian Model of the Psyche {{!}} Journal Psyche|website=journalpsyche.org|access-date=11 January 2020}}</ref>
* '''[[Psychological Types|Psychological types]]''' – a framework for consciously orienting psychotherapists to patients, by raising to consciousness particular modes of personality, differentiation between analyst and patient.
* '''[[Shadow (psychology)|Shadow]]''' – (archetype) the repressed, therefore unknown, aspects of the personality including those often considered to be negative.
* '''[[Self in Jungian psychology|Self]]''' – (archetype) the central overarching concept governing the individuation process, as symbolised by mandalas, the union of male and female, totality, unity. Jung viewed it as the psyche's central archetype.
* '''[[Synchronicity]]''' – an acausal principle as a basis for the apparently random simultaneous occurrence of phenomena.<ref>Bright, George. (1997) "Synchronicity as a basis of analytic attitude", ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 42, 4</ref>

===Collective unconscious===
{{main|Collective unconscious}}
Since the establishment of [[psychoanalytic theory]], the notion and meaning of individuals having a [[personal unconscious|''personal'' unconscious]] has gradually come to be common knowledge.  This was popularised by both Freud and Jung.  Whereas an individual's personal unconscious is made up of thoughts and emotions which have, at some time, been experienced or held in mind, but which have been repressed or forgotten, in contrast, the ''collective'' unconscious is neither acquired by activities within an individual's life, nor a container of things that are thoughts, memories or ideas which are capable of being conscious during one's life. The contents of it were never naturally "known" through physical or cognitive experience and then forgotten.

The collective unconscious consists of universal heritable elements common to all humans, distinct from other species.<ref>{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1  |chapter=''Psychological Aspects of the Mother Archetype'' |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 152 }}</ref> It encapsulates fields of evolutionary biology, history of civilization, ethnology, brain and nervous system development, and general psychological development.<ref name="CW9_1__90_92_118">{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1 |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 90-92,118 }}</ref> Considering its composition in practical physiological and psychological terms, "it consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents."<ref name="CW9_1__90_92_118" />  Specifically contrasting himself from the work of Freud and Adler, who were wholly concerned with personal psychology, Jung writes about causal factors in personal psychology, as stemming from, influenced by an abstraction of the impersonal physical layer, the common and universal physiology among all humans.<ref name="CW9_1__91">{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1 |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 91 }}</ref> Jung considers that science would hardly deny the existence and basic nature of 'instincts', existing as a whole set of motivating urges. The collective unconscious acts as the frame where science can distinguish individual motivating urges, thought to be universal across all individuals of the human species, while instincts are present in all species. Jung contends, "the hypothesis of the collective unconscious is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there are instincts."<ref name="CW9_1__90_92_118" />

{{main|Jungian archetypes}}
The archetype is a concept "borrowed" from [[anthropology]] to denote a process of nature.  Jung's definitions of archetypes varied over time and have been the subject of debate as to their usefulness. [[Jungian archetypes|Archetypal images]], also referred to as [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature|motifs in mythology]],{{efn-la|Also see other [[Motif (disambiguation)#General concepts|general concepts of 'motif']] covering visual arts, narrative, etcetera}}, are universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, are often found in religious art, mythology and fairy tales across cultures. 
Jung saw archetypes as pre-configurations in nature that give rise to repeating, understandable, describable experiences. In addition the concept takes into account the passage of time and of patterns resulting from transformation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1  |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 80-81 }}</ref> Archetypes are said to exist independently of any current event, or its effect. They are said to exert influence both across all domains of experience and throughout the stages of each individual's unique development. Being in part based on heritable physiology, they are thought to have "existed" since humans became a differentiated species. They have been deduced through the development of storytelling over tens of thousands of years, indicating repeating patterns of individual and group experience, behaviors, and effects across the planet, apparently displaying common themes.<ref name="CW9_1__90_92_118" />

The concept did not originate with Jung but with [[Plato]] who first conceived of primordial patterns. Later contributions came from [[Adolf Bastian]],  and [[Hermann Usener]] among others.<ref name="CW9_1__153">{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1 |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 153 }}</ref> In the first half of the twentieth century it proved impossible to objectively isolate and categorize the notion of an archetype within a materialist frame.  According to Jung, there are "as many archetypes as there are typical situations in life",<ref name="CW9_1__99">{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1 |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 99 }}</ref> and he asserted that they have a dynamic mutual influence on one another. Their alleged presence could be extracted from thousand-year-old narratives, from comparative religion and mythology.<ref name="CW9_1__89_110_115">{{cite book |author=Carl Jung  |title=''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'', Collected Works, Volume 9, Part 1 |year=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01833-2 |at=para. 89,110,115 }}</ref> Jung elaborated many archetypes in "''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''" and in "''Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self''". Examples of archetypes might be the shadow, the hero, the self, anima, animus, mother, father, child, and trickster.

==== Shadow ====
{{See also|shadow (psychology)}}

The ''shadow'' exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals instinctively or consciously resist identifying as their own and would rather ignore, typically: repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. Much of the shadow comes as a result of an individual's adaptation to cultural norms and expectations.<ref name=":0" /> Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society but also those that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.

Jung argues that the ''shadow'' plays a distinctive role in balancing one's overall psyche, the counter-balancing to consciousness – "where there is light, there must also be shadow". Without a well-developed ''shadow'' (often "shadow work", "integrating one's shadow"), an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others; that is, a walking [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']].<ref name=":0" /> Not wanting to look at their shadows directly, Jung argues, often results in [[psychological projection]].  Individuals project imagined attitudes onto others without awareness.  The qualities an individual may hate (or love) in another, may be manifestly present in the individual, who does not see the external, material truth.<ref name=":0" /> In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']] and ''[[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]'' should be balanced.<ref name=":0" />

The shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.{{fact|date=May 2021}}

===Extraversion and introversion===
{{main|Extraversion and introversion}}
Jung was one of the first people to define introversion and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung's ''Psychological Types'', he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert, and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. The introvert is likened to Apollo, who shines a light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming, and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception, and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychological Types|author=C.G. Jung|publisher=Princeton University Press, 1971|pages=136–147}}</ref> Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extraversion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stepp|first=G|title=People: Who Needs Them|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/social-relationships-introvert-vs-extrovert/50363.aspx|work=Vision Journal|access-date=19 December 2011}}</ref> Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world ''subjectively'', whereas extraverts interpret the world ''objectively''.<ref name="celebritytypes1">{{cite web | url=http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/04/5-basic-facts-about-jung-and-types/ | title=5 Basic Facts about Jung and Types | work=CelebrityTypes | publisher=CelebrityTypes International | date=19 April 2014 | access-date=9 June 2015 | author=Arild, Sigurd | page=1}}</ref>

===Persona===
{{see also|persona (psychology)}}
In his psychological theory – which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of [[social structure]] – the ''persona'' appears as a consciously created personality or identity, fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through [[socialization]], [[acculturation]] and experience.<ref>Jolande Székács Jacobi, ''Masks of the Soul''. William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.</ref> Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played.

The ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the "collective psyche", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the "persona-mask" as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is "a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be".<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]]", The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious", in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.</ref> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.</ref> The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains their "own self" – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses.

Jung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate "management persona" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<ref>Joann S. Lublin, "How to Look and Act Like a Leader", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.</ref> but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).<ref>[[Kees van der Pijl]], "May 1968 and the Alternative Globalist Movement – Cadre Class Formation and the Transition to Socialism". In: Angelika Ebbinghaus et al. (ed.), ''1968: A View of the Protest Movements 40 Years after, from a Global Perspective. 43rd {{ill|International Conference of Labour and Social History|de}} 2008.'' Vienna: Akademische Verlagsanstalt, 2009, pp. 192, 193, 194.</ref>

===Spirituality===
Jung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'']</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|page=3|chapter=Prelude|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uegLZklR0fEC&pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref> Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep, innate potential. Based on his study of [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called [[individuation]], is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the [[self]] and at the same time to meet the [[Divinity|Divine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Frick|first=Eckhard|author2=Lautenschlager, Bruno|title=Auf Unendliches bezogen – Spirituelle Entdeckungen bei C. G. Jung|publisher= Munich: Koesel|year=2007|page=204|isbn=978-3-466-36780-1}}</ref> Unlike Freud's objectivist worldview, Jung's [[pantheism]] may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to our well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Vivianne|title=Jung: A Journey of Transformation: Exploring His Life and Experiencing His Ideas|year=2000|publisher=Quest Books|location=Wheaton Illinois|isbn=978-0-8356-0782-7|url=https://archive.org/details/jung00vivi}}</ref><ref>Andrew Reid Fuller, "Psychology and Religion: Eight Points of View", 2002, p. 111</ref>

In 1959, Jung was asked by host [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] on the BBC interview program ''[[Face to Face (British TV programme)|Face to Face]]'' whether he believed in God, to which Jung answered, "I do not need to believe. I ''know''."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AMu-G51yTY BBC ''Face to Face'' broadcast, 22 October 1959]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rollins |first1=Wayne Giibert |title=Jung and the Bible |date=2013 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers [reprint of 1983 edition] |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1625642615 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_spNAwAAQBAJ&q=jung+god+%22the+listener%22&pg=PA121 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> Jung's ideas on religion counterbalance Freudian skepticism.

Jung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism, and he is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Jerome David|title=Introduction to Alcoholism Counseling|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoal00levi/page/167 167]|chapter=Other Etiological Theories of Alcoholism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_y7H9Sq5g6kC&pg=PA167|isbn=978-1-56032-358-7|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoal00levi/page/167}}</ref> Jung once treated an American patient ([[Rowland Hazard III]]), suffering from chronic alcoholism. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed.

Hazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a Christian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]].

The above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson, excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (1984) ''Pass It On: The Story of Bill Wilson and How the A.A. Message Reached the World.'' New York: Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. {{ISBN|0-916856-12-7}}, page. 381–386.</ref> Although the detail of this story is disputed by some historians, Jung himself discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in Volume 18 of his ''Collected Works'', ''The Symbolic Life,''

{{blockquote|For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can't do it better than Jesus.<ref>Jung, C. G.; Adler, G. and Hull, R. F. C., eds. (1977), ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 18: The Symbolic Life: Miscellaneous Writings Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-09892-0}}, p. 272, as noted 2007-08-26 at http://www.stellarfire.org/additional.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908023121/http://www.stellarfire.org/additional.html |date=8 September 2007 }}</ref>}}

Jung goes on to state that he has seen similar cures among [[Roman Catholics]]. The [[Twelve-step program|12 step program of Alcoholics Anonymous]] has an intense psychological backdrop, involving the human ego and dichotomy between the conscious and unconscious mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopemakersrecovery.com/psychology/jungian-12-steps|title=Jungian 12 Steps|website=Hope Makers|url-status=dead|access-date=5 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609020111/https://www.hopemakersrecovery.com/psychology/jungian-12-steps|archive-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>

=== Inquiries into the paranormal ===

Jung had an apparent interest in the paranormal and occult. For decades he attended [[seance]]s and claimed to have witnessed "parapsychic phenomena". Initially, he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on "The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits".<ref name="Jung1997">{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=6|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}</ref> However, he began to "doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question"<ref name="Jung1997"/> and stated that "the spirit hypothesis yields better results".<ref name="Carl Gustav Jung 1997 7">{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=7|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}</ref> Showing his own skepticism toward this postulation, as he could not find material evidence of the existence of spirits.<ref name="Carl Gustav Jung 1997 7"/>

Jung's ideas about the paranormal culminated in "[[synchronicity]]".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |author-link=Joe Nickell |title="Visitations": After-Death Contacts |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=September 2002 |volume=12 |issue=3 |url=https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/visitations_after-death_contacts |access-date=8 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808203007/https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/visitations_after-death_contacts |archive-date=8 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  This is the idea that certain coincidences manifest in the world, have exceptionally intense meaning to observers.  Such coincidences have great effect on the observer from multiple cumulative aspects: from the immediate personal relevance of the coincidence to the observer; from the peculiarities of (the nature of, the character, novelty, curiosity of) any such coincidence; from the sheer improbability of the coincidence, having no apparent causal link (hence Jung's essay subtitle "An Acausal Connecting Principle").  Despite his own experiments failing to confirm the phenomenon<ref name="ShermerLinse2002">{{cite book|author1=Michael Shermer|author2=Pat Linse|title=The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&pg=PA241|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=240–241|isbn=978-1-57607-653-8}}</ref> he held on to the idea as an explanation for apparent [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]].<ref name="Jung2013">{{cite book|author=C.

===Interpretation of quantum mechanics===
Jung influenced one philosophical interpretation (not the science) of quantum physics with the concept of [[synchronicity]] regarding some events as [[causality|non-causal]]. That idea influenced the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] (with whom, via a letter correspondence, he developed the notion of ''[[unus mundus]]'' in connection with the notion of nonlocality) and some other [[Quantum physics|physicists]].<ref>Jung, C. G. and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], ''The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1955.</ref>

===Alchemy===
[[File:Michael Maier Atalanta Fugiens Emblem 21.jpeg|thumb|The mythic alchemical philosopher's stone as pictured in ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' Emblem 21]]
Jung's acquaintance with alchemy came between 1928–1930, when he was introduced to a manuscript of [[The Secret of the Golden Flower]], translated by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jung |first1=Carl |editor1-last=Shamdasani |editor1-first=Sonu |title=The Red Book |date=2012 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=555 |edition=Reader |chapter=Epilogue}}</ref>  The work and writings of Jung from the 1930s onwards shifted to a focus on the [[Alchemy#Psychology|psychological significance of alchemy]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jung |first1=Carl |editor1-last=Hull |editor1-first=R.F.C. |title=Psychology and Alchemy |date=1952 |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=1968 Second Edition completely revised |chapter=From Editorial Note to the First Edition}}</ref>

In 1944 Jung published ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]]'', in which he analyzed the alchemical symbols and came to the conclusion that there is a direct relationship between them and the psychoanalytical process.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|'For Jung, alchemy is not only part of the pre-history of chemistry, that is, not only laboratory work, but also an essential part of the history of psychology as the history of the discovery of the deep structure of the psyche and its unconscious. Jung emphasized the significance of the symbolic structure of alchemical texts, a structure that is understood as a way independent of laboratory research, as a structure per se.' {{cite book|last=Calian|first=George Florin|title=Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa.

In 1963 ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' first appeared in English as part of ''[[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung]]''. ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' was Jung's last major book and focused on the "''Mysterium Coniunctionis''" archetype, known as the [[sacred marriage]] between sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening, and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation—his chosen term for personal growth (75).

===Art therapy===
Jung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore and heal.<ref name="art-therapy"/> In his work with patients and his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could help recover from trauma and emotional distress. At times of emotional distress, he often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions which he recognized as more than recreational.<ref name="art-therapy"/>

=== Dance/movement therapy ===
[[Dance/movement therapy]] as active imagination was created by Carl Gustav Jung and [[Toni Wolff]] in 1916<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Dance-Therapy-and-Depth-Psychology-The-Moving-Imagination/Chodorow/p/book/9780415041133|title=Dance Therapy and Depth Psychology: The Moving Imagination – Routledge|last=Chodorow|first=Joan|year=1991|access-date=23 November 2017}}</ref> and was practiced by [[Tina Keller-Jenny]] and other analysts, but remained largely unknown until the 1950s when it was rediscovered by [[Marian Chace]] and therapist Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse, after studying with [[Martha Graham]] and [[Mary Wigman]], became herself a dancer and teacher of modern dance,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xywBCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33|title=Authentic Movement: Moving the Body, Moving the Self, Being Moved: A Collection of Essays – Volume Two|last=Pallaro|first=Patrizia|date=15 January 2007|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1846425868|location=London|page=33|language=en}}</ref> as well as Swiss Dancer [[Trudi Schoop|Trudy Schoop]] in 1963, who is considered one of the founders of the dance/movement therapy in the United States.

===Political views===

====The state====
Jung stressed the importance of [[Natural and legal rights|individual rights]] in a person's relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as "a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected" but that this personality was "only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it",<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-451-21860-5|title=The Undiscovered Self: The Problem of the Individual in Modern Society|pages=15–16|publisher=New American Library|last=Jung|first=Carl|year=2006}}</ref> and referred to the state as a form of slavery.<ref>C. G. Jung, ''Die Beziehungen zwischen dem Ich und dem Unbewußten'', chapter one, second section, 1928. Also, C. G. Jung ''Aufsätze zur Zeitgeschichte'', 1946.

====Germany, 1933 to 1939====
Jung had many Jewish friends and colleagues and maintained relations with them throughout the 1930s despite prevailing [[anti-semitism]]. Until 1939, he also maintained professional relations with psychotherapists in Germany who had declared their support for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime. Some scholars allege that he himself sympathized with the regime.<ref name="Clark, R.W 1980 pp. 492">Clark, R.W (1980) ''Freud: the Man and the Cause''. London: Cape, pp. 492–3</ref>

In 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung took part in the restructuring of the [[International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy|General Medical Society for Psychotherapy]] (''Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie''), a German-based professional body with an international membership. The society was reorganized into two distinct bodies:
# A strictly German body, the Deutsche Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie, led by [[Matthias Göring]], an [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] psychotherapist<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/books/psychotherapy-in-the-third-reich.html Lifton, Robert Jay (27 January 1985) "Psychotherapy in the Third Reich"] ''The New York Times''</ref> and a cousin of the prominent Nazi [[Hermann Göring]]
# International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, led by Jung. The German body was to be affiliated to the international society, as were new national societies being set up in Switzerland and elsewhere.<ref>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; pp.&nbsp;79–80.</ref>

The International Society's constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly, rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a circular in 1934.<ref>An English translation of the circular is in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; pp.&nbsp;545–546.</ref> This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.<ref>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; p.&nbsp;82.</ref>

As leader of the international body, Jung assumed overall responsibility for its publication, the ''Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie''. In 1933, this journal published a statement endorsing Nazi positions<ref>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; p.&nbsp;80.</ref> and Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.<ref>Mark Medweth. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050331084847/http://www.sfu.ca/~wwwpsyb/issues/1996/winter/medweth.htm "Jung and the Nazis"], in ''Psybernetika'', Winter 1996.</ref> In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', that he experienced "great surprise and disappointment"<ref>Article republished in English in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p.&nbsp;538.</ref> when the ''Zentralblatt'' associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement.

Jung went on to say "the main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake".<ref>Article republished in English in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p.&nbsp;538. See also Stevens, Anthony, ''Jung: a very short introduction'', Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-285458-5}}</ref> He did not end his relationship with the ''Zentralblatt'' at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, [[Carl Alfred Meier]] of Switzerland. For the next few years, the ''Zentralblatt'' under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis, in that it continued to acknowledge contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy.<ref name=Jaffe_p83>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; p.&nbsp;83.</ref> In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939,<ref name=Jaffe_p83/> the year the [[Second World War]] started.

====Nazism and antisemitism====
Jung's interest in [[European mythology]] and [[folk psychology]] was shared by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noll |first=Richard |edition=1st |date=1994 |title=The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement |page=336 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}</ref>{{sfn|Grossman|1979}}<ref name="theguardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jun/06/carl-jung-freud-nazis|last=Vernon|first=Mark|work=The Guardian|date=6 June 2011|title=Carl Jung, part 2: A troubled relationship with Freud – and the Nazis|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> [[Richard Noll]] describes Jung's own reaction to this connection:

{{quote|Jung clearly identifies himself with the spirit of German [[Völkisch movement|Volkstumsbewegung]] throughout this period and well into the 1920s and 1930s, until the horrors of Nazism finally compelled him to reframe these [[neopagan]] metaphors in a negative light in his 1936 essay on [[Wotan]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noll |first=Richard |edition=1st |date=1994 |title=The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement |page=134 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}</ref>}}

Various statements made by Jung in the 1930s have been cited as evidence of both contempt for Nazism and sympathy for Nazism.<ref name="Clark, R.W 1980 pp. 492"/> In the 1936 essay "Wotan", Jung described the influence of [[Adolf Hitler]] on Germany as "one man who is obviously 'possessed' has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course towards perdition."<ref>{{cite book|title = Carl Gustav Jung: Avant-Garde Conservative|first=Jay|last=Sherry|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref><ref>Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p. 185.</ref> He would later say, during a lengthy interview with H. R. Knickerbocker in October 1938:<ref>''C. G. Jung Speaking: Interviews and Encounters'', eds William McGuire and [[R. F. C. Hull]], Princeton University Press, pp. 128, reprint from ''Diagnosing the Dictators'' (1938).</ref><ref>''C. G. Jung Speaking: Interviews and Encounters'', eds William McGuire and [[R. F. C. Hull]] (London: Thames and Hudson, 1978), pp. 91–93, 115–135, 136–40.</ref>
{{quote|Hitler seemed like the 'double' of a real person, as if Hitler the man might be hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so concealed in order not to disturb the mechanism&nbsp;... You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there&nbsp;... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation.}}

Jung consistently rejected accusations of [[antisemitism]]. In a 1948 interview with Carol Baumann, he stated:
{{quote|It must be clear to anyone who has read any of my books that I have never been a Nazi sympathizer and I never have been anti-Semitic, and no amount of misquotation, mistranslation, or rearrangement of what I have written can alter the record of my true point of view. Nearly every one of these passages has been tampered with, either by malice or by ignorance. Furthermore, my friendly relations with a large group of Jewish colleagues and patients over a period of many years in itself disproves the charge of anti-Semitism.<ref>Interview with Carol Baumann, published in the ''Bulletin of Analytical Psychology Club of New York'', December 1949.</ref>{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A full response from Jung discounting the rumors can be found in ''C. G Jung Speaking, Interviews and Encounters'', Princeton University Press, 1977.}}}}

The accusations, however, have continued to be made concerning Jung's statements. [[Avner Falk]] cites articles such as "The State of Psychotherapy Today",<ref>[[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung|Collected Works]], Volume 10</ref> published in 1934 in the ''Zentralblatt fur Psychotherapie'', where Jung wrote: "The [[Aryan]] unconscious has a greater potential than the Jewish unconscious" and "The Jew, who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own and as far as we can see never will".<ref>Falk, A ''Anti-Semitism A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred'' Westport Connecticut: Praeger, 2008, pp. 110–111</ref> [[Andrew Samuels]] argues that his remarks on the "Aryan unconscious" and the "corrosive character" of Freud's "Jewish gospel"<ref>Letter to William M Kranefeldt dd 9 February 1934 reprinted in the ''International Review of Psychoanalysis'' Vol. 4:377 (1977)</ref> demonstrate an antisemitism "fundamental to the structure of Jung's thought".<ref>[[Andrew Samuels|Samuels, Andrew]].

====Service to the Allies during World War II====
Jung was in contact with [[Allen Dulles]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and provided valuable intelligence on the psychological condition of [[Hitler]].  Dulles referred to Jung as "Agent 488" and offered the following description of his service: "Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side".  Jung's service to the Allied cause through the OSS remained classified after the war.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-shrink-as-secret-agent-jung-hitler-and-the-oss | title=The Shrink as Secret Agent: Jung, Hitler, and the OSS| newspaper=The Daily Beast| date=12 November 2016| last1=Dickey| first1=Christopher}}</ref>

===Views on homosexuality===
Jung addressed homosexuality in his published writings, in one comment specifying that homosexuality should not be a concern of legal authorities nor be considered a crime. He also claimed that homosexuality does not reduce the value of a person as a member of society. However, Jung has also stated that homosexuality is a result of psychological immaturity, but only if one's sexuality is not an aspect of their sexuality and constitutional characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hopcke |first1=R. |title=Jung and Homosexuality: A Clearer Vision |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |date=1988 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=65–80 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1988.00065.x|pmid=3350769 }}</ref>

===Psychedelics===

Jung's theories are considered to be a useful therapeutic framework for the analysis of unconscious phenomena that become manifest in the acute psychedelic state.<ref>Hill, S.J. 2013.

This research has led to a re-evaluation of Jung's work, and particularly the visions detailed in ''[[The Red Book (Jung)|The Red Book]]'', in the context of contemporary psychedelic, evolutionary and developmental neuroscience. For example, in a chapter entitled 'Integrating the Archaic and the Modern: The Red Book, Visual Cognitive Modalities and the Neuroscience of Altered States of Consciousness', in the 2020 volume ''Jung's Red Book for Our Time: Searching for Soul Under Postmodern Conditions, Volume 4'', it is argued Jung was a pioneer who explored uncharted "cognitive domains" that are alien to Western modes of thought. While such domains of experience are not part of mainstream Western culture and thought, they are central to various Indigenous cultures who use psychedelics such as [[Tabernanthe iboga|Iboga]] and [[Ayahuasca]] during rituals to alter consciousness. As the author writes: "Jung seems to have been dealing with modes of consciousness alien to mainstream Western thought, exploring the terrain of uncharted cognitive domains. I argue that science is beginning to catch up with Jung who was a pioneer whose insights contribute a great deal to our emerging understanding of human consciousness."<ref>Clark, Gary.

Commenting on research that was being undertaken during the 1950s, Jung wrote the following in a letter to Betty Eisner, a psychologist who was involved in LSD research at the University of California: "Experiments along the line of mescaline and related drugs are certainly most interesting since such drugs lay bare a level of the unconscious that is otherwise accessible only under peculiar psychic conditions. It is a fact that you get certain perceptions and experiences of things appearing either in mystical states or in the analysis of unconscious phenomena."<ref>Jung, C.G., G. Adler, and A. Jaffé. 1976. Letters: Routledge, p. 382.</ref>

A detailed account of Jung and psychedelics, as well as the importance of Jungian psychology to psychedelic-assisted therapies, is outlined in Scott Hill's 2013 book ''Confrontation with the Unconscious: Jungian Depth Psychology and Psychedelic Experience''.<ref>Hill, S.J. 2013.

As the author writes Jung's '...legitimate reservations about the clinical use of psychedelics are no longer relevant as the field has progressed significantly, devising robust clinical and experimental protocols for psychedelic assisted therapies. That said Jung’s concept of individuation — that is the integration of the archaic unconscious with consciousness — seems extremely pertinent to modern psychedelic research.' <ref> Clark, Gary, 2021.

==Legacy==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI), a popular [[Personality psychology|psychometric instrument]], and the concepts of [[socionics]] were developed from Jung's theory of psychological types. Jung saw the human psyche as "by nature religious" and made this religiousness the focus of his explorations. Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to [[dream interpretation|dream analysis]] and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the "psychologization of religion", [[spirituality]] and the [[New Age]] movement has been immense. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Jung as the 23rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. |journal=Review of General Psychology |year=2002 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx| display-authors= 8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913|s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

* [[Hermann Hesse]], author of works such as ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' and ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', was treated by Joseph Lang, a student of Jung. For Hesse this began a long preoccupation with [[psychoanalysis]], through which he came to know Jung personally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm |title=Hermann Hesse |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm |archive-date=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>
* In his novel ''The World is Made of Glass'' (1983), [[Morris West]] gives a fictional account of one of Jung's cases, placing the events in 1913.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/morris-west-5/the-world-is-made-of-glass/ | title=The World is Made of Glass by Morris West}}</ref> According to the author's note, the novel is "based upon a case recorded, very briefly, by Carl Gustav Jung in his autobiographical work ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections''".
* The Canadian novelist Robertson Davies made Jungian analysis a central part of his 1970 novel ''The Manticore''. He stated in a letter, "There have been other books which describe Freudian analyses, but I know of no other that describes a Jungian analysis" adding "I was deeply afraid that I would put my foot in it, for I have never undergone one of those barnacle-scraping experiences, and knew of it only through reading. So I was greatly pleased when some of my Jungian friends in Zurich liked it very much."<ref>''For Your Eye Alone: The Letters of Robertson Davies'' edited by Judith Skelton Grant (New York: Viking, 2001)72</ref>

===Music===
* Musician [[David Bowie]] described himself as Jungian in his relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Bowie sang of Jung on his album ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (a pun on "a lad insane") and attended the exhibition of ''The Red Book'' in New York with artist [[Tony Oursler]], who described Bowie as "reading and speaking of the psychoanalyst with passion".  Bowie's 1967 song "[[Shadow Man (song)|Shadow Man]]" encapsulates a key Jungian concept, while in 1987 Bowie described the Glass Spiders of ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' as Jungian mother figures around which he not only anchored [[Glass Spider Tour|a worldwide tour]] but also created an enormous onstage effigy.<ref>[https://tanjastark.com/2015/06/22/crashing-out-with-sylvian-david-bowie-carl-jung-and-the-unconscious/ Stark, Tanja, (2015) "Crashing Out with Sylvian: David Bowie, Carl Jung and the Unconscious" in Deveroux, E., M.Power and A.

===Theatre, film, television and radio===
* [[Federico Fellini]] brought to the screen exuberant imagery shaped by his encounter with Jung's ideas, especially Jungian [[dream interpretation]]. Fellini preferred Jung to Freud because Jungian analysis defined the dream not as a symptom of a disease that required a cure but rather as a link to archetypal images shared by all of humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bondanella|first=Peter E.|title=The Films of Federico Fellini|url=https://archive.org/details/filmsfedericofel00bond|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/filmsfedericofel00bond/page/n109 94]|isbn=978-0-521-57573-7|date=17 January 2002}}</ref>

* [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1987 film ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' has an underlying theme about the duality of man. In one scene, a colonel asks a soldier, "You write 'Born to Kill' on your helmet and you wear a peace button. What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?" The soldier replies, "I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir...the Jungian thing, sir."<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0065.html] The Kubrick Site: Full Metal Jacket.</ref>
