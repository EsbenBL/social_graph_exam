The etymology of the name ''Milan'' ([[Lombard Language|Lombard]]: ''Milan'' {{IPA-lmo|miˈlãː|}}) remains uncertain. One theory holds that the [[Ancient Rome|Latin]] name ''[[Mediolanum]]'' comes from the Latin words ''medio'' (in the middle) and ''planus'' (plain).<ref>{{cite book|last= Ambrogio|first= Renzo|title= Nomi d'Italia : origine e significato dei nomi geografici e di tutti i comuni|year= 2009|publisher= Istituto geografico De Agostini|location= Novara|isbn= 978-88-511-1412-1|page= 385}}</ref> However, some scholars believe that ''lanum'' comes from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] root ''lan'', meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''[[Llan (placename)|llan]]'', meaning "a sanctuary or church", ultimately cognate to English/[[German language|German]] ''[[Land]]'') in which Celtic communities used to build shrines.<ref>{{cite book|last= Wise|first= Hilary|title= The vocabulary of modern French origins, structure and function|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|location= London|isbn= 0-203-42979-6|page= 39}}</ref> Hence ''Mediolanum'' could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman sites in France bore the name "Mediolanum", for example: [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] (''Mediolanum Santonum'') and [[Évreux]] (''Mediolanum Aulercorum'').<ref>{{cite book|last= Michell|first= John|title= The sacred center: the ancient art of locating sanctuaries|year= 2009|publisher= Inner Traditions|location= Rochester, Vt.|isbn= 978-1-59477-284-9|page= 32}}</ref> In addition, another theory links the name to the [[wild boar|boar sow]] (the ''[[Scrofa semilanuta]]'') an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''Emblemata'' (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of ''Mediolanum'' given as "half-wool",<ref>''medius'' + ''lanum''; Alciato's "etymology" is intentionally far-fetched.</ref> explained in Latin and in [[French language|French]].

The Celtic [[Insubres]], the inhabitants of the region of northern Italy called [[Insubria]], appear to have founded a settlement around 600 BC. According to the legend reported by [[Livy]] (writing between 27 and 9 BC), the [[Gaul]]ish king [[Ambicatus]] sent his nephew [[Bellovesus]] into northern Italy at the head of a party drawn from various Gaulish tribes; Bellovesus allegedly founded the settlement in the times of the Roman monarchy, during the reign of [[Tarquinius Priscus]]. Tarquin is traditionally recorded as reigning from 616 to 579 BC, according to ancient Roman historian Titus Livy.<ref>Livius, ''[[Ab Urbe condita]]'' 5.34–35.3.</ref>
During the Roman Republic, the Romans, led by consul [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]], fought the Insubres and captured the settlement in 222 BC. The chief of the Insubres then submitted to Rome, giving the Romans control of the settlement.<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Aid%3Db2c34 Polybius, ''Histories'']</ref> They eventually conquered the entirety of the region, calling the new [[Roman province|province]] "[[Cisalpine Gaul]]" ({{lang-la | Gallia Cisalpina}}) – "Gaul this side of the Alps" – and may have given the site its [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] name of [[Mediolanum]]: in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] ''*medio-'' meant "middle, center" and the name element ''-lanon'' is the Celtic equivalent of Latin ''-planum'' "plain", thus ''*Mediolanon'' (Latinized as ''Mediolānum'') meant "(settlement) in the midst of the plain".<ref>{{cite book |last= Delamarre |first= Xavier |title= Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise |url= https://archive.org/details/dictionnairedela00dela_348 |url-access= limited |edition= 2nd |year= 2003 |publisher= Errance |location= Paris |isbn= 2-87772-237-6 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dictionnairedela00dela_348/page/n219 221]–222 |language= fr}}</ref><ref>Compare G.

In 286 the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] moved the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from Rome to Mediolanum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/16_febbraio_12/antica-mediolanum-rivive-computer-milano-romana-circo-anfiteatro-urbanfile-blog-66026574-d1af-11e5-9819-2c2b53be318b.shtml |title=Video of Roman Milan |access-date=24 November 2018 |archive-date=5 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505073359/http://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/16_febbraio_12/antica-mediolanum-rivive-computer-milano-romana-circo-anfiteatro-urbanfile-blog-66026574-d1af-11e5-9819-2c2b53be318b.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

Diocletian himself chose to reside at [[Nicomedia]] in the Eastern Empire, leaving his colleague [[Maximian]] at Milan. Maximian built several gigantic monuments: the large [[Circus (building)|circus]] (470 × 85 metres), the ''[[thermae]]'' or "Baths of Hercules", a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which few visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area to 375 acres by surrounding it with a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5&nbsp;km long) with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; one included in the convent of [[San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore|San Maurizio Maggiore]] remains 16.6 m high.

From Mediolanum the [[Emperor Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, and thus paving the way for [[Christianity]] to become the dominant religion of Roman Europe. Constantine was in Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, [[Licinius]]. In 402 the [[Visigoths]] besieged the city and the [[Emperor Honorius]] moved the Imperial residence to [[Ravenna]].<ref>Compare:

In 452 [[Attila]] in his turn besieged Mediolanum, but the real break with the city's Imperial past came in 539, during the [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]], when [[Uraias|Uraia]] (a nephew of [[Witiges]], formerly King of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Italian Ostrogoths]]) laid Mediolanum to waste with great loss of life.<ref>
According to [[Procopius]], the losses at Milan amounted to 300,000 men.
</ref>
The [[Lombards]] took [[Ticinum]] as their capital in 572 (renaming it ''Papia'' – the modern [[Pavia]]), and left early-medieval Milan to the governance of its [[Archbishop of Milan|archbishop]]s.

After the siege of the city by the [[Visigoths]] in 402, the imperial residence moved to [[Ravenna]]. An age of decline began which worsened when [[Attila]], King of the [[Huns]], sacked and devastated the city in 452&nbsp;AD. In 539 the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan during the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from whom the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule.<ref>See the ''[[Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis]]''.</ref> Milan surrendered to [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Franks]] in 774.

The 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. City-states emerged in northern Italy, an expression of the new political power of the cities and their will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the Italian city-states to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017|archive-date=29 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093826/http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|url-status=live}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] for help.

These brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.

A period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its geographical position. During this time, the city was considered one of the largest European cities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Tom|title=The City-State in Europe, 1000-1600: Hinterland, Territory, Region|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=17}}</ref>

In 1395, [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] became the first [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] after receiving the title from [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans]]. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], Duke of Milan, died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name="lucas:268">Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' p. 268.</ref> Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan.

===Early modern===

Milan's last independent ruler, [[Lodovico il Moro]], requested the aid of [[Charles VIII of France]] against the other [[Italian states]], eventually unleashing the [[Italian Wars]]. The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orléans]], took part in the expedition and realized most of Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor François I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[François I of France|François I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated François I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>

[[File:Suvorov in Milan.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial reception of Russian Field Marshal [[Alexander Suvorov]] in Milan, April 1799]]
In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629–1631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629–31, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece "[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>

In 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713–1714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan. [[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned King of Italy in the [[Milan Cathedral|cathedral]]. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, to Austrian control in 1815.

===Late modern and contemporary===

[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the "[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]" uprising against Austrian rule.]]

On March 18, 1848, Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called "[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organised a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name="Solferino">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J. Morris |url=http://www.battlefieldanomalies.com/solferino/08_the_battle.htm |access-date=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630084539/http://www.battlefieldanomalies.com/solferino/08_the_battle.htm |archive-date=30 June 2009}}</ref> Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into Piedmont-Sardinia, which then proceeded to annex all the other Italian statlets and proclaim the birth of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on March 17, 1861.

The [[Italian unification|political unification of Italy]] enhanced Milan's economic dominance over northern Italy. A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living.

[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]
Milan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] Milan large industrial and transport facilities [[Bombing of Milan in World War II|suffered extensive damage from Allied bombings]] that often also hit residential districts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Philip|title=The fall of Mussolini: Italy, the Italians, and the Second World War|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-921934-6|page=67|edition=Reprint.}}</ref> When Italy [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|surrendered]] in 1943, German forces occupied and plundered most of northern Italy, fueling the birth of a massive resistance guerrilla movement.<ref name="Cooke">{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Philip|title=Italian resistance writing: an anthology|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-5172-X|page=20}}</ref> On April 29, 1945, the American [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was advancing on Milan but, before it arrived, the Italian resistance seized control of the city and executed Mussolini along with his mistress and several regime officers, that were later hanged and exposed in [[Piazzale Loreto]], where one year before some resistance members had been executed.

During the post-war economic boom, the reconstruction effort and the so-called Italian economic miracle attracted a large wave of internal migration (especially from rural areas of [[southern Italy]]) to Milan. The population grew from 1.3&nbsp;million in 1951 to 1.7&nbsp;million in 1967.<ref name="Ginsborg">{{cite book|last= Ginsborg|first= Paul|title= A history of contemporary Italy: society and politics, 1943 – 1988|year= 2003|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|location= New York|isbn= 1-4039-6153-0|page=220}}</ref> During this period, Milan was rapidly rebuilt, with the construction of several innovative and modernist [[skyscraper]]s, such as the [[Torre Velasca]] and the [[Pirelli Tower]], that soon became the symbols of this new era of prosperity.<ref name="Foot">{{Cite book

The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when [[Piazza Fontana bombing|a bomb]] exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing 17 people and injuring 88.

In the 1980s, with the international success of Milanese houses (like [[Armani]], [[Versace]] and [[Dolce & Gabbana]]), Milan became one of the world's fashion capitals. The city saw also a marked rise in [[international tourism]], notably from America and Japan, while the stock exchange increased its market capitalisation more than five-fold.<ref>{{cite web|title=Italian Stock Exchange – Main indicators 1975–2012|url=http://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsaitaliana/ufficio-stampa/dati-storici/principaliindicatori2012_pdf.htm|access-date=16 October 2012|archive-date=6 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106211102/https://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsaitaliana/ufficio-stampa/dati-storici/principaliindicatori2012_pdf.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> This period led the mass media to nickname the metropolis ''"Milano da bere"'', literally "Milan to be drunk".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cultura/200804articoli/31497girata.asp |title=L'uomo che inventò la Milano da bere |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=4 January 2008 |access-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914065500/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cultura/200804articoli/31497girata.asp |archive-date=14 September 2009}}</ref> However, in the 1990s, Milan was badly affected by [[Tangentopoli]], a political scandal in which many politicians and businessmen were tried for corruption.

=== Climate ===

Milan features a mid-latitude, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Milan's climate is similar to much of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot, humid summers and cold, foggy winters. The [[Alps]] and [[Apennine Mountains]] form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the sea.<ref>{{cite web|title=The ENVIBASE-Project – Climate of Milan|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/archiv_sensut/umwelt/uisonline/envibase/handbook/climate3.htm|access-date=14 August 2012|archive-date=28 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228142756/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/archiv_sensut/umwelt/uisonline/envibase/handbook/climate3.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

During winter, daily average temperatures can fall below freezing ({{convert|0|C|disp=sqbr}}) and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan's area is {{convert|25|cm|in|0}} in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of {{convert|90|cm|in|0}} in January 1985.

The city is often shrouded in thick cloud or fog during winter, although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighbourhoods and the [[urban heat island]] effect have reduced this occurrence in recent decades. Occasionally, the [[Foehn]] winds cause the temperatures to rise unexpectedly: on 22 January 2012 the daily high reached {{convert|16|C|4=0}} while on 22 February 2012 it reached {{convert|21|C|4=0}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recorded temperatures, Milan|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/it/milan/214046/month/214046?monyr=2/01/2012|publisher=Accuweather|access-date=14 August 2012|archive-date=26 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626222115/https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/milan/214046/month/214046?monyr=2%2F01%2F2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Air pollution levels rise significantly in wintertime when [[Thermal inversion|cold air clings to the soil]], causing Milan to be one of Europe's most polluted cities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smog in Northern Italy|date = 29 December 2005|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=15900|publisher=NASA|access-date=14 August 2012|archive-date=11 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611140852/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/15900/smog-in-northern-italy|url-status=live}}</ref>

The legislative body of the Italian {{lang-it|comuni|links=no|label=none}} is the [[City Council of Milan|City Council]] (''Consiglio Comunale''), which in cities with more than one million population is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 12 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]], that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected [[Mayor of Milan|Mayor]]. The current mayor of Milan is [[Giuseppe Sala]], an independent leading a centre-left alliance led by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].

The municipality of Milan is subdivided into nine administrative Borough Councils (''Consigli di Municipio''), down from the former twenty districts before the 1999 administrative reform.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Borough Councils of Milan|url=http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/CDM?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ContentLibrary/In%20Comune/In%20Comune/I%20Consigli%20di%20Zona|publisher=Municipality of Milan|access-date=18 October 2012|archive-date=18 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418043458/http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/CDM?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fwps%2Fwcm%2Fconnect%2FContentLibrary%2FIn%20Comune%2FIn%20Comune%2FI%20Consigli%20di%20Zona|url-status=live}}</ref> Each Borough Council is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor.

=== Metropolitan city ===
Milan is the capital of the eponymous [[Metropolitan City of Milan|Metropolitan city]].

The Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (''Sindaco metropolitano'') and by the Metropolitan Council (''Consiglio metropolitano''). Since 21 June 2016 [[Giuseppe Sala]], as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.

=== Regional government ===
Milan is also the capital of [[Lombardy]], one of the twenty [[Regions of Italy|regions]] of Italy. Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. It is governed by a Regional Council, composed of 80 members elected for a five-year term.  On 26 March 2018, a list of candidates of the [[Centre-right coalition]], a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Attilio Fontana, largely won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists, liberals and ecologists and a third-party candidate from the populist [[Five Stars Movement]]. The conservatives have governed the region almost uninterruptedly since 1970. The regional council has 48 members from the Centre-right coalition, 18 from the [[Centre-left coalition]] and 13 from the Five Star Movement. The seat of the regional government is [[Palazzo Lombardia]] that, standing at {{convert|161.3|m|abbr=off}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/Awards/AllPastWinners/12_PalazzoLombardia/tabid/3360/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|access-date=18 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027145405/http://ctbuh.org/Awards/AllPastWinners/12_PalazzoLombardia/tabid/3360/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|archive-date=27 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> is the fifth-tallest building in Milan.

There are only few remains of the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony, notably the well-preserved [[Colonne di San Lorenzo]]. During the second half of the 4th century, [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, reshaping the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built in Roman times are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Sant'Ambrogio]], [[San Nazaro in Brolo]], [[Basilica of San Simpliciano|San Simpliciano]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio|Sant'Eustorgio]], which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan. [[Duomo di Milano|Milan's Cathedral]], built between 1386 and 1877, is the fifth-largest cathedral in the world<ref>{{cite book|last=Ferrari-Bravo|first=Anna|title=Milano.|year=1985|publisher=Touring club italiano|location=Milano|isbn=88-365-0004-8|page=130|edition=9a}}</ref> and the most important example of [[Gothic architecture]] in Italy.

In the 15th century, when the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] ruled the city, an old Viscontean fortress was enlarged and embellished to become the [[Sforza Castle|Castello Sforzesco]], the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects involved in the project included the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Filarete]], who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milanocastello.it/ing/lungaRicostruito.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830184307/http://www.milanocastello.it/ing/lungaRicostruito.html |archive-date=2003-08-30 |title=The Castle Reconstructed by the Sforza |website=Castello Sforzesco website}}</ref> The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence's [[Cosimo de' Medici]] bore to Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the [[Ospedale Maggiore]] and Bramante's work in the city, which includes [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] and three cloisters for Sant'Ambrogio.<ref name="murray"/> The [[Counter-Reformation]] in the 16th to 17th centuries was also the period of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish domination]] and was marked by two powerful figures: [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]] and his cousin, [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]]. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], in a building designed by [[Francesco Maria Richini]], and the nearby [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, [[Pellegrino Tibaldi]], [[Galeazzo Alessi]] and Richini himself.<ref name="Wittkower"/>

In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London. Several other arcades such as the [[Galleria del Corso]], built between 1923 and 1931, complement it. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] graveyard, built in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] style between 1863 and 1866.

The tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture. [[Art Nouveau]], also known as ''[[Liberty style|Liberty]]'' in Italy, is recognisable in [[Palazzo Castiglioni (Milan)|Palazzo Castiglioni]], built by architect [[Giuseppe Sommaruga]] between 1901 and 1903.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Other examples include Hotel Corso,<ref name="ReferenceC"/> [[Casa Guazzoni]] with its wrought iron and staircase, and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.100milano.com/liberty/191.html |title=Verso Una Conclusione: Casa Berri Meregalli |publisher=100milano.com |access-date=10 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424052448/http://www.100milano.com/liberty/191.html |archive-date=24 April 2012}}</ref> A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info2015expo.it/index.php?/archives/826-Castello-Cova.html |title=Castello Cova – info2015expo |publisher=Info2015expo.it |access-date=10 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424225206/http://www.info2015expo.it/index.php?%2Farchives%2F826-Castello-Cova.html |archive-date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> An important example of [[Art Deco]], which blended such styles with [[Fascist architecture]], is the huge [[Milano Centrale|Central railway station]] inaugurated in 1931.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ICYUKYHQ_cC&q=milan+railway+station+1931&pg=PA119|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Milan & the Lakes|last=Birmingham|first=Brenda|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4053-6747-9|location=London|language=en|oclc=828734755|access-date=17 November 2020|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529132107/https://books.google.com/books?id=-ICYUKYHQ_cC&q=milan+railway+station+1931&pg=PA119|url-status=live}}</ref>

The post–World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly two-fold increase in population. In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Giò Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956–60), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956–58), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]] in downtown Milan and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]]. In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the [[CityLife (Milan)|Citylife]] regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the {{convert|202|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Isozaki Arata]]—when completed, the tallest building in Italy,<ref name="Isozaki Tower Citylife"/> the twisted [[Zaha Hadid|Hadid Tower]],<ref name="Hadid Tower Citylife"/> and the curved [[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind Tower]].<ref name="Liebskind Tower Citylife"/>

English-style Sempione Park, built in 1890, contains a Napoleonic Arena, the Milan City Aquarium, a steel lattice panoramic tower, an art exhibition centre, a Japanese garden and a public library.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sempione Park|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=en/SITur/HOME/milanodintorni/parchigiardini/loc2197|access-date=13 June 2013|archive-date=10 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410230306/http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=en%2FSITur%2FHOME%2Fmilanodintorni%2Fparchigiardini%2Floc2197|url-status=live}}</ref> The Montanelli gardens, created in the 18th century, hosts the [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]] and a [[Planetario di Milano|planetarium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Indro Montanelli Gardens|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=en/situr/home/milanodintorni/parchigiardini/loc10|access-date=13 June 2013|archive-date=8 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508053103/http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=en%2Fsitur%2Fhome%2Fmilanodintorni%2Fparchigiardini%2Floc10|url-status=live}}</ref> Slightly away from the city centre, heading east, Forlanini Park is characterised by a large pond and a few preserved shacks which remind of the area's agricultural past.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forlanini Park|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=en/situr/home/milanodintorni/parchigiardini/loc26|access-date=13 June 2013|archive-date=10 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410223819/http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=en%2Fsitur%2Fhome%2Fmilanodintorni%2Fparchigiardini%2Floc26|url-status=live}}</ref> In recent years Milan's authorities pledged to develop its green areas: they planned to create twenty new urban parks and extend the already existing ones, and announced plans to plant three million trees by 2030.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Girardi |first1=Annalisa |title=Milan: The Grey City Is Going Green |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annalisagirardi/2019/01/10/milan-the-gray-city-is-going-green/#3d2c4e391d9f |access-date=1 January 2020 |magazine=[[Forbes]] |archive-date=17 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217083616/https://www.forbes.com/sites/annalisagirardi/2019/01/10/milan-the-gray-city-is-going-green/#3d2c4e391d9f |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition, even though Milan is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Italy, it is surrounded by a belt of green areas and features numerous gardens even in its very centre. Since 1990, the farmlands and woodlands north (Parco Nord Milano) and south ([[Parco Agricolo Sud Milano]]) of the urban area have been protected as regional parks. West of the city, the Parco delle Cave (Sand pit park) has been established on a neglected site where gravel and sand used to be extracted, featuring artificial lakes and woods.

After World War II, Milan experienced two main waves of immigration: the first, dating from the 1950s to the early 1970s, saw a large influx of migrants from poorer and rural areas within Italy; the second, starting from the late 1980s, has been characterised by the preponderance of foreign-born immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Foot|first1=John|title=Mapping Diversity in Milan. Using the administrative division of the Milanese territory in the functional areas some important aspects of the spatial distribution of demographic phenomena can be captured. As well as the aggregated data on the stocks, the individual information (also geographically referenced) by the population register are considered for this purpose. The stocks at the 1st on January of the years from 2005 to 2009 are available. The totals for individuals and family are consistent with the totals published by ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics) by means of appropriate scaling coefficients, since some differences can occur between the two sources.

The early period coincided with the so-called Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and underdeveloped [[Southern Italy]].<ref name="Foot"/> In the last three decades, the foreign born share of the population soared. Immigrants came mainly from Africa (in particular Eritrean, Egyptian, Moroccans, Senegalese, and Nigerian), and the former socialist countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (notably Albania, Romania, Ukraine, Macedonia, Moldova, and Russia), in addition to a growing number of Asians (in particular Chinese, Sri Lankans and Filipinos) and [[Latin America]]ns (Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the total).<ref>{{Cite book

=== Languages and literature ===
{{main|Milanese literature}}

[[File:Statua di Alessandro Manzoni - Milano.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Monument to [[Alessandro Manzoni]].]]

In the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caffè'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.

In the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that—against the will of many of its inhabitants—was being extended to the city.

In the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.

After the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.

In addition to Italian, approximately 2&nbsp;million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3-03911-041-4|page=260}}</ref>

=== Media ===
Milan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.
Other local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Catholic newspaper ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.
Milan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi (magazine)|Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.

Several commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Lombard cuisine}}
[[File:Sun-rice (11027684905).jpg|thumb|left|''[[risotto|Risotto alla Milanese]]''.]]
[[File:Cotoletta alla milanese.jpg|thumb|''[[Cotoletta|Cotoletta alla Milanese]]''.]]
Like most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), ''[[ossobuco]]'' (braised [[veal]] shank served with a condiment called ''[[gremolata]]''), ''[[risotto|risotto alla milanese]]'' (with [[saffron]] and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed [[tripe]] with beans), ''[[mondeghili]]'' ([[meatballs]] made with leftover meat fried in butter), and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).

Season-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for [[Easter]], ''pane dei morti'' ("bread of the (Day of the ) Dead", cookies flavoured with [[cinnamon]]) for [[All Souls' Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas. The ''salame Milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. Renowned Milanese cheeses are [[gorgonzola]] (from the [[Gorgonzola, Milan|namesake]] village nearby), [[mascarpone]], used in pastry-making, [[taleggio cheese|taleggio]] and quartirolo.

Milan is well known for its world-class restaurants and cafés, characterised by innovative cuisine and design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where Are the World's Best Shopping and Dining Destinations?|url=http://magazine.fourseasons.com/travel-food-style/things-to-do/personalities-perspectives/best-shopping-and-dining-around-the-world|publisher=Four Seasons Magazine|access-date=14 September 2014|archive-date=15 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915032240/http://magazine.fourseasons.com/travel-food-style/things-to-do/personalities-perspectives/best-shopping-and-dining-around-the-world|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2014}}, Milan has 157 Michelin-selected places, including three 2-Michelin-starred restaurants;<ref>{{cite web|title=best restaurant in milan |url=http://milan.citylisting.org/category/restaurant/ |access-date=27 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402202228/http://milan.citylisting.org/category/restaurant/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 }}</ref> these include [[Cracco Peck|Cracco]], Sadler and il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michelin Guide restaurants – Milan|url=http://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurants/Restaurants-Milan-_-Milano-Italy?strLocid=31NDMwdDIxMGNORFV1TkRZek5qZz1jT1M0eE9EZ3hOdz09|access-date=17 September 2014|archive-date=20 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020151144/http://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurants/Restaurants-Milan-_-Milano-Italy?strLocid=31NDMwdDIxMGNORFV1TkRZek5qZz1jT1M0eE9EZ3hOdz09|url-status=live}}</ref> Many historical restaurants and bars are found in the historic centre, the [[Brera (district of Milan)|Brera]] and [[Navigli]] districts.
