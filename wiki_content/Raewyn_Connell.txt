==Life and career==
Connell was born on 3 January 1944 in [[Sydney]], Australia. Her father, William Fraser (Bill) Connell ([[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]), was a Professor of Education at the University of Sydney for many years, where she focused on educational research and teaching. Her mother, Margaret Lloyd Connell (née Peck) was a high school science teacher. Connell has two sisters, [[Patricia Margaret Selkirk]] and Helen Connell.<ref name="AWAP">{{cite web | url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0734b.htm | title=Connell, Raewyn (1944 - ) | publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project 2014 | access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="USydney">{{cite web | url=http://sydney.edu.au/arms/archives/history/HonConnell.shtml | title=Honorary awards - Emeritus Professor William Fraser Connell OBE | publisher=University of Sydney | access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="Cunningham">{{cite web | url=http://cunningham.acer.edu.au/inted/onlinedocs/Connell_WFC_%20in_date_order.pdf | title=William Fraser Connell | publisher=Cunningham Library - Australian Council for Educational Research | access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="SLNSW">{{cite web | url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110363071 | title=William Fraser Connell papers, 1891-2010 | publisher=State Library of New South Wales | access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref> 

Connell was educated at Manly and North Sydney High Schools, and has degrees from the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[University of Sydney]]. She has held academic positions at universities in Australia, including being the founding professor of sociology at [[Macquarie University]] 1976–1991. 

In the United States Connell was visiting professor of Australian studies at [[Harvard University]] 1991–1992, and professor of sociology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]] 1992–1995.<ref>[http://www.raewynconnell.net/p/about-raewyn_20.html "About Raewyn"]. raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.</ref> She was a rank-and-file member of the [[Australian Labor Party]] until the early 1980s and a trade unionist, currently in the [[National Tertiary Education Union]].

Connell's sociology emphasises the historical nature of social reality and the transformative character of social practice.  Her writing tries to combine empirical detail, structural analysis, critique, and relevance to practice.  Much of her empirical work uses biographical (life-history) interviewing in education, family life and workplaces. She has written or co-written twenty-one books and more than 150 research papers.<ref>[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2011/01/research-publications-complete-list-or.html "Research publications (complete list)."] raewynconnell.net.

Retrieved on 30 November 2012.</ref> Almost all her earlier work was published under the gender-neutral name "R. W. Connell" up to the second edition of  "Masculinities" in 2005. A few publications are under the names Bob or Robert. Since 2006 all her work has appeared under the name Raewyn Connell. Connell has also written about [[transsexualism]].<ref>Connell, Raewyn. 2012.

Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, vol. 37 no. 4, 857–881; Connell, R.

==Major contributions==
===Class and education===
Connell first became known for research on large-scale class dynamics ("Ruling Class, Ruling Culture", 1977 and "[[Class Structure in Australian History]]", 1980), and the ways class and gender hierarchies are re-made in the everyday life of schools ("Making the Difference", 1982).

===Gender===

In the late 1980s she developed a social theory of gender relations ("Gender and Power", 1987), which emphasised that gender is a large-scale social structure not just a matter of personal identity. In applied fields she has worked on poverty and education ("Schools and Social Justice", 1993), sexuality and AIDS prevention, and labour movement strategy ("Socialism & Labor", 1978).

===Masculinity===
Connell is best known outside Australia for studies of the social construction of [[masculinity]].  She was one of the founders of this research field,<ref>[http://fdp.edsw.usyd.edu.au/users/raewyn "Faculty of Education and Social Work – Professor Raewyn Connell"]. University of Sydney. Retrieved on 2 March 2012.</ref> and her book "Masculinities" (1995, 2005) is the most-cited in the field.  The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] has been particularly influential and has attracted much debate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Connell|first1=R. W.|last2=Messerschmidt|first2=James W.|date=December 2005|title=Hegemonic Masculinity|journal=Gender & Society|language=en-US|volume=19|issue=6|pages=829–859|doi=10.1177/0891243205278639|s2cid=5804166|issn=0891-2432}}</ref> She has been an advisor to [[UNESCO]] and UNO initiatives relating men, boys and masculinities to gender equality and peacemaking.

===Southern theory===
Connell has developed a sociology of intellectuals that emphasises the collective character of intellectual labour, and the importance of its social context.  Her 2007 book ''Southern Theory'' extended this to the global dynamics of knowledge production, critiquing the "Northern" bias of mainstream social science which is predominately produced in "metropolitan" universities. In doing so, she argues, metropolitan social theory fails to adequately explain social phenomena in the Southern experience.

She analysed examples of theoretical work deriving from the global South: including the work of [[Paulin Hountondji]], [[Ali Shariati]], [[Veena Das]], [[Ashis Nandy]] and [[Raúl Prebisch]]. Connell has also examined Southern theories of [[neoliberalism]]<ref>[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2012/05/research-project-market-society-on.html "Research Project- Market Society on a World Scale"] raewynconnell.net. Retrieved 30 November 2012.</ref> and gender.<ref>[http://gender.stanford.edu/events/roses-south-re-thinking-gender-analysis-world-perspective "Roses from the South- Re-Thinking Gender Analysis from a World Perspective"] Clayman Institute for Gender Research, Stanford University.
