'''Andrew M. Greeley''' (February 5, 1928 – May 29, 2013) was an American Catholic priest, [[sociologist]], journalist and popular novelist.

Greeley was a professor of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Arizona]] and the [[University of Chicago]], and a [[research associate]] with the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC). For many years, he wrote a weekly column for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and contributed regularly to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', and ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]''.

==Life and career==
Greeley was born into a large Irish Catholic family in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (a suburb of Chicago) in 1928.<ref name=allenobit>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=John L.|title=Fr.

From 1954 to 1964, Greeley served as an assistant pastor at [[Christ the King]] parish in Chicago, during which time he studied sociology at the [[University of Chicago]]. His first book, ''The Church in the Suburbs (1958)'', was drawn from notes a sociology professor had encouraged him to take describing his experiences.<ref name=latobit/> He received a [[Master of Arts]] in 1961 and a PhD in 1962. His [[doctoral dissertation]] dealt with the influence of religion on the career plans of 1961 college graduates. At various times, Greeley was a professor at the [[University of Arizona]], the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the University of Chicago. He was denied [[tenure]] by the University of Chicago in 1973, despite having been a faculty member there for a decade and having published dozens of books; he attributed the denial to anti-Catholic prejudice, although a colleague said his cantankerous temperament was more to blame.<ref name=latobit/> He would eventually be granted tenure by the university.

==Sociology==
As a sociologist, he published a large number of influential academic works during the 1960s and 1970s, including ''Unsecular Man: The Persistence of Religion'' (1972) and ''The American Catholic: A Social Portrait'' (1977).<ref name=allenobit/> Over the course of his career, he authored more than 70 scholarly books,<ref name=allenobit/><ref name=latobit/> largely focusing on the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. His early work challenged the widespread assumption that Catholics had low college attendance rates, showing that white Catholics were in fact more successful than other whites in obtaining college undergraduate and graduate degrees, which he attributed to what he called the high-quality education Catholics received in [[parochial schools]].<ref name=latobit/> He also studied how religion influenced the political behavior of ethnic Catholics, and he was one of the first scholars to document the sociological effects of the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s reforms on American Catholics.<ref name=allenobit/><ref name=latobit/>

In the early 1970s, the U.S. bishops commissioned him to write a profile of the American priesthood.<ref name=allenobit/> He completed a two-year survey in 1972, reporting that dissatisfaction among the priests was widespread; but the bishops rejected his findings.<ref name=latobit/> Greeley said, "Honesty compels me to say that I believe the present leadership in the church to be morally, intellectually and religiously bankrupt."<ref name=latobit/>

Greeley's sociological work was also viewed with suspicion by some of his fellow clerics, and his archbishop (later cardinal), [[John Cody]], denied Greeley's request for a [[parish (Catholic Church)|parish ministry]].<ref name=latobit/> Greeley criticized Cody, calling him a "madcap tyrant" when Cody closed a number of inner-city schools.

==Interpreting American Catholicism==
Greeley's biographer summarizes his interpretation:

{{quote|He argued for the continued salience of ethnicity in American life and the distinctiveness of the Catholic religious imagination. Catholics differed from other Americans, he explained in a variety of publications, by their tendency to think in "sacramental" terms, imagining God as present in a world that was revelatory rather than bleak. The poetic elements in the Catholic tradition--its stories, imagery, and rituals--kept most Catholics in the fold, according to Greeley, whatever their disagreements with particular aspects of church discipline or doctrine. But Greeley also insisted on the disastrous impact of ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'', the 1968 [[papal encyclical]] upholding the [[Catholic theology of sexuality#Contraception|Catholic ban on contraception]], holding it almost solely responsible for a sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975. He believed that lay Catholics understood far better than their bishops that sex in marriage was intended by God to be joyous and playful, a true means of grace.<ref>Leslie Woodcock Tentler, "Greeley, Andrew Moran" [http://www.anb.org/articles/08/08-02390.html in ''American National Biography Online'' April 2016; Access Apr 30 2017]</ref>}}

As described by [[John L. Allen Jr.]] of the ''National Catholic Reporter'', Greeley became fascinated with what has been called the Catholic [[Catholic imagination|"analogical imagination"]], the idea that "visible, tangible things in the created order serve as metaphors for the divine, as opposed to the more textual and literal religious sensibility of Protestants and others."<ref name=allenobit/> Greeley believed that it was this viewpoint that had led the church to be a pre-eminent patron of the arts through the centuries, allowing it to communicate through artistic imagery spiritual concepts that doctrinal texts alone could not.<ref name=allenobit/> Greeley's appreciation for the spiritual power of art inspired him to begin writing works of fiction.<ref name=allenobit/>

==Fiction==
Greeley's literary output was such it was said that he "never had an unpublished thought".<ref name=grobel/><ref>{{cite book|last=Greeley|first=Andrew M.|title=Furthermore! Memories of a Parish Priest|year=1999|publisher=Forge|location=New York}}</ref>  He said, "The only way I can write fiction is to keep those hours from 6:00 to 9:00 A.M. sacred."<ref name="GreelyLoveAffair">{{cite book|last1=Greeley|first1=Andrew M.|title=Love Affair: A Prayer Journal|url=https://archive.org/details/loveaffairprayer00gree|url-access=registration|date=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/loveaffairprayer00gree/page/123 123]}}</ref>  He published his first novel, ''The Magic Cup'', in 1975,<ref name=allenobit/> a fantasy tale about a young king who would lead Ireland from [[paganism]] to Christianity. A second novel, ''Death in April'', followed in 1980.

His third novel, ''[[The Cardinal Sins]]'' (1981), was his first work of fiction to become a major commercial success. As one reviewer put it, ''The Cardinal Sins'' "did for the Catholic Church what ''[[The Godfather]]'' did for the mafia".<ref name=allenobit/> The novel's principal characters were both priests—one a writer-sociologist (like Greeley), and the other a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] who had broken the [[vow of celibacy]]. At the time of the book's release, Chicago's cardinal, [[John Cody]], was the subject of allegations of having diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Church to a mistress.<ref name=latobit/> Church officials accused Greeley of using the novel to attack Cardinal Cody, although Greeley denied the charges and told the ''New York Times'' that Cody was "a much better bishop ... and a much better human being" than the character in the novel.<ref name=latobit/>

''The Cardinal Sins'' was followed by the [[Passover]] trilogy: ''Thy Brother's Wife'' (1982), ''Ascent into Hell'' (1983), and ''[[Lord of the Dance (novel)|Lord of the Dance]]'' (1984). Thereafter, he wrote a minimum of two novels per year, on average. In 1987 alone, he produced four novels and two works of non-fiction. He once said that he wrote an average of 5,000 words per day, and was known to quip, "Why should I practice contraception on my ideas?"<ref name=allenobit/>

The explicit treatment of sexuality in Greeley's novels was a source of controversy for some.<ref name=allenobit/><ref name=latobit/> The ''National Catholic Register'' said that Greeley had "the dirtiest mind ever ordained".<ref name=latobit/> Greeley responded to his critics by saying that "there is nothing wrong with sex"<ref name=latobit/> and that "at the most basic level, people learn from the novels that sex is good ... Then they get the notion that sexual love is a sacrament of God's love, that sexual love tells us something about God."<ref name=allenobit/> He told one interviewer that his erotic writing was not pornography and that it was "less erotic than the ''[[Song of Songs]]'' in the scriptures".<ref name=grobel/> He insisted that from what they heard in confession from women, priests probably knew more about marriage than most married men; and he drew on this knowledge to write a marital advice book he called ''Sexual Intimacy'' (1988).<ref name=latobit/>

At the height of the Catholic Church [[sexual abuse]] scandal, Greeley wrote ''The Priestly Sins'' (2004), a novel about a young priest who is exiled to an [[insane asylum]] and then to an academic life because he reports abuse that he has witnessed.  His book ''The Making of the Pope'' (2005) was intended as a follow-up to his ''The Making of the Popes 1978''. ''The Making of the Pope'' (2005) was a first-hand account of the coalition-building process by which the conservative Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]] ascended to the papacy as [[Benedict XVI]]. Greeley also dabbled in science fiction, writing the novels ''God Game'' and ''The Final Planet''.

Greeley wrote about the spiritual life in his prayer journals "that revealed a man who most of all wanted to love God and let people know that God was a Tremendous Lover who loved them as if He loved them alone and loved everyone as if all of them were one".  (Michael Leach, "Greeley: Appreciation", National Catholic Reporter, June 21 – July 4, 2013, pp.&nbsp;12–14)  "Love Affair" (1992) was his first prayer journal, a winner of the Catholic Association book award in the spiritual category, followed by "Sacraments of Love" (1994), "Windows" (1995), "I Hope You're Listening, God" (1997), and "Letters To A Loving God" (2002).  The prayer journal was neither a book of prayers nor a book about prayer but rather an experience of praying, to dialogue with God.  It is prayer as it happens.  (Andrew Greeley, "Love Affair," 1992, pp.&nbsp;5–6)  He said that writing out prayers on a computer screen for his journals "are the best way to pray I've yet discovered."  (Ibid., p.&nbsp;5)  Thus, paraphrasing a famous quote about him, it might be said he "never had an unpublished prayer".  Leach said, "The prayer journals were among his favorite books."  (Op.cit., NCR, p.&nbsp;14).

Greeley wrote his first major collection of poetry entitled ''The Sense of Love'' (1992), taking his place among the priest poets of the Anglo-Roman tradition, as he examined the love relationship between God and humanity on the levels of eros (sexual), philos (social), and agape (spiritual)  (Robert McGovern, foreword, ''The Sense of Love'', 1992, pp. viii-xi).

==Politics==
Politically, Greeley was an outspoken critic of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] and the [[Iraq War]], and a strong supporter of immigration reform. His book titled ''A Stupid, Unjust, and Criminal War: Iraq 2001&ndash;2007'' (2007) was critical of the rush by the Bush administration to start the Iraq War and the consequences of that war for the United States. Garry Wills wrote, "Andrew Greeley shows that Jesus is the Prince of Peace, not a Captain of War."<ref>Ibid., Leach, NCR, p. 14.</ref>

==Priesthood==
Reflecting on his life's work, Greeley told the ''Chicago Tribune'' in 1992, "I'm a priest, pure and simple ... The other things I do — sociological research, my newspaper columns, the novels I write — are just my way of being a priest. I decided I wanted to be one when I was a kid growing up on the West Side. I've never wavered or wanted to be anything but."<ref name=obit/>

==Philanthropy==
Greeley was probably the best-selling priest in history, with an estimated 250,000 readers who would buy almost every novel he published, probably generating at least $110 million in gross income by 1999.<ref name=allenobit/> He was able to live comfortably in Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]],<ref name=allenobit/><ref name=obit/> but he donated most of his earnings<ref name=allenobit/><ref name=grobel/> to the Church and other charities. In 1984, he contributed $1 million to endow a [[endowed chair|chair]] in Roman Catholic Studies at the University of Chicago.<ref name=latobit/> In 1986, he established a $1 million private educational fund for scholarships and financial support to inner-city schools in the [[Chicago Archdiocese]] with a [[minority group|minority]] student body of more than 50%. He had originally offered the donation to the Archdiocese, but the then Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]], had declined the gift without ever publicly offering an explanation.<ref name=biggift>{{cite news|last=McNeil|first=Brett|title=Greeley's donation welcomed this time|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-30/news/0301300368_1|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 30, 2003}}</ref> In 2003, the Archdiocese accepted the $420,000 that still remained in the fund to bolster a newly established Catholic Schools Endowment Fund, providing scholarships for low-income students and for raising teachers' salaries in the Archdiocese's schools.<ref name=biggift/> Greeley also funded an annual lecture series, "The Church in Society", at [[St. Mary of the Lake Seminary]], Mundelein, Illinois, where he had earned his [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|S.T.L.]] in 1954.

In 2008, he donated several thousand dollars to the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]] of [[Barack Obama]],<ref>[http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Andrew_Greeley.php Greeley's federal campaign contributions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704191720/http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Andrew_Greeley.php |date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> who was then serving as a U.S. Senator representing Illinois, although Greeley predicted that racism would lead to Obama's defeat.<ref name=obit/>

==Injury and death==
Greeley suffered skull fractures in a fall in 2008 when his clothing got caught on the door of a taxi as it pulled away; he was hospitalized in critical condition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Mary|title=Greeley in critical condition after fall|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-11-09/news/0811080384_1_chicago-priest-rev-andrew-greeley-critical-condition|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 9, 2008}}</ref> He remained in poor health for the rest of his life and died on May 29, 2013 at his Chicago home. He was 85.<ref name=nytimesobit>{{cite news|last=Steinfels|first=Peter|title=Andrew M.

==Honors==
Greeley was awarded [[honorary degrees]] from the [[University of Arizona]], [[Bard College]] (New York State) and the [[National University of Ireland|National University of Ireland, Galway]]. In 1981, he received the F. Sadlier Dinger Award, which is presented each year by educational publisher [[William H. Sadlier, Inc.]] in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the ministry of religious education in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agreeley.com/author.html|title=Andrew Greeley's Biography Page|website=www.agreeley.com}}</ref>
