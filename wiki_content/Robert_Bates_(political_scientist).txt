==Education and career==
He was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1942.<ref name=":0" /> His father was a country doctor.<ref name=":0" /> After graduating from [[Haverford College]] in 1964, Bates received his Ph.D. in Political Science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1969.<ref name=":0" /> He has also studied anthropology at [[Manchester University]] and the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and economics at [[Stanford University]] at the graduate level. He joined the faculty of the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1969. From 1985 until 1993 he was Luce Professor of Political Economy at [[Duke University]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1991 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 2016.

Bates's research focuses on the political economy of development, particularly in Africa. Starting with field work in the mining townships of the Copperbelt he subsequently conducted field work in the Luapula Valley of Zambia. Expanding the scope of his research to include countries in Eastern and Western Africa as well, he addressed the politics of agricultural development and food supply just at the time that dearth and famine increasingly arose on the continent.

Under the auspices of the Africa Economic Research Consortium and the Harvard University, Bates returned to Africa twice yearly to contribute to a two-volume analysis of Africa's economic performance in the post independence period.

Bates has received grants {{How many|date=March 2020}} from the National Science Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, and other sources; been a Carnegie Scholar, an Olin Fellow at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, and Moore Fellow at the California Institute of Technology; and received the Riker Prize from the University of Rochester's department of political science. He has served as Vice President of the American Political Science Association and President of its Comparative Politics Section and on the editorial board of book series with the California and Cambridge University Press. He has held fellowships at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Russell Sage Foundation and served as a consultant with the World Bank. He is a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.
