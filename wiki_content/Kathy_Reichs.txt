==Casey Anthony murder trial==
{{Main|Death of Caylee Anthony}}
In 2011, Reichs was an expert witness in the [[Casey Anthony]] murder trial. After initially refusing to be a part of Anthony's defense, she cited biased media coverage as the reason she changed her mind.  "Initially, I said no, and then I started seeing media coverage and it made me angry. This woman needed to be tried in court, not in the press."

Reichs performed a full skeletal analysis of Anthony's daughter, Caylee, but could not determine a cause of death.  She concluded that there was no evidence of abuse and that the child appeared to be well-nourished.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/story/2011-08-22/For-author-Kathy-Reichs-its-all-about-the-bones/50099182/1 | archive-url= https://archive.today/20130412022818/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/story/2011-08-22/For-author-Kathy-Reichs-its-all-about-the-bones/50099182/1 | title= Reichs Examines Murder Victim Caylee Anthony | work= [[USA Today]]| archive-date= 12 April 2013}}</ref>
