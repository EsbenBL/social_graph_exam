'''Yegor Timurovich Gaidar''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Его́р Тиму́рович Гайда́р}}; {{IPA-ru|jɪˈɡor tʲɪˈmurəvʲɪtɕ ɡɐjˈdar|pron}}; 19 March 1956 – 16 December 2009)<ref name="rian" /> was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] economist, politician, and author, and was the Acting [[Prime Minister of Russia]] from 15 June 1992 to 14 December 1992.

He was the architect of the controversial [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] reforms administered in Russia after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], which brought him both praise and harsh criticism. He participated in the preparation of the [[Belavezha Accords|Bialowieza agreements]]. Many Russians held him responsible for the economic hardships that plagued the country in the 1990s that resulted in mass poverty and [[hyperinflation]] among other things, although [[Liberalism in Russia|liberals]] praised him as a man who did what had to be done to save the country from complete collapse.<ref name=tel>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/finance-obituaries/6827912/Yegor-Gaidar.html Yegor Gaidar] [[The Daily Telegraph]].

==Personal life==
Gaidar was born in 1956 in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], the son of Ariadna Bazhova<ref name="bookref2">{{Cite book|last=Gaĭdar|first=Egor Timurovich|title=Days of defeat and victory|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1999|page=6|isbn=0-295-97823-6}}</ref> and ''[[Pravda]]'' military correspondent [[Timur Gaidar]], who fought in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and was a friend of [[Raúl Castro]]. His paternal grandfather was Soviet writer [[Arkady Gaidar]] and his maternal grandfather was writer [[Pavel Bazhov]].<ref name=book1/> Despite the Turkic-sounding surname, Gaidar was Russian; his grandfather, originally called "Golikov", adopted the name "Gaidar" from the [[Khakas language]] as a ''nom-de-plume''.
 
Gaidar married the daughter of writer [[Arkady Strugatsky]] during his time at the university.<ref name=book1>{{cite book|last=Medvedev|first=Roy Aleksandrovich|author2=George Shriver|title=Post-Soviet Russia: a journey through the Yeltsin era|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2000|page=[https://archive.org/details/postsovietrussia00medv/page/13 13]|isbn=0-231-10606-8|url=https://archive.org/details/postsovietrussia00medv/page/13}}</ref> His daughter, [[Maria Gaidar]], was one of the leaders of the Russian democratic opposition.

==Career==
Gaidar graduated with honors from the [[Moscow State University]], [[MSU Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]], in 1978 and worked as a researcher in several academic institutes. A long-time member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and an editor of the CPSU ideological journal ''Communist'' during the [[perestroika]], he joined [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s camp during [[Perestroika]]. In 1991 he quit the Communist Party{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and was promoted to Yeltsin's government.

While in government, Gaidar advocated [[free market]] economic reforms according to the principle of [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]. His best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state, which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a [[market economy]] in Russia. He also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies, and reduced the budget deficit. Gaidar was the First Vice-Premier of the Russian Government and Minister of Economics from 1991 until 1992, and Minister of Finance from February 1992 until April 1992.

He was appointed Acting [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] under President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1992 from 15 June until 14 December, when the anti-Yeltsin Russian [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] refused to confirm Gaidar in this position and [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] was eventually chosen as a compromise figure. Gaidar continued to advise the new government. On 18 September 1993, he was again appointed the First Vice-Premier under Chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition. He played an active role in the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]].

On 3 October, he famously spoke live on Russian television, then broadcasting from an emergency station near Moscow, as there was fighting going on in the Ostankino complex, calling on Muscovites to gather to defend Yeltsin's government so that Russia would not be "turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqPLUz1Mlfg|title=Егор Гайдар в октябре 1993 г.|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

In the [[1993 Russian legislative election|1993 Duma elections]], in the aftermath of the crisis, Gaidar led the pro-government bloc [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]] and was seen by some as a possible future Prime Minister. However, due to the bloc's failure to win the plurality of votes in the election, Gaidar's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on 20 January 1994.
[[File:YegorGaidar.jpg|thumb|right|Gaidar in the early 1990s]]
During the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] Yegor Gaidar, [[Boris Nemtsov]] and [[Boris Fyodorov]] were in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a mediation mission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vor.ru/Kosovo/opinions_eng_29_03_99.html |title=Russia's Reaction to NATO Aggression Against Yugoslavia |date=29 March 1999 |access-date=17 December 2009 |archive-date=28 February 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228164013/http://www.vor.ru/Kosovo/opinions_eng_29_03_99.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Reforms controversy===
Gaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in 1992 with little care for their social impact; however, it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a [[famine]]. Russia had no currency for buying import goods, at the same time, no-one gave credits as the country was essentially bankrupt.<ref>[http://expert.ru/2009/12/17/reformy_gaidara/ Гайдар и его реформы] by Григорий Герасимов</ref> The collapse of the Soviet social system led to serious deterioration in [[standard of living|living standards]]. Millions of Russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive [[hyperinflation]]. Moreover, the [[privatization in Russia|privatization]] and break-up of state assets left over from the Soviet Union, which he played a big part in, led to much of the country's wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives, later known as the [[Business oligarch#Yeltsinian oligarchs|Russian oligarchs]], for much less than what they were worth. The voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy, these oligarchs were dubbed "kleptocrats."<ref name=Granville>Johanna Granville, [https://www.academia.edu/5597850/The_Russian_Kleptocracy_and_Rise_of_Organized_Crime  "''Dermokratizatsiya'' and ''Prikhvatizatsiya'': The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime,"]''Demokratizatsiya'' (summer 2003), pp. 448-457.</ref> As society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms, Gaidar was often held by Russians as one of the men most responsible.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20091216/ts_nm/us_russia_gaidar_death |title=Russia's market reform architect Gaidar dies at 53|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]|access-date=17 December 2009}} {{Dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref> On the other hand, the ubiquitous goods deficit of the Soviet years disappeared and it became possible to buy all goods in the shops. Per capita calorie consumption under Gaidar diminished by 3.5% from 2526.88 kCal to 2438.17 kCal.<ref name="калорийность">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203153341/http://www.gks.ru/dbscripts/Cbsd/DBInet.cgi?pl=2340017|title=Калорийность потребленных продуктов питания в среднем на члена домохозяйства, за сутки, килокалория|date=3 December 2009|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>

According to Franklin Foer writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', however, "when Yegor Gaidar ... asked the United States for help hunting down the billions that the KGB had carted away, the White House refused."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/how-kleptocracy-came-to-america/580471/|title=Russian-Style Kleptocracy Is Infiltrating America|first=Franklin|last=Foer|date=7 February 2019|website=The Atlantic}}</ref>

One of Gaidar's most outspoken critics was the [[Yabloko]] economist and MP [[Grigory Yavlinsky]], who had proposed since 1990 a [[500 Days]] programme for the transition of the whole USSR to market economic, which was first backed and then dismissed by the government of [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]]. Yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and Gaidar's reforms program, such as the sequencing of [[privatization]] vs. [[Price controls|liberalization of prices]] and the applicability of his program to the entire Soviet Union.

Gaidar's supporters contend that although many mistakes were made, he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation. According to the [[BBC]]'s Andrei Ostalski, "There were only two solutions—either introduce [[Martial law in Russia|martial law]] and severe rationing, or radically liberalize the economy. The first option meant going all the way back to the [[stalinism|Stalinist]] system of mass repression. The second meant a colossal change, a journey—or, rather, a race—through uncharted waters with an unpredictable outcome."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8416497.stm Yegor Gaidar: The price to pay] [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 17 December 2009</ref>

=== Poisoning case ===
In November 2006 Gaidar went to [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] to present his book '[[Death of the Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia]]' at an academic conference. Shorty after breakfast, a fruit salad and a cup of tea, Gaidar felt sick and returned from the conference hall to his room at the hotel. Then he was called on the phone to come down and deliver his speech, what Gaidar has later recalled as a call that saved his life, as he must had certainly died if were left in his room unattended. After Gaidar had tried to deliver his speech he collapsed in the university hallway and was urgently taken a to local hospital. His colleague, Ekaterina Genieva, recalled that "He was lying on the floor unconscious. There was blood coming from his nose; he was vomiting blood. This went on for more than half an hour".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bowcott|first=Tom Parfitt Owen|date=2006-12-01|title=Family believes former Russian prime minister also poisoned|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/01/politics.russia|access-date=2020-09-15|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Next day he moved from the hospital to the Russian embassy's premises and arranged a transfer to Moscow where the doctors familiar with his health status suggested that it looks like he was 'poisoned'.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{Cite web|date=2006-12-01|title=Former Russian PM Gaidar poisoned, say his doctors|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/former-russian-pm-gaidar-poisoned-say-his-doctors-426569.html|access-date=2020-09-15|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

In a later interview that was published in the [[Financial Times|FT]] Gaidar claimed that this has been an attempted political murder, where "most likely that means that some obvious or hidden adversaries of the Russian authorities stand behind the scenes of this event, those who are interested in further radical deterioration of relations between Russia and the west".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Subscribe to read {{!}} Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/aacc818a-855b-11db-b12c-0000779e2340|access-date=2020-09-15|website=ft.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Gaidar Alleges He Was Poisoned By Putin's Enemies|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1073264.html|access-date=2020-09-15|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en}}</ref>

Another Russian reformist official and former colleague of Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais rejected a possibility of Kremlin's involvement in this case, commenting that "Yegor Gaidar was on the verge of death on 24 November. The deadly triangle - Politkovskaya, Litvinenko and Gaidar - would have been very desirable for some people who are seeking an unconstitutional and forceful change of power in Russia.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>"

Irish police opened an official investigation of the case.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|title=Ирландская полиция начала расследование странной болезни Гайдара {{!}} DW {{!}} 01.12.2006|url=https://www.dw.com/ru/%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0/a-2255876|access-date=2020-09-15|publisher=Deutsche Welle|language=ru-RU}}</ref> One of the versions voiced by the Russian opposition leaders and Kremlin supporters suggested that [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], then a Russian oligarch in exile, may have been behind it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Яд для Гайдара|url=https://expert.ru/2006/11/29/jad_gajdar/|access-date=2020-09-15|website=expert.ru}}</ref> Andrey Illarionov, former Putin's adviser now living in the US, commented that the whole case was staged, and the reason for taking Gaidar to hospital must have been hyperthensia, stress or alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Спецоперация "Отравление Гайдара Борисом Березовским"|url=https://aillarionov.livejournal.com/1114866.html|access-date=2020-09-15|website=aillarionov.livejournal.com}}</ref>
