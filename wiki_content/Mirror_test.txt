The '''mirror test'''—sometimes called the '''mark test''', '''mirror self-recognition''' ('''MSR''') '''test''', '''red spot technique''', or '''rouge test'''—is a [[animal behavior|behavioral]] technique developed in 1970 by American psychologist [[Gordon Gallup Jr.]] as an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition.<ref name="Gallup">{{cite journal

In the classic MSR test, an animal is [[anesthetized]] and then marked (e.g., painted or a sticker attached) on an area of the body the animal cannot normally see. When the animal recovers from the anesthetic, it is given access to a [[mirror]]. If the animal then touches or investigates the mark, it is taken as an indication that the animal perceives the reflected image as an image of itself, rather than of another animal.(''see [[Face perception]]'')

Very few species have passed the MSR test. Species that have, include the [[great ape]]s, a single [[Asiatic elephant]], [[dolphins]], [[orcas]], the [[Eurasian magpie]], and the [[cleaner wrasse]]. A wide range of species has been reported to fail the test, including several species of [[monkeys]], [[giant panda]]s, and [[sea lion]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Animals That Have Passed the Mirror Test|url=http://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/|access-date=23 November 2015|date=2015-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Rebecca|title=10 Animals with Self Awareness|url=http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/10-animals-with-self-awareness.html|access-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>

==Method and history==
The inspiration for the mirror test comes from an [[anecdote]] about [[Charles Darwin]] and a captive orangutan. While visiting the [[London Zoo]] in 1838, Darwin observed an orangutan, named Jenny, throwing a tantrum after being teased with an apple by her keeper. This started him thinking about the subjective experience of an orangutan.<ref name="darwin1">{{cite magazine|first=Jonathan|last=Weiner|title=Darwin at the Zoo|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwin-at-the-zoo|date=December 1, 2006|magazine=[[Scientific American]]}}</ref> He also watched Jenny gaze into a mirror and noted the possibility that she recognized herself in the reflection.<ref name="darwin2">Carl Zimmer. ''The Descent of Man: The Concise Edition.'' excerpt available at [http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229004750/http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html |date=29 February 2008 }}.</ref>

In 1970, Gordon Gallup, Jr., experimentally investigated the possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild preadolescent chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes''), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously. Each chimpanzee was put into a room by itself for two days. Next, a full-length mirror was placed in the room for a total of 80 hours at periodically decreasing distances. A multitude of behaviors was recorded upon introducing the mirrors to the chimpanzees. Initially, the chimpanzees made threatening gestures at their own images, ostensibly seeing their own reflections as threatening. Eventually, the chimps used their own reflections for self-directed responding behaviors, such as grooming parts of their body previously not observed without a mirror, picking their noses, making faces, and blowing bubbles at their own reflections.

Gallup expanded the study by manipulating the chimpanzees' appearance and observing their reaction to their reflection in the mirror. Gallup anesthetized the chimpanzees and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and on the top half of the opposite ear. When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues. Gallup then returned the chimpanzees to the cage (with the mirror removed) and allowed them to regain full consciousness. He then recorded the frequency with which the chimpanzees spontaneously touched the marked areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was reintroduced into the room and the frequency of touching the marked areas again determined. The frequency of touching increased to four to ten, with the mirror present, compared to only one when the mirror had been removed. The chimpanzees sometimes inspected their fingers visually or olfactorily after touching the marks. Other mark-directed behavior included turning and adjusting of the body to better view the mark in the mirror, or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.<ref name="Gallup" />

An important aspect of the classical mark-test (or rouge test) is that the mark/dye is nontactile, preventing attention being drawn to the marking through additional perceptual cues ([[somesthesis]]). For this reason, animals in the majority of classical tests are anesthetized. Some tests use a tactile marker.<ref name="Mitchell">{{cite journal|author=Mitchell, R.W.|year=1995|title=Evidence of dolphin self-recognition and the difficulties of interpretation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|issue=2|pages=229–234|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1029|pmid=8521261|s2cid=45507064}}</ref> If the creature stares unusually long at the part of its body with the mark or tries to rub it off, then it is said to pass the test.

Animals that are considered to be able to recognize themselves in a mirror typically progress through four stages of behavior when facing a mirror:<ref name="Plotnik2006" />
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha
| social responses
| physical inspection (e.g. looking behind the mirror)
| repetitive mirror-testing behavior
| realization of seeing themselves}}

Gallup conducted a follow-up study in which two chimpanzees with no prior experience of a mirror were put under anesthesia, marked, and observed. After recovery, they made no mark-directed behaviors either before or after being provided with a mirror.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The rouge test was also done by Michael Lewis and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn in 1979 for the purpose of self-recognition with human mothers and their children.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development|last=Shaffer|first=David|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|location=Belmont|pages=172}}</ref>

== Implication and alternate explanations ==
The default implication drawn from Gallup's test is that those animals who pass the test possess some form of self-recognition. However, a number of authors have suggested alternative explanations of a pass. For example, Povinelli<ref>Povinelli, D. J. (2000). ''Folk physics for apes. The chimpanzee’s theory of how the world works''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> suggests that the animal may see the reflection as some odd entity that it is able to control through its own movements. When the reflected entity has a mark on it, then the animal can remove the mark or alert the reflected entity to it using its own movements to do so. Critically, this explanation does not assume that the animals necessarily see the reflected entity as "self".

==Animals that have passed==
[[File:Pica pica -Manchester -England -side-8.jpg|thumb|[[European magpie]]s have demonstrated mirror self recognition.]]

Several studies using a wide range of species have investigated the occurrence of spontaneous, mark-directed behavior when given a mirror, as originally proposed by Gallup. Most marked animals given a mirror initially respond with social behavior, such as aggressive displays, and continue to do so during repeated testing. Only a few species have touched or directed behavior toward the mark, thereby passing the classic MSR test.

Findings in MSR studies are not always conclusive. Even in chimpanzees, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested.<ref name="Prior" /> Prevalence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and aging individuals.<ref name="Povinelli">{{cite journal|last1=Povinelli|first1=D.J.|last2=Rulf|first2=A.B.|last3=Landau|first3=K.R.|last4=Bierschwale|first4=D.T.|year=1993|title=Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence|journal=J.

Until the 2008 study on magpies, self-recognition was thought to reside in the [[neocortex]] area of the brain. However, this brain region is absent in nonmammals. Self-recognition may be a case of [[convergent evolution]], where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviors or traits, although species arrive at them by different routes, and the underlying mechanism may be different.<ref name="Suddendorf" />

Their results indicate a distinction between cultures and communities. They found that children from Western communities showed earlier signs of self-oriented behaviors toward the mark when given the mirror mark test, whereas an absence of this behavior was seen in children from non-Western communities. Some have claimed that such results do not suggest a delayed development in cognition in the latter group, but rather the potential of how differences in parenting styles (as influenced by culture) impact the way children express self-concept. One paper questioned the universal validity of the mirror mark test as an accurate measurement of self-concept based on these unequal results.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Broesch|first1=Tanya|last2=Callaghan|first2=Tara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|last4=Murphy|first4=Christine|last5=Rochat|first5=Philippe|s2cid=18326326|date=2010|title=Cultural Variations in Children's Mirror Self-Recognition|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1018–1029|doi=10.1177/0022022110381114|issn=0022-0221|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/31614709df7222fd21f27572005df8edaa7af3ea}}</ref>

When put through the mirror test, using a benign brown gel injected into the skin of the fish, and resembling a parasite, the cleaner wrasse showed all the behaviors of passing through the phases of the test. When provided with a colored tag in a modified mark test, the fish attempted to scrape off this tag by scraping their bodies on the side of the mirror.  Gordon Gallup believes the cleaner wrasses' behavior can be attributed to something other than recognizing itself in a mirror. Gallup has argued that a cleaner wrasse's job in life is to be aware of ectoparasites on the bodies of other fish, so it would be hyper aware of the fake parasite that it noticed in the mirror, perhaps seeing it as a parasite that it needed to clean off of a different fish. The authors of the study retort that because the fish checked itself in the mirror before and after the scraping, this means that the fish has self-awareness and recognizes that its reflection belongs to its own body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=This tiny fish can recognize itself in a mirror.

===Fish===
*The Tanganyikan cichlid, or daffodil cichlid (''[[Neolamprologus pulcher]]''), is another fish that has "failed the mirror test", according to a study done in 2017. Although not [[cleaner fish]] like the [[cleaner wrasses]], these fish are typically regarded as socially intelligent and can recognize conspecifics in their social groups. Therefore, they would theoretically make good candidates for the mirror test, but they ended up failing. Similar to the cleaner wrasse, the Tanganyikan cichlid first exhibited signs of aggression towards the mirrored image. After a colored mark was injected, the researchers found no increased scraping or trying to remove the mark, and the cichlids did not observe the side with the mark any longer than it would have otherwise. This demonstrates a lack of contingency checking and means that the Tanganyikan cichlid did not pass the mirror test.<ref name="Hotta">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hotta T, Komiyama S, Kohda M | year=2018 | journal = Animal Cognition | volume= 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 127–136 | title = A social cichlid fish failed to pass the mark test | doi = 10.1007/s10071-017-1146-y | pmid = 29150813| s2cid=3950089 }}</ref>

===Fish===
Two captive [[giant manta rays]] showed frequent, unusual and repetitive movements in front of a mirror, suggesting contingency checking. They also showed unusual self-directed behaviors when exposed to the mirror.<ref name="Ari">{{cite journal|last1=Ari|first1=C.|last2=D'Agostino|first2=D.P.|year=2016 |title=Contingency checking and self-directed behaviors in giant manta rays: Do elasmobranchs have self-awareness?|journal=Journal of Ethology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z|s2cid=18628472}}</ref> Manta rays have the largest brains of all fish. In 2016, Csilla Ari tested captive manta rays at the Atlantis Aquarium in the Bahamas by exposing them to a mirror. The manta rays appeared to be extremely interested in the mirror. They behaved strangely in front the mirror, including doing flips and moving their fins. They also blew bubbles. They did not interact with the reflection as if it were another manta ray; they did not try to socialize with it. However, only an actual mirror test can determine if they actually recognize their own reflections, or if they are just demonstrating exploratory behavior. A classic mirror test has yet to be done on manta rays.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|author=Amanda Pachniewska|year=2016|title=List of Animals That Have Passed the Mirror Test|url=http://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/|website=Animalcognition.org}}</ref>

Another fish that may pass the mirror test is an [[archerfish]], ''[[Toxotes chatareus]]''. A study in 2016 showed that archerfish can discriminate between human faces. Researchers showed this by testing the archerfish, which spit a stream of water at an image of a face when they recognized it. The archerfish would be trained to expect food when it spat at a certain image. When the archerfish was shown images of other human faces, the fish did not spit. They only spit for the image that they recognized.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/srep27523|pmid = 27272551|title = Discrimination of human faces by archerfish (Toxotes chatareus)|journal = Scientific Reports|volume = 6|pages = 27523|year = 2016|last1 = Newport|first1 = Cait|last2 = Wallis|first2 = Guy|last3 = Reshitnyk|first3 = Yarema|last4 = Siebeck|first4 = Ulrike E.|bibcode = 2016NatSR...627523N|pmc = 4895153}}</ref> Archerfish normally, in the wild, use their spitting streams to knock down prey from above into the water below. The study showed that archerfish could be trained to recognize a three-dimensional image of one face compared to an image of a different face and would spit at the face when they recognized it. The archerfish were even able to continue recognizing the image of the face even when it was rotated 30, 60 and 90°.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/10/archerfish-animal-cognition-intelligence-human-faces-news/|title=Water-spitting fish can identify and remember human faces|first=Jason|last=Bittel|date=October 18, 2018|magazine=[[National Geographic]]}}</ref>

===Pigs===
[[Pig]]s can use visual information seen in a mirror to find food, and show evidence of self-recognition when presented with their reflections. In a 2009 experiment, seven of the eight pigs tested were able to find a bowl of food hidden behind a wall and revealed using a mirror.

==Criticism==
The MSR test has been criticized for several reasons, in particular because it may result in false negative findings.<ref name="Suddendorf" />

The MSR test may be of limited value when applied to species that primarily use senses other than vision.<ref name="coren"/>{{Verify source|date=January 2009}} For example, dogs mainly use [[olfactory sense|olfaction]] and [[hearing|audition]]; vision is used third. This may be why dogs fail the MSR test. With this in mind, biologist [[Marc Bekoff]] developed a scent-based paradigm using [[dog urine]] to test self-recognition in canines.<ref name="archer"/><ref name="coren"/> He tested his own dog, but his results were inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201107/does-my-dog-recognize-himself-in-mirror | title=Does My Dog Recognize Himself in a Mirror? |first=Stanley|last=Coren |date=July 7, 2011 |work=[[Psychology Today]]}}</ref> Dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz formalized Bekoff's idea in a controlled experiment, reported in 2016<ref name="Horowitz">{{Cite book|title=Being a dog : following the dog into a world of smell|last=Horowitz |first=Alexandra |date=2016 |publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781476795997|location=New York|oclc = 955777362}}</ref> and published in 2017.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Alexandra|date=2017|title=Smelling themselves: Dogs investigate their own odors longer when modified in an "olfactory mirror" test|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=143C|pages=17–24|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.08.001|pmid=28797909|s2cid=4929863}}</ref> She compared the dogs' behavior when examining their own and others' odors, and also when examining their own odor with an added smell "mark" analogous to the visual mark in MSR tests. These subjects not only discriminated their own odor from that of other dogs, as Bekoff had found, but also spent more time investigating their own odor "image" when it was modified, as subjects who pass the MSR test do.<ref name="the atlantic">{{cite web|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/can-dogs-smell-their-reflections/537219/|title= Can Dogs Smell Their 'Reflections'?|date=17 August 2017 |access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref> A 2016 study<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cazzolla Gatti|first=Roberto|date=2016|title=Self-consciousness: beyond the looking-glass and what dogs found there|journal=Ethology Ecology & Evolution|volume=28|issue=2|pages=232–240|doi=10.1080/03949370.2015.1102777|s2cid=217507938|issn=0394-9370}}</ref> suggested an ethological approach, the "Sniff test of self-recognition (STSR)" which did not shed light on different ways of checking for self-recognition.

Another concern with the MSR test is that some species quickly respond aggressively to their mirror reflection as if it were a threatening conspecific, thereby preventing the animal to calmly consider what the reflection actually represents. This may be why gorillas and monkeys fail the MSR test.<ref name="Couchman">{{cite journal|author=Couchman, J.J.|year=2011|title=Self-agency in rhesus monkeys|journal=Biology Letters|pages=39–41|doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0536|pmid=21733868|volume=8|issue=1|pmc=3259954}}</ref><ref name="Anderson">{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Primatology|year=1984|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81–98|title=Monkeys with mirrors: Some questions for primate psychology|author=Anderson, J.R.|doi=10.1007/bf02735149|s2cid=30888917}}</ref>

In a MSR test, animals may not recognise the mark as abnormal, or may not be sufficiently motivated to react to it. However, this does not mean they are unable to recognize themselves. For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test, but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviors that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them.<ref name="scientificamerican1">{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kids-and-animals-who-fail-classic-mirror |title=Kids (and animals) who fail classic mirror tests may still have sense of self |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=30 May 2013 |first=Maggie|last=Koerth-Baker |work=[[Scientific American]]}}</ref> Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their heads in the mirror test.<ref name="Suddendorf" />

Frans de Waal, a biologist and primatologist at Emory University, has stated that self-awareness is not binary, and the mirror test should not be relied upon as a sole indicator of self-awareness, though it is a good test to have. Different animals adapt to the mirror in different ways.<ref>{{Cite magazine | url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/the-mirror-test-peers-into-the-workings-of-animal-minds-65497 |title = The Mirror Test Peers into the Workings of Animal Minds | first=Carolyn|last=Wilke |date=February 21, 2019 |magazine=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]}}</ref>

Finally, controversy arose over whether self-recognition (''through specifically visual stimuli'') implies self-awareness. Dogs recognize their own scent as different from others' scents,<ref name="bekoff" /> but fail the traditional, visual mirror test. There are also many animals that are biologically unfit for this test, for example, certain species of mole that are born blind.

==Rouge test==

The rouge test is a version of the mirror test used with human children.<ref name=Amsterdam>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dev.420050403 |author=Beulah Amsterdam |title=Mirror self-image reactions before age two |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=297–305 |year=1972 |pmid=4679817}}</ref> Using [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] makeup, an experimenter surreptitiously places a dot on the face of the child.

===Developmental reactions===
From the ages of 6 to 12 months, the child typically sees a "sociable playmate" in the mirror's reflection. Self-admiring and embarrassment usually begin at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months, most children demonstrate avoidance behaviors.<ref name="Amsterdam" /> Finally, at 18 months, half of children recognize the reflection in the mirror as their own<ref name="Lewis" /> and by 20 to 24 months, self-recognition climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behavior; they touch their own noses or try to wipe the marks off.<ref name="Amsterdam" />

Self-recognition in mirrors apparently is independent of familiarity with reflecting surfaces.<ref name=Priel/> In some cases, the rouge test has been shown to have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a [[Nso people|Cameroonian Nso]] sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact.<ref name=Keller>{{cite journal |author=Heidi Keller |author2=Relindis Yovsi |author3=Joern Borke |author4=Joscha Kärtner |author5=Henning Jensen |author6=Zaira Papaligoura  |title=Developmental Consequences of Early Parenting Experiences: Self-Recognition and Self-Regulation in Three Cultural Communities |journal=Child Development |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1745–1760 |year=2004|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00814.x |pmid=15566377 |s2cid=601275 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3475594aa32a6a11d1c31ea41c8ea2676c6ac700 }}</ref> A strong correlation between self-concept and [[object permanence]] have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.<ref name=Bertenthal>{{cite journal |first1=Bennett I.|last1=Bertenthal |first2=Kurt W.|last2=Fischer |title=Development of Self-Recognition in the Infant |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=14 |pages=44–50 |year= 1978 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.14.1.44 |url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/~ddl/articlesCopy/BertenthalFischerDevtSelfRecog.DevPsy1978.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript |citeseerx=10.1.1.550.1903 }}</ref>

===Implications===
The rouge test is a measure of [[self-concept]]; the child who touches the rouge on his own nose upon looking into a mirror demonstrates the basic ability to understand self-awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/dev.420050403 | pmid=4679817 | volume=5 | issue=4 | title=Mirror self-image reactions before age two | year=1972 | journal=Dev Psychobiol | pages=297–305 | author=Amsterdam B}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FK3AwAAQBAJ&q=Butterworth%2C+1992&pg=PA94|title=Self-awareness in the first few weeks of life|access-date=November 4, 2017|isbn=9781136872006|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathon|date=2014-06-03}}</ref><ref>Social Psychology, 6th Edition p. 68-69</ref> Animals,<ref name="coren">{{cite book |title=How Dogs Think |author=Stanley Coren |isbn=978-0-7432-2232-7 |year=2004 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/howdogsthinkunde00core }}</ref> young children,<ref name="palmer">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ulm.edu/~palmer/ConsciousnessandtheSymbolicUniverse.htm|title=Consciousness and the Symbolic Universe|website=www.ulm.edu}}</ref> and people who have their sight restored after being blind from birth,<ref name="archer">{{cite book |last=Archer |first=John |year=1992 |title=Ethology and Human Development|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-389-20996-6}}</ref> sometimes react to their reflection in the mirror as though it were another individual.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Theorists have remarked on the significance of this period in a child's life. For example, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]] used a similar test in marking the [[mirror stage]] when growing up.<ref name="Lacan">Lacan, J., ''Some reflections on the Ego'' in ''Écrits'', org. published 1949.</ref> Current views of the [[self (psychology)|self in psychology]] position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].<ref name="Sedikides" />

=== Methodological flaws ===
{{Repetition section|date=February 2021}}
There is some debate as to the interpretation of the results of the mirror test,<ref name="coren"/> and researchers in one study have identified some potential problems with the test as a means of gauging self-awareness in young children and animals.<ref name="Asendorpf">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.32.2.313 |last1=Asendorpf |first1=J.B. |last2= Warkentin|first2=V. |last3=Baudonniere|first3=P. |title=Self-awareness and other-awareness II: Mirror self-recognition, social contingency awareness, and synchronic imitation |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=32 |pages=313–321 |year=1996 |issue=2|s2cid=21762291 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/962a0db8a8b018f9c2552b07e1fbd236939413b5}}</ref>

Proposing that a self-recognizing child or animal may not demonstrate mark-directed behavior because they are not motivated to clean up their faces, thus providing incorrect results, the study compared results of the standard rouge test methodology against a modified version of the test.<ref name=Asendorpf />

In the classic test, the experimenter first played with the children, making sure that they looked in the mirror at least three times. Then, the rouge test was performed using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the experimenter introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The experimenter would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown to increase the number of self-recognisers.<ref name="Asendorpf" />

The results uncovered by this study at least suggest some issues with the classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognize the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot did not lead to them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.<ref name="Asendorpf" />

On a more general level, it remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image implies self-awareness.<ref>Muth, Felicity. (Sept 2011). "Crows take a look in the mirror". Not Bad Science. Scientific American.</ref> Likewise, the converse may also be false—one may hold self-awareness, but not present a positive result in a mirror test.
