'''Hans Joachim Morgenthau''' (February 17, 1904 – July 19, 1980) was one of the major twentieth-century figures in the study of [[international relations]]. Morgenthau's works belong to the tradition of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] in [[international relations theory]], and he is usually considered among the most influential realists of the post-World War II period.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Specter|first=Matthew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtoszgEACAAJ|title=The Atlantic Realists: Empire and International Political Thought Between Germany and the United States|date=2022|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-1-5036-0312-7|language=en}}</ref> Morgenthau made landmark contributions to [[international relations theory]] and the study of [[international law]]. His ''[[Politics Among Nations]]'', first published in 1948, went through five editions during his lifetime and was widely adopted as a textbook in U.S. universities. While Morgenthau emphasized the centrality of power and "the national interest," the subtitle of ''Politics Among Nations'' -- "the struggle for power and peace" -- indicates his concern not only with the struggle for power but the ways in which it is limited by ethics, mores, and law.<ref>H. Morgenthau, ''Politics Among Nations'', 4th ed. (Knopf, 1967), chap.15.</ref>  

In addition to his books, Morgenthau wrote widely about international politics and U.S. [[foreign policy]] for general-circulation publications such as ''[[The New Leader]]'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', ''Worldview'', ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]''. He knew and corresponded with many of the leading intellectuals and writers of his era, such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]],<ref>Daniel Rice, ''Reinhold Niebuhr and His Circle of Influence'' (Cambridge Univ.

Johnson|Johnson]] administrations until he was dismissed by Johnson when he began to publicly criticize American policy in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name="Zambernardi 2011 1335–1356">{{cite journal |last=Zambernardi |first=L. |title=The Impotence of Power: Morgenthau's Critique of American Intervention in Vietnam |journal=Review of International Studies |volume=37 |year=2011 |issue=3 |pages=1335–1356 |doi=10.1017/S0260210510001531 |s2cid=145583770 }}</ref> For most of his career, however, Morgenthau was esteemed as an academic interpreter of U.S. foreign policy.<ref> See e.g. Hans Morgenthau, ''In Defense of the National Interest: A Critical Examination of American Foreign Policy'', with a new introduction by Kenneth W.

==Education, career, and personal life==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Coburg-1915.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Morgenthau's birthplace: [[Coburg]] in 1915.]] -->
Morgenthau was born in an [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] family in [[Coburg]], [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1904. After attending the [[Casimirianum Coburg|Casimirianum]], he continued his education at the universities of [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Munich]]. He received his doctorate in 1929 with a thesis entitled ''International Jurisdiction: Its Nature and Limits'', and pursued postdoctoral work at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. 

He taught and practiced law in Frankfurt before emigrating to the United States in 1937, after several interim years in Switzerland and [[Spain]]. One of his first jobs in the U.S. was teaching night school at [[Brooklyn College]].  From 1939 to 1943, Morgenthau taught in [[Kansas City]] and taught at Keneseth Israel Shalom Congregation there.<ref>Hartmut Behr and Felix Roesch, intro. to Hans Morgenthau, ''The Concept of the Political'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, p.13.</ref> Morgenthau then was a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] until 1973, when he took a professorial chair at the City University of New York (CUNY).

On moving to New York, Morgenthau separated from his wife, who remained in Chicago partly because of medical issues. He is reported to have tried to initiate plans to start a new relationship while in New York, with [[Ethel Person]] (d. 2012), a psychiatrist at Columbia University.<ref>G. O. Mazur, ed. ''One Hundred Year Commemoration to the Life of Hans Morgenthau''. New York: Semenenko, 2004.</ref>

On October 8, 1979, Morgenthau was one of the passengers on board [[Swissair Flight 316]], which crashed while trying to land at [[Ellinikon International Airport|Athens-Ellinikon International Airport]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_t0pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JNIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1090,3624823&dq=swissair+athens+crash+14+dead&hl=en Small amount of plutonium missing from crashed jet]</ref> The flight had been destined for Bombay and Peking.

Morgenthau died on July 19, 1980, shortly after being admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York with a perforated ulcer.<ref>"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7Z8rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V_wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5291,3735449&dq=hans+morgenthau+dies&hl=en Hans Morgenthau dies; noted political scientist]". ''The Telegraph'', July 21, 1980.</ref> He is buried in the Chabad section of Montefiore Cemetery,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/player_cdo/aid/3323949/jewish/Research-Results.htm | title=Research Results}}</ref> in proximity to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, with whom he had a respectful relationship.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.torah4blind.org/diamonds/index.htm | title="Diamonds of the Rebbe" by Mordechai Staiman}}</ref>

==European years and functional jurisprudence==
Morgenthau completed his doctoral dissertation in Germany in the late 1920s. It was published in 1929 as his first book, ''The International Administration of Justice, Its Essence and Its Limits''.<ref>Morgenthau, Hans. ''Die internationale Rechtspflege, ihr Wesen und ihre Grenzen,'' in the ''Frankfurter Abhandlungen zum Kriegsverhütungsrecht'' book series (Leipzig: Universitätsverlag Noske, 1929), still untranslated into English.</ref> The book was reviewed by [[Carl Schmitt]], who was then a jurist teaching at the University of Berlin. In an autobiographical essay written near the end of his life, Morgenthau related that, although he had looked forward to meeting Schmitt during a visit to Berlin, the meeting went badly and Morgenthau left thinking that he had been in the presence of (in his own words) "the demonic".<ref>"Fragment of an Intellectual Autobiography: 1904–1932," in Kenneth W. Thompson and Robert J. Myers, eds., Truth and Tragedy: A Tribute to Hans J. Morgenthau (New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1984).</ref> By the late 1920s Schmitt was becoming the leading jurist of the rising Nazi movement in Germany, and Morgenthau came to see their positions as irreconcilable. (The editors of Morgenthau's ''The Concept of the Political'' [see below] state that "the reader of [Morgenthau's] ''The Concept of the Political'' ... will easily recognize that Morgenthau deplored Schmitt's understanding of the political on moral grounds and conceptual grounds.")<ref>Behr and Roesch, Intro. to Hans Morgenthau,  ''The Concept of the Political'', trans M. Vidal, p. 19. For a different view of the relation between Morgenthau's ideas and Schmitt's, see, e.g., W. Scheuerman, "Carl Schmitt and Hans Morgenthau: Realism and Beyond" (see note 3).</ref>

Following the completion of his doctoral dissertation, Morgenthau left Germany to complete his Habilitation dissertation (license to teach at universities) in Geneva. It was published in French as ''La Réalité des normes en particulier des normes du droit international: Fondements d'une théorie des normes'' (The Reality of Norms and in Particular the Norms of International Law: Foundations of a Theory of Norms). It has not been translated into English.<ref>Morgenthau, Hans. ''La Réalité des normes en particulier des normes du droit international: Fondements d'une théorie des normes'' (Paris: Alcan, 1934).</ref> The legal scholar [[Hans Kelsen]], who had just arrived in Geneva as a professor, was an adviser to Morgenthau's dissertation. Kelsen was among the strongest critics of [[Carl Schmitt]]. Kelsen and Morgenthau became lifelong colleagues even after both emigrated from Europe to take their respective academic positions in the United States.

In 1933, Morgenthau published a second book in French, ''La notion du "politique"'', which was translated into English and published in 2012 as ''The Concept of the Political''.<ref>Morgenthau, Hans (2012). ''The Concept of the Political'', Palgrave Macmillan.</ref> In this book Morgenthau seeks to articulate the difference between legal disputes between nations and political disputes between nations or other litigants. The questions driving the inquiry are: (i) Who holds legal power over the objects or concerns being disputed? (ii) In what manner can the holder of this legal power be changed or held accountable? (iii) How can a dispute, the object of which concerns a legal power, be resolved? and (iv) In what manner will the holder of the legal power be protected in the course of exercising that power? For Morgenthau, the end goal of any legal system in this context is to "ensure justice and peace."

In his work in the 1920s and 1930s, Morgenthau sought a "functional jurisprudence," an alternative to mainstream international law. He borrowed ideas from [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref>Schuett, Robert. "Freudian Roots of Political Realism: The Importance of Sigmund Freud to Hans J. Morgenthau's Theory of International Power Politics." History of the Human Sciences 20, no. 4 (2007): 53–78.</ref> [[Max Weber]], [[Roscoe Pound]], and others. In 1940 Morgenthau set out a research program for legal functionalism in the article "Positivism, Functionalism, and International Law".<ref>Morgenthau, Hans J., "Positivism, Functionalism, and International Law," ''American Journal of International Law'', vol 34, 2 (1940): 260–284</ref>
 
[[Francis Boyle]] has written that Morgenthau's post-war writings perhaps contributed to a "break between international political science and international legal studies."<ref>Francis Boyle, ''World Politics and International Law,'' p. 12</ref> However, ''Politics Among Nations'' contains a  chapter on international law, and Morgenthau remained an active contributor to the subject of the relationship between international politics and international law until the end of his career.<ref>Morgenthau, Hans (1974). "International Law and International Politics: An Easy Partnership," Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the American Society of International Law (1974), pp. 331–334.</ref>

==American years and political realism==
Hans Morgenthau is considered one of the "founding fathers" of the [[realism in international relations|realist school]] in the 20th century. This school of thought holds that nation-states are the main actors in international relations and that the main concern of the field is the study of [[Power in international relations|power]]. Morgenthau emphasized the importance of "the national interest," and in ''Politics Among Nations'' he wrote that "the main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the landscape of international politics is the concept of interest defined in terms of power." Morgenthau is sometimes referred to as a [[Classical realism in international relations theory|classical realist]] or modern realist in order to differentiate his approach from the [[Neorealism (international relations)|structural realism or neo-realism]] associated with [[Kenneth Waltz]].<ref>Cf. Jack Donnelly, ''Realism and International Relations'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000), pp. 11–12, though he prefers the label "biological realist" to "classical realist". For an argument that the differences between classical and structural realists have been exaggerated, see {{cite journal |first1=Joseph M. |last1=Parent |first2=Joshua M. |last2=Baron |title=Elder Abuse: How the Moderns Mistreat Classical Realism |journal=International Studies Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |year=2011 |pages=192–213 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01021.x }}</ref> Recent scholarly assessments of Morgenthau show that his intellectual trajectory was more complicated than originally thought.<ref>William E. Scheuerman, ''Hans Morgenthau: Realism and Beyond'' (Polity Press, 2009); Michael C. Williams, ed., ''Reconsidering Realism: The Legacy of Hans J. Morgenthau'' (Oxford Univ. Press, 2007); Christoph Frei, ''Hans J. Morgenthau: An Intellectual Biography'' (LSU Press, 2001).</ref> His realism was infused with moral considerations -- though not always acknowledged as such -- and during the last part of his life he favored supranational control of nuclear weapons and strongly opposed the U.S. role in the Vietnam War (see below).<ref>E.g.: Hans J. Morgenthau, "We Are Deluding Ourselves in Viet-Nam", ''New York Times Magazine,'' April 18, 1965, reprinted in ''The Viet-Nam Reader'', ed. M. Raskin and B. Fall (Vintage Books, 1967), pp. 37–45.</ref> 

===Realism and ''Politics Among Nations'' (1948)===
Morgenthau's ''[[Scientific Man versus Power Politics]]'' (1946) argued against an overreliance on science and technology as solutions to political and social problems.  The book presented a "pessimistic view of human nature"<ref>Michael J. Smith, ''Realist Thought from Weber to Kissinger'' (LSU Press, 1986), p.137.</ref> centered on a universal lust for power and the inevitability of selfishness.<ref>Ibid., p.136.</ref>

Starting with the second edition of ''Politics Among Nations'', Morgenthau included a section in the opening chapter called "Six Principles of Political Realism".<ref name="PAN-4-15">Hans J. Morgenthau, [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm ''Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace''], Fifth Edition, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978, pp. 4–15.</ref>

The principles, paraphrased, are:
# Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature.<ref>Russell, Greg. ''Hans J. Morgenthau and the Ethics of American Statecraft''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1990.</ref><ref>Morgenthau, Hans (1974). "Macht und Ohnmacht des Menschen in technischen Zeitalter," in Oskar Schatz, Hrsg., ''Was wird aus dem Menschen? Analysen und Warnungen bedeutender Denker'' (Graz: Verlag Styria, 1974) [in HJMP, Container No. 175].</ref>
# The main signpost of political realism is the concept of interest defined in terms of [[Power in international relations|power]], which infuses rational order into the subject matter of politics, and thus makes the theoretical understanding of politics possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rösch|first=Felix|date=2014|title=Pouvoir, puissance, and politics: Hans Morgenthau's dualistic concept of power?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/pouvoir-puissance-and-politics-hans-morgenthaus-dualistic-concept-of-power/A25D6E8C797CD2EBB312F9A3EC490AF0|journal=Review of International Studies|volume=40|issue=2|pages=349–365|doi=10.1017/S0260210513000065|s2cid=143514064|issn=0260-2105}}</ref> Political realism avoids concerns with the [[Motivation|motives]] and [[ideology]] of [[politician|statesmen]]. Political realism avoids reinterpreting reality to fit the policy. A good foreign policy minimizes risks and maximizes benefits.
# Realism recognizes that the determining kind of interest varies depending on the political and cultural context in which foreign policy is made. It does not give "interest defined as power" a meaning that is fixed once and for all.
# Political realism is aware of the moral significance of political action. It is also aware of the tension between the moral command and the requirements of successful political action. Realism maintains that universal moral principles must be filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and place, because they cannot be applied to the actions of states in their abstract universal formulation.<ref>Cozette, Murielle. "Reclaiming the Critical Dimension of Realism: Hans J. Morgenthau on the Ethics of Scholarship." Review of International Studies 34 (2008): 5–27.</ref>
# Political realism refuses to identify the moral aspirations of a particular nation with the moral laws that govern the universe.<ref>Murray, A. J. H. "The Moral Politics of Hans Morgenthau." The Review of Politics 58, no. 1 (1996): 81–107.</ref>
# The political realist maintains the autonomy of the political sphere; the statesman asks "How does this policy affect the power and interests of the nation?" Political realism is based on a pluralistic conception of human nature. The political realist must show where the nation's interests differ from the [[Morality|moralistic]] and [[Liberal legalism|legalistic]] viewpoints.

Morgenthau argued in ''Politics Among Nations'' that skillful diplomacy drawing on these principles could lead to stability via the balance of power.  He wrote that "the balance of power and policies aiming at its preservation are not only inevitable, but an essential stabilizing factor in a society of sovereign nations."<ref>H. Morgenthau, ''Politics Among Nations,'' as quoted in Smith, ''Realist Thought from Weber to Kissinger,'' p.144.</ref> (For further discussion, see section on Criticism, below.)
 
In practice, however, countries "actively engaged in the struggle for power must actually aim not at a balance -- that is, equality -- of power, but at superiority of power in their own behalf," Morgenthau wrote.<ref>H. Morgenthau, ''Politics Among Nations,'' 4th ed. (Knopf, 1967), p.202.</ref>  The reason is partly that the relative strength of countries can be difficult to calculate, since key elements of national power, such as "the quality of government," are elusive and frequently change.<ref>Ibid., p.198.</ref>  Because "no nation can foresee how large its miscalculations will turn out to be, all nations must ultimately seek the maximum of power obtainable under the circumstances.  Only thus can they hope to attain the maximum margin of safety commensurate with the maximum of errors they might commit."<ref>Ibid., p.202.</ref>

===Center for the Study of American Foreign and Military Policy===
In the 1950s, Morgenthau directed the [[University of Chicago]]’s Center for the Study of American Foreign and Military Policy. Among other things, he sought to rebuild the American government’s resources on [[Sinology|“China Studies,”]] after many experts on [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Sino-American relations]] had been publicly discredited during the [[Red Scare#Second Red Scare (1947–57)|Second Red Scare]]. Morgenthau approached Chinese immigrant and political scientist [[Tsou Tang]] to explore the Sino-American relationship using both American and Chinese materials. Morgenthau trusted Tsou, having served on Tsou’s committees for his master’s and PhD theses. Tsou’s 1963 book, ''America’s Failure in China, 1941-50'', drew upon his research at the Center.<ref name="heqliu">{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Qing |title=To Be an Apolitical Political Scientist: A Chinese Immigrant Scholar and (Geo)politicized American Higher Education |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2020 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=129–130, 143-147 |doi=10.1017/heq.2020.10|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Dissent on the Vietnam War===
[[File:JFKBerlinSpeech.jpg|thumb|Morgenthau was a consultant for the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] from 1961 to 1963]]

Morgenthau was a strong supporter of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.<ref>Scheuerman, William E. "Realism and the Left: The Case of Hans J. Morgenthau." Review of International Studies 34 (2008): 29–51.</ref> When the Eisenhower administration gained the White House, Morgenthau turned his efforts towards a large amount of writing for journals and the press in general. By the time of Kennedy's inauguration in 1961, he had become a consultant to the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]].  After Johnson became President, Morgenthau became much more vocal in his dissent concerning American participation in the Vietnam War,<ref>Morgenthau, Hans (1973). "The Lessons of Vietnam," in John H. Gilbert, ed., ''The New Era in American Foreign Policy'' (New York: St Martin's Press, 1973); Morgenthau, Hans (1975). "The Intellectual, Political, and Moral Roots of U. S. Failure in Vietnam," in William D. Coplin and Charles W. Kegley, Jr., eds., ''Analyzing International Relations: A Multimethod Introduction'' (New York: Praeger, 1975); Morgenthau, Hans (1975). "The Real Issue for the U.S. in Cambodia," The New Leader, vol. 58, issue 6 (March 17, 1975), pp. 4–6.</ref> for which he was dismissed as a consultant to the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson administration]] in 1965.<ref name="Zambernardi 2011 1335–1356"/> Morgenthau sparred with Johnson's advisors [[McGeorge Bundy]]<ref>Gordon Goldstein, ''Lessons in Disaster: McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam'', 2009; Kai Bird, ''The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms'', Simon and Schuster, 2000.</ref> and [[Walt Rostow]].<ref>David Milne, ''America's Rasputin: Walt Rostow and the Vietnam War'', Hill and Wang, 2008, p.153.</ref>  Morgenthau's dissent concerning American involvement in Vietnam, which he viewed mainly as a civil war whose "global significance" was "remote,"<ref>H. Morgenthau, ''Truth and Power: Essays of a Decade, 1960-70,'' p.408.</ref> brought him considerable public and media attention.

On 21 June 1965, Morgenthau debated Bundy live on television under the title ''Vietnam Dialogue: Mr. Bundy and the Professors'' with [[Eric Sevareid]] as the moderator.<ref>A.J. Langguth ''Our Vietnam'', Simon and Schuster, 2000,  p.368.</ref> During the debate, Bundy accused Morgenthau of being a defeatist and pessimist, citing his 1961 statement that the Pathet Lao were destined to win the Lao civil war, leading Morgenthau to reply: "I may have been dead wrong on Laos, but it doesn't mean I am dead wrong on Vietnam."<ref>Ibid.</ref>  Bundy then brought up a statement Morgenthau made in 1956, praising President Diem of South Vietnam for creating a "miracle."<ref>Ibid.</ref> The American journalist A.J. Langguth wrote that Bundy's point was irrelevant as Diem had been assassinated in 1963, but Bundy made it sound as if Morgenthau was opportunistic and inconsistent.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Bundy was generally regarded as having won the debate by viewers at the time.<ref>Ibid.</ref>  

In these years Morgenthau continued to write prolifically, publishing a three-volume collection of his essays in 1962.<ref>Hans Morgenthau, ''Politics in the Twentieth Century'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), vol. 1 ''The Decline of Democratic Politics'', vol. 2 ''The Impasse of American Foreign Policy'', vol. 3 ''The Restoration of American Politics''.</ref>

===American years after 1965===
[[File:McGeorge Bundy.jpg|thumb|left|Morgenthau's dissent against Vietnam policy caused the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson administration]] to dismiss him as an advisor and to assign [[McGeorge Bundy]] to publicly oppose him in 1965]]

Starting in 1960, Morgenthau became increasingly concerned with the revolutionary implications of nuclear weapons and the possibility of nuclear war, which he maintained would be a moral calamity of an unprecedented kind.<ref>See W. E. Scheuerman, ''Hans Morgenthau: Realism and Beyond'', pp. 142ff.</ref> He remarked in the journal <i>Christianity and Crisis</i> that "no such radical qualitative transformation of the structure of international relations has ever occurred in history."<ref>Quoted in Scheuerman, ''Hans Morgenthau'', p. 143.</ref> While in the 1950s and earlier, Morgenthau had tended to emphasize, in William Scheuerman's words, "the continuities of human history," his recognition of the radical novelty of nuclear weapons led, from the early 1960s onward, to a stress on discontinuity, as represented by the possibility of a civilization-ending nuclear conflict.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Morgenthau's views on this issue were influenced by [[Karl Jaspers]]' ''The Future of Mankind,'' which he reviewed in 1961 for ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]''.<ref>Ibid., p. 146.</ref>   

After 1965, Morgenthau became a leading voice in the discussion of [[just war theory]] in the modern nuclear era.<ref>E.g., Hans Morgenthau, "Vietnam and Cambodia" (exchange with Noam Chomsky and Michael Walzer) ''Dissent'', vol. 25 (Fall 1978), pp. 386–391.</ref> Just war theory was further developed in the work of [[Paul Ramsey (ethicist)|Paul Ramsey]], [[Michael Walzer]], and other scholars.

Morgenthau's book ''Truth and Power,'' published in 1970, collected his essays from the previous turbulent decade dealing with both foreign policy, including Vietnam, and U.S. domestic politics, e.g. the civil rights movement.  Morgenthau dedicated the book to [[Hans Kelsen]], "who has taught us through his example how to speak Truth to Power." Morgenthau's last major book, ''Science: Servant or Master,'' was dedicated to his colleague [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and published in 1972.<ref>Hans Morgenthau, ''Science: Servant or Master?'' (New York: New American Library, 1972).</ref>

In summer 1978, Morgenthau wrote his last co-authored essay titled "The Roots of Narcissism," with Ethel Person of Columbia University.<ref>Hans Morgenthau and Ethel Person (1978). "The Roots of Narcissism," ''The Partisan Review'', pp 337–347, Summer 1978.</ref> This essay was a continuation of Morgenthau's earlier study of this subject in his 1962 essay "Public Affairs: Love and Power," where Morgenthau engaged some of the themes that Niebuhr and the theologian [[Paul Tillich]] were addressing.<ref>Morgenthau, Hans (1962). "Public Affairs: Love and Power," Commentary 33:3 (March 1962): 248.</ref> Morgenthau admired Tillich's book ''Love, Power and Justice,'' and he wrote a second essay related to the book's themes.<ref>Morgenthau, Hans (1974). "Justice and Power," Social Research, vol. 41, no. 1 (Spring 1974), pp. 163–175.</ref> More recently, Anthony Lang has recovered and published Morgenthau's extensive course notes on Aristotle (for a course Morgenthau taught while at the New School for Social Research during his New York years).<ref>Lang, Anthony F., Jr., ed. Political Theory and International Affairs: Hans J. Morgenthau on Aristotle's The Politics. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2004.</ref> The comparison of Morgenthau to Aristotle has been further explored by Molloy.<ref>Molloy, Sean. "Aristotle, Epicurus, Morgenthau and the Political Ethics of the Lesser Evil." Journal of International Political Theory 5 (2009): 94–112.</ref>

Morgenthau was a tireless reviewer of books during the several decades of his career as a scholar in the United States. He wrote nearly a hundred book reviews, including almost three dozen for ''The New York Review of Books'' alone. Morgenthau's last two book reviews were not written for ''The New York Review of Books'' and were of the books ''Soviet Perspectives on International Relations, 1956–1967'', by William Zimmerman<ref>Morgenthau, Hans (1971).

==Criticism==
The reception of Morgenthau's work can be divided into three phases. The first phase occurred during Morgenthau's life up to his death in 1980. The second phase was between 1980 and the one hundred year commemoration of his birth that took place in 2004. The third phase of the reception of his writings is between the centenary commemoration and the present, which shows a vibrant discussion of his continuing influence.

===Criticism during European years===
In Morgenthau's early career, the book review of his dissertation by [[Carl Schmitt]] had a lasting and negative effect on Morgenthau. Schmitt had become a leading juristic voice for the rising Nazi movement in Germany, and Morgenthau came to see their positions as incommensurable, although it has been argued that Schmitt and Morgenthau engaged in a "hidden dialogue" in which they influenced each other.<ref>See W. Scheuerman, "Carl Schmitt and Hans Morgenthau: Realism and Beyond" (see note 3). See also Hans-Karl Pichler, "The Godfathers of 'Truth': Max Weber and Carl Schmitt in Morgenthau's Theory of Power Politics," ''Review of International Studies'', 1998, v.24, pp.185-200.  </ref> Morgenthau subsequently met [[Hans Kelsen]] at Geneva while a student, and Kelsen's treatment of Morgenthau's writings left a lifelong positive impression upon the young Morgenthau. Kelsen in the 1920s had emerged as Schmitt's most thorough critic and had earned a reputation as a leading international critic of the then rising National Socialist movement in Germany, which matched Morgenthau's own negative opinion of Nazism.

===Criticism during American years===
While Morgenthau's ''Politics Among Nations'' had a large influence on a generation of scholars in global politics and international law, Morgenthau's views did not go unchallenged.  On the one hand, some critics rejected the basic premises of Morgenthau's realist perspective. On the other hand, some theorists working within a realist framework, such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, took issue with aspects of Morgenthau's approach even while sharing some of his basic assumptions.

In his ''Theory of International Politics'' (1979), [[Kenneth Waltz]] urged more attention to purely "structural" elements of the international system, especially the distribution of capabilities among states.<ref>Kenneth Waltz, ''Theory of International Politics'', McGraw-Hill, 1979.</ref> Waltz's neorealism was more self-consciously scientific than Morgenthau's version of realism.<ref>Hartmut Behr and Amelia Heath. "Misreading in IR Theory and Ideology Critique: Morgenthau, Waltz and Neo-Realism," ''Review of International Studies'' 35 (2009): 327–49.</ref> Waltz argued that balances of power recurrently form whether or not states intend that result.<ref>Waltz, ''Theory of International Politics'', p.119.</ref> Waltz criticized Morgenthau for seeing the maintenance of a balance of power as dependent on states' motives and conscious aims, leading to what Waltz called a "distortion" of balance-of-power theory.<ref>Ibid., pp.119-120.</ref>    

In contrast to Waltz's "defensive" realism, [[John Mearsheimer]] presented a theory of "offensive realism" in ''The Tragedy of Great Power Politics'' (2001).  Mearsheimer agreed with Morgenthau that states seek to maximize their relative power but disagreed about the cause: whereas Morgenthau posited, in Mearsheimer's words, "a will to power inherent in every state," Mearsheimer argued that the "anarchical" character of the international system pushes states to acquire as much power as possible to maximize their chances of survival.<ref>John J. Mearsheimer, ''The Tragedy of Great Power Politics'' (W.W. Norton, 2001), pp.17-22.</ref>       

Another area of criticism concerned Morgenthau's treatment of the concept of the national interest.  One scholar has suggested that Morgenthau erred in thinking that "the 'rational core of the national interest' can be ascertained by objective analysis."<ref>Michael J. Smith, ''Realist Thought from Weber to Kissinger'' (1986), p.154.</ref> On this account, "the concept of the national interest simply cannot bear the weight Morgenthau assigned to it."<ref>Ibid., p.160.</ref>

Morgenthau's concept of politics itself has been seen, at least by some writers, as a firmer basis for his position.  While Morgenthau viewed politics as a struggle for power, he also viewed it as a struggle conducted by specific means and within certain limits. From this perspective, Morgenthau's distinction between political power and military power represented an effort "to insulate" the properly political realm "from the intrusion of physical violence and domination."<ref>Michael C. Williams, "Why Ideas Matter in International Relations: Hans Morgenthau, Classical Realism, and the Moral Construction of Power Politics," ''International Organization'' vol. 58 no. 4 (2004), p.649.</ref>                     

The conceptual distinction between political and military power may not always have influenced Morgenthau's views on specific policy issues, but it probably did so in the case of nuclear weapons.  His concern with nuclear weapons and the arms race <ref>Hans Morgenthau, "Some Political Aspects of Disarmament," in David Carlton and Carlo Schaerf, eds., ''The Dynamics of the Arms Race'' (London: Croom Helm, 1975).</ref> led to discussions and debates with [[Henry Kissinger]] and others.<ref>Hans Morgenthau, "Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State," ''Encounter'', vol. 43, no. 6 (November 1974), pp. 57–61.</ref> Morgenthau saw many aspects of the nuclear arms race as a form of irrationality requiring the attention of responsible diplomats, statesmen, and scholars.<ref>Hans Morgenthau, "Superpower Politics," ''The New Leader'', vol. 55, issue 13 (June 26, 1972), pp. 11–12; Joel Rosenthal, ''Righteous Realists'' (1991).</ref> However, Morgenthau's view that a world state would be required to solve the problem of nuclear weapons is in tension with the skepticism about global governance that his realist perspective implies.

===Criticism of Morgenthau's legacy===
[[File:Stolperstein Joachim Morgenthau by 2eight 3SC1356.jpg|thumb|[[Stolperstein]] for Hans Morgenthau at the [[Casimirianum Coburg]].]]
Christoph Frei's intellectual biography of Morgenthau, published in English translation in 2001 (from the earlier German edition)<ref>Christoph Frei, ''Hans J. Morgenthau: An Intellectual Biography''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2001.</ref> was one of the first of many substantial publications about Morgenthau in the 2000s. Christoph Rohde published a biography of Morgenthau in 2004, still available only in German.<ref>Hans J. Morgenthau und der weltpolitische Realismus: Die Grundlegung einer realistischen Theorie. P. Weidmann und Christoph Rohde von VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften (2004).</ref> Also around 2004, commemorative volumes were published on the occasion of the centenary of Morgenthau's birth.<ref>Christian Hacke, Gottfried-Karl Kindermann, and Kai M. Schellhorn, eds. ''The Heritage, Challenge, and Future of Realism: In Memoriam Hans J. Morgenthau (1904–1980)''. Göttingen, Germany: V&R unipress, 2005; G.O. Mazur, ed. ''One Hundred Year Commemoration to the Life of Hans Morgenthau''. New York: Semenenko Foundation, 2004.</ref>

[[John Mearsheimer]] of the University of Chicago has contrasted Morgenthau's political realism to the neo-conservativism prevailing during the G.W. Bush Administration in the context of the 2003 Iraq war.<ref>John J. Mearsheimer, "Hans Morgenthau and the Iraq War: Realism Versus Neo-Conservatism." openDemocracy.net (2005).</ref>  Morgenthau saw the ethical and moral component of international politics as an integral part of the reasoning process of the international statesman and the essential content of responsible scholarship in international relations.<ref>Lorenzo Zambernardi,  ''I limiti della potenza. Etica e politica nella teoria internazionale di Hans J. Morgenthau''. Bologna: Il Mulino, 2010.</ref> Various aspects of Morgenthau's thought, as well as his place in relation to twentieth-century intellectual currents and the disciplinary history of political science and international relations, continue to be explored by scholars (see Further Reading section, below).
