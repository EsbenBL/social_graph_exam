{{Anthropology}}
'''George Emanuel Marcus''' is an [[American people|American]] professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]] who focuses on the anthropology of [[elites]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web|title=Department of Anthropology: George Marcus|url=http://www.anthropology.uci.edu/anthr_bios/gmarcus|publisher=UC Irvine School of Social Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

==Education and life==
Marcus received a B.A. from [[Yale University]] in 1968 and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1976.<ref name=rice/> He spent the 1982–83 academic year at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Institute for Advanced Study]], where he came up with the idea for ''Anthropology as Cultural Critique'', which he co-wrote with [[Michael M.&nbsp;J. Fischer]] and published in 1986 (a second edition was later published in 1999).<ref name=xii>{{cite book|title=Anthropology as Cultural Critique: An Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences|date=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0226504506|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oStfoHG0ovIC|author=George Marcus|edition=2|author2=Michael M.&nbsp;J. Fisher|author2-link=Michael M.&nbsp;J. Fisher}}</ref>

Afterwards, he served as the [[Joe Jamail|Joseph D. Jamail]] Professor at [[Rice University]], where he chaired the anthropology department for 25 years. He currently holds the position of Chancellor's Professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he established a Center for [[Ethnography]], devoted to experiments and innovations in this form of inquiry.

He is married to the historian [[Patricia Seed]], a historian who specializes in [[History of cartography|cartography]] and also teaches as a professor at UC Irvine.<ref name=seed>{{cite web|title=Faculty Profile System: Patricia Seed|url=http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5308|publisher=University of California, Irvine|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> They have two children.

==Academic research==
Marcus has studied "elites"&mdash;people with a great amount of [[social power]]. He has researched and written about [[nobility]] in [[Tonga]], an [[upper-class]] group with family fortunes in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Texas]], and a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] nobleman. In two books, ''Writing Culture'' and ''Anthropology as Cultural Critique'', he argues that anthropologists typically frame their thoughts according to their own social, political, and literary history, and are inclined to study people with less power and status than themselves.

Marcus pushed [[anthropology]] to pay greater attention to the modern world’s influence on communities once regarded as isolated. He advocated new research methods to reflect this contemporary focus, including how a community changes and [[diaspora|disperses]] around the world. In the 1980s, most anthropologists studied people who had lived in the same location for hundreds of years, with a narrow focus on longstanding local traditions. Today, an anthropologist interested in the people of [[Samoa]], for example, would likely not only study life in the [[Samoan Islands]], but also Samoan communities in [[New Zealand]], [[Hawaii]], and [[California]].

Marcus’s current research focuses on institutions of great power, and their connections and consequences for ordinary people. Working with anthropologist [[Douglas R. Holmes]], he applies an anthropological research approach to people’s thought- and decision-making processes in the operation of [[central bank]]s in the [[The Fed|United States]] and [[European Central Bank|Europe]].

==Publications==
He founded ''[[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]]'', the [[Society for Cultural Anthropology]]'s academic journal of repute, and was the [[editor]] of the [[University of Chicago Press]]'s ''Late Editions: Cultural Studies for the End of the Century'', an eight-volume series of annuals published in the 1990s that documented "unsettling dilemmas and unprecedented challenges facing cultural studies on the brink of the twenty-first century".<ref name=perilous>{{cite web|title=Perilous States: Conversations on Culture, Politics, and Nation|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo3697037.html|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> The series covered a range of subjects, including the [[Internet]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[documentaries]], [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[environmental politics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[cryonics]].<ref name=books>{{cite web|title=Late Editions: Cultural Studies for the End of the Century|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/LE.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
