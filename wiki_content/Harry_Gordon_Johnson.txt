'''Harry Gordon Johnson''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (26 May 1923 – 9 May 1977) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[economist]] who studied topics such as [[international trade]] and [[international finance]].

[[Nobel laureate]] [[James Tobin]] said about him: "For the economics profession throughout the world, the third quarter of this century was an Age of Johnson. ... It was his impact on his own profession ... that justifies calling the era his Age."<ref name="Moggridge2012-413-415">{{citation|last=Moggridge|first=D.

Appointed professor of economics at Manchester University in 1956, he left upon being appointed Professor of Economics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1959 (and from 1969, the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor) until his death in 1977.  He was also Professor of Economics at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1966 until 1974. And he briefly was professor at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva until his death. He was twice Editor of the [[Journal of Political Economy]].<ref name="Shils1991">{{citation|last=Shils|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Shils|editor=Edward Shils|title=Remembering the University of Chicago: Teachers, Scientists, and Scholars|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_LH7zTcu2cC&pg=PA202|access-date=17 August 2013|date=1 December 1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-75335-5|page=202|chapter=Harry G.

In 1976 the Canadian government named him an officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and in 1977 he was named a distinguished fellow of the [[American Economic Association]].

The [[Canadian Economics Association]] awards an annual Harry G. Johnson Prize for the best paper published in the [[Canadian Journal of Economics]].

==Early life and education==
He was born on 26 May 1923 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, the elder son of two children of Henry Herbert Johnson, newspaperman and later secretary of the [[Liberal Party of Ontario]], and his wife, Frances Lily Muat, lecturer in child psychology at the Institute of Child Study of the [[University of Toronto]].

Johnson was educated at the University of Toronto schools and then obtained scholarships to the University of Toronto, where he studied law and economics. According to W. Max Corden in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Biography'', it was at this time that he "developed an interest in the history of thought and was much influenced by [[Harold Innis]]'s lectures and ideas on Canadian and generalized economic history."<ref name=dnb>Corden, W. Max, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31290?rskey=ydHKSy&result=1 "Johnson, Harry Gordon (1923–1977)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, 23 September 2004. Retrieved 8 April 2018 {{subscription}}</ref> He graduated in 1943 and subsequently became, for one year, acting professor and sole member of the economics staff at [[St Francis Xavier University]], in [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia]]. "In 1944", explains Corden, "Johnson volunteered for active service in the [[Canadian armed forces]] and, after training, was sent to [[England]] in 1945, eventually doing clerical work in [[Canada House]]."<ref name=dnb/> This was then followed by further study at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where he obtained a first-class [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in economics under the tutelage of the Marxist economist [[Maurice Dobb]]; a return to the [[University of Toronto]], where he earned his [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree; and then finally doctoral research at [[Harvard University]], where he completed the course work requirements in three terms.<ref name=dnb/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/who/mcorden/one-and-only-Harry.pdf |title=Harry Gordon Johnson (1923–1977) |access-date=2012-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318194510/http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/who/mcorden/one-and-only-Harry.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Who's Who | surname = JOHNSON | othernames = Prof. Harry Gordon | id = U156164 | type = was | volume = 2018 | edition = online}} {{subscription required}}</ref> It was while at Harvard that he became a follower of the ideas of [[Joseph Schumpeter]].

In 1948 he married Elizabeth Scott, daughter of Harold Victor Serson, civil engineer. She later became one of the editors of the collected writings of Keynes. They had one son and one daughter.

Harry, as Johnson was universally known, was an inveterate conference-goer. In addition he visited innumerable universities, especially in [[Canada]] and in [[Asia]]. He "circled the globe like a planet" (Scott 80). This travelling style began in the fifties when he was teaching refresher courses for economists in [[Karachi]] and [[Singapore]]. His travelling and ubiquitousness became legendary.

Physically, he was a large man, overweight or at least stout, with piercing dark brown eyes. But he was far from sluggish, and gave an impression of intense and disciplined intellectual and physical energy. He was often loudly and informally dressed. His energy was kept under control by his continuous [[Wood Carving|carving]] of wooden statuettes, of which he made thousands in many different artistic styles. He carved at seminars and in his room, throughout the most concentrated discussions of intricate economic problems.

Economist [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], writing about Johnson's productivity and accessibility, said, "Countless numbers of manuscripts would reach him, from aspiring students of international economics and somehow Harry found the energy and time to read them carefully and write back to the authors promptly. ... once ... when he was staying with us, my wife asked him what he had been doing in the early hours of the morning when we had been still asleep. 'I read two manuscripts, one indifferent and the other bad; what is worse, I could have written one good paper in that time.' "<ref name="Moggridge2012-413-415"/>

He was a strong drinker and his reputation at [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] was that he travelled weekly between [[London]] and [[Chicago]], and he would enter each flight with a bottle of [[Southern Comfort]] and would leave it with a fully written paper! According to Moggeridge he was often deeply intoxicated whilst attending seminars and workshops. Despite his prolific writing, he was criticized for essentially rewriting the same articles over and over. [[George Stigler]] was asked about Johnson's 500 published papers versus his 100. Stigler replied, "Yes, but mine were all different."

The enormous admiration and affection for Johnson was reflected in the numerous obituaries by members of the economics profession that appeared in 1977. "For the economics profession throughout the world, the third quarter of this century was an Age of Johnson" (Tobin 443). "He bestrode our discipline like a [[Colossus of Rhodes|Colossus]]", "He was an institution" (ibid.). "Canada lost one of its greatest sons". He was "larger than life’ (the most common remark). "The one and only Harry" ([[The Economist]], 14 May 1977, 121). Harry Johnson died of a [[stroke]] in [[Geneva]] on 9 May 1977; he was survived by his wife.

==Legacy==
Johnson made many contributions to the development of [[Hecksher-Ohlin]] theory and until the 1970s according to Moggeridge, was the second most quoted trade theorist after [[Paul Samuelson]]. Johnson also helped to found the monetary approach to the [[balance of payments]] and wrote many high quality surveys of [[monetary economics]] that helped to clarify the issues in question. Despite being perhaps the most prolific economist of the modern era, Johnson's star has waned as is evidenced by the significant fall (discussed in Moggeridge's biography) in citations to his work in the past decade.

The [[Canadian Economics Association]] presents a [[Harry Johnson Prize]] every year for the best article to appear in the [[Canadian Journal of Economics]] in the preceding year.
