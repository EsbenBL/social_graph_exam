'''Dirigisme''' or '''dirigism''' ({{ety|fr|diriger|to direct}}) is an economic doctrine in which the state plays a strong directive role as opposed to a merely [[Regulation|regulatory]] or non-interventionist role over a [[capitalist]] [[market economy]].<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/dirigisme ''Dirigisme''] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 25 May 2013.</ref> As an economic doctrine, dirigisme is the opposite to [[laissez-faire]], stressing a positive role for state intervention in curbing productive inefficiencies and [[market failure]]s. Dirigiste policies often include [[indicative planning]], state-directed investment, and the use of market instruments (taxes and subsidies) to incentivize market entities to fulfill state economic objectives.

The term emerged in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] era to describe the economic policies of [[France]] which included substantial state-directed investment, the use of indicative [[economic planning]] to supplement the [[market mechanism]] and the establishment of [[state enterprise]]s in strategic domestic sectors. It coincided with both the period of substantial [[economic]] and [[demographic]] growth known as the [[Trente Glorieuses]] which followed the war, and the slowdown beginning with the [[1973 oil crisis]]. 

The term has subsequently been used to classify other economies that pursued similar policies, most notably the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian tiger economies]], [[India]] during current period<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> and more recently the [[Economy of China|economy]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref name="Models of dirigisme in East Asia: perspectives from Eastern Europe, 1996">{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-349-14155-5_13 |chapter=Models of Dirigisme in East Asia: Perspectives for Eastern Europe |title=The Aftermath of 'Real Existing Socialism' in Eastern Europe |year=1996 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Johannes Dragsbaek |pages=196–216 |isbn=978-1-349-14157-9 }}</ref> [[State capitalism]] is a related concept.

Most modern economies can be characterized as dirigist to some degree as the state may exercise directive action by performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies through government procurement (especially [[military]]) or through state-run research institutes.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mazzucato |first1=Mariana |title=The myth of the 'meddling' state |url=https://www.publicfinancefocus.org/news/2013/06/myth-meddling-state |work=Public Finance Focus |date=25 June 2013 }}</ref>

== In France ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Before the [[Second World War]], France had a relatively fragmented [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system. The many small companies, often family-owned, were often not dynamic and efficient{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} in comparison to the large industrial groups in [[Germany]] or the [[United States]]. The Second World War laid waste to France. Railroads and industries were destroyed by aerial [[bombardment]] and [[sabotage]]; industries were seized by Nazi Germany; in the immediate postwar years loomed the spectre of long years of [[rationing]] (such as the system enforced in that period in the [[United Kingdom]]). Some sections of the French business and political world lost authority after [[Vichy France|collaborating with the German occupiers]].

Post-war French governments, from whichever political side, generally sought rational, efficient economic development, with the long-term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced economy of the [[United States]]. The development of French dirigisme coincided with the development of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]]: the [[École Nationale d'Administration]] supplied the state with high-level administrators, while leadership positions in industry were staffed with [[Corps of Mines (France)|Corps of Mines]] state engineers and other personnel trained at the [[École Polytechnique]].

During the 1945–1975 period, France experienced unprecedented [[economic growth]] (5.1% on average) and a [[demography|demographic]] boom, leading to the coinage of the term ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (the "Glorious Thirty [years]").

Dirigisme flourished under the [[right-wing|centre-right]] governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou]]. In those times, the policy was viewed as a middle way between the American policy of little state involvement and the Soviet policy of total state control. In 1981, [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] president [[François Mitterrand]] was elected, promising greater [[state enterprise]] in the economy; his government soon [[nationalization|nationalised]] industries and banks. However, in 1983 the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce dirigisme and start the era of ''rigueur'' ("rigour"). This was primarily due to the Inflation of the French [[Franc]] and the [[Keynesian]] policies take by [[François Mitterrand]]. Dirigisme has remained out of favour with subsequent governments, though some of its traits remain.

=== Indicative planning ===
The main French tool under dirigisme was [[indicative planning]] through plans designed by the ''Commissariat général du plan'' ("Commission for the Plan"). Indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion, with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment. During this period France never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the [[accumulation of capital]], profit-maximizing enterprise and [[Market economy|market-based allocation]] of producer goods.

In contrast to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type central planning]] practiced in the former [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]], where economic planning substituted private [[profit (accounting)|profit]] incentivized investment and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan, the French state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace private profit with central planning. The idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants. This concept is held in contrast to a planned economy, which aims to replace market-based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities.

=== State ownership ===
Because French industry prior to the Second World War was weak due to fragmentation, the French government encouraged mergers and the formation of "[[national champions]]": large industry groups backed by the state.

Two areas where the French government sought greater control were in [[infrastructure]] and the transportation system. The French government owned the national railway company [[SNCF]], the national electricity utility [[Electricité de France|EDF]], the national natural gas utility [[Gaz de France|GDF]], the national airline [[Air France]]; [[France Télécom|phone]] and [[La Poste (France)|postal]] services were operated as the [[Postes, télégraphes et téléphones (France)|PTT]] administration. The government chose to devolve the construction of most [[autoroutes of France|autoroutes]] (freeways) to semi-private companies rather than to administer them itself. Other areas where the French government directly intervened were defense, nuclear and aerospace industries ([[Aérospatiale]]).

This development was marked by ''volontarisme'', the belief that difficulties (e.g. postwar devastation, lack of natural resources) could be overcome through willpower and ingenuity. For instance, following the [[1973 energy crisis]], the saying "In France we don't have oil, but we have ideas" was coined. Volontarisme emphasized [[modernization]], resulting in a variety of ambitious state plans. Examples of this trend include the extensive use of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (close to 80% of French electrical consumption), the [[Minitel]], an early online system for the masses, and the [[TGV]], a [[high-speed rail]] network.

== Other economies with dirigiste characteristics ==
Economic dirigisme has been described as an inherent aspect of [[fascist]] economies by Hungarian author [[Iván T. Berend]] in his book ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berend |first1=Ivan T. |author-link1=Iván T.

Dirigisme has been brought up as a politico-economic scheme at odds with ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the context of French overseas holdings. To varying degrees throughout the post-colonial period, countries such as Lebanon and Syria have been influenced by this motif.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Quilty |first1=Jim |title=Cohabitation leading to a shotgun wedding and a bitter divorce |url=https://www.dailystar.com.lb//Culture/Art/2007/Oct-17/116065-cohabitation-leading-to-a-shotgun-wedding-and-a-bitter-divorce.ashx |work=The Daily Star |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>

The economies of the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian tigers]] are sometimes characterised as being "dirigisme" due to the strong role played by the state in [[Developmental state|development planning]] and guiding investment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
