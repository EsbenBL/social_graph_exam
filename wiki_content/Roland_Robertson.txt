'''Roland Robertson''' (born 1938) is a [[Sociology|sociologist]] and theorist of [[globalization]] who lectures at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland. Formerly, he was a professor of sociology at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and in 1988 he was the President of the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].

Robertson's theories have focused significantly on a more phenomenological and psycho-social approach than that of more materialist oriented theorists such as [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] or [[Fredric Jameson]]. For Robertson, the most interesting aspect of the [[Modernity|modern]] (or [[Postmodernity|postmodern]]) era is the way in which a global consciousness has developed. He lays down a progression of "phases" that capture the central aspects of different eras in global history, asserting that the fifth phase, Global Uncertainty, has been reached.

Robertson's main works are ''Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture'' (1992) and the edited volume ''Global Modernities''. In 1985, he was the first sociologist to use the term [[globalization]] in the title of a sociological article.<ref name="Welch2006">{{cite book|author=Anthony R.
