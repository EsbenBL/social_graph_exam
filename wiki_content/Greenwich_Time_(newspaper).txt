'''''Greenwich Time''''' is a [[daily newspaper]] based in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], United States. The paper shares an editor and publisher with ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of nearby [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. Both papers are owned and operated by the [[Hearst Corporation]].

In 1977, Southern Connecticut Newspapers, which owned the ''Time'' and the ''[[Stamford Advocate]]'', was acquired by [[Times Mirror]].<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-times-mirror-company-history/ The Times Mirror Company History]</ref> Times Mirror was acquired by [[Tribune Company|Tribune]] in 2000.<ref name=Tribune>{{cite news|title=Tribune called on to sell L.A.

In March 2007, Tribune announced it would sell the two papers to [[Gannett]] for [[US$]]73 million, but the deal fell through when Gannett refused to honor 35 ''Advocate'' newsroom workers' union contract with Local 2110 of [[United Auto Workers]].<ref name=nepa />

The ''Time'' and its sister paper, ''The Advocate'', were sold to Hearst for [[US$]]62.4 million by [[Tribune Company]] in a deal that closed November 1, 2007. The sale did not include Tribune-owned land in Stamford and Greenwich, including the papers' printing presses. Hearst prints both ''The Advocate'' and the ''Time'' at the ''[[Connecticut Post]]'' plant in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]].

Following the Tribune sale, the ''Post'' was owned by MediaNews, which managed ''The Advocate'' and ''Greenwich Time'' for Hearst until Hearst bought out MediaNews in 2008.<ref name=nepa>"Hearst Corp.

On August 8, 2008 the Hearst Corporation acquired the [[Connecticut Post]] (Bridgeport, Conn.) and www.ConnPost.com, including seven non-daily newspapers, from MediaNews Group, Inc. and assumed management control of three additional daily newspapers in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], Conn., including [[The Advocate (Stamford)]], Greenwich Time (Greenwich), and [[The News-Times]] (Danbury), which had been managed for Hearst by MediaNews under a management agreement that began in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hearst.com/newspapers/greenwich-time|title=Greenwich Time|website=[[Hearst Corporation]]}}</ref>
