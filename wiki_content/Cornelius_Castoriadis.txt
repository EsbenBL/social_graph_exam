Cornelius Castoriadis (named after Saint [[Cornelius the Centurion]])<ref name="Dosse 13"/> was born on 11 March 1922 in [[Constantinople]],<!--''Istanbul'' became common only after Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name. Dosse says: "à Constantinople".--><ref name="Dosse 13">Dosse 2014, p. 13.</ref> the son of Kaisar ("Caesar") and Sophia Kastoriadis.<ref>Tasis 2007, p. 37.</ref> His family had to move in July 1922<ref name="Dosse 13"/> to [[Athens]] due to the [[Greek–Turkish population exchange]]. He developed an interest in [[politics]] after he came into contact with [[Marxism|Marxist thought and philosophy]] at the age of 13.<ref name="entretien p. 2">[http://agorainternational.org/enccaiint.pdf Cornelius Castoriadis/Agora International Interview Cerisy Colloquium (1990)], p. 2 (French original: [http://agorainternational.org/fr/CCAIINT.pdf ''Entretien d'Agora International avec Cornelius Castoriadis au Colloque de Cerisy'' (1990)]).</ref> At the same time he began studying traditional philosophy after purchasing a copy of the book ''History of Philosophy'' (''Ιστορία της Φιλοσοφίας'', 1933, 2 vols.) by the [[History of ideas|historian of ideas]] {{ill|Nikolaos Louvaris|el|Νικόλαος Λούβαρις}}.<ref name="entretien p. 2"/>

Sometime between 1932 and 1935, [[Maximiani Portas]] (later known as "Savitri Devi") was the French tutor of Castoriadis.<ref>Dosse 2014, p. 17.</ref> During the same period, he attended the 8th [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] of Athens in [[Kato Patisia]],<ref name="Bella">Marianthi Bella, [http://www.glinos.gr/v1/public/image/files/30_original.pdf "In my Neighborhood, Patisia&nbsp;..."], [[Glinos Foundation]], 2013, p. 5.</ref> from which he graduated in 1937.

His first active involvement in politics occurred during the [[Metaxas Regime]] (1937), when he joined the Athenian Communist Youth (Κομμουνιστική Νεολαία Αθήνας, ''Kommounistiki Neolaia Athinas''), a section of the [[Young Communist League of Greece]]. In 1941 he joined the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), only to leave one year later in order to become an active [[Trotskyist]].<ref>At the time, Castoriadis was under the influence of the Trotskyist [[wikt:militant#Noun|militant]] [[Agis Stinas]] (Tasis 2007, pp. 40–1).</ref> The latter action resulted in his persecution by both the [[Germans]] and the Communist Party.

In 1944 he wrote his first essays on social science and [[Max Weber]],<ref>Suzi Adams. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Castoriadis_s_Ontology.html?id=CKRFYgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y ''Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation'']. New York: Fordham University Press, 2011, p. 218. {{ISBN|978-0-8232-3459-2}}.</ref> which he published in a magazine named ''Archive of Sociology and Ethics'' (Αρχείον Κοινωνιολογίας και Ηθικής, ''Archeion Koinoniologias kai Ithikis''). Castoriadis heavily criticized the actions of the KKE during the [[Dekemvriana|December 1944 clashes]] between the communist-led [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] on one side, and the [[Georgios Papandreou|Papandreou]] government aided by [[United Kingdom|British]] troops on the other.

In December 1945, three years<ref name="Biblionet"/> after earning a bachelor's degree in [[law]], [[economics]] and [[political science]] from the School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences of the [[University of Athens]] (where he met and collaborated with the [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] intellectuals [[Konstantinos Despotopoulos]], [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]], [[Konstantinos Tsatsos]]),<ref name="Dosse 22">Dosse 2014, p. 22.</ref><ref name="entretien p. 4"/> he got aboard the [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ''[[:fr:Mataroa|Mataroa]]'',<ref>Tasis 2007, p. 42.</ref> a New Zealand ocean liner, to go to [[Paris]] (where he remained permanently) to continue his studies under a scholarship offered by the [[:fr:Institut français d'Athènes|French Institute of Athens]]. The same voyage—organized by [[Octave Merlier]]—also brought from Greece to France a number of other Greek writers, artists and intellectuals, including [[Constantine Andreou]], [[Kostas Axelos]], [[Georges Candilis]], [[:fr:Costa Coulentianos|Costa Coulentianos]], [[Emmanuel Kriaras]], [[Adonis A. Kyrou]], [[:fr:Kostas Papaïoannou|Kostas Papaïoannou]], and [[:fr:Virgile Solomonidis|Virgile Solomonidis]].<ref>Tasis 2007, p. 43.</ref><ref>Dosse 2014, p. 37.</ref><ref>François Bordes, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=yQqz6w72At0C&pg=PA63&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false "Exil et création : des penseurs grecs dans la vie intellectuelle française"], in Servanne Jollivet, Christophe Premat, Mats Rosengren, ''Destins d'exilés'', Le Manuscrit, 2011, p. 66.</ref>

=== Paris and the Chaulieu–Montal Tendency ===
Once in Paris, Castoriadis joined the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Internationalist Communist Party (France)|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] (PCI). He and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a [[Chaulieu–Montal Tendency]] in the French PCI in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castoriadis |first=Cornelius |author2=''L'Anti-Mythes'' |date=January 1974 |title=An Interview with C. Castoriadis |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=23 |page=133}}</ref> leading them to break away to found the [[libertarian socialist]] and [[councilist]] group and journal ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' (''S. ou B.'', 1949–1966), which included [[Jean-François Lyotard]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howard|first=Dick |year=1974 |title=Introduction to Castoriadis |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=23 |pages=117}}</ref> and [[Guy Debord]] as members for a while, and profoundly influenced the French intellectual [[left-wing politics|left]]. Castoriadis had links with the group known as the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] until 1958. Also strongly influenced by Castoriadis and ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' were the British group and journal ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'' and [[Maurice Brinton]].

=== Early philosophical research ===
In the late 1940s, he started attending philosophical and sociological courses at the Faculty of Letters at the [[University of Paris]] (''[[:fr:|faculté des lettres de Paris]]''), where among his teachers were [[Gaston Bachelard]],<ref name="entretien p. 4">[http://agorainternational.org/enccaiint.pdf Cornelius Castoriadis/Agora International Interview Cerisy Colloquium (1990)], p. 4.</ref><ref name="Dosse 43–4">Dosse 2014, pp. 43–4.</ref><ref>Tasis 2007, pp. 67–8.</ref> the [[Epistemology|epistemologist]] [[:fr:René Poirier|René Poirier]], the historian of philosophy Henri Bréhier (not to be confused with [[Émile Bréhier]]), [[Henri Gouhier]], [[Jean Wahl]], [[Gustave Guillaume]], [[:fr:Albert Bayet|Albert Bayet]], and [[Georges Davy]].<ref name="Dosse 43–4"/> He submitted a proposal for a [[doctoral dissertation]] on [[mathematical logic]] to Poirier, but he eventually abandoned the project.<ref name="Dosse 44">Dosse 2014, p. 44.</ref><ref name="entretien p. 4"/> The working title of his thesis was ''Introduction à la logique axiomatique'' (''Introduction to [[Axiomatic logic|Axiomatic Logic]]'').<ref name="HC"/><ref name="Dosse 44"/>

=== Career as economist and distancing from Marxism ===
At the same time (starting in November 1948), he worked as an economist at the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) until 1970, which was also the year when he obtained French [[citizenship]]. Consequently, his writings prior to that date were published pseudonymously, as "'''Pierre Chaulieu'''," "'''Paul Cardan'''," "'''Jean-Marc Coudray'''" etc.

In his 1949 essay "The Relations of Production in Russia",<ref>''PSW'' 1, pp. 135–158.</ref> Castoriadis developed a critique of the supposed socialist character of the government of the [[Soviet Union]]. According to Castoriadis, the central claim of the [[Stalinist]] regime at the time was that the mode of production in Russia was socialist, but the mode of distribution was not yet a socialist one since the socialist edification in the country had not yet been completed. However, according to Castoriadis' analysis, since the mode of distribution of the social product is inseparable from the mode of production,<ref>"[L]e mode de répartition du produit social est inséparable du mode de production." (P. Chaulieu, "Les rapports de production en Russie", ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' n° 2 (May 1949) reproduced in ''La Société bureaucratique - Volumes 1–2'', Christian Bourgois Éditeur, 1990, p. 164.)</ref> the claim that one can have control over distribution while not having control over production is meaningless.<ref>"L'Idée que l'on puisse dominer la répartition sans dominer la production est de l'enfantillage." (''La Société bureaucratique - Volumes 1–2'', p. 166.)</ref>

Castoriadis was particularly influential in the turn of the intellectual left during the 1950s against the Soviet Union, because he argued that the Soviet Union was not a [[Communist state|communist]] but rather a [[State capitalism|bureaucratic capitalist state]], which contrasted with Western powers mostly by virtue of its centralized power apparatus.<ref>Peter Osborne (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7zyESK4VH4EC&dq= ''A Critical Sense: Interviews with Intellectuals''], Routledge, 2013, p. 17.</ref> His work in the OECD substantially helped his analyses.

In the latter years of ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'', Castoriadis came to reject the [[Marxian economics|Marxist theories of economics]] and of [[Historical materialism|history]], especially in an essay on "Modern Capitalism and Revolution", first published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' in 1960–61 (first English translation in 1963 by ''Solidarity''). Castoriadis' final ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' essay was "Marxism and Revolutionary Theory", published in April 1964 – June 1965. There he concluded that a [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] Marxist must choose either to remain Marxist or to remain revolutionary.<ref>"Marxism and Revolutionary Theory" later became the first of the two parts of ''IIS'' (the second being "The Social Imaginary and the Institution", a previously unpublished follow-up to "Marxism and Revolutionary Theory"). The relevant quote from ''IIS'', p. 14 is: "Starting from revolutionary Marxism, we have arrived at the point where we have to choose between remaining Marxist and remaining revolutionaries".</ref><ref name="Hirsch 126">Arthur Hirsh, ''The French Left'', Black Rose Books, 1982, p. 126.</ref>

=== Psychoanalyst<!--'Magma (philosophy)' and 'Magma (ontology)' redirect here--> ===
When Jacques Lacan's disputes with the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] led to a split and the formation of the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] (EFP) in 1964, Castoriadis became a member (as a non-practitioner).<ref>{{cite book | last=Roudinesco| first=Élisabeth | author-link=Élisabeth Roudinesco | title=Jacques Lacan & Co | publisher=University of Chicago Press | page=433}}</ref>

In 1968 Castoriadis married [[Piera Aulagnier]], a French psychoanalyst who had undergone psychoanalytic treatment under [[Jacques Lacan]] from 1955 until 1961.<ref name="Aulagnier">[http://www.psychoanalytikerinnen.de/france_biographies.html#Aulagnier "Piera Aulagnier ''née'' Spairani" entry at Psychoanalytikerinnen.de]</ref>

In 1969 Castoriadis and Aulagnier split from the EFP to join the [[:fr:Organisation psychanalytique de langue française|Organisation psychanalytique de langue française]] (OPLF), the so-called "Quatrième Groupe",<ref name="Tasis216">Tasis 2007, p. 216.</ref> a psychoanalytic group that claims to follow principles and methods that have opened up a third way between [[Lacanianism]] and the standards of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]].<ref>Sophie de Mijolla-Mellor (2005).

Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale.</ref>

Castoriadis began to practice analysis in 1973 (he had undergone analysis in the 1960s first with Irène Roubleff and then later with Michel Renard).<ref name="Tasis216"/><ref>Dosse 2014, p. 175.</ref>

=== Philosopher of history and ontologist<!--'Magma (ontology)' redirects here--> ===
In 1967, Castoriadis submitted a proposal for a doctoral dissertation on the [[philosophy of history]] to [[Paul Ricœur]] (then at the [[University of Nanterre]]).<ref>Dosse 2014, p. 264.</ref> An epistolary dialogue began between them but Ricœur's obligations to the [[University of Chicago]] in the 1970s were such that their collaboration was not feasible at the time.<ref name="Dosse 264–5">Dosse 2014, pp. 264–5.</ref> The subject of his thesis would be ''Le fondement imaginaire du social-historique'' (''The [[Imaginary (sociology)#Castoriadis|Imaginary]] Foundations of the [[Society|Social]]-[[History|Historical]]'')<ref name="Dosse 264–5"/> (see [[#Later life|below]]).

In his 1975 work, ''L'Institution imaginaire de la société'' (''Imaginary Institution of Society''), and in ''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' (''Crossroads in the Labyrinth''), published in 1978, Castoriadis began to develop his distinctive understanding of historical change as the [[emergence]] of irrecoverable otherness that must always be socially instituted and named in order to be recognized. Otherness emerges in part from the activity of the psyche itself. Creating external social institutions that give stable form to what Castoriadis terms the ([[Ontology|ontological]]) "'''magma'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--><ref>From the contemporary geological term [[magma]], "blend of molten or semi-molten rock", from the [[Ancient Greek]] [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Fgma μάγμα], "thick unguent" (Suzi Adams, ed., 2014, ch. 6).</ref><ref name="IIS 343">"A magma is that from which one can extract (or in which one can construct) an indefinite number of [[Set theory|ensemblist]] organizations but which can never be reconstituted (ideally) by a (finite or infinite) ensemblist composition of these organizations."

According to logician Athanassios Tzouvaras, the properties of a magma that Castoriadis proposed were either unformalizable or inconsistent (see Athanassios Tzouvaras, [http://users.auth.gr/tzouvara/Texfiles.htm/Castor.pdf "Sets with dependent elements: Elaborating on Castoriadis' notion of 'magma'"] [n.d.]).</ref> allows the psyche to create stable figures for the self, and to ignore the constant emergence of mental [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]] and [[alterity]].

For Castoriadis, self-examination, as in the ancient Greek tradition, could draw upon the resources of modern psychoanalysis. Autonomous individuals—the essence of an autonomous society—must continuously examine themselves and engage in critical reflection. He writes:
<blockquote>...&nbsp;psychoanalysis can and should make a basic contribution to a politics of autonomy. For, each person's self-understanding is a necessary condition for autonomy. One cannot have an autonomous society that would fail to turn back upon itself, that would not interrogate itself about its motives, its reasons for acting, its deep-seated [''profondes''] tendencies. Considered in concrete terms, however, society doesn't exist outside the individuals making it up. The self-reflective activity of an autonomous society depends essentially upon the self-reflective activity of the humans who form that society.<ref>''FT'' A: "Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads" (essay based on a speech given in [[Abrantes]] in November 1996), p. 151. The quote appears in a slightly different translation in ''FT'' B (''Figures of the Thinkable'', trans. by Helen Arnold, Stanford University Press, 2007), pp. 89–90.</ref></blockquote>

Castoriadis was not calling for every individual to undergo psychoanalysis, per se. Rather, by reforming education and political systems, individuals would be increasingly capable of critical self- and social reflexion. He offers: "if psychoanalytic practice has a political meaning, it is solely to the extent that it tries, as far as it possibly can, to render the individual autonomous, that is to say, lucid concerning her desire and concerning reality, and responsible for her acts: holding herself accountable for what she does."<ref>''FT'' A: "First Institution of Society and Second-Order Institutions" (essay based on a lecture presented on December 15, 1985 in Paris), p. 163.</ref>

=== Sovietologist ===
In his 1980 ''Facing the War'' text, he took the view that Russia had become the primary world military power. To sustain this, in the context of the visible economic inferiority of the Soviet Union in the civilian sector, he proposed that the society may no longer be dominated by the [[one-party state]] bureaucracy but by a "[[stratocracy]]"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castoriadis |first=Cornelius |date=February 1980 |title=Facing the War |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=46 |pages=48}}</ref>—a separate and dominant military sector with expansionist designs on the world. He further argued that this meant there was no internal class dynamic which could lead to social revolution within Russian society and that change could only occur through foreign intervention.

=== Later life ===
In 1980, he joined the faculty of the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS) as ''[[:fr:Directeur d'études|Directeur d'études]]'' (Director of Studies).<ref>[[:fr:Sophie Klimis|Sophie Klimis]] and [[:fr:Laurent Van Eynde|Laurent Van Eynde]] (eds.), ''L'imaginaire selon Castoriadis: thèmes et enjeux'', Facultés Universitaires Saint Louis à Bruxelles, 2006, p. 47 n. 8.</ref> He had been elected ''[[:fr:Directeur de recherche|Directeur de recherche]]'' (Director of Research) in EHESS at the end of 1979<ref name="Schrift 112">Schrift 2006, p. 112.</ref> after submitting his previously published material in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project of connecting the disciplines of history, sociology and economy through the concept of the social imaginary<ref>Dosse 2014, pp. 305–11.</ref><ref>He had proposed in his application form the creation of a Chair in ''Recherches sur les régimes sociaux contemporains'', "Research on contemporary social systems" (Dosse 2014, p. 308), which he eventually occupied.</ref> (see [[#Thought|below]]). His teaching career at the EHESS lasted sixteen years.<ref>''OPS'', p. xxi.</ref>

In 1980, he was also awarded his [[State doctorate]] from the University of Nanterre; the final title of his thesis under Ricœur (see [[#Philosopher of history and ontologist|above]]) was ''L'Élément imaginaire de l'histoire''<ref name="Schrift 112"/> (''The Imaginary Element in History'').

In 1984, Castoriadis and Aulagnier divorced.<ref name="Aulagnier"/>

In 1989, he was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] in Social Sciences by [[Panteion University]] and in 1993 another one in [[Pedagogy|Education Sciences]] by the [[Democritus University of Thrace]].<ref>Dosse 2014, pp. 350–1.</ref>

In 1992, he joined the [[libertarian socialist]] journal ''[[Society and Nature]]'' (established by [[Takis Fotopoulos]]) as a writer; the magazine also featured such writers as [[Murray Bookchin]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].<ref>[[Chris Atton]], ''Alternative Literature: A Practical Guide for Librarians'', Gower, p. 41.</ref>

He died on 26 December 1997 from complications following [[heart surgery]]. He was survived by Zoe Christofidi (his wife at the time of his death), his daughter Sparta (by an earlier relationship with Jeanine "Rilka" Walter,<ref>Tasis 2007, pp. 43 and 85 n. 23.</ref> "Comrade Victorine" in the [[Fourth International]]),<ref>Anon. (2003), [http://www.notbored.org/foreword.html Foreword to ''The Rising Tide of Insignificancy'']</ref> and Kyveli, a younger daughter from his marriage with Zoe.<ref>Tasis 2007, p. 81.</ref><ref>[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/backiss/vol7/no2/economou.html Alex Economou: Obituary – Cornelius Castoriadis (1922–1997)]</ref>

== Philosophy ==
[[Edgar Morin]] proposed that Castoriadis' work will be remembered for its remarkable continuity and coherence as well as for its extraordinary breadth which was "[[wikt:encyclopedic|encyclopaedic]]" in the original Greek sense, for it offered us a ''[[paideia]]'', or education, that brought full circle our cycle of otherwise compartmentalized knowledge in the arts and sciences.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Radical Philosophy|last=Morin|first=Edgar|title=An encyclopaedic spirit|url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&editorial_id=10264|date=1997-12-30|access-date=2008-04-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611154828/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&editorial_id=10264|archive-date=2008-06-11}}</ref> Castoriadis wrote essays on mathematics, physics, biology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, linguistics, society, economics, politics, philosophy, and art.

One of Castoriadis' many important contributions to social theory was the idea that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through ''the [[imaginary (sociology)#Castoriadis|social imaginary]]'' without strict determinations,<ref name="IIS 3">''IIS'', p. 3.</ref> but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as [[revolution]]. Any knowledge of society and [[social change]] can exist only by referring to (or by positing) ''social imaginary [[Social meaning-making|significations]]''.<ref name="IIS 359"/> Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of [[modernity]] centered on the principal categories of ''[[social institution]]s'' and social imaginary significations;<ref name="IIS 160"/> in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the ''radical [[imagination]]'' and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former.<ref>Marcela Tova, [http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/815/81500904.pdf "The imaginary term in readings about modernity: Taylor and Castoriadis conceptions"], ''Revista de Estudios Sociales'' 9, June 2001, pp. 32–39.</ref> (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of ''the radical [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)#French culture|imaginary]]''<ref name="IIS 146">''IIS'', p. 146.</ref> can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.)<ref name="IIS 373">''IIS'', p. 373.</ref><ref>Chiara Bottici, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Au0YBQAAQBAJ&dq= ''Imaginal Politics: Images Beyond Imagination and the Imaginary''], Columbia University Press, 2014, p. 50.</ref><ref>[[:fr:Nicolas Poirier|Nicolas Poirier]], [http://www.cairn.info/revue-du-mauss-2003-1-page-383.htm "Cornelius Castoriadis. L'Imaginaire radical"], ''Revue du MAUSS'', 1/2003 (No. 21), pp. 383–404.</ref> However, the social imaginary cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination, since the individual is informed through an internalisation of social significations.<ref>"The Social Imaginary and the Institution" in ''IIS'', pp. 167–220. Also in ''CR'', pp. 196–217.</ref><ref>Schismenos 2013, p. 86.</ref>

He used traditional terms as much as possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, it is helpful to understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.

=== Autonomy and heteronomy ===
{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People}}
The concept of [[autonomy]] was central to his early writings, and he continued to elaborate on its meaning, applications, and limits until his death, gaining him the title of "Philosopher of ''Autonomy''." The word itself is [[Greek language|Greek]], where ''[[wikt:auto#Etymology 1|auto]]'' means "for/by itself" and ''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'' means "law." It refers to the condition of "self-institution" by which one creates their own laws, whether as an individual or as a whole society. And while every society creates their own institutions, only the members of ''autonomous societies'' are fully aware of the fact, and consider themselves to be the ultimate source of justice.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castoriadis |first=Cornelius |author2=''L'Anti-Mythes'' |date=January 1974 |title=An Interview with C. Castoriadis |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=23 |page=152}}</ref> In contrast, members of ''heteronomous societies'' (''hetero''- 'other') delegate this process to an authority outside of society, often attributing the source of their traditions to divine origins or, in modern times, to "historical necessity."<ref>"Alienation appears first of all as the alienation of a society to its institutions, as the ''autonomization'' of institutions in relation to society." (''IIS'', p. 115.)</ref> Castoriadis then identified the need of societies not only to create but to legitimize their laws, to explain, in other words, why their laws are just. Most traditional societies did that through religion, claiming their laws were given by God or a mythical ancestor and therefore must be true. 

An exception to this rule is to be found in Ancient Greece, where the constellation of cities (''poleis'') that spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean, although not all democratic, showed strong signs of autonomy, and during its peak, Athens became fully aware of the fact as seen in [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]].<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis. ''Ce qui fait la Grèce : Tome 3, Thucydide, la force et le droit''. Seuil 2011. (Séminaire of 13 February 1985.)</ref> Castoriadis considered Greece, a topic that increasingly drew his attention, not as a blueprint to be copied but an experiment that could inspire a truly autonomous community, one that could legitimize its laws without assigning their source to a higher authority. The Greeks differed from other societies because they not only started as autonomous but maintained this ideal by challenging their laws on a constant basis while obeying them to the same degree (even to the extent of enforcing capital punishment), proving that autonomous societies can indeed exist.

Regarding modern societies, Castoriadis notes that while religions have lost part of their [[normative]] function, their nature is still heteronomous, only that this time it has rational pretenses. [[Capitalism]] legitimizes itself through "[[reason]]," claiming that it makes "rational sense",<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1999). « ''La rationalité du capitalisme'' » in ''Figures du Pensable'', Paris: Seuil.</ref> but Castoriadis observed that all such efforts are ultimately [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], in that they can only legitimize a system through the rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament claimed that ''"There is only one God, God,"'' capitalism defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of costs, and ''then'' legitimizes itself based on its effectiveness to meet these criteria. Surprisingly, this definition of logic is also shared by [[Communism]], which despite the fact it stands in seeming opposition, it is the product of the same imaginary, and uses the same concepts and categories to describe the world, principally in material terms and through the process of human labor.

=== The imaginary ===
The term "imaginary" originates in the writings of the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (see ''[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]'') and is strongly associated with Castoriadis' work. Castoriadis believed that for a given society, as we penetrate the layers of its culture deeper and deeper, we arrive at [[Meaning-making|meanings]] that do not mean something other than themselves. They are, so to speak, "final meanings" that the society in question has imposed on the world, on itself.<ref>''IIS'', pp. 142–3.</ref> Because these meanings (manifestations of the "radical imaginary" in Castoriadian terminology) do not point to anything concrete, and because the logical categories needed to analyze them are derived from them, these meanings cannot be analysed rationally. They are [[arationality|arational]] (rather than [[Irrationality|irrational]]), and must therefore be acknowledged rather than comprehended in the common use of the term. Castoriadis' views on concept formation is in sharp contrast to that of [[postmodernist]]s like [[Jacques Derrida]], who explicitly denies the existence of concepts "in and off themselves".<ref>Jacques Derrida. ''Positions''. University of Chicago Press, 1982, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=OCJonuW4L_EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=no%20concept%20is&f=false p. 57].</ref>

Radical imaginary is at the basis of cultures and accounts for their differences. In his seminal work ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'', Castoriadis argues that societies are founded ''not'' as products of historical necessity, but as the result of a new and radical idea of the world, an idea that appears to spring fully formed and is practically [[Reductionism|irreducible]]. All cultural forms (laws and institutions, aesthetics and ritual) follow from this radical imaginary, and are not to be explained merely as products of material conditions. Castoriadis then is offering an "ontogenetic",<ref>Yannis Ktenas. ''How Castoriadis read Weber: Meaning, values, and imaginary institution''. Published: March 6, 2018 from [http://www.publicseminar.org/2018/03/how-castoriadis-read-weber/ PUBLIC SEMINAR].</ref> or "[[Emergentism|emergentist]]" model of history, one that is apparently unpopular amongst modern historians,<ref>Ricardo Duchesne. ''Uniqueness of Western Civilization''. BRILL, 2011, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=pWmDPzPo0XAC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Uniqueness%20of%20Western%20Civilization&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=ontogenetic&f=false p. 267].</ref> but can serve as a valuable critique of [[historical materialism]]. For example, Castoriadis believed that Ancient Greeks had an imaginary by which the world stems from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], while in contrast, the [[Hebrews]] had an imaginary by which the world stems from the will of a rational entity, God or [[Yahweh]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The former developed therefore a system of [[direct democracy]] where the laws were ever changing according to the people's will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God.

Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries, expressed through various creation myths, by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason (as examined [[#Autonomy and heteronomy|above]]). That same imaginary is the foundation of its opposing ideology, [[Communism]]. By that measure he observes (first in his main criticism of [[Marxism]], titled the ''Imaginary Institution of Society'',<ref name="IIS 23">''IIS'', p. 23.</ref> and subsequently in a speech he gave at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] on February 27, 1980)<ref>''EA'', p. 9.</ref> that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought, since they share the same [[industrial revolution]] type imaginary: that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not, as he claimed, the main drive of social change, since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first.<ref name="IIS 23" /> Similarly, in the issue of ecology he observes that the problems facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries. Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail, since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real, thus perpetuating the problem.

Castoriadis also believed that the complex historical processes through which new imaginaries are born are not directly quantifiable by science. This is because it is through the imaginaries themselves that the categories upon which science is applied are created. In the second part of his ''Imaginary Institution of Society'' (titled "The Social Imaginary and the Institution"), he gives the example of [[set theory]], which is at the basis of [[Mathematical logic|formal logic]], which cannot function without having first defined the "elements" which are to be assigned to sets.<ref>''IIS'', pp. 223–5.</ref> This initial ''schema of separation''<ref name="IIS 224–5"/> (''schéma de séparation'', σχήμα του χωρισμού) of the world into distinct elements and categories therefore, precedes the application of (formal) logic and, consequently, science.

=== Social constructionism ===
Castoriadis was a [[social constructionist]] and a [[moral relativist]] insofar as he held that the radical imaginary of each society was opaque to rational analysis. Since he believed that social norms and morals ultimately derive from a society's unique idea of the world, which emerges fully formed at a given moment in history and cannot be reduced further. From this he concluded that any criteria by which one could evaluate these morals objectively are ''also'' derived from the said imaginary, rendering this evaluation subjective. This does not mean that Castoriadis stopped believing in the value of social struggles for a better world, he simply thought that rationally proving their value is impossible.

This however does not mean that Castoriadis believed there is no [[truth]], but that truth is linked to the imaginary which is ultimately [[arationality|arational]]. In his book ''World in Fragments'', which includes essays on science, he explicitly writes that "We have to understand that ''there is'' truth - and that ''it is to be made/to be done'', that to attain [''atteindre''] it we have to create it, which means, first and foremost, to ''imagine'' it".<ref>''WIF'', p. 373.</ref> He then quotes [[William_Blake|Blake]] who said "What is now proved was once only imagin'd".

=== Chaos ===
The concept of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], as found in Ancient Greek [[cosmogony]], plays a significant role in Castoriadis' work, and is connected to the idea of the "imaginary".<ref name="IIS 46">''IIS'', p. 46.</ref><ref>''FT'' B, p. 80.</ref> Castoriadis translates the Greek word "chaos" as ''nothingness''.<ref>Note that he doesn't entirely exclude its definition, in [[chaos theory]], as a state of maximum entropy.</ref> According to him, the core of the Greek imaginary was a world that came from Chaos rather than the will of God as described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. Castoriadis concludes that the Greeks' imaginary of a "world out of chaos" was what allowed them to create institutions such as democracy, because— if the world is created out of nothing— man can model it as he sees fit,<ref>Castoriadis advocated that "[t]he surging forth [''surgissement''] of signification—of the institution, of society—is creation and self-creation.&nbsp;... Signification emerges to cover over the Chaos, thus bringing into being a mode of being that posits itself as negation of the Chaos" (''WIF'', p. 315).</ref> without trying to conform to some divine law. He contrasted the Greek imaginary to the Biblical imaginary in which God is a "willing" (i.e. intentional) agent and man's position is to understand God's will and act according to it.

=== The Ancient Greeks and the modern West ===
{{Anti-consumerism |People}}
Castoriadis views the political organization of the ancient Greek cities (''poleis'') not as a model to imitate, rather as a source of inspiration towards an autonomous society. He rejects also the term city state used to describe Ancient Greek cities; for him the administration of Greek ''poleis'' was not that of a State in the modern sense of the term, since Greek ''poleis'' were self–administrated. The same goes for colonisation since the neighbouring [[Phoenicia]]ns, who had a similar expansion in the Mediterranean, were monarchical till their end. During this time of colonization, however, around the time of Homer's epic poems, we observe for the first time that the Greeks, instead of transferring their mother city's social system to the newly established colony, instead, for the first time in known history, legislate anew from the ground up. What also made the Greeks special was the fact that, following the above, they kept this system as a perpetual autonomy which led to direct democracy.

This phenomenon of autonomy is again present in the emergence of the states of northern Italy during the [[Renaissance]],<ref>''WIF'', p. 72; cf. ''[[List of republics#Middle Ages and Renaissance|Renaissance republics]]''.</ref> again as a product of small independent merchants.

He sees a tension in the modern West between, on the one hand, the potentials for autonomy and creativity and the proliferation of "open societies" and, on the other hand, the spirit-crushing force of capitalism. These are respectively characterized as the ''creative imaginary'' and the ''capitalist imaginary'':
<blockquote><poem>I think that we are at a crossing in the roads of history, history in the grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its general orientation. That's the road of the loss of meaning, of the repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of "rational mastery," pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary.
The other road should be opened: it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social and political awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary.<ref>''FT'' A: "Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads," p. 146.</ref></poem></blockquote>

He argues that, in the last two centuries, ideas about autonomy again come to the fore: "This extraordinary profusion reaches a sort of pinnacle during the two centuries stretching between 1750 and 1950. This is a very specific period because of the very great density of cultural creation but also because of its very strong
subversiveness."<ref>''FT'' A: "Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads," p. 134.</ref>

== Lasting influence ==
Castoriadis has influenced European (especially continental) thought in important ways. His interventions in sociological and political theory have resulted in some of the most well-known writing to emerge from the continent (especially in the figure of [[Jürgen Habermas]], who often can be seen to be writing against Castoriadis).<ref>Elliott 2003, p. 101.</ref> Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis' work to a North American sociological audience,<ref>Joas, H. 1989. "Institutionalization as a Creative Process: The Sociological Importance of Cornelius Castoriadis's Political Philosophy", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. '''4''': 5 (March), 1184–99.</ref> and [[:cs:Johann Pál Arnason|Johann Pál Arnason]] has been of enduring importance both for his critical engagement with Castoriadis' thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public (especially during his editorship of the journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]'').<ref>Arnason, J. P. 1989. "Culture and Imaginary Significations", ''Thesis Eleven'', February 1989, '''22'''(1): 25–45.</ref> In the last few years, there has been growing interest in Castoriadis's thought, including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students: Jeff Klooger's ''Castoriadis: Psyche, Society, Autonomy'' (Brill), and Suzi Adams's ''Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation'' (Fordham University Press).
