'''Buell Halvor Quain''' (May 31, 1912 – August 2, 1939) was an [[United States|American]] [[ethnology|ethnologist]] who, after graduating from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and studying as a graduate student at [[Columbia University]], worked with native peoples in [[Fiji]] and [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropologising.ca/fidji/admin.htm|title=The Effects of Limited Anthropological Theory on Problems of Fijian Administration|access-date=2008-06-18|date=2002-03-27|author=Cyril Belshaw|author-link=Cyril Belshaw|publisher=Anthropologising.ca|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504033017/http://www.anthropologising.ca/fidji/admin.htm|archive-date=2008-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brazzil.com/p119jan03.htm|title=White Chief's Gone|access-date=2008-06-18|date=2003-01-19|author=Elma Lia Nascimento|publisher=Brazzil.com}}</ref> He published a total of four books, three of them posthumously.

In 1938, Quain travelled to Brazil to work with the [[Krahô|Kraho]] people of the Brazilian rainforest, where he also spent time in the [[Trumai people|Trumai]] village.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/biblio%3Amurphy-1955-trumai/Murphy%26Quain_1955_trumai.pdf|title=The Trumai Indians of Central Brazil|last=Quain|first=Buell|last2=Murphy|first2=Robert F.|publisher=J.

== Death ==
On August 2, 1939, at the age of 27, Buell Quain committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in the Brazilian rainforest. The reason for the suicide is somewhat unclear - some reports suggested that he had written about having caught an incurable disease, but other reasons were mooted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/columnists/curt-eriksmoen/promising-anthropologist-from-bismarck-died-young/article_9a840eac-5c79-11e0-805f-001cc4c03286.html|title=Promising anthropologist from Bismarck died young|last=ERIKSMOEN|first=CURT|work=Bismarck Tribune|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}</ref>

== Other ==
The mystery surrounding his death by suicide was the subject of [[Brazil]]ian author [[Bernardo Carvalho]]'s 2002 novel ''Nove Noites''.
