The '''American Sociological Association''' ('''ASA''') is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to advancing the discipline and profession of [[sociology]]. Founded in December 1905 as the '''American Sociological Society''' at [[Johns Hopkins University]] by a group of fifty people, the first president of the association would be [[Lester Frank Ward]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Michael R.|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|year=2007|isbn=9781405124331|editor1-last=Ritzer|editor1-first=George|pages=130–134|chapter=American Sociological Association|doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x|hdl=10138/224218|chapter-url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/book.html?id=g9781405124331_9781405124331}}</ref> Today, most of its members work in [[academia]], while around 20 percent of them work in government, business, or non-profit organizations.
 
ASA publishes ten [[academic journals]] and magazines, along with four section journals. Among these publications, the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' is perhaps the best known, while the newest is an [[Open access|open-access]] journal titled ''[https://www.asanet.org/research-and-publications/journals/socius-sociological-research-dynamic-world Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World]''. ''[[Contexts]]'' is one of their magazines, designed to share the study of sociology with other disciplines as well as [[Public sociology|the public]]. 

The ASA is currently the largest professional [[association of sociologists]] in the world, even larger than the [[International Sociological Association]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/professional_associations.html | title=Homepages of Sociological Societies & Associations | publisher=[[Hartford Seminary]], Hartford Institute for Religion Research | access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> The ASA consists of over 13,000 members—composed of researchers, students, college/university faculty, high school faculty, and various practitioners—while its 52 special-interest sections contain more than 21,000 members.<ref name=":0">"[https://www.asanet.org/about-asa About ASA]."

== History ==

=== Mission ===
The mission of the ASA is to advance sociology as a [[scientific discipline]] and as a profession serving the public good.<ref>"[http://asanet.org/about/mission.cfm Mission Statement]." ''American Sociological Association''. Retrieved on 31 March 2020.</ref> 

As the national organization for sociologists, the ASA provides a unique set of services to its members, promoting the vitality, visibility, and diversity of the discipline. Function at both the national and international level, the Association aims to articulate policy and implement programs likely to have the broadest possible impact for sociology now and in the future.[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|thumb|Lester Frank Ward]]

=== Founding ===
In the summer of 1905, a [[George Washington University]] professor began a discussion among sociologists throughout the [[United States]], writing to several dozen people to gauge the need for or interest in forming an sociological organization.<ref name=":0" /> Ultimately, a consensus was reached that the time had come for a society of sociologists in the U.S.

In early December, the professor and eight others wrote to about 300 people inviting them to a special session during the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA) and [[American Political Science Association]] meetings later that month to discuss the potential formation of a sociological society.

On December 27th, approximately 50 people, including one woman, gathered in McCoy Hall at [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Baltimore]], and, by its end, the group would motion to form a new society of sociologists. Though there would be debate as to integrating this new society with an existing organization, such as the AEA, the group would ultimately decide that the new society ought to be an independent entity. 

==== The committee ====
At the end of the day of the initial meeting, those gathered at the meeting formed a five-person committee to develop a plan for the new society and how it should be governed. The committee members would re-convene the next afternoon to review the proposed structure of the society. Council members would include [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward A. Ross]], W.F. Wilcox, [[Albion Woodbury Small|Albion Small]], Samuel Lindsay, D. C. Wells, and William Davenport.

The following men would be elected officers of the new society:<ref name=":0" /> 

* [[Lester Frank Ward]], President
* [[William Graham Sumner]], First Vice President
* [[Franklin Henry Giddings|Franklin Giddings]], Second Vice President
* C.W.A. Veditz (the professor), Secretary and Treasurer

When the committee left Baltimore, the birth of the American Sociological Society was complete, a Constitution had been adopted, officers were elected, and plans were made for the second Annual Meeting of the new Society.

=== 1905-1980 ===
In 1981, in celebration the Association's 75th anniversary, Lawrence J. Rhoades prepared a 90-page publication entitled ''A History of the American Sociological Association, 1905-1980'', commonly referred to as the "1981 Rhoades History." The publication provides a brief overview of the founding and early years of the Association, as well as highlights of key activities and events in the decades since.<ref name=":1">"[https://www.asanet.org/about-asa/asa-story/history History]." ''American Sociological Association'', ''The ASA Story''. Retrieved on 31 March 2020.</ref>

In 1953, during the Annual Meeting in [[Berkeley, California]], each of the (living) past presidents of the Society would compose a voice recording to address the coming generation of sociologists.<ref>"[https://www.asanet.org/1953-recording-american-sociological-society-past-presidents A 1953 Recording of the American Sociological Society Past Presidents]." ''American Sociological Association''. Retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>

=== 1981-2011 ===

==== 100-Year Anniversary ====
In 2005, in celebration of the Association's 100-year anniversary, ASA would publish a 201-page book entitled ''A History of the American Sociological Association, 1981-2004''. The publication picks up where the 1981 Rhoades history concludes, continuing the story and capturing the Association's history from 1981 through 2004. It is the culmination of over two years of detailed research by Katherine J. Rosich. The objective of this volume would be to describe and report on the major events in the life of ASA during the last two decades of the 20th century, leading up to a new century and millennium, as well as to commemorate the ASA's 100th anniversary in 2005.<ref name=":1" />

==== The "ASA Wikipedia" Initiative ====
In the fall of 2011, the ASA launched its "Sociology in Wikipedia" initiative. [[Erik Olin Wright]], President of the ASA, called for improvement in sociological entries in [[Wikipedia]]. He asked that professors and students to get more involved by having Wikipedia-writing assignments in class. The basic goal set forth by the initiative would be to make it easier for sociologists to contribute to Wikipedia, and for sociologists to become better involved in the writing and editing processes to ensure that social science articles are up-to-date, complete, accurate, and written appropriately.

In conjunction with the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and a research group at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the ASA developed its [[wikipedia:Community portal|Wikipedia Portal]] in an attempt to achieve the initiative’s goal through providing tutorials on how to contribute; video discussions of norms and procedures; and lists of articles and subject areas that need improvement. The Portal would also provide instructions for professors on how to use Wikipedia writing assignments for academic courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asanet.org/footnotes/nov11/images_new/footnotes_nov11.pdf|title=American Sociological Association: ASA Wikipedia Initiative|publisher=Asanet.org|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref>

=== Code of Ethics ===
The ASA is governed by a code of ethics and ethical standards, which has been revised since 1970, with the first ASA code of ethics being written in 1970. The Committee on Professional Ethics worked to write this code and upon completing and approving it in 1997, the code focused on three goals, which would be to make the code more educative, accessible/easier to use, and more helpful for sociologists to understand ethical issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iutcovich|first=Joyce M.|author2=Kennedy, John M.|author3=Levine, Felice J.|title=Establishing an Ethical Climate in Support of|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|year=2003|volume=9|pages=201–205|doi=10.1007/s11948-003-0007-z|pmid=12774652|issue=2|s2cid=10641096}}</ref>

== Meetings ==
The Annual Meeting of the ASA is held each August to provide opportunity for professionals involved in the study of society to share knowledge and new directions in research and practice. It provides networking outlets for nearly 3,000 research papers and 4,600 presenters.<ref name="asanet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/meetings/index.cfm |title=ASA Annual Meetings |publisher=Asanet.org |access-date=2012-05-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501185009/http://asanet.org/meetings/index.cfm |archive-date=2012-05-01 }}</ref> The meeting is spread across four days and covers 600 program sessions.

All ASA Committees and Task Forces meet during the annual meeting. The ASA Council and several Constitutional Committees meet mid-year during the winter months in Washington D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/meetings/committeemtgs.cfm |title=ASA Committee Meetings |publisher=Asanet.org |date=2012-01-19 |access-date=2012-05-03}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In 1993, then-doctoral student Rik Scarce was jailed for more than five months as a result of following the ASA's [[code of ethics]]. Scarce's Ph.D. research was on the [[radical environmental movement]]. Based on an [[FBI]] investigation of an [[Animal Liberation Front]] break-in, federal prosecutors argued in court that Scarce may have engaged in conversations with individuals believed to be involved with the incident. Prosecutors demanded that Scarce testify to a federal grand jury about those conversations, but Scarce refused to answer three dozen questions, citing the ASA Code of Ethics and the [[First Amendment]] as his reasoning for remaining unresponsive.<ref>Rik Scarce.  (2003).  ''Contempt of Court: A Scholar's Battle for Free Speech from behind Bars''.  {{ISBN|0759106436}}.</ref> Scarce's refusal to answer resulted in a [[contempt of court]] citation and 159 days spent in jail. He was never suspected of wrongdoing and—in keeping with contempt of court practice—he was never read his [[Miranda rights]], arrested, or tried.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/ethics/detail.cfm?id=Case99|title=American Sociological Association: Teaching Ethics Throughout the Curriculum, Ethics, Teaching, Teaching Ethics to Students|publisher=Asanet.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511211116/http://www.asanet.org/ethics/detail.cfm?id=Case99|archive-date=2012-05-11|access-date=2012-05-03}}</ref>

In early 2010, ASA publicly expressed outrage over a controversy involving [[Frances Fox Piven]] and [[Glenn Beck]], asking [[Fox News]] to stop Beck's comments.<ref>American Sociological Association: [http://www.asanet.org/press/asa_presidents_respond_to_attacks_on_piven.cfm ASA Officers Respond to Attacks on Frances Fox Piven.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512103443/http://www.asanet.org/press/asa_presidents_respond_to_attacks_on_piven.cfm|date=May 12, 2012}} January 24, 2011.</ref> An article written by Piven concerning mobilization of unemployed individuals had spurred the commentary by Beck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/157900/glenn-beck-targets-frances-fox-piven|title=Glenn Beck Targets Frances Fox Piven|author=The Editors <!--/blurb-->|date=2011-01-20|publisher=The Nation|access-date=2012-05-03}}</ref> ASA suggests in their public statements that the line should be drawn at name calling and that political commentators should instead rely on gathering evidence related to the topics and then drawing the proper conclusions.

In January 2012, a [[United States district court]] ordered [[Boston College]] to turn over material from the "[[Belfast Project]]", an oral history project pertaining to the violence in Northern Ireland. Boston College filed an appeal in February 2012, challenging the district court's decision. ASA became involved in the case to help protect human participants from the subpoena of confidential project research data.<ref>[http://bostoncollegesubpoena.wordpress.com/2012/22/statement-by-the-council-of-the-american-sociological-associations]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> The statement by the ASA council cited the potential damage this ruling would have on social science research by stifling the ability to study controversial topics. ASA is looking for an affirmation by the court for confidentiality in research.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ASA Opposes Subpoena of 'Belfast Project' Data|url=http://www.asanet.org/news-events/asa-news/asa-opposes-subpoena-belfast-project-data|website=American Sociological Association|access-date=15 February 2019|language=en|date=22 February 2012}}</ref>
