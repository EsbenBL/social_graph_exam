'''Robert David Putnam'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|t|n|ə|m}}.}} (born 1941) is an American  [[political scientist]] specializing in [[comparative politics]]. He is the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at the [[Harvard University]] [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. Putnam developed the influential [[two-level game theory]] that assumes [[international agreement]]s will only be successfully brokered if they also result in domestic benefits. His most famous (and controversial) work, ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', argues that the United States has undergone an unprecedented collapse in civic, social, associational, and political life ([[social capital]]) since the 1960s, with serious negative consequences.<ref>Marc Parry, "Can Robert Putnam Save the American Dream" ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', March 12, 2015 [http://chronicle.com/article/Can-Robert-Putnam-Save-the/228443/  Chronicle Review]</ref> In March 2015, he published a book called ''Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis'' that looked at issues of inequality of opportunity in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press release on book release|url=http://robertdputnam.com/about-our-kids/press-release/|website=robertdputnam.com|access-date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> According to the Open Syllabus Project, Putnam is the third most frequently cited author on college syllabi for political science courses.<ref>https://opensyllabus.org/results-list/authors?size=50&fields=Political%20Science</ref>

He taught at the [[University of Michigan]] until joining the faculty at Harvard in 1979, where he has held a variety of positions, including Dean of the Kennedy School, and is currently the [[Malkin Professor of Public Policy]]. Putnam was raised as a religiously observant [[Methodist]]. In 1963, Putnam married his wife Rosemary, a special education teacher and [[French horn]] player.<ref name="NYT82212" /> Around the time of his marriage, he [[Convert to Judaism|converted to Judaism]], his wife's religion.<ref>The Forward, [http://www.forward.com/articles/133047 Robert Putnam Assays Religious Tolerance From a Unique Angle], Retrieved November 26, 2010</ref>

==''Making Democracy Work''==
His first work in the area of [[social capital]] was ''[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy]]'', a comparative study of regional governments in Italy which drew great scholarly attention for its argument that the success of democracies depends in large part on the horizontal bonds that make up social capital.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert D. |last1=Putnam |year=1994 |title=Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy |isbn=978-0-691-03738-7 |title-link=Making Democracy Work }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}</ref> Putnam writes that northern Italy's history of community, guilds, clubs, and choral societies led to greater civic involvement and greater economic prosperity.<ref name="Putnam1993">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ncr.4100820204 |title=What Makes Democracy Work? |journal=National Civic Review |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=101–107 |year=1993 |last1=Putnam |first1=Robert D.}}</ref> Meanwhile, the agrarian society of Southern Italy is less prosperous economically and democratically because of less social capital. Social capital, which Putnam defines as "networks and norms of civic engagement", allows members of a community to trust one another.<ref name="Putnam1993" /> When community members trust one another, trade, money-lending, and democracy flourish.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Putnam's finding that social capital has pro-democracy effects has been rebutted by a sizable literature which finds that civic associations have been associated with the rise of anti-democratic movements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berman|first=Sheri|date=1997|title=Civil Society and the Collapse of the Weimar Republic|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25054008|journal=World Politics|volume=49|issue=3|pages=401–429|doi=10.1353/wp.1997.0008|jstor=25054008|s2cid=145285276|issn=0043-8871}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Dylan|date=2005|title=Civic Associations and Authoritarian Regimes in Interwar Europe: Italy and Spain in Comparative Perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240507000205|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=288–310|doi=10.1177/000312240507000205|s2cid=2338744|issn=0003-1224}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Satyanath|first1=Shanker|last2=Voigtländer|first2=Nico|last3=Voth|first3=Hans-Joachim|date=2017|title=Bowling for Fascism: Social Capital and the Rise of the Nazi Party|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/690949|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|issue=2|pages=478–526|doi=10.1086/690949|s2cid=3827369|issn=0022-3808}}</ref>

==''Bowling Alone''==
{{BLP sources section|date=October 2015}}
In 1995, he published "Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital" in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]''. The article was widely read and garnered much attention for Putnam, including an invitation to meet with then-President [[Bill Clinton]] and a spot in the pages of ''[[People magazine|People]]''.

In 2000, he published ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'', a book-length expansion of the original argument, adding new evidence and answering many of his critics. Though he measured the decline of social capital with data of many varieties, his most striking point was that many traditional civic, social and fraternal organizations&nbsp;– typified by [[bowling league]]s&nbsp;– had undergone a massive decline in membership while the number of people bowling had increased dramatically.

Putnam makes a distinction between two kinds of social capital: bonding capital and bridging capital. Bonding occurs when you are socializing with people who are like you: same age, same race, same religion, and so on. But in order to create peaceful societies in a diverse multi-ethnic country, one needs to have a second kind of social capital: bridging. Bridging is what you do when you make friends with people who are not like you, like supporters of another football team.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Putnam|first1=Robert D.|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-0304-3|pages=22–23}}</ref> Putnam argues that those two kinds of social capital, bonding and bridging, do strengthen each other. Consequently, with the decline of the bonding capital mentioned above inevitably comes the decline of the bridging capital leading to greater ethnic tensions.

In 2016, Putnam explained his inspiration for the book, by saying,
{{quote|We've [Americans] been able to run a different kind of society. A less statist society, a more free-market society, because we had real strength in the area of social capital and we had relatively high levels of social trust. We sort of did trust one another, not perfectly, of course, but we did. Not compared to other countries. And all that is declining, and I began to worry, "Well, gee, isn't that going to be a problem, if our system is built for one kind of people and one kind of community, and now we've got a different one. Maybe it's not going to work so well."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/robert-d-putnam/|title=Robert D. Putnam on Conversations with Bill Kristol}}</ref>}}

Critics such as the sociologist [[Claude Fischer]] argue that (a) Putnam concentrates on organizational forms of social capital, and pays much less attention to networks of interpersonal social capital; (b) Putnam neglects the emergence of new forms of supportive organizations on and off the Internet; and (c) the 1960s are a misleading baseline because the era had an unusually high number of traditional organizations.

Since the publication of ''Bowling Alone'', Putnam has worked on efforts to revive American social capital, notably through the [[Saguaro Seminar]], a series of meetings among academics, civil society leaders, commentators, and politicians to discuss strategies to re-connect Americans with their communities. These resulted in the publication of the book and website, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060714080329/http://www.bettertogether.org/ Better Together],'' which provides case studies of vibrant and new forms of social capital building in the United States

== Social capital ==
Putnam theorizes a relation in the negatives trends in society. He envisions a uniting factor named [[social capital]]; originally coined by social theorist [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as a strength within America allowing democracy to thrive due to the closeness of society, "trends in civic engagement of a wider sort".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert D.|date=1995|title=Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RGID/article/view/60809|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=6|pages=65–78|doi=10.1353/jod.1995.0002|s2cid=154350113}}</ref> Putnam observes a declining trend in social capital since the 1960s. The decreasing in social capital is blamed for rising rates in unhappiness as well as political apathy. Low social capital, a feeling of alienation within society is associated with additional consequences such as:
* Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media.
* Lower political efficacy&nbsp;– that is, confidence in one's own influence.
* Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.
* Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result.
* Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of [[collective action]] (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage).
* Less likelihood of working on a community project.
* Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering.
* Fewer close friends and confidants.
* Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.
* More time spent watching [[television]] and more agreement that "television is my most important form of entertainment".

==Diversity and trust within communities==
{{See also|Multiculturalism#Criticism}}
In recent years, Putnam has been engaged in a comprehensive study of the relationship between [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] within communities and their ethnic diversity. His conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the United States is that in the short term, other things being equal, ''more'' diversity in a community is associated with ''less'' trust both among and within ethnic groups. Putnam describes people of all races, sex, socioeconomic statuses, and ages as "hunkering down", avoiding engagement with their local community as diversity increases. Although limited to American data, his findings run counter to [[contact hypothesis]], which proposes that distrust declines as members of different ethnic groups interact, and [[conflict theory]], which suggests that while distrust ''among'' ethnic groups rises with diversity, distrust ''within'' ethnic groups should decrease. Putnam found that even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates, two factors which [[conflict theory]] states should be prime causal factors in declining inter-ethnic group trust, more diversity is still associated with less communal trust. Further, he found that low communal trust is associated with the same consequences as low social capital. Putnam says, however, that "in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits."<ref name=":0" />

Putnam published his data set from this study in 2001<ref name="Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, 2000">{{cite web|title=Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221143809/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html#.UDTTcnCUpME|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url=http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html#.UDTTcnCUpME |work=Public Opinion Archives|publisher=[[Roper Center for Public Opinion Research]]|access-date=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Hendrix | first=Anastasia | title=Fewer In S.F.

Putnam has been criticized for the lag between his initial study and his publication of his article. In 2006, Putnam was quoted in the ''Financial Times'' as saying he had delayed publishing the article until he could "develop proposals to compensate for the negative effects of diversity" (quote from John Lloyd of Financial Times).<ref name="FT10806">{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=John|title=Study paints bleak picture of ethnic diversity|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c4ac4a74-570f-11db-9110-0000779e2340.html#axzz24HMFQrIc|access-date=August 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times|The Financial Times]]  |date=October 8, 2006|location=London }}</ref> In 2007, writing in ''City Journal'', [[John Leo]] questioned whether this suppression of publication was ethical behavior for a scholar, noting that "Academics aren't supposed to withhold negative data until they can suggest antidotes to their findings."<ref>{{cite news | last = Leo | first = John | author-link = John Leo | title = Bowling with our own |url = http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2007-06-25jl.html | work = [[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]] | publisher = [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] | date = June 25, 2007 }}</ref> On the other hand, Putnam did release the data in 2001 and publicized this fact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/saguaro/communitysurvey/results3.html|title=The Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey|website=www.ksg.harvard.edu}}</ref>

Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been "twisted" to make a case against race-based admissions to universities. He asserted that his "extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society."<ref>{{cite news | last= Berlett | first = Tom | title=Harvard Sociologist Says His Research Was 'Twisted' | url = https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357 | work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = August 15, 2012 }}</ref>
