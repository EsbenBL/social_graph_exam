Some students (and faculty<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anzali|first1=Ata|title=A Sad Day on Campus|url=https://middleburycampus.com/article/a-sad-day-on-campus/|website=The Middlebury Campus|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=9 March 2017|quote=As I sat in McCullough Student Center, unsuccessfully trying to watch the live stream of Murray’s speech in the middle of student protests, fire alarms going on and off and the live stream being cut off, I saw the frozen face of a man with whom I deeply, and fundamentally, disagreed. As events unfolded, however, I could think less and less about my disagreements with him and more and more about how much the student protesters — who could afford to ignore President Patton and Professor Stanger’s open and strong invitation for civic engagement and rhetorical resilience — took the tremendous amount of freedom that they had for granted. A freedom that, even after the loss of thousands of precious lives in its pursuit, still looks like a distant dream in many countries across the globe.}}</ref>) felt that by refusing to allow Murray to speak, and by injuring Stanger, the Middlebury College student community "trod all over the ideas of free speech this country was founded upon".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charles|title=Charles Murray, Middlebury, the Working Class and the Rise of Trump's America|url=https://middleburycampus.com/article/charles-murray-middlebury-the-working-class-and-the-rise-of-trumps-america/|website=The Middlebury Campus|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=9 March 2017}}</ref>

Patton later issued a statement, saying the school would conduct an investigation into the sequence of events and then determine what actions to take for those individuals who were involved. Patton also said that the Middlebury Police Department would investigate the violent confrontation outside McCullough.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2017-news/node/545978 |title=Statement from President Laurie L.
