'''Judith Ann Tickner''' (born 1937)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lamb |first1=Peter |last2=Robertson-Snape |first2=Fiona |year=2017 |title=Historical Dictionary of International Relations |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=292 |isbn=978-1-5381-0169-8}}</ref> is an Anglo-American [[Feminism (international relations)|feminist]] [[international relations theory|international relations (IR) theorist]]. Tickner is a distinguished scholar in residence at the School of International Services, [[American University]], Washington DC.

==Career==
Tickner served as president of the [[International Studies Association]] (ISA) from 2006 to 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Erickson|first1=Karen|last2=Prügl|first2=Elisabeth|date=2010-03-01|title=Women and Academic Organizations in International Studies|url=https://oxfordre.com/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-428|access-date=2021-03-01|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.428}}</ref> Since 2011, the ISA give out the J. Ann Tickner Award.<ref>{{Cite web|title=J. Ann Tickner Award|url=https://www.isanet.org/Programs/Awards/J-Ann-Tickner|access-date=2021-03-01|website=www.isanet.org}}</ref>

After fifteen years as a Professor of International Relations at the [[University of Southern California]], Tickner recently became a distinguished scholar in residence at the School of International Services, [[American University]], Washington DC,<ref>Mershon Center</ref> On June 4, 1999, Tickner received an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates - Uppsala University, Sweden|first=David|last=Naylor|website=www.uu.se|accessdate=Apr 5, 2021}}</ref>

Her books include ''Gendering World Politics: Issues and Approaches in the Post-Cold War Era'' (Columbia University Press, 2001), ''Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on Achieving International Security'' (Columbia University Press, 1992), and ''Self-Reliance Versus Power Politics: American and Indian Experiences in Building Nation-States'' (Columbia University Press, 1987). One of Tickner's most famous journal articles was the piece "You Just Don't Understand" (''[[International Studies Quarterly]]'' (1997) 41, 611-632), which critiqued mainstream international relations theorists for the omission of [[gender]] from their theory and practice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tickner|first=J. Ann|date=1997-12-01|title=You Just Don't Understand: Troubled Engagements Between Feminists and IR Theorists|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/41/4/611/1786067/You-Just-Don-t-Understand-Troubled-Engagements|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=4|pages=611–632|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00060|issn=0020-8833|hdl=1885/41080|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Whilst mainstream scholars argued that feminists should develop scientific, [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] theories, Tickner argued against this assertion, claiming that it misunderstood one of the premises of feminist IR. Most feminist IR theory takes a strongly [[deconstructivist]] approach to knowledge, arguing that theories reflect the gendered social positioning of their authors; they therefore questioned [[Positivism|positivist]] ("scientific") methods for obscuring the gendered politics of knowledge construction. She favors a social, "bottom-up" method of analysis that makes the role of women in IR visible, as opposed to the usual scientific methodologies that are "top-down" and focus on traditionally masculinist subjects, including men, money, and [[war]]. Feminist approaches to international relations are a phenomenon of the [[Post–Cold War era|post–Cold War period]]. Feminist scholarly research began in the 1980s in various academic disciplines, from literature to [[psychology]] to [[history]].

Tickner was married to [[Hayward Alker]] until his death in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/390/in-memoriam-hayward-alker/|title=In Memoriam: Hayward Alker > News > USC Dornsife|website=dornsife.usc.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>
