He became a top-level international consultant on [[participatory democracy]] as well as an adviser to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Howard Dean]], and [[Muammar Gaddafi]].

==Personal life==
Barber was born in [[New York City]] in 1939. He was educated at [[Grinnell College]] (B.A., 1960) and [[Harvard University]] (M.A., 1963; Ph.D., 1966), after earning certificates at [[Albert Schweitzer]] College (1959) and the [[London School of Economics]] (1957).

Barber's father, Philip W. Barber, directed the New York City unit of the [[Federal Theatre Project]], which produced plays including ''[[Voodoo Macbeth|Macbeth]]'' and the [[Living Newspaper]].

==Career==
Barber was a Senior Research Scholar at The Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society of The Graduate Center, The [[City University of New York]], the President and Founder of the Interdependence Movement, and [[Walt Whitman]] Professor of Political Science Emeritus, [[Rutgers University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://benjaminbarber.org/biography/|title=Biography|website=benjaminbarber.org}}</ref> In 2001 he joined the Department of Government and Politics at the [[University of Maryland]] as Kekst Professor of Civil Society.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/us/benjamin-barber-dead-jihad-vs-mcworld.html</ref> From 2007<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.demos.org/press-release/statement-benjamin-barber-distinguished-senior-fellow|title=Statement: Benjamin Barber, a Distinguished Senior Fellow|publisher=[[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]]|date=March 14, 2007}}</ref>–2012, he was a Distinguished Senior Fellow at [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]].

As a political theorist, Barber argued for a renewed focus on [[civil society]] and engaged citizenship as tools for building effective [[democracy]], particularly in the post-[[Cold War]] world. His work examined the failure of nation-states to address global problems, and argued that cities and intercity associations are more effectively addressing shared concerns. Barber was a Senior Fellow at the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] in 2005–2017. In February 2016, he joined the [[Fordham University]] Urban Consortium as its first Distinguished Senior Fellow<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/26265/urban_consortium_fellows |title=Urban Consortium Fellows |access-date=April 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425202329/https://www.fordham.edu/info/26265/urban_consortium_fellows |archive-date=April 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and announced the inaugural convening of the Global Parliament of Mayors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://benjaminbarber.org/announcing-the-inaugural-convening-of-the-global-parliament-of-mayors/ |title="Announcing the Inaugural Convening of the Global Parliament of Mayors" |access-date=April 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303071747/http://benjaminbarber.org/announcing-the-inaugural-convening-of-the-global-parliament-of-mayors/ |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Barber was an outside adviser to President [[Bill Clinton]] and a foreign policy adviser to [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign]].

Barber met with and worked alongside civil society and government leaders in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, China, and [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s Libya.<ref>[http://www.thenation.com/blog/159046/professors-paid-qaddafi-providing-positive-public-relations "Professors Paid by Qaddafi: Providing 'Positive Public Relations'"]</ref><ref>Dugald McConnell and Brian Todd, [http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/06/libya.gadhafi.image/index.html?hpt=T2 "Gadhafi paid millions to U.S. firms to polish his global image"], CNN, April 6, 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.thenation.com/article/159054/benjamin-barber-responds "Benjamin Barber Responds"]</ref>

== Meaning and central thesis of ''Strong Democracy'' ==
In the 2004 preface to his ''Strong Democracy,'' Barber explains the central premise of that book:  "Once established strongly in the political and civic realm, democracy can assure sufficient equality and justice to coexist with a variety of economic systems."  He goes on to say that his goal in writing that book was not "to replace representative with strong democracy, but to thicken thin democracy with a critical overlay of participatory institutions."   Barber went on to propose  "a national initiative and referendum act" which would "permit Americans to petition for a legislative referendum either on popular initiatives or on laws passed by Congress."

== Honors ==
Barber's honors included a knighthood from the French Government ([[Palmes académiques|Palmes Academiques/Chevalier]])  (2001), the Berlin Prize of the [[American Academy in Berlin]] (2001) and the John Dewey Award (2003). He was also awarded Guggenheim, Fulbright, and Social Science Research Fellowships,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/person/barber-benjamin-r|title=Benjamin R. Barber {{!}} European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|publisher=Europa (web portal)|access-date=April 29, 2017}}</ref> honorary doctorates from Grinnell College, Monmouth University and Connecticut College, and held the chair of American Civilization at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.fordham.edu/university-news/benjamin-barber-fellow-at-fordham-urban-consortium-passes-away/|title=Benjamin Barber, Fellow at Fordham Urban Consortium, Passes Away|work=Fordham Newsroom|access-date=April 29, 2017}}</ref>

== 2016 elections ==
In November 2016, Barber was cited as a "major Hillary donor" and recorded expressing his opinion that black voters who vote for Republicans are voting against their own interests, in an undercover video produced by the activist group [[Project Veritas]] earlier in the year.<ref>[http://www.thedenverchannel.com/newsy/undercover-video-claims-democratic-donor-criticized-black-gop-voters Undercover Video Claims Democratic Donor Criticized Black GOP Voters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212092539/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/newsy/undercover-video-claims-democratic-donor-criticized-black-gop-voters |date=February 12, 2017 }}; ''[[ABC News]] - The Denver Channel 7 News''; Stephanie Liebergen; November 2, 2016</ref> Project Veritas has been falsely criticized by mainstream media sources for misleading audiences, splicing video footage, entrapping people, lying, fraud etc.<ref>[[Conor Friedersdorf|Friedersdorf, Conor]].

When confronted about his remarks by news station WRAL, Barber responded that the analogy to ''[[Sonderkommando]]s'' "was an overstatement and not one that I would make in public.  I stand by the basic view that people of color – Latinos and African-Americans and others – who are voting for Trump are voting in total disregard of their own long-range interests and in total obliviousness to everything that Trump has said about Latinos, about immigrants, about African-Americans, his own racist record."<ref name="wral">[http://www.wral.com/ross-donor-criticized-for-racially-charged-remarks-at-fundraiser/16187207/ Ross donor criticized for racially charged remarks at fundraiser, November 2, 2016]; WRAL</ref>

Barber donated $12,825 to various political campaigns between 2008 and 2016,<ref name="wral" /> and he described himself as an experienced fundraiser in his biography.<ref>[http://benjaminbarber.org/biography/full-biography/ ''Benjamin R.
