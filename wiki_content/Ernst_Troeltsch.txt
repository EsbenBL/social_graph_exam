'''Ernst Peter Wilhelm Troeltsch''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|ɛ|l|tʃ}};<ref>{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Andrew P.|year=2001|title=By the Waters of Naturalism: Theology Perplexed among the Sciences|location=Eugene, Oregon|publisher=Wipf and Stock|page=57|isbn=1-57910-770-2}}</ref> {{IPA-de|tʁœltʃ|lang}}; 17 February 1865 – 1 February 1923) was a German [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] [[Protestant theologian]], a writer on the [[philosophy of religion]] and the [[philosophy of history]], and a [[classical liberal]] politician. He was a member of the [[history of religions school]]. His work was a synthesis of a number of strands, drawing on [[Albrecht Ritschl]], [[Max Weber]]'s conception of [[sociology]], and the [[Baden school]] of [[neo-Kantianism]].

His "The Social Teachings of the Christian Church" (''Die Soziallehren der christlichen Kirchen und Gruppen'', 1912)<ref>Two-volume edition in translation by Harper Row, 1960.</ref> is a seminal work in theology.

==Life==
Troeltsch was born on 17 February 1865 into a Lutheran family to a doctor but went to a Catholic school in a predominantly Catholic area. He then attended university, at the [[University of Erlangen]] and then at the [[University of Göttingen]]. His ordination in 1889 was followed in 1891 by a post teaching theology at Göttingen. In 1892, he moved on to teach at the [[University of Bonn]]. In 1894, he moved on again to [[Heidelberg University]]. Finally, in 1915, he transferred to teach at what is now the [[University of Berlin]], where he took the title of professor of philosophy and civilization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|year=2001|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofchri0000unse/page/1108 1108]|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofchri0000unse/page/1108}}</ref> Troeltsch died on 1 February 1923.

==Theology==
Throughout Troeltsch's life, he wrote frequently of his belief that changes in society posed a threat to Christian religion and that "the disenchantment of the world" as described by sociologist [[Max Weber]] was underway. At an academic conference that took place in 1896, after a paper on the doctrine of ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'', Troeltsch responded by saying, "Gentlemen, everything is tottering!"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crisis in consciousness: The Thought of Ernst Troeltsch|author=Robert J. Rubanowice|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Tallahassee|page=[https://archive.org/details/crisisinconsciou00ruba/page/9 9]|year=1982|isbn=0813007216|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/crisisinconsciou00ruba/page/9}}</ref>

Troeltsch sought to explain the decline of religion in the modern era by a description of the historical evolution of the role of religion in society. He described European civilization as having three periods: [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[medieval]], and [[Modern history|modern]]. Troeltsch's understanding of the border between the medieval and modern periods is revisionist. Instead of claiming that modernity starts with the rise of [[Protestantism]], Troeltsch argues that early Protestantism should be understood as a continuation of the medieval period. The modern period starts much later on his account: in the seventeenth century. The Renaissance in Italy and the scientific revolution planted the seeds for the arrival of the modern period, and Protestantism delayed, rather than heralded, its onset. Protestantism, Troeltsch argued, was "in the first place, simply a modification of Catholicism, in which the Catholic formulation of the problems was retained, while a different answer was given to them".<ref>Quoted in Rubanowice, p. 21, from ''Protestantism and Progress'' (translated by W. Montgomery, 1958), p. 59. Original title: ''Die Bedeutung des Protestantismus für die Entstehung de modernen Welt''.</ref>

Troeltsch saw the distinction between early and late (or "neo-") Protestantism as "the presupposition for any historical understanding of Protestantism".<ref>Quoted in {{Cite book|author=Toshimasa Yasukata|title=Ernst Troeltsch: Systematic Theologian of Radical Historicality|year=1986|isbn=1555400698|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, Georgia|page=51}}</ref>

== Historiography ==
Troeltsch developed three principles pertaining to critical [[historiography]]. Each of the principles served as a philosophical retort for the issue of the preconceived notions sustained by the historian. Troeltsch's principles (the principle of criticism, the principle of analogy, and the principle of correlation) were determined to account for the issue surrounding the biases of the historian.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Historian and The Believer: The Morality of Historical Knowledge and Christian Faith|last=Harvey|first=Van Austin|publisher=Macmillan Company|year=1966|location=New York|pages=13–15}}</ref>

=== Principle of criticism ===
Troeltsch's claim in the principle concludes that absolutes within history cannot exist. Troeltsch surmised that judgments about the past must be varied. As such, the absolute truth of historical reality could not exist, but he claimed historical situation could be examined only as more likely or less likely to have happened. In that, Troeltsch understood to never create a finite and non-revisable claim. 

=== Principle of analogy ===
This principle pertains to averting the historian from applying anachronism to the past. Troeltsch understood that the probability in the former principle cannot be validated unless it is a historian's present situation, when assessing the probability, is not radically different from the past. In that, Troeltsch expects that human nature has been fairly constant throughout time, but that clause is still included as a form of accountability for the historian's narrative. 

=== Principle of correlation ===
In regards to a historical events, Troeltsch determined through this principlehumanity's historical life is interdependent upon each individual. The understanding applies a causal nature to all events, equaling thus, an effect. Any radical event, the historian should assume, affected the historical nexus immediately surrounding that event. Troeltsch determines that in historical explanation, it is important to include antecedents and consequences of events in an effort to maintain historical events in their conditioned time and space.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gesammelte Schriften II|last=Troeltsch|first=Ernst|pages=729–753}}</ref>

==Politics==
Troeltsch was politically a [[classical liberal]] and served as a member of the Parliament of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. In 1918, he joined the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). He strongly supported Germany's role in [[World War I]]: "Yesterday we took up arms. Listen to the [[ethos]] that resounds in the splendour of heroism: To your weapons, To your weapons!"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/ernst-troeltsch-and-the-power-of-the-pen/a-17547502|title=Ernst Troeltsch and the power of the pen|publisher=DW.de|date=9 April 2014|author=Emma Wallis}}</ref>

==Reception==
In the immediate aftermath of Troeltsch's death, his work was considered passé and irrelevant. This was part of a wider rejection of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] thought with the rise of [[neo-orthodoxy]] in Protestant theology, especially with the prominence of [[Karl Barth]] in the German-speaking world. From 1960 onwards, however, Troeltsch's thought has seen a revival of interest in academic circles with a variety of books being published on Troeltsch's theological and sociological work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/article/why-troeltsch-why-today-theology-for-the-21st-century/|title=Why Troeltsch?
