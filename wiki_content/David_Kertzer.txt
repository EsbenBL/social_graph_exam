==Biography==
David Kertzer graduated from Brown University in 1969. He received his PhD in Anthropology from [[Brandeis University]] in 1974, and taught at [[Bowdoin College]] until 1992.<ref name="BrownVivo">{{cite web |title=David I Kertzer |url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dkertzer |website=Researchers@Brown |publisher=Brown University |access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> That year he joined the faculty of Brown University as Professor of Anthropology and History.<ref name="brown"/> 

Sponsored by the [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission]], in 1978 he was Senior Lecturer at the [[University of Catania]] and in 2000, Chair at the [[University of Bologna]]. In 2001, he relinquished his post at Brown as Professor of History and was appointed Professor of Italian Studies. In 2005, he was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. From July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2011, Kertzer served as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] at Brown.<ref name="brown">{{Cite web|url=https://research.brown.edu/pdf/10173.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217185422/http://research.brown.edu/pdf/10173.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Kertzer CV|archivedate=February 17, 2012}}</ref>

Kertzer is the author of numerous books and articles on politics and culture, European social history, anthropological demography, 19th-century Italian social history, contemporary Italian society and politics,  and the history of Vatican relations with the Jews and the Italian state.  His book, ''The Kidnapping of [[Edgardo Mortara]]'', was a finalist for the National Book Award in Nonfiction in 1997. His ''The Popes Against the Jews,'' published in 2001, was subsequently described as "one of the most critically acclaimed and contentious books of its genre and generation."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ventresca|first=R. A. |year=2012|title=Review Essay: War without End: The Popes and the Jews between Polemic and History|journal=[[Harvard Theological Review]]|volume=105|issue=4|pages=466–490|doi=10.1017/S0017816012000223 }}</ref> The book analyzes the relation between the development of the Catholic Church and the growth of European anti-Semitism in the 19th and 20th centuries, arguing that the Vatican and several popes contributed actively to fertilizing the ideological ground that produced the [[Holocaust]]. The work produced intense discussion among scholars of European history and historians of the Catholic Church.

The follow-up work, ''The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe'' (2014), examined documentary evidence from the Vatican archives, arguing that Pope [[Pius XI]] played a significant role in supporting the rise of [[Fascism]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, but not of Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ventresca|first=R.
