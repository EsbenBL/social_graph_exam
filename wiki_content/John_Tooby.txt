'''John Tooby''' (born 1952) is an American [[anthropologist]], who, together with [[psychologist]] wife [[Leda Cosmides]], helped pioneer the field of [[evolutionary psychology]].<ref>[[David Buss]], in the textbook ''Evolutionary Psychology'' (Allyn & Bacon, 1999), pp. xxi-xxii: "In the writing of this book I owe the greatest intellectual debt to Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, Don Symons, Martin Daly, and Margo Wilson, pioneers and founders of the emerging field of evolutionary psychology."</ref><ref>See also Geoffrey Miller, "How to Keep Our Meta-Theories Adaptive: Beyond Cosmides, Tooby, and Lakatos" ''Psychological Inquiry'' 11:1 (2000), p. 42: "For a young science barely a decade old, evolutionary psychology has achieved a remarkably strong metatheoretical consensus. [...] [E]volutionary psychology's metatheory was also shaped very strongly by a series of ambitious, persuasive, and visionary articles by Cosmides and Tooby in the late 1980s and early 1990s that showed how adaptationism could be applied to the human mind.  The Cosmides-Tooby vision of evolutionary psychology profoundly influenced the thinking of other leading researchers, such as [[David Buss|Buss]], [[Gerd Gigerenzer|Gigerenzer]], [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]], and [[Randy Thornhill|Thornhill]]. It was also adopted as the conceptual framework in the most influential popular accounts of evolutionary psychology."</ref> 

==Biography==
Tooby received his PhD in [[Biological anthropology|Biological Anthropology]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1989 and is currently Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

In 1992, together with Cosmides and [[Jerome Barkow]], Tooby edited ''[[The Adapted Mind|The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture]]''. Tooby and Cosmides also co-founded and co-direct the UCSB [[Center for Evolutionary Psychology]]. Cosmides and Tooby are the joint recipient of the 2020 [[Jean Nicod Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jean-Nicod Lectures and Prize 2020|url=http://www.institutnicod.org/seminaires-colloques/prix-jean-nicod/conferences-et-prix-jean-nicod-2020/article/jean-nicod-lectures-and-prize-2020?lang=en|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-16|website=Institut Jean Nicod}}</ref>
