His undergraduate textbook, ''Price Theory and Applications'', went into seven editions. A 1958 article by Hirshleifer began the triumphant comeback of [[Irving Fisher]]'s theory of capital and interest, now deemed canonical.  While at Rand Corporation, Hirshleifer wrote a report which tore apart the Department of Water and Power's feasibility report for the [[Oroville Dam]], noting among other things that the report failed to include the cost of building the dam. The dam ended up being built. (Cadillac Desert, Chapter 10).
