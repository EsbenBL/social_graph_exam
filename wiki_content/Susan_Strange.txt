'''Susan Strange''' (9 June 1923 – 25 October 1998) was a British scholar of [[international relations]] who was "almost single-handedly responsible for creating [[international political economy]]."<ref name="cbrown">{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chris|date=1999|title=Susan Strange: A Critical Appreciation|journal=Review of International Studies|volume=25|issue=3|pages=531–535|doi=10.1017/s0260210599005318|jstor=20097617|doi-access=free}}</ref> Notable publications include ''Sterling and British Policy'' (1971), ''Casino Capitalism'' (1986), ''States and Markets'' (1988), ''The Retreat of the State'' (1996), and ''Mad Money'' (1998).<ref name=":92">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=45–51|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Susan Strange was born on 9 June 1923 in [[Langton Matravers]] (County [[Dorset]]). She went to the [[Royal High School, Bath]], and to the [[University of Caen Normandy|University of Caen]] in France,{{sfn|Baker|2004}} and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) during the Second World War.<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|author=Gautam Sen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-professor-susan-strange-1190179.html |title=Obituary: Professor Susan Strange &#124; Culture |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref> Like [[Robert W.

==Career==
Susan Strange earned a first in economics at the [[London School of Economics]]&nbsp;(LSE) in 1943.<ref name=":92" /> She raised six children and worked as a financial journalist for ''[[The Economist]]'', then ''[[The Observer]]'' until 1957. At ''The Observer'', she became the youngest White House correspondent of her time.<ref name=":92" /> She began lecturing on International Relations at the University College London in 1949.<ref name=":92" />

In 1964, she became a full-time researcher at [[Chatham House]] (formerly The Royal Institute of International Affairs).<ref name=":92" /><ref name="cbrown" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Fred|title=The revenge of ideas: Karl Polanyi and Susan Strange|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/the-revenge-of-ideas-karl-polanyi-and-susan-strange|access-date=12 June 2012|newspaper=openDemocracy|date=24 September 2008}}</ref> At the Chatham House, she authored ''Sterling and British Policy'' (1971).<ref name=":92" /> She set up an influential research group on IPE at the Chatham House in 1971.<ref name=":92" /> She played a role in the establishing of the journal ''[[Review of International Political Economy]]'', which is the leading journal dedicated to IPE.<ref name=":92" /> 

From 1978 to 1988, she served as the [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]] at LSE, and was the first woman at LSE to hold this chair and professorship. At the LSE, she built Britain's first graduate program in IPE.<ref name=":92" />

She served as professor of international political economy at the [[European University Institute]] in [[Florence, Italy]], from 1989 to 1993. Strange's final academic post, which she held from 1993 until her death in 1998, was as chair of international relations and professor of international political economy at the [[University of Warwick]], where she built up the graduate programme in International Political Economy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cIV4DWKS3IAC&q=susan+strange+warwick&pg=PA232 |title=Fifty Key Thinkers on Globalization |author1=William Coleman |author2=Alina Sajed |page=232  |date=26 June 2013 |access-date=16 July 2016|isbn=9781136163944 }}</ref> She also taught in Japan, where between 1993 and 1996 she was several times guest lecturer at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo.

She was a major figure in the professional associations in both Britain and the United States. She was an instrumental founding member and the first treasurer of the [[British International Studies Association]],<ref name=":92" /> and served as the third female president of the [[International Studies Association]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isanet.org/ISA/Governance/President/PastPresidents.aspx |title=Presidents of ISA |publisher=Isanet.org |access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref>

==International relations scholarship==
Strange was an influential International Relations scholar.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1999-01-01|title=Susan Strange 1923-1998: a great international relations theorist|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/096922999347254|journal=Review of International Political Economy|volume=6|issue=2|pages=121–132|doi=10.1080/096922999347254|issn=0969-2290}}</ref> She played a central role in developing [[international political economy]] (IPE) as a field of study,<ref name=cbrown /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H79WVDwMzCEC&newbks=0&hl=en|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=8|language=en}}</ref> and is a key figure in political economy approaches to security studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cappella Zielinski|first=Rosella|last2=Schilde|first2=Kaija|last3=Ripsman|first3=Norrin|date=2020|title=A Political Economy of Global Security Approach|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogaa005|journal=Journal of Global Security Studies|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1093/jogss/ogaa005|issn=2057-3170}}</ref> Her 1970 article, "International Economics and International Relations: A Case of Mutual Neglect", laid out her arguments for the need of a discipline of IPE.<ref name=":92" /> 

She argued that power was central to international political economy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poast|first=Paul|date=2019|title=Beyond the “Sinew of War”: The Political Economy of Security as a Subfield|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070912|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=223–239|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070912|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref> She claimed that in general, "economists simply do not understand how the global economy works" due to a poor understanding of power and an over-reliance on abstract economic models. However, she noted that political scientists also have a woeful understanding of international economics due to their emphasis on institutions and power. Thus she became one of the earliest campaigners advocating the necessity of studying both politics and economics for international relations scholars.<ref name="cbrown" /> She influenced scholars such as [[Robert Gilpin]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=32|language=en}}</ref> She was a critic of [[regime theory]], arguing that the scholarship on regimes was too state-centric and carried a hidden bias in favor of maintaining U.S. hegemony.<ref name=":924">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=101|language=en}}</ref>

In the 1980s, she disagreed with claims by other International Relations scholars that U.S. hegemony was on the decline.<ref name=":93" /> Strange was skeptical of static indicators of power, arguing that it was structural power that mattered.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Norrlof|first=Carla|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/americas-global-advantage/29F591B11AD3CCFDA25F7ED7D9191B55|title=America's Global Advantage: US Hegemony and International Cooperation|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76543-5|location=Cambridge|pages=18|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511676406}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Winecoff|first=William Kindred|date=2020|title=“The persistent myth of lost hegemony,” revisited: structural power as a complex network phenomenon|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1354066120952876|journal=European Journal of International Relations|language=en|volume=26|pages=209–252|doi=10.1177/1354066120952876|issn=1354-0661}}</ref> In particular, interactions between states and markets mattered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Katzenstein|first=Peter J.|last2=Keohane|first2=Robert O.|last3=Krasner|first3=Stephen D.|date=1998|title=International Organization and the Study of World Politics|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S002081830003558X/type/journal_article|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=645–685|doi=10.1017/S002081830003558X|issn=0020-8183}}</ref> She pointed to the superiority of the American technology sector, dominance in services, and the position of the U.S. dollar as the top international currency as real indicators of lasting power.<ref name=":93">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=76|language=en}}</ref> 

===Power and international financial markets===
Strange's key contribution to IPE was on the issue of [[Power (social and political)|power]], which she considered essential to the character and dynamics of the global economy.<ref name=":92" /> She distinguished between relational power (the power to compel A to get B to do something B does not want to do) and structural power (the power to shape and determine the structure of the global political economy).<ref name=":92" /><ref name=":1" />

''States and Markets'' (1988) delineates four key channels that constitute power—security, production, finance, and knowledge; power is the ability to "provide protection, make things, obtain access to credit, and develop and control authoritative modes of interpreting the world". Strange posits that the most overlooked channel of power is financial access, which consequently becomes the most important one to comprehend; in other words, she argues that one cannot comprehend how the world works without a thorough understanding of international financial markets. To illustrate, ''Casino Capitalism'', published in 1986, discusses the dangers of the international financial system, which she considered confirmed by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In this book, she defined "casino capitalism" as a form of capitalism that is extremely volatile and unpredictable as a consequence of the "speculatively-oriented lifts" in finance capital. There is a financial "contagion" creating a huge instability in the international financial markets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}</ref>

Her analysis in ''States and Markets'' (1988) focused on what she called the "market-authority nexus", the see-saw of power between the market and political authority. She maintained that the global market, relative to the nation state, had gained significant power since the 1970s and that a "dangerous gap" was emerging between the two. She considered nation states inflexible, limited by territorial boundaries in a world of fragile intergovernmental co-operation; "[[Westfailure]]" is what she called [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalia]]. Markets would be able to flout regulations and reign free, creating more uncertainty and risk in an already chaotic environment.

===Position on the International Monetary System===
In ''Casino Capitalism'' (Blackwells, 1986), Susan Strange problemizes the nonsystem that the international monetary system has become. She compares it with a casino whereon the foreign exchange plays as [[snakes and ladders]]. She sets the stakes that international finance has become stronger than states and has been deregularized. The Smithsonian Agreement has been weak leading further to benign neglect from the US, the Eurodollar market and OPEC has been strong undermining the [[Bretton Woods system]]. There is no state or actor governing the international monetary system and the international financial markets. American banks are made free to pursue their interests since the 1980s strengthened by the possibility to finance American bonds in the world, making a carousel of bond trading with the OPEC and the Eurodollar market. The forces of market integration set by the Bretton Woods system was going through.<ref>Strange, Susan, Casino Capitalism, Manchester University Press, 1986, pp. 1–48</ref>

''Mad Money'' (University of Manchester Press, 1998) is a rewritten and updated version of ''Casino Capitalism''. At the time of her death, she was working on an exposition of her theory of the international money system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Strange, Susan|title=CSGR Working Paper No. 18/98 "What Theory?

==Personal life==
In 1942, she married Denis Merritt (died 1993); they had one son and one daughter, and the marriage was dissolved in 1955. In 1955 she married Clifford Selly, with whom she had three sons, and one daughter.<ref name="independent1"/>
