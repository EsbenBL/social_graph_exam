'''Urie Bronfenbrenner''' (April 29, 1917 – September 25, 2005) was a Russian-born American psychologist who is most known for his [[ecological systems theory]].<ref name=ecology>Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979).The ecology of human development. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> His work with the United States government helped in the formation of the Head Start program in 1965.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/27/local/me-bronfen27 |title=Urie Bronfenbrenner, 88; Co-founder of Head Start Urged Closer Family Ties| access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref> Bronfenbrenner's ability research was key in changing the perspective of developmental psychology by calling attention to the large number of environmental and societal influences on child development.<ref name=latimes />

==Biography==
Bronfenbrenner was born in Moscow on April 29, 1917,<ref name=nytimes /> to [[Russian Jewish]] parents, the [[pathologist]] Alexander Bronfenbrenner and Eugenie Kamenetski.<ref>Behind the Mirror Image: Urie Bronfenbrenner in the Soviet Union,
Jaffa Panken, 2005, p.9</ref> When he was six, his family moved to the United States, first to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then a year later to a rural part of New York state.<ref name=apaaward>American Psychologist. (1988). Urie Bronfenbrenner. ''American Psychologist''.</ref> His father worked as a [[Neuropathology|neuropathologist]] at a hospital for the developmentally disabled called [[Letchworth Village]], located in Rockland County, N.Y.

Bronfenbrenner received a bachelor's in psychology and music from [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca, New York, in 1938.<ref name=nytimes /> He earned a master's in education from [[Harvard]] in 1940, and a doctorate in developmental psychology from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1942.<ref name=latimes /> He entered the U.S. military the day after receiving his doctorate, going on to serve as a psychologist in various military bodies during [[World War II]].<ref name=aps>{{cite web| url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/uncategorized/in-appreciation-urie-bronfenbrenner.html| title=In Appreciation: Urie Bronfenbrenner| access-date=2013-10-20}}</ref> After the war, he briefly obtained a job as an assistant chief clinical psychologist for the newly founded VA Clinical Psychology Training Program in Washington D.C.<ref name=aps /> After that, he served as an assistant professor at the [[University of Michigan]] for two years, and then moved to Cornell University in 1948 as an assistant professor in the [[Department of Human Development]].<ref name=aps /> At Cornell, his research focused on child development and the impact of social forces in this development for the rest of his career.<ref name=cornell>{{cite web| url=http://www.bctr.cornell.edu/about-us/urie-bronfenbrenner/| title=Urie Bronfenbrenner| access-date=2013-10-20}}</ref>

He was appointed to a federal panel about development in impoverished children around 1964 and 1965, with this panel helping in the creation of Head Start in 1965.<ref name=nytimes />

Bronfenbrenner wrote over 300 research papers and 14 books,<ref name=latimes /> and achieved the title of Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of [https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd Human Development at Cornell University].<ref name=aps /> He was married to Liese Price and had six children.<ref name=nytimes /> He died at his home in Ithaca, New York, on September 25, 2005 at the age of 88, due to complications with diabetes.<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/27/nyregion/urie-bronfenbrenner-88-an-authority-on-child-development-dies.html |title=Urie Bronfenbrenner, 88, an Authority on Child Development |last=Fox |first=Margalit |date=September 27, 2005 |work=The New York Times |access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref>

==Views on human development and ecological systems theory==
Bronfenbrenner saw the process of human development as being shaped by the interaction between an individual and their environment.<ref name=ecology /> The specific path of development was a result of the influences of a person's surroundings, such as their parents, friends, school, work, culture, and so on.<ref name=ecology /> During his time, he saw developmental psychology as only studying individual influences on development in unnatural settings; in his own words, developmental psychology was, "...the science of strange behavior of children in strange situations with strange adults for the briefest possible periods of time."<ref name=ecology />{{rp|19}}

It is from this vantage point that Bronfenbrenner conceives his theory of human development, the [[ecological systems theory]]. His theory states that there are many different levels of environmental influences that can affect a child's development, starting from people and institutions immediately surrounding the individual to nationwide cultural forces.<ref name=ecology /> He later accounted for the influence of time, such as specific events and changes in culture over time, by adding the [[Ecological systems theory#The five systems|chronosystem]] to the theory.<ref name=berger>Berger, K.S. (2012). The developing person through childhood (6th edition). New York, NY: Worth Publishers</ref> Furthermore, he eventually renamed his theory the [[bioecological model]] in order to recognize the importance of biological processes in development.<ref name=ceci>Ceci, S.J. (2006). Urie Bronfenbrenner (1917–2005). ''American Psychologist, 61'' (2), 173-174.</ref> However, he only recognized biology as producing a person's potential, with this potential being realized or not via environmental and social forces.<ref name=ceci />

==Head Start==
In 1964 Bronfenbrenner testified before a congressional hearing about an antipoverty bill, stating that measures should be directed towards children in order to reduce the effects of poverty on developing persons.<ref name=nytimes /> This perspective was contrary to the predominant view at the time that child development was purely biological, with no influence of experience or environment on its course.<ref name=headstart>{{cite web| url=https://www.apa.org/research/action/early.aspx| title=Early Intervention Can Improve Low-Income Children's Cognitive Skills and Academic Achievement| access-date=2013-10-23}}</ref> Because of his testimony, he was invited to the White House to discuss the issue with [[Lady Bird Johnson|Claudia Alta "Lady Bird" Johnson]], with whom he discussed child-care programs of other countries.<ref name=latimes /> Furthermore, he was invited to a federal panel that was tasked with developing a method to counteract the effects of child poverty and to get them on an equal educational footing with wealthier students.<ref name=headstart /> He worked with 12 other professionals from various fields such as mental and physical health, education, [[social work]], and [[developmental psychology]].<ref name=headstart /> Bronfenbrenner convinced the panel to focus efforts on involving a child's family and community in the intervention effort, so as to expand the program to also focus on the creation of a better environment for development.<ref name=headstart /> The panel's recommendations led to the formation of the Head Start in 1965.<ref name=latimes /> Bronfenbrenner's input may have helped Head Start develop some of its environmental intervention methods, such as family support services, home visits, and education for parenthood.<ref name=headstart />

==Legacy and influence==
According to [[Melvin L. Kohn]], a sociologist from [[Johns Hopkins University]], Bronfenbrenner was critical in making social scientists realize that, "...interpersonal relationships, even [at] the smallest level of the parent-child relationship, did not exist in a social vacuum but were embedded in the larger social structures of community, society, economics and politics."<ref name=latimes /> His theory also helped to push developmental research into conducting observations and experiments to discern the impact of certain environmental variables on human development.<ref name=cornell /> His research and ideas were also influential in the formation and direction of Head Start (see above).<ref name=latimes /> Bronfenbrenner's teaching in the [https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd Department of Human Development] at [[Cornell University]] produced a large number of developmental researchers who are now, as Cornell University claims, "leaders in the field."<ref name=cornell />
