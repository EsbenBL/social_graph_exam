'''Simon Fraser University''' ('''SFU''') is a [[public university|public research university]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, with three campuses: [[Burnaby]] (main campus), [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], and [[Vancouver]]. The {{convert|170|ha|acre|adj=on}} main Burnaby campus on [[Burnaby Mountain]], located {{convert|20|km|mi}} from downtown Vancouver, was established in 1965 and comprises more than 30,000 students and 160,000 alumni. The university was created in an effort to expand higher education across Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HighEdBCPlan|url=https://www.bccat.ca/pubs/HighEdBCPlan.pdf}}</ref>

SFU is a member of multiple national and international higher education associations, including the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], [[International Association of Universities]], and [[Universities Canada]]. SFU has also partnered with other universities and agencies to operate joint research facilities such as the [[TRIUMF]], Canada's national laboratory for [[Particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]], which houses the world's largest [[cyclotron]], and [[Bamfield Marine Station]], a major centre for teaching and research in marine biology.

Undergraduate and graduate programs at SFU operate on a year-round, three-semester schedule.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Revised: Janna Whelan|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/simon-fraser-university/|title=Simon Fraser University |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=1993-08-22 |access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref> Consistently ranked as Canada's top comprehensive university and named to the Times Higher Education list of 100 world universities under 50, SFU is also the first Canadian member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], the world's largest college sports association.<ref>{{Cite web|title=about|url=https://www.sfu.ca/about.html}}</ref> In 2015, SFU became the second Canadian university to receive accreditation from the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwccu.org/member-institutions/directory/ |title=Institutions}}</ref> SFU faculty and alumni have won 43 fellowships to the [[Royal Society of Canada]], three [[Rhodes Scholarships]] and one [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2013/sfu-profs-named-royal-society-fellows.html|title=SFU profs named Royal Society fellows|publisher=Simon Fraser University News}}</ref><ref>[[Ernest Becker]]</ref> Among the list of alumni includes two former premiers of British Columbia, [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] and [[Ujjal Dosanjh]], owner of the Vancouver Canucks NHL team, [[Francesco Aquilini]], Prime Minister of Lesotho, [[Pakalitha Mosisili]], director at the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences|Max Planck Institute]], [[Robert Turner (scientist)|Robert Turner]], and humanitarian and cancer research activist, [[Terry Fox]].<!-- Wikipedia is not a reliable source! -->

==History==
[[File:Sfu 1967.jpg|thumb|left|The newly constructed university in 1967, with the Academic Quadrangle as a centre of the campus]]

===Founding===
Simon Fraser University was founded upon the recommendation of a 1962 report entitled ''Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future'', by [[John B. Macdonald]]. He recommended the creation of a new university in the Lower Mainland and the British Columbia Legislature gave formal assent on March 1, 1963 for the establishment of the university in Burnaby.<ref name="Pound 2005">{{cite book|title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates|last=Pound|first=Richard W.|publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside|year=2005}}</ref> The university was named after [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], a [[North West Company]] fur trader and explorer. The original name of the school was Fraser University, but was changed because the initials "FU" evoked the profane phrase "f**k you".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.theprovince.com/2016/01/30/50-little-known-facts-about-50-year-old-simon-fraser-university/|title=50 little-known facts about 50-year-old Simon Fraser University|date=January 30, 2016|work=The Province|access-date=January 31, 2016|archive-date=January 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131135205/http://blogs.theprovince.com/2016/01/30/50-little-known-facts-about-50-year-old-simon-fraser-university/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-peak.ca/2015/01/simon-fraser-vs-louis-riel/|title=Simon Fraser vs. Louis Riel|date=January 6, 2015|work=The Peak|author=McLeod, B.}}</ref> In May of the same year, [[Gordon Shrum|Gordon M. Shrum]] was appointed as the university's first chancellor. From a variety of sites that were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain, 365 meters above sea level, be chosen for the new university. Architects [[Arthur Erickson]] and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964. The campus faces northwest over Burrard Inlet. Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester<ref name="Pound 2005"/> with 2,500 students.

===Early activism===
The campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty. The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department into today's separate departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans |title=Peak.sfu.ca |access-date=2011-02-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901103558/http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans |archive-date=September 1, 2005}}</ref> During this time, [[Thelma Finlayson]] became the University's first female faculty member in the Department of Biological Sciences. She would later become their first professor emerita upon her retirement in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=SFU'S FIRST PROFESSOR EMERITA TURNS 100 |url=http://www.sfu.ca/science/news-events/news/2014/sfus-first-professor-ermerita-turns-100.html |website=sfu.ca |access-date=October 18, 2019 |date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
The school's original [[coat of arms]] was used from the university's inception until 2006, at which point the Board of Governors voted to adapt the old coat of arms and thereby register a second coat of arms. The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective foreign students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/archive-sfunews/Stories/sfunews02070713.shtml|title=SFU News Online - SFU's new coat of arms - February 7, 2007|publisher=Simon Fraser University}}</ref> In 2007, the university decided to register both the old coat of arms and the revised coat of arms featuring the books. In 2007, a new marketing logo was unveiled, consisting of white letters on block red.<ref>[https://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/sfu_news/archives/sfunews02070725.html SFU News Online - SFU launches new brand - February 07, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403130532/http://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/sfu_news/archives/sfunews02070725.html |date=April 3, 2007 }}</ref>

In 2009, SFU became the first Canadian university to be accepted into the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/pamr/media_releases/media_releases_archives/media_07100901.html|title=SFU first Canadian school in NCAA|publisher=Simon Fraser University|date=2009-07-10|access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref> Starting in the 2011–2012 season, SFU competed in the NCAA's Division II [[Great Northwest Athletic Conference]] (GNAC) and has now transitioned all 19 Simon Fraser teams into the NCAA.

SFU has the highest publication impact among Canadian comprehensive universities and the highest success rates per faculty member in competitions for federal research council funding from the [[NSERC|Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)]] and the [[SSHRC|Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/report2008/research.html|title=Research that matters|publisher=Simon Fraser University|access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref> In 2007, the University began offering [[Double degree|dual and double degree]] programs by partnering with international universities, such as a dual computing-science degree through partnership with [[Zhejiang University]] in China and a double Bachelor of Arts degree in conjunction with Australia's [[Monash University]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.sfu.ca/pamr/media_releases/media_releases_archive/media_release11040801.html|title=SFU teams up with Australia to offer double degree|publisher=Simon Fraser University|date=4 November 2008|access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref>

On September 9, 2015, SFU celebrated its 50th anniversary.

Faculty and lecturers are members of the Faculty Association. Staff are members of the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]] (CUPE), the Administrative and Professional Staff Association (APSA), or Polyparty. A few positions at the university such as some in Human Resources and senior administrative positions fall outside of the five associations or unions above.

Under the previous president, Andrew Petter, SFU's administration has incurred a number of grievances and bad faith bargaining judgments.<ref name=TyeeWages /><ref name=BadFaith /><ref name=PeakHealthPlan /> During their most recent rounds of bargaining, both the TSSU and CUPE local 3338 resorted to job action, and the BC Labour Relations Board found SFU's administration to be bargaining in bad faith with the CUPE local.<ref name=BadFaith>{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Marelle|title=SFU bargaining in bad faith|url=http://www.burnabynow.com/news/sfu-bargaining-in-bad-faith-1.411770|website=Burnaby Now|access-date=2015-01-12}}</ref> Conflicts since then include unpaid wages (in Fall 2013, 18% of TSSU members reported that they were not paid on the first payday; by the term's third payday, some members still had not received their wages),<ref name=TyeeWages>{{cite magazine|last1=Bjornson|first1=Leah|title=TSSU files complaint over unpaid wages|url=https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/2013/06/03/SFU-TA-Pay/|magazine=The Tyee|access-date=2015-01-12}}</ref> and a health plan, redundant with the provincial health plan available to all international students after their first three months in-province and costing double a prior plan's cost, in which international students are automatically enrolled.<ref name=PeakHealthPlan>{{cite web|last1=Friday|first1=Melissa|title=TSSU files grievance over international student health plan|url=http://www.the-peak.ca/2014/09/tssu-files-grievance-over-international-student-health-plan/|website=The Peak|access-date=2015-01-12}}</ref>{{clear}}

=== Surrey campus ===
[[File:Harbour Centre 2015.jpg|thumb|The School of International Studies is housed within [[Harbour Centre]]]]
The Surrey campus consists of two buildings located in [[Whalley / City Centre]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. The main building is part of [[Central City (Surrey)|Central City]], an architectural complex adjacent to the [[Surrey Central station|Surrey Central]] [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] station. It was established in 2002 to absorb the students and programs of the former [[Technical University of British Columbia]], which was closed by the provincial government. It has since expanded to house the Surrey operations of other SFU programs. The Central City complex that houses the campus was designed by architect [[Bing Thom]] and opened in 2006. The Fraser Library,<ref>[http://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/fraser Fraser Library]</ref> a branch of the SFU Library, is located at the second floor on this campus, and is the only branch with a games room, where arcade games and console games are available.

=== Vancouver campus ===
[[File:W43 Tower Vancouver.jpg|thumb|The School for the Contemporary Arts within the [[Woodward's Building]]]]
The Vancouver campus was launched in the 1980s with a storefront classroom. It was the first urban university classroom in British Columbia. A significant portion of funding for the building of the campus came from the private sector. The Vancouver campus has eight buildings spread across the downtown core: SFU [[Harbour Centre]], the Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue, the [[SFU Business|Segal Graduate School of Business]], SFU Contemporary Arts at the restored [[Woodward's Building]], SFU Charles Chang Innovation Centre, SFU Vancity Office of Community Engagement at 312 Main, SFU VentureLabs, SFU Collection at Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art, and SFU Contemporary Arts at 611 Alexander Visual Arts Studio. The original campus building at Harbour Centre, a rebuilt heritage department store, officially opened on May 5, 1989. Today, the entire campus serves more than 70,000 people annually. Approximately 10,000 are graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in courses and degree programs based downtown. The Belzberg Library<ref>[http://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/belzberg Belzberg Library]</ref> is based at the Vancouver campus. <!--[[File:Woodwards sfu.jpg|thumb|right|SFU Woodwards, home to the School of Contemporary Arts]]-->

In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts relocated to the historic Woodward's district in downtown Vancouver known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. The {{convert|130,000|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} SFU facility is part of the [[Woodward's]] revitalization project. The new facility accommodates the increasing enrolment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries.

==Student life and athletics==

===Student life===
The student newspaper ''[[The Peak (newspaper)|The Peak]]'' was established shortly after the university opened and is circulated throughout the University. [[CJSF-FM]] radio is the school's radio station, broadcasting from 90.1 FM to Burnaby and surrounding communities, online at www.cjsf.ca or on cable at 93.9 FM. The Simon Fraser Student Society provides funding for over 300 campus clubs. Various campus events include the annual Terry Fox Run, [[Gung Haggis Fat Choy]], Clubs Week, and other multi-cultural events.

The Tau chapter of [[Phrateres]], a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1966. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America, including the Theta chapter nearby at the [[University of British Columbia]].

===Terry Fox===
{{Main|Terry Fox}}
[[Terry Fox]] was a notable alumnus of SFU. Diagnosed with [[bone cancer]], which resulted in the amputation of his leg, the 18-year-old kinesiology major set out to run across [[Canada]] in the [[Marathon of Hope]] to raise funding and awareness about cancer. As a result of Terry Fox's legacy, running for charitable causes is now integrated within communities worldwide. He also inspired friend [[Rick Hansen]]'s Man in Motion world tour by wheelchair. In 2001, SFU conferred an honorary degree to [[Betty Fox]], mother of Terry Fox and honorary chair of the [[Terry Fox Run|Terry Fox Foundation]].

==Appearances in popular culture==
[[File:Library-SFU-Burnaby-British-Columbia-Canada-02A.jpg|thumb|right|WAC Bennett Library, a building commonly depicted in films featuring the Burnaby campus]]
Due to the contemporary [[Brutalist architecture]] of the Burnaby Mountain campus, many buildings, including the WAC Bennett Library and Academic Quadrangle have been used for location shots in a variety of films and television programmes over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://students.sfu.ca/filming|title=SFU Facilities Services – Burnaby Services|publisher=Simon Fraser University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007233946/http://students.sfu.ca/filming/|archive-date=2011-10-07}}</ref>

===In film===
Its first use as a film set was for the 1972 science fiction film ''[[The Groundstar Conspiracy]]'', in which the entire campus complex was used. It was then followed by ''[[The Fly II]]'', which has scenes shot inside and outside the Burnaby campus. The campus also appeared in the 1989 movie ''[[American Boyfriends]]'', set in 1965, with the buildings dressed to look like they were still under construction. The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film ''[[Antitrust (film)|Antitrust]]''. Recently, in addition to other [[Vancouver]]-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie ''[[The 6th Day]]'' as well as ''[[Agent Cody Banks]]''. The 2007 film ''[[Personal Effects (2008 film)|Personal Effects]]'', was filmed in the newly constructed Blusson Hall at the Burnaby campus. In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (2008 Remake). Filming of the 2012 movie ''[[Underworld: Awakening]]'' starring Kate Beckinsale, began in early 2011 with parts of the AQ modified as part of the set. The SFU Surrey Campus has also been featured in blockbuster movies such as ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]''. SFU was also the film location for ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'', representing the Corbulo Academy of Military Science.

===In television===
The Burnaby campus has been prominently featured in science fiction television series such as ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. The Academic Quadrangle has also served as a backdrop for shots of "FBI headquarters" in the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', as well as the "National Academy For Seers" in  ''[[Sliders]]''. Exterior shots of the Academic Quadrangle have also been used in the Vancouver-based TV series ''[[JPod (TV series)|JPod]]'' (based on the book). The SFU Surrey campus has been featured in several episodes of ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', with the entire mezzanine and registration area being transformed into the Caprica Inter-colonial Space Port. Recently{{when|date=April 2012}}, filming of the TV show ''[[Hellcats]]'' commenced in the West Gym of the Chancellor's Gymnasium in November 2010.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In ''Stargate SG-1'', SFU was the homeworld for the technologically-advanced [[Tollan (Planet)|Tollan]],<ref>{{cite web |author1=Heckman, Candace  |author2=Chansanchai, Athima  |name-list-style=amp |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/251525_hollywoodnorthact3.html |title=Vancouver: A sci-fi film and TV fan's paradise |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=December 12, 2005 |access-date=2009-03-21}}</ref> as seen in the Tollan-centric episodes [[Pretense (Stargate SG-1)|"Pretense"]] ([[Stargate SG-1 (season 3)|season 3]] Ep. 15) and [[Between Two Fires (Stargate SG-1)|"Between Two Fires"]] ([[Stargate SG-1 (season 5)|season 5]] Ep. 9).
