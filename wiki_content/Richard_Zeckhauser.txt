'''Richard Jay Zeckhauser''' (born 1940) is an American [[economist]] and the [[Frank P. Ramsey]] Professor of [[Political Economy]] at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.environment.harvard.edu/about/faculty/richard-zeckhauser | title=Richard Zeckhauser| date=2009-10-12}}</ref>

He holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (''[[summa cum laude]]'') and a PhD in [[economics]] from [[Harvard University]]. Early in his career, he was one of the "[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|whiz kids]]" assembled by Defense Secretary [[Robert S. McNamara]] to apply cutting-edge analysis to [[Cold War]] military strategy. He is married to Sally H. Zeckhauser.<ref name="sallyref">{{cite news|title='Quiet' Harvard Leader To Retire {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/3/10/quiet-harvard-leader-to-retire-harvards/|work=www.thecrimson.com|language=en}}</ref>

He is the author or co-author of many books and over 300 peer-reviewed articles. His most significant works focus on risk management, decision sciences, investment, and policy-making under uncertainty. Zeckhauser introduced the term "ignorance" into decision-making under uncertainty, as in: there's "risk", "uncertainty", and outright "ignorance".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zeckhauser|first1=Richard|title=Investing in the Unknown and Unknowable|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|date=11 January 2011|doi=10.2470/rf.v2010.n2.7|url=https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2470/rf.v2010.n2.7|language=EN|doi-broken-date=31 October 2021}}</ref>

His most recent book, with Peter Schuck, is ''Targeting in Social Programs.'' The book examines how and why to deploy scarce public resources to solve public problems. While he holds no formal office, he has long been an informal leader at the Kennedy School and at Harvard.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbDDXznHPI0</ref> He is also a consultant with Analysis Group.<ref>http://www.analysisgroup.com/richard_zeckhauser.aspx</ref> In 1994, he was elected to the [[Common Cause]] National Governing Board.
