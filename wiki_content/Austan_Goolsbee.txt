On June 15, 2009, he appeared as a guest on ''[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/230578/june-15-2009/austan-goolsbee The Colbert Report]''.

He made a second appearance on ''The Colbert Report'' on October 13, 2010, where he defended Obama's tax cut policies which would allow tax breaks to expire for Americans earning more than $250,000 per year. Goolsbee's main arguments were that 98% of Americans would still receive a tax break under the Obama proposal and that the country would have to borrow money to fund tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans if all tax breaks were extended. In November 2010, however, the House of Representatives swung to a Republican majority who threatened that they would not extend the expiring tax cuts on that 98% without extending the cuts for the wealthiest 2% as well, and in December Obama signed a compromise deal to extend the cuts for all.

In January 2011, Goolsbee expressed the administration's confidence that the [[U.S. debt limit]] would be raised, noting that rhetoric from some members of Congress, who suggested the routine increase should be opposed, "[appear] to reflect a deep misunderstanding of the consequences of default".<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/debt-cap-to-be-raised-obama-adviser-says-2011-01-02?siteid=rss&rss=1 Debt cap to be raised, Obama adviser says – MarketWatch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/06/AR2011010603244.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Lori | last=Montgomery | title=Raise debt limit to avoid national catastrophe, Geithner warns Congress | date=January 7, 2011}}</ref> Goolsbee agreed with [[Tim Geithner]] and numerous conservative commentators "that the debt ceiling must be allowed to rise", commenting that "playing chicken" with a default of government liabilities could have a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70466W20110105 | work=Reuters | title=Government seen hitting debt limit in March or April | date=January 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110108203529/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/01/06/5778274-obama-admin-confident-congress-will-raise-debt-ceiling First Read – Obama admin. confident Congress will raise debt ceiling<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He noted that the Obama administration sought to fuel economic growth during the continuing gradual recovery by "focusing on spurring investment and improving U.S. exports and innovation" but noted that "in the medium run, a series of tough choices" would need to be made and that the president's budget would indicate his willingness to make budget cuts a part of the long-term plan.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/01/02/goolsbee-obama-to-make-tough-choices-on-budget/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Goolsbee: Obama to Make 'Tough Choices' on Budget | date=January 2, 2011}}</ref>

On June 6, 2011, Goolsbee announced that he would return to the University of Chicago, saying that the economy was "a million miles from where it started".
