'''Stanisław Ossowski''' ([[Lipno, Poland|Lipno]], 22 May 1897{{spaced ndash}}7 November 1963, [[Warsaw]]) was one of [[Poland]]'s most important [[Sociology|sociologists]].

He held [[professor]]ships at [[Łódź University]] (1945–47) and [[Warsaw University]] (1947–63).

==Life==
Ossowski first contributed to [[logic]] and [[aesthetics]] before moving on to [[sociology]]. He studied philosophy at the University of Warsaw, his teachers were i.a. Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Jan Łukasiewicz and Władysław Tatarkiewicz. He also studied in Paris (Collège de France), in Rome and in London. He took part in the 1920 war. Doctorate (Analysis of the notion of a sign, 1925) wrote to Tadeusz Kotarbiński at the University of Warsaw. He took part in the September campaign. He spent the occupation in Lviv and Warsaw. He taught sociology at an underground university.

He was a proponent of [[Antipositivism|humanistic sociology]] and [[Antinaturalism (sociology)|antinaturalism]], differentiating between the [[natural science]]s and the [[social sciences]]. He believed that all phenomena of social life had a consciousness aspect. For example, a social bond, especially ethnic or national, is the result of imaginations and beliefs. Their pathological forms, such as racism or chauvinism, were strongly denounced by Ossowski, while praising positive manifestations such as patriotism ("private homeland" or "ideological homeland").

Ossowski was one of the greatest intellectual and moral authorities in post-war Poland, he has had a strong influence on Polish sociologists, including [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and [[Jerzy Szacki]].

In 1949 Ossowski was a founding member, and from 1959 to 1962 vice-president, of the [[International Sociological Association]]. In 1956 he was a founding member of the reactivated [[Polish Sociological Association]] and became its first president (1957–63).

Ossowski was married to [[Maria Ossowska]], a fellow sociologist and [[social philosophy|social philosopher]].

[[Maria Ossowska]] and Stanisław Ossowski are considered among the founders of the field of "science of science" due to their authorship of a seminal 1935 paper, "The Science of Science."<ref>Originally published in Polish as ''"Nauka o nauce"'' in the Polish journal ''Nauka Polska'' (Polish Science), vol. XX, no. 3, 1935; reprinted in English in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', 1982, {{ISBN|83-01-03607-9}}, pp. 82-95.</ref><ref>A synonym for "science of science" is the [[back-formation|back-formed]] term "[[Logology (sociology)|logology]]" ([[Christopher Kasparek]], "[[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'':  the Creation of a [[Historical Novel]]", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXIX, no. 1, 1994, note 3, pp. 45–46; [[:pl:Stefan Zamecki|Stefan Zamecki]], ''Komentarze do naukoznawczych poglądów Williama Whewella (1794–1866):  studium historyczno-metodologiczne'' [Commentaries to the [[Logology (sociology)|Logological]] Views of [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866):  A Historical-Methodological Study], Warsaw, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], 2012, {{ISBN|978-83-86062-09-6}}, [English-language] summary, pp. 741–43).  The term "[[Logology (sociology)|logology]]" provides convenient grammatical variants not available with the earlier terms, "science of science" and "sociology of science":  i.e., "logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".</ref>

In 1951 he was removed from teaching. He was returned to the right to conduct classes after [[Polish October|Polish October 1956]].

An indication of the esteem in which he was held by certain sections of Polish society is a statue of him erected in Central Warsaw.
