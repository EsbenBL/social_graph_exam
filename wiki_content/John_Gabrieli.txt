'''John Gabrieli''' is a [[neuroscientist]] at [[MIT]], and an associate member of the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]].  He is a faculty member in the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and director of the Martinos Imaging Center, part of the McGovern Institute.   Gabrieli is an expert on the brain mechanisms of human cognition, including memory, thought and emotion.  His work includes [[neuroimaging]] studies on healthy adults and children as well as clinical patients with many different brain disorders, including [[schizophrenia]], depression, [[Alzheimer's disease]], autism and dyslexia.

As a graduate student with [[Suzanne Corkin]] at MIT he carried out research with the famous [[Henry Molaison|HM]], who was a globally amnesic patient as a result of epileptic surgery.  Gabrieli was able to show the importance of the [[parahippocampal cortex]] in the formation of memories.<ref>The impaired learning of semantic knowledge following bilateral medial temporal-lobe resection. Gabrieli JD, Cohen NJ, Corkin S.Brain Cogn. 1988 Apr;7(2):157-77.</ref> In collaboration with [[Christopher deCharms]] and colleagues he was the first to demonstrate that human subjects could learn to control their own brain activity using real-time feedback from [[functional MRI]].<ref>Learned regulation of spatially localized brain activation using real-time fMRI. deCharms RC, Christoff K, Glover GH, Pauly JM, Whitfield S, Gabrieli JD. Neuroimage. 2004 Jan;21(1):436-43.</ref>

One of his major current interests is dyslexia, in particular the use of brain imaging to identify children who are at risk for reading difficulties and to understand how reading instruction affects the brain.<ref>Dyslexia: A New Synergy Between Education and Cognitive Neuroscience.  Gabrieli, J.D.E., Science 17 July 2009:
Vol. 325. no. 5938, pp. 280 - 283

In 2008 Gabrieli was elected as a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], which cited his "penetrating analyses of the nature of human memory, its neural substrates, its development, and its problems."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/aaas-fellows-1218.html|title=Nine from MIT named AAAS fellows}}</ref>
