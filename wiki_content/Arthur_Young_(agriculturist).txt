'''Arthur Young''' (11 September 1741 – 12 April 1820)<ref name="ODNB"/> was an English [[agriculturist]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lJ0EDhwQ-AcC'' The Autobiography of Arthur Young]'', ed. Matilda Betham-Edwards. First published 1898, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012.</ref> Not himself successful as a farmer, he built on connections and activities as a publicist a substantial reputation as an expert on agricultural improvement. After the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, his views on its politics carried weight as an informed observer, and he became an important opponent of [[Radicalism (historical)|British reformers]]. Young is considered a major English writer on agriculture, although he is best known as a social and political observer. Also read widely were his ''Tour in Ireland'' (1780) and ''Travels in France'' (1792).

==Early life==
Young was born in 1741 at [[Whitehall]], London, the second son of Anna Lucretia Coussmaker, and her husband [[Arthur Young (divine)|Arthur Young]], who was rector of [[Bradfield Combust]] in [[Suffolk]] and [[chaplain]] to [[Arthur Onslow]].<ref name="DNB">{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Young, Arthur (1741-1820) |first=Henry |last=Higgs |author-link=Henry Higgs |volume=63 |pages=357–363}}</ref> After attending school at [[Lavenham]] from 1748,<ref name=stedmundsbury>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/1700-1899.cfm |title=The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries |date=2010–2014 |publisher=[[Borough of St Edmundsbury|St Edmundsbury]] District Council |access-date=14 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040327181254/http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/1700-1899.cfm |archive-date=27 March 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> he was in 1758 placed at Messrs Robertson, a mercantile house in [[King's Lynn]]. His sister Elizabeth Mary, who married [[John Thomlinson (MP)|John Thomlinson]] in 1758, died the next year, which disrupted the plan for Young to work at Messrs Thomlinson in London, under his sisters in-law.<ref name="DNB"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/thomlinson-john-1731-67 |title=''Thomlinson'', John (1731–1767), of East Barnet, Herts., History of Parliament Online |access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Farmer's Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWJaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA299 |year=1820 |page=299}}</ref>

Young's father also died in 1759. In 1761 Young went to London and the following year started a magazine entitled ''The Universal Museum''. It ran to five numbers, edited by Young, who recruited [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]], just out of [[King's Bench Prison]]. It was then sold to a consortium of booksellers, according to initial advice from [[Samuel Johnson]], who wanted no part of it.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Arthur Young |author2=Matilda Betham-Edwards |title=The Autobiography of Arthur Young: With Selections from His Correspondence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJ0EDhwQ-AcC&pg=PA27 |date=10 May 2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-04774-6 |pages=26–27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=15416 |first1=C.

E. |last=Mingay |title=Young, Arthur}}</ref> Young's mother then put him in charge of the family estate at Bradfield Hall, a small property encumbered with debt. Between 1763 and 1766 he concentrated on farming there.

In 1764–1765 Young met and became a friend of [[Walter Harte]], who published his ''Essays on Husbandry'' in 1764. Harte advised him to give up writing for periodicals.<ref>{{Cite book |author=John Gerow Gazley |title=The Life of Arthur Young, 1741–1820 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUQnAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA19 |year=1973 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-097-5 |page=19}}</ref> He then collected works by [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]], [[Samuel Hartlib]] and [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], as well as reading Harte. He was a contributor to the ''Museum Rusticum''.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Farmer and writer==
In 1767 Young took over a farm in [[Essex]], at Sampford Hall, one reason being to move away from his mother, who was on bad terms with his wife. For financial reasons he had to move on in 1768 to Bradmore Farm, [[North Mymms]], in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name="ODNB"/> There he engaged in experiments described in ''A Course of Experimental Agriculture'' (1770). Though these were generally unsuccessful, they gave him a working knowledge of agriculture. He acted as parliamentary reporter for the London ''[[Morning Post]]'' from 1773.<ref name="ODNB"/>
[[File:Thomas Gainsborough - Mr and Mrs Andrews.jpg|thumb|300px|Robert Andrews, considered for his farming a model landowner by Young, with his wife, in a double portrait by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] (c. 1750)]]

Young was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1774; but the Society refused a number of his papers on agricultural topics, which always had critics, such as [[James Anderson of Hermiston]].<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Dan Doll |author2=Jessica Munns |title=Recording and Reordering: Essays on the Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-century Diary and Journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFC0IIKYlsYC&pg=PA124 |year=2006 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |isbn=978-0-8387-5630-0 |page=124}}</ref> In 1784 Young began the publication of the ''Annals of Agriculture'', which ran for 45 volumes: contributors included [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]], writing under the pseudonym "Ralph Robinson", and [[Robert Andrews (landowner)|Robert Andrews]], whom Young took as a model farmer.<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=95074 |first=Hugh |last=Belsey |title=Andrews, Robert}}</ref> Young's figures for the total area of England and Wales, and total cultivated area, were serious overestimates. In a work from 1799, during wartime and fiscal strain on the national budget, [[Henry Beeke]] gave more reliable figures, showing Young had erred.<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=1952 |first=R. D. |last=Sheldon |title=Beeke, Henry}}</ref>

Young was appointed secretary of the [[Board of Agriculture (1793–1822)|Board of Agriculture]] in 1793, just after it was formed under the presidency of [[Sir John Sinclair]]. In that capacity he worked on collecting and preparing the [[General View of Agriculture county surveys]]. The ''Annals of Agriculture'' began to wind down in 1803, when John Rackham of Bury St Edmunds, who printed it, found copy was lacking and pressed Young, who padded out the pages with old notes. [[Sir Richard Phillips|Richard Phillips]] took it on for volume 41, and saw the publication out, the final volume 45 appearing in 1808.<ref>{{Cite book |author=John Gerow Gazley |title=The Life of Arthur Young, 1741–1820 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUQnAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA19 |year=1973 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-097-5 |page=464}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Annals of Agriculture and Other Useful Arts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI0ZAQAAIAAJ |year=1808}}</ref>

==Travel writer==
Young began a series of journeys through England and Wales, which he described in books that appeared from 1768 to 1770: ''A Six Weeks' Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales'', ''A Six Months' Tour through the North of England'' and the ''Farmer's Tour through the East of England''. He claimed that these contained the only first-hand information on the rentals, produce and stock of England. They were favourably received and widely translated.

He toured the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1776–1777, publishing his ''Tour in Ireland'' in 1780. The book was republished in 1897 and 1925, but with much of Young's social detail removed.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22387/22387-h/22387-h.htm ''Tour in Ireland'', 1897 edition, ed. Henry Morley]</ref><ref>''Tour of Ireland {{sic}} 1776–1779'' (1780), selected and edited by Constantia Maxwell; ''Tour of Ireland: Irish History from Contemporary Sources'' (London: Allen & Unwin 1925).</ref> The full text was republished in 1892 as "''Arthur Young's Tour in Ireland (1776–1779)''" by Arthur Hutton.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/arthuryoungstou00andegoog Pdf copy in Google Books, as seen in 2017]</ref>
 
Young's first visit to France was in 1787. Travelling all over the country annually from 1787 to 1789 (around the start of the [[French Revolution]]) he described the condition of the people and the conduct of public affairs at a critical juncture. His ''Travels in France'' appeared in one large [[quarto]] volume in 1792, reprinted in two [[octavo]] volumes ([[Dublin]], 1793) and in an enlarged second edition in two [[quarto]] volumes (London, 1794).

==On the French Revolution==
An eye-witness to the French Revolution from the perspective of one who was welcomed into the company of the highest levels of the French nobility (including the King and Queen) at the time of the [[fall of the Bastille]] in 1789,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Young |first=Arthur |date=1794 |title=Travels During the Years 1787, 1788 & 1789; Undertaken More Particularly With a View of Ascertaining the Cultivation, Wealth, Resources and National Prosperity of the Kingdom of France |publisher=W. Richardson, Royal Exchange, London |edition=Second }}</ref> Young by 1792 had become an opponent of its violence and modified his reforming views on English politics.<ref name="ODNB"/> Seeing the burned châteaux at [[Besançon]], he was shocked by the provincial disorders, as he had been by the chaotic debates of the [[National Assembly]] (for which he recommended [[John Hatsell]]'s book on procedure).<ref>{{Cite book |author=Jenny Graham |year=2000 |title=The Nation, the Law, and the King: Reform Politics in England, 1789–1799 |volume=1 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=0-7618-1484-1 |pages=161 and 125}}</ref> He and [[William Windham]] aligned themselves with [[Edmund Burke]]'s views expressed in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), in Young's ''Plain and Earnest Address to Britons'' of November 1792. This was endorsed by the loyalist [[Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Jenny Graham |year=2000 |title=The Nation, the Law, and the King: Reform Politics in England, 1789–1799 |volume=1 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=0-7618-1484-1 |pages=24 and 415}}</ref> In 1793 he opposed [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]]'s reform motion in Parliament and wrote ''Example of France a Warning to Britain.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Jenny Graham |year=2000 |title=The Nation, the Law, and the King: Reform Politics in England, 1789–1799 |volume=1 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=0-7618-1484-1 |pages=91 and 483}}</ref>

Still in 1793, Young played a role in recruiting the [[Suffolk Yeomanry]], by pulling together local groups of cavalry volunteers. The formation actually took place in 1794, although the cap-badge date of 1793 was later adopted.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.friendsofthesuffolkregiment.org/the-loyal-suffolk-hussars.html |title=The Loyal Suffolk Hussars – The Friends Of The Suffolk Regiment |access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://suffolkandnorfolkyeomanryassociation.org.uk/history/# |title=History, Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry Association |access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> He joined with the radical [[Capel Lofft]] of [[Troston Hall]] in a proposal for a Suffolk ship-of-war to be supported by subscription.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Susan Mitchell Sommers |title=Parliamentary Politics of a County and Its Town: General Elections in Suffolk and Ipswich in the Eighteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ff-gR5cqn-IC&pg=PA163 |year=2002 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-97513-5 |page=163 note 25}}</ref>

Young returned to the subject of reform in 1798 with ''An Enquiry into the State of Mind Amongst the Lowest Classes''. He had attained a formidable position as commentator and used it to call attention to urban unrest and the influence of [[Tom Paine]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Jenny Graham |year=2000 |title=The Nation, the Law, and the King: Reform Politics in England, 1789–1799 |publisher= University Press of America |isbn=0-7618-1484-1 |volume=2 |pages=855 and 887}}</ref>

==Associations==
Young's closest friend was [[John Symonds (academic)|John Symonds]], a Cambridge academic, who became involved in his writing as editor. [[Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol]] in 1782 held weekly Thursday dinners at [[Ickworth]] for Symonds, Young and others.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Chris Wrigley |author2=Johnathan Shepherd |title=On the Move: Essays in Labour and Transport History Presented to Philip Bagwell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCClbsCqFIQC&pg=PA9 |year=1991 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-1-85285-060-9 |page=9}}</ref>

In the late 1780s the export of [[wool]] became contentious, but Young combined forces with [[Sir Joseph Banks]] in opposing restrictions on this.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Edward Smith |title=The Life of Sir Joseph Banks: President of the Royal Society, with Some Notices of His Friends and Contemporaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpOdQQMkMvwC&pg=PA310 |date=11 May 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-03112-7|page=310}}</ref> [[James Oakes (diarist)|James Oakes]] of Bury St Edmunds, a yarn dealer, was a friend of both Symonds and Young.<ref name="RochefoucauldScarfe1988">{{Cite book |author1=François duc de La Rochefoucauld |author2=Norman Scarfe |title=A Frenchman's Year in Suffolk: French Impressions of Suffolk Life in 1784: the Mélanges Sur L'Angleterre of François de La Rochefoucauld |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5Ltyk_xbZcC&pg=PA225 |year=1988 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |isbn=978-0-85115-508-1 |page=225}}</ref> In the wool controversy, Oakes was on the other side from Young, who argued that restricting the export of wool was against the interests of landowners, while Oakes wished to see the price of wool to spinners fall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stedmundsburychronicle.co.uk/Chronicle/1700-1812.htm |title=St Edmundsbury Local History - St Edmundsbury from 1700 to 1812 |access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref>

A tour by Young was typically preceded by newspaper publicity and consisted of social meetings with prominent farmers and agricultural improvers.<ref name="ODNB"/> One in south-west England in 1796 led to an acquaintance with [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet]], a judge and improver at [[Princetown]] on [[Dartmoor]]. Buller corresponded with Young on agricultural matters. The relationship later became awkward, however, when Young's son, the Rev. Arthur Young, was suspected of jury tampering in the trial of [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]], on the basis of a letter to [[Gamaliel Lloyd]] of [[Bury St Edmunds]], a radical. Buller and the attorney-general took a belligerent attitude to the allegations, when the letter was read out in court.<ref>{{Cite book |author=John Gerow Gazley |title=The Life of Arthur Young, 1741–1820 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUQnAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA19 |year=1973 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-097-5 |pages=355 and 399}}</ref><ref>{{cite ODNB |id=3914 |first=James |last=Oldham |title=Buller, Sir Francis}}</ref>

==Final years==
[[File:Arthur Young tomb 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Young's tomb at All Saint's Church, [[Bradfield Combust]]]]
From 1801, Young followed the [[evangelical]] teaching of [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Thomas Scott]] at the London Lock Chapel, and was influenced by [[Charles Simeon]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=John Gerow Gazley |title=The Life of Arthur Young, 1741–1820 |year=1973 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-097-5 |page=415}}</ref> In 1809 he became a correspondent, living abroad, of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909044830/https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004004 |title=A. Young (1741 – 1820) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |archive-date=9 September 2019}}</ref> In 1811 he became firm friends with a niece of [[Frances Burney]], Marianne Francis (1790–1832), who shared his commitment to evangelical Christianity.<ref>''The Letters of Sarah Harriet Burney'', op. cit., p. 138, Note 2.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=John Gerow Gazley |title=The Life of Arthur Young, 1741–1820 |year=1973 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |isbn=978-0-87169-097-5 |pages=587–8}}</ref> His sight, however, was failing, and in that year he had an operation for a [[cataract]], which proved unsuccessful, leaving him blind.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Young continued to publish pamphlets. He died in Sackville Street, London, on 12 April 1820, aged 78, after a painful illness caused by [[bladder calculus]], and was buried at Bradfield Combust church,<ref name="ODNB"/> where his tomb, in sarcophagus form, is inscribed, "Let every real patriot shed a tear, For genius, talent, worth, lie buried here." The tomb is a designated [[Grade II listed]] structure.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1228581 |desc=Tomb Chest, 6 Metres South of Chancel of All Saints Church, Bradfield Combust with Stanningfield |date=27 January 1984 |access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> He left an autobiography in manuscript, which was edited (1898) by [[Matilda Betham-Edwards]].

==Legacy==
[[File:An Arthur Young (1741–1820) bookplate in a Royal Agricultural Society of England book.jpg|thumbnail|One of Arthur Young's bookplates in a [[Royal Agricultural Society of England]] book]]
Young influenced contemporary observers of economic and social life, such as [[Frederick Morton Eden]] and Sir John Sinclair. He was influential too on the American improver [[John Beale Bordley]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB |id=68464 |first=Jean B. |last=Russo |title=Bordley, John Beale}}</ref>

More recently Young has been studied for his methods of investigation. [[Richard Stone]] (1997) presents him as a pioneer national income statistician, continuing the work of [[Gregory King]], who had lived a century before. Young produced three estimates of the national income of England: in his ''Tour through the North of England'', ''Farmer's Tour through the East of England'' and ''Political Arithmetic''. Brunt (2001) emphasises how Young collected his information, and presents him as a pioneer of [[sample survey]]s.

==Works==
Young built a reputation on the views he expressed as an agricultural improver, a [[political economist]] and a social observer. At the age of 17, he published a pamphlet ''On the War in North America''. He also wrote four early novels, and ''Reflections on the Present State of Affairs at Home and Abroad'' in 1759. In 1768 he published the ''Farmer's Letters to the People of England'', in 1771 the ''Farmer's Calendar'', which went through many editions, and in 1774 his ''Political Arithmetic'', which was widely translated.

Young produced around 25 books and pamphlets on agriculture and 15 books on political economy, as well as many articles. These include:

*''A Six Weeks Tour Through the Southern Counties of England and Wales''
*''The Farmer’s Letters to the People of England'', 1768.

The ''Travels in France'' were translated into French in 1793–1794 by François Soules; a new version by Henri Lesage with an introduction by [[Léonce Guilhaud de Lavergne]] appeared in 1856. The [[French Directory|Directory]] in 1801 ordered Young's writings to be translated in 20 volumes under the title ''Le Cultivateur anglais''.

==Family==
In 1765 Young married Martha Allen (died 1815), sister-in-law of [[Charles Burney]]. Their acute marital strife and Young's devotion to his children were witnessed by [[Frances Burney]] and her half-sister [[Sarah Burney|Sarah]] during a visit in 1792.<ref>''The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay)'', Volume 1, 1791–1792, ed. Joyce Hemlow, et al. (London: Oxford University Press, 1972), pp. 231–248.</ref> He grieved deeply when his daughter Martha Ann died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] on 14 July 1797 at the age of 14, and her loss is said to have turned his mind to religion.<ref>''The Autobiography of Arthur Young with Selections from his Correspondence'', ed. M. Betham-Edwards (London: Smith, Elder, 1898), pp. 167 and 177–178. Cited in ''The Letters of Sarah Harriet Burney'', ed. Lorna J. Clark (Athens, GA, and London, UK: University of Georgia Press, 1997), which has several letters to Young's daughter Mary and wife Martha (pp. 1–30). These show occasional irritation at Mrs Young's requests for various articles to be sent to her, at her claims that people are slow to reply to her letters, and at repeated invitations for Sarah to visit again. This was something neither she nor Frances wished to do, as they had been embarrassed by the frequent marital strife they had witnessed.</ref>
