He was the [[Edna Fischel Gellhorn]] Professor and chair of the political science department at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and then the [[William B. Munro|William Bennett Munro]] Professor of Political Science at [[Stanford University]]. He was an influential scholar of constitutional law and civil liberties, as well as race and ethnic politics in the United States. He published works on [[civil liberties in the United States]] and [[systemic racism]]. He was also involved with several presidential campaigns, and he wrote books about the [[Jesse Jackson 1984 presidential campaign]], for which he was a convention delegate.

==Early life and education==

Barker intended to study medicine while attending [[Southern University at Baton Rouge]],<ref name=wapo/> where he obtained his bachelor's degree in political science in 1949.<ref name=psnow/> He decided to study political science after taking a class with [[Rodney Higgins]].<ref name=sss/> After graduating from Southern University in 1949, Barker earned a master's degree from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]] in 1950, followed by a doctorate from the same institution four years later, where [[Jack Peltason]] was his advisor.<ref name=psnow/> He was the first Black teaching assistant in the College of Arts and Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.<ref name=sss/>

==Career==
===Academic positions===
After completing his PhD, Barker became a Fellow at the University of Illinois, and taught there for several years.<ref name=psnow/> He then returned to Southern University, followed by the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].<ref name=psnow/> In 1964, he was a Liberal Arts Fellow of Law and Political Science at the Harvard Law School.<ref name=sss/> In 1967, Jack Peltason recruited Barker to return to the University of Illinois, where Peltason was chancellor and Barker was appointed assistant chancellor.<ref name=psnow/> In 1969, he joined the political science faculty at Washington University in St. Louis, where he became chair of the political science department, and was named the Edna Fischel Gellhorn Professor. In 1990, Barker moved to Stanford University, where he was appointed William Bennett Munro Professor of Political Science.<ref name=stanford /> He retired in 2006.<ref name=stanford/>

Barker was the 1992–1993 president of the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref name=ky /> He was the second Black president of the association; the first, 40 years before, had been [[Ralph Bunche]].<ref name=psnow/> He was also the 1984 president of the [[Midwest Political Science Association]].<ref name=mpsa/> Barker was the founding editor of the ''National Review of Black Politics'' (then the ''National Political Science Review''), a journal of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists.<ref name=psnow/>

===Research===
In addition to articles and chapters in edited volumes, Barker authored dozens of books.<ref name=psnow/> Several of these books have been described as foundational studies of topics in American politics. In 1970, Lucius Barker and his brother [[Twiley Barker]] coauthored the textbook ''Civil Liberties and the Constitution''.<ref name=sss/> This textbook had been published in 9 editions by 2020, and is considered a classic textbook on the structure of the American legal system.<ref name=wapo/> In 1980, he published ''Black Americans and the Political System'' (published in later editions as ''African Americans and the American Political System''), which the American Political Science Association publication ''Political Science Now'' called "a defining book on systemic racism through a political lens".<ref name=psnow/> In 1984, he wrote a book on Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign, called ''Our time has come: A delegate's diary of Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign''.<ref name=psnow/>

In this way, Barker's research activity was connected to civil rights and civil liberties activism. ''Our time has come'' was based on Barker's experience as a delegate for Jesse Jackson at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=psnow/> Jackson called Barker "a scholarly soldier in our [[civil rights movement|ongoing battle for equal rights]]".<ref name=psnow/>

Barker was also particularly noted for his teaching,<ref name=wapo/> and his students included [[Julian Castro|Julián Castro]], [[Joaquin Castro]], [[Cory Booker]], and [[Tony West (attorney)|Tony West]].<ref name=psnow/>
