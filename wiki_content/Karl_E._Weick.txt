==Early life and education==
Weick was born on October 31, 1936 in [[Warsaw, Indiana]]. He  earned his [[bachelor's degree]] at [[Wittenberg University|Wittenberg College]] in [[Springfield, Ohio]]. He went on to The [[Ohio State University]] earning his [[M.A.]] under the direction of [[Harold B. Pepinsky]] in 1960 and his [[Ph.D.]] under the direction of [[Douglas P. Crowne]] and [[Milton J. Rosenberg]] in 1962.<ref name=Miner2005/><ref name=CV2007/> Although he tried several degree programs within the psychology department, the department finally built a degree program specifically for Weick and fellow student [[Genie Plog]] called "organizational psychology".<ref name="Bedeian">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0hZAAAAYAAJ|title=Management Laureates: A Collection of Autobiographical Essays|last=Bedeian|first=Arthur G.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Jai Press|isbn=9781559384711|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==

From 1962 to 1965, Weick was an assistant professor of psychology at [[Purdue University]] in Lafayette, IN. Six months after arriving at Purdue, he received a letter from [[John C. Flanagan]] congratulating him on being the 1961-62 Winner of the Best Dissertation of the Year Award in Creative Talent Awards Program sponsored by the [[American Institutes for Research]]. Weick submitted an article based on this research to ''The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', but it was rejected by the editor, [[Dan Katz]]. In an unlikely turn of events one of the referees, Arthur R. (Bob) Cohen, wrote the editor indicating that he would like to change his appraisal of the article. This prompted Katz to reconsider the significance of the article. Finally in 1964, Weick's first article to come out of his dissertation was published.<ref>Weick, K. E. (1964). Reduction of cognitive dissonance through task enhancement and effort expenditure. The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 68(5), 533.</ref>

Weick notes that while at Purdue, he was fortunate to develop close ties with faculty in the [[Krannert School of Management]]. It was [[William Starbuck]] that suggested Weick write a chapter about laboratory experiments and organizations for the first edition of [[James G. March]]'s ''Handbook of Organizations'', published in 1965.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw8iQUbMv6IC|title=Handbook of Organizations (RLE: Organizations)|last=March|first=James G.|date=2013-06-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135965426|language=en}}</ref> This ultimately established Weick's "identity" as an organizational psychologist.<ref name="Bedeian"/>

Also in 1965, Weick moved to the [[University of Minnesota]] as an associate professor of psychology, and was promoted to full professor in 1968. In 1972, he left Minnesota to be a professor of psychology and organizational behavior in the business school at [[Cornell University]], and in 1977 was given the title of Nicholas H. Noyes Professor of Organizational Behavior and Professor of Psychology. From 1977 to 1985, he was the editor of the [[Administrative Science Quarterly]].

In 1984 until 1988, Weick was the Harkins and Co. Centennial Chair in Business Administration at University of Texas at Austin. Finally, he moved to the University of Michigan in 1988, where he remains as the Rensis Likert Distinguished University Professor of Organizational Behavior and Psychology.

== Key contributions ==

=== Enactment ===
Weick uses the term ''enactment'' to denote the idea that certain phenomena (such as [[organizations]]) are created by being talked about.

{{quote|Managers construct, rearrange, single out, and demolish many 'objective' features of their surroundings. When people act they unrandomize variables, insert vestiges of orderliness, and literally create their own constraints.<ref>Social Psychology of Organizing, p. 243</ref>}}

=== Loose coupling ===
Weick's major contribution to the topic of [[loose coupling]] in an organizational context comes from his 1976 paper on "Educational Organizations as Loosely Coupled Systems" (published in the Administrative Science Quarterly), revisited in his review of subsequent uses of the concept, with JD Orton, in 1990's ''Loosely Coupled Systems: A Reconceptualization''.<ref>Orton JD, Weick K (1990). ''Loosely Coupled Systems: A Reconceptualization'', "The Academy of Management Review, Vol. 15:2, pp203-223, https://www.jstor.org/pss/258154</ref>

Loose coupling in Weick's sense is a term intended to capture the necessary degree of flex between an organization's internal abstraction of reality, its theory of the world, on the one hand, and the concrete material actuality within which it finally acts, on the other. A loose coupling is what makes it possible for these [[ontology|ontologically]] incompatible entities to exist and act on each other, without shattering (akin to [[Cornelius Castoriadis|Castoriadis's]] idea of 'articulation'). Orton and Weick argue in favour of uses of the term which consciously preserve the [[dialectic]] it captures between the subjective and the objective, and against uses of the term which 'resolve' the dialectic by folding it into one side or the other.

=== Sensemaking ===
People try to make sense of organizations, and organizations themselves try to make sense of their environment. In this [[Sensemaking|sense-making]], Weick pays attention to questions of ambiguity and uncertainty, known as ''equivocality'' in organizational research that adopts [[information processing theory]]. His contributions to the theory of sensemaking include research papers such as his detailed analysis of the breakdown of sensemaking in the case of the [[Mann Gulch fire|Mann Gulch]] disaster,<ref>Weick, K. (1993). ''The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations: The Mann Gulch Disaster'', Administrative Science Quarterly, Vol. 38</ref> in which he defines the notion of a '[[cosmology episode]]' - a challenge to assumptions that causes participants to question their own capacity to act.

=== Mindfulness ===
Weick introduced the term mindfulness into the organizational and safety literatures in the article ''Organizing for high reliability: Processes of collective mindfulness'' (1999).  Weick develops the term “mindfulness” from Langer's (1989) work, who uses it to describe individual cognition.  Weick's innovation was transferring this concept into the organizational literature as “collective mindfulness.”  The effective adoption of collective mindfulness characteristics by an organization appears to cultivate safer cultures that exhibit improved system outcomes.  The term [[high reliability organization]] (HRO) is an emergent property described by Weick (and Karlene Roberts at UC-Berkeley).  Highly mindful organizations characteristically exhibit: a) Preoccupation with failure, b) Reluctance to simplify c) Sensitivity to operations, d) Commitment to Resilience, and e) Deference to Expertise.

Weick explained that mindfulness is when we realize our current expectations, continuously improve those expectations based on new experiences, and implement those expectations to improve the current situation into a better one.<ref>Weick, K. E., & Sutcliffe, K. M. (2001). ''Managing the unexpected: assuring high performance in an age of complexity''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref>

===Organizational information theory===
[[Organizational information theory]] builds upon general systems theory, and focuses on the complexity of information management within an organization. The theory addresses how organizations reduce equivocality, or uncertainty through a process of information collection, management and use.

== Plagiarism ==

In several published articles, Weick related a story that originally appeared in a poem by [[Miroslav Holub]], “Brief thoughts on maps”, in which soldiers lost in the Alps find their way with an old map, revealed at the end to be a map of the Pyrénées. The original poem was published in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', February 4, 1977. Weick republished the poem with minor differences, sometimes without quotation or attribution. The plagiarism was detailed in an article by Thomas Basbøll and Henrik Graham.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Basbøll|first1=Thomas|last2=Graham|first2=Henrik|year=2006|title=Substitutes for Strategy Research: Notes on the source of Karl Weick's anecdote of the young lieutenant and the map of the Pyrenees|journal=Ephemera: Theory & Politics in Organizations|volume=6|issue=2|pages=194–204|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/sites/default/files/6-2basboell-graham.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>

Weick has disputed the claim of plagiarism in a response.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weick|first1=Karl|title=Dear editor: A reply to Basbøll and Graham|journal=Ephemera|volume=6|issue=2|page=193|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/sites/default/files/6-2weick.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> Basbøll and Graham later remarked that Weick's defense violates some of the assumptions of his theory of sensemaking,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flory|first1=Marja|last2=Basbøll|first2=Thomas|title=Legitimate peripheral irritations|journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management|date=30 March 2012|volume=25|issue=2|pages=220–235|doi=10.1108/09534811211213900}}</ref> also noting: “The American Historical Association acknowledges the existence of this common defence in specific cases of plagiarism, tersely remarking that it “is plausible only in the context of a wider tolerance of shoddy work.”<ref>{{cite web|last1=Basbøll|first1=Thomas|title=Karl Weick and I|url=https://secondlanguage.blogspot.fr/2006/07/karl-weick-and-i.html|website=Research as a Second Language|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=2006-07-17}}</ref>
