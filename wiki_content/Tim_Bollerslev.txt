A fellow of the [[Econometric Society]], Bollerslev is known for his ideas for measuring and forecasting [[financial market]] [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] and for the [[GARCH]] (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model. He is editor of the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics.''

==Biography==
Tim Bollerslev received his MSc in economics and mathematics in 1983 from the [[Aarhus University]] in Denmark. He continued his studies in the U.S., earning his Ph.D. in 1986 from the [[University of California at San Diego]] with a thesis titled ''Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity with Applications in Finance''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/303461010/ | title = Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity with Applications in Finance | first = Tim | last = Bollerslev | accessdate = 14 January 2014| via = ProQuest }}</ref> written under the supervision of [[Robert F. Engle]] ([[Nobel Prize in Economics]] winner in 2003).

After his graduate studies, Bollerslev taught at the [[Northwestern University]] between 1986–1995 and at the [[University of Virginia]] between 1996–1998. Since 1998 he is the Juanita and Clifton Kreps Professor of Economics at [[Duke University]].

He and [[Mark Watson (economist)|Mark Watson]] are widely regarded as carrying forward the work of the Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Robert F.
