==Biography==
Smelser was born in [[Kahoka, Missouri|Kahoka]], [[Missouri]], on July 22, 1930. He received his undergraduate degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1952 in the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613233340/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/profiles/smelser/cv.pdf]</ref> From 1952 to 1954, he was a [[Rhodes scholar]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he studied economics, philosophy, and politics and was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. During his first year of graduate school at the age of 24, he co-authored ''Economy and Society'' with [[Talcott Parsons]], first published in 1956. 

He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[sociology]] from Harvard in 1958, and was a junior fellow of the Society of Fellows. He was given tenure a year after graduating from Harvard and joining Berkeley.<ref name="orgtheory.wordpress.com"/> and, at the age of 31, he was the youngest editor of the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' in 1961, just three years after coming to Berkeley.

He was the fifth director of the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] from 1994 to 2001. He retired in 1994 when he became an [[emeritus professor]] and died in Berkeley on October 2, 2017.<ref name="Memoriam" /><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/12/neilsmelserobituary/ |title = Sociologist Neil Smelser, campus leader and Free Speech Movement diplomat, dies at 87|date = 2017-10-12}}</ref>

==Major works==

===Theory of Collective Behavior===

In ''Theory of Collective Behavior'',<ref>Smelser, Neil J. ''Theory of Collective Behavior''. New York: Free Press, 1963.</ref> Smelser offers a unified theory of collective behavior. It differs from the European social-psychological research on [[crowd psychology]] by [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Wilfred Trotter]], [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], and [[Sigmund Freud]]. It also breaks with the American tradition of [[Edward Alsworth Ross]], [[Robert E. Park]], and [[Herbert Blumer]].<ref>Ormrod J.S. (2014) Smelser’s Theory of Collective Behaviour. In: ''Fantasy and Social Movements. Studies in the Psychosocial Series''. Palgrave Macmillan, London. https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137348173_7</ref> 

As part of his theory, Smelser used the concept of value-added as a metaphor to describe how collective actions occur. Smelser's ''[[value added theory]]'' (or strain theory) argued that six elements were necessary for a particular kind of collective behavior to emerge:<ref>Heath, R.L., Johansen, W. and Saffer, A.J. (2018). "Value-Added Theory". In ''The International Encyclopedia of Strategic Communication'' (eds R.L. Heath and W. Johansen).</ref>
* Structural conduciveness - things that make or allow certain behaviors possible (e.g. spatial proximity)
* Structural strain - something (inequality, injustice) must strain society
* Generalized belief - explanation; participants have to come to an understanding of what the problem is
* Precipitating factors - spark to ignite the flame
* Mobilization for action - people need to become organized
* Failure of social control - how the authorities react (or don't)

===Economic sociology===
Smelser was a proponent of [[economic sociology]], an interdisciplinary field that links sociology and economics.  

In ''The Sociology of Economic Life'' (1963), Smelser defines the field of economic sociology "as the sociological perspective applied to economic phenomena."<ref>Neil J. Smelser, ''The Sociology of Economic Life''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1963, pp. 27-28.</ref>
Smelser contrasts economic sociology to mainstream economics in terms of (1) their concept of the actor, (2) their concept of economic action, (3) their sense of constraints on Economic Action, (4) their view of the relationship between the economy and society, (5) their goals of analysis, (6) the models they employ, and (7) their intellectual tradition.<ref>Neil J. Smelser and Richard Swedberg, "Introducing Economic Sociology," pp. 3-25, in Neil J. Smelser and Richard Swedberg (eds.), ''The Handbook of Economic Sociology'', Second Edition. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005, pp. 3-6. </ref>

Neil J. Smelser and Richard Swedberg's edited volume ''The Handbook of Economic Sociology'' (1994; 2nd edition in 2005) is credited with "consolidat[ing] the field of economic sociology."<ref>Mauro F. Guillén, Randall Collins, Paula England, and Marshall Meyer, "The Revival of Economic Sociology," pp. 1-32, in Mauro F. Guillén, Randall Collins, Paula England, and Marshall Meyer (eds.), ''New Economic Sociology: The Developments in an Emerging Field''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2002, p. 5.</ref>

===The comparative method===
Smelser wrote some important early works on the comparative method in the social sciences.<ref>Neil J. Smelser, “Notes on the Methodology of Comparative Analysis of Economic Activity.” ''Social Science Information'' 6(2-3) 1967: 7-21; Neil J. Smelser, ''Comparative Methods in the Social Sciences''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1976.</ref> In ''Comparative Methods in the Social Sciences'' (1976), Smelser shows how classic studies of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Émile Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber]] relied on the comparative method.

Smelser's work on the comparative method influenced a key text on the comparative method by [[Arend Lijphart]].<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, “Arend Lijphart: Political Institutions, Divided Societies, and Consociational Democracy,” pp. 234-72, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p. 263.</ref>
