'''James Douglas Montgomery''' (born April 13, 1963) is professor of [[sociology]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in economics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He has applied game-theoretic models and non-monotonic logic to present formal analysis and description of social theories and sociological phenomena. He was the recipient of James Coleman Award (1999) for his paper “Toward a Role-Theoretic Conception of Embeddedness”. His paper is a major contribution towards formalization of social theories and sociological interpretation of game theories since he presents a repeated-game model in which the players are not individuals (as traditionally conceived in economic models) but assume social roles such as a profit-maximizing "businessperson" and nonstrategic "friend" (Montgomery, 1999).

In the early 1990s, Montgomery contributed to economic theories of network structures in labor market. In 1991, Montgomery incorporated network structures in an [[adverse selection]] model to analyze the effects of social networks on [[labor market]] outcomes.<ref>Montgomery, J.D. (1991). “Social Networks and Labor-Market Outcomes: Toward an Economic Analysis”, ''American Economic Review'', '''81''' (Dec.): 1408-18.</ref> In 1992, Montgomery explored the role of “weak ties”, which he defined as non-frequent and transitory social relations, in labor market.<ref>Montgomery, J.D. (1992). “Job Search and Network Composition: Implications of the Strength-of-Weak-Ties Hypothesis”, ''American Sociological Review'', '''57''' (Oct.): 586-96.</ref><ref>Montgomery, J.D. (1994). “Weak Ties, Employment, and Inequality: An Equilibrium Analysis”, ''American Journal of Sociology'', '''99''' (Mar.): 1212-36.</ref> He demonstrates that weak ties are positively related to higher wages and higher aggregate employment rates.

He is currently{{when|date=April 2013}} working on integrating non-monotonic logic with social network analysis in the context of sociological theories.
