Moravcsik's "liberal intergovernmentalist" theory of European integration is widely regarded as a plausible account of the emergence and evolution of the European Union. It stresses the issue-specific functional national interests of member states and goes on to analyze the interstate bargains they strike among themselves and the rational incentive to construct institutions to render enforcement and elaboration of those bargains credible.<ref name="princeton.edu">"[https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/intergovernmentalism.pdf Liberal Intergovernmentalism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202902/http://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/intergovernmentalism.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}," in Antje Wiener and Thomas Diez, eds.

Regarding international relations theory more generally, Moravcsik adheres to "liberal" theory: he seeks to explain state behavior with reference to variation in the underlying social purposes (substantive "preferences" or "fundamental national interests," material or ideational) that states derive from their embeddedness in an interdependent domestic and transnational civil society.<ref name="princeton.edu" /><ref>"[https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/preferences.pdf Taking Preferences Seriously: A Liberal Theory of International Politics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111600/http://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/preferences.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}" ''International Organization'' (Autumn 1997) Retrieved on 2009-06-28</ref> In contrast to realist, institutionalist, and various types of "constructivist" or "non-rational" theory, liberal theory privileges and directly theorizes social interdependence and globalization as the dominant force in world politics, past and present. Liberal theory, Moravcsik maintains, is not empirically sufficient to explain all of international relations, but it is analytically more fundamental than other types of international relations theory.

Moravcsik advocates greater transparency and replicability of textual, qualitative and historical research in international relations, political science, and the social sciences more generally. To this end, he has proposed the use of "active citation" the use of precise footnotes hyperlinked to source material contained in an appendix or on a permanent qualitative data repository.<ref name="princeton2">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/ps.pdf|date=22 December 2009|title=Active Citation: A Precondition for Replicable Qualitative Research Andrew Moravcsik, Princeton University|accessdate=2015-01-03|archive-date=2015-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134509/http://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/ps.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> He has worked with other scholars to extend this approach through the "Annotation for Transparent Inquiry" (ATI) initiative.<ref name="ATI">{{Cite web|url=https://qdr.syr.edu/ati|title=Annotation for Transparent Inquiry (ATI) at a Glance|first=Qualitative Data|last=Repository|date=February 10, 2017|website=QDR|access-date=March 14, 2021|archive-date=November 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124042805/https://qdr.syr.edu/ati|url-status=live}}</ref> Moravcsik's book ''The Choice for Europe'' was criticized for imprecise and misleading use of historical sources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lieshout|first1=Robert H.|last2=Segers|first2=Mathieu L.
