Arlen|publisher=MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UahAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA159|page=159|year=2006|isbn= 978-0-374-53012-9}}</ref>) means "land of the Turks". [[Middle English]] usage of ''Turkye'' is evidenced in an early work by [[Chaucer]] called ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' (c. 1369). The phrase ''land of Torke'' is used in the 15th-century [[The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul|Digby Mysteries]]. Later usages can be found in the [[William Dunbar|Dunbar poems]], the 16th century ''[[Manipulus Vocabulorum]]'' (''Turkie'') and [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''Sylva Sylvarum'' (''Turky''). The modern spelling ''Turkey'' dates back to at least 1719.<ref>{{Cite OED|Turkey}}</ref>

The [[Seljuq dynasty|House of Seljuk]] originated from the ''[[Kınık (tribe)|Kınık]]'' branch of the [[Oghuz Turks]] who resided on the periphery of the [[Muslim history#Abbasids - "Islamic Golden Age"|Muslim world]], in the [[Oghuz Yabgu State|Yabgu Khaganate]] of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea]]s, in the 9th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Al Hind: The Making of the Indo Islamic World, Vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, 7th–11th Centuries|first=Andre|last=Wink|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=1990|isbn=978-90-04-09249-5|page=21}}</ref> In the 10th century, the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into [[Persia]], which became the administrative core of the [[Seljuk Empire|Great Seljuk Empire]], after its foundation by [[Tughril]].<ref name=peter.mackenzie.org>{{cite web|title=The Seljuk Turks|url=http://peter.mackenzie.org/history/hist2021.htm|website=peter.mackenzie.org|access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [[medieval Armenia]] and the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], starting the [[Turkification]] process in the area; the Turkish language and [[Islam]] were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from a predominantly [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly [[Muslim]] and Turkish-speaking one was underway. The [[Mevlevi Order]] of [[dervishes]], which was established in [[Konya]] during the 13th century by [[Sufi]] poet [[Celaleddin Rumi]], played a significant role in the [[Islamization]] of the diverse people of Anatolia who had previously been [[Hellenized]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davison|first1=Roderic H.|title=Essays in Ottoman and Turkish History, 1774–1923: The Impact of the West|date=2013|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75894-0|pages=3–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQvUAAAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Katherine Swynford Lambton|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Bernard|title=The Cambridge history of Islam|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] at the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]], causing the Seljuk Empire's power to slowly disintegrate. In its wake, one of the [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish principalities]] governed by [[Osman I]] would evolve over the next 200 years into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by [[Fall of Constantinople|capturing its capital, Constantinople]], in 1453: their commander thenceforth being known as [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].

In 1514, Sultan [[Selim I]] (1512–1520) successfully expanded the empire's southern and eastern borders by defeating Shah [[Ismail I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]]. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]] and [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|Egypt]], and created a naval presence in the [[Red Sea]]. Subsequently, a contest started between the Ottoman and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires to become the dominant sea power in the [[Indian Ocean]], with [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|a number of naval battles]] in the Red Sea, the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat to the Ottoman monopoly over the [[Silk Road|ancient trade routes]] between [[East Asia]] and [[Western Europe]]. Despite the increasingly prominent European presence, the Ottoman Empire's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya |editor-last=İnalcık |editor-first=Halil |editor2=Donald Quataert |title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1914 |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |page=507 |chapter=Crisis and Change, 1590–1699 |isbn=978-0-521-57456-3}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law.

The empire was often at odds with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in its steady advance towards [[Central Europe]] through the [[Balkans]] and the southern part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|author=Stanford J.

The [[Ottoman Navy]] contended with several Holy Leagues, such as those in [[Holy League (1538)|1538]], [[Holy League (1571)|1571]], [[Holy League (1684)|1684]] and [[Holy League (1717)|1717]] (composed primarily of [[Habsburg Spain]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], the [[Papal States]], the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]), for the control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

In the east, the Ottomans were often at war with Safavid Persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Short History of the Middle East|first=George E.|last=Kirk|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=2008|page=58|isbn=978-1-4437-2568-2}}</ref> The [[Ottoman-Persian Wars|Ottoman wars with Persia]] continued as the [[Zand dynasty|Zand]], [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties succeeded the Safavids in Iran, until the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1821–1823)|first half of the 19th century]].

From the 16th to the early 20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire also [[Russo-Turkish Wars|fought twelve wars]] with the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsardom]] and [[Russian Empire|Empire]]. These were initially about Ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern Europe; but starting from the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]], they became more about the survival of the Ottoman Empire, which had begun to lose its strategic territories on the northern [[Black Sea]] coast to the advancing Russians.

In the [[Second Balkan War]] (1913) the Ottomans managed to recover their former capital [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) and its surrounding areas in [[East Thrace]], which was formalised with the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1913)]]. The 1913 coup d'état effectively put the country under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], making sultans [[Mehmed V]] and [[Mehmed VI]] largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power.

The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. The Ottomans successfully defended the [[Dardanelles]] strait during the [[Gallipoli campaign]] (1915–1916) and achieved initial victories against British forces in the first two years of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], such as the [[Siege of Kut]] (1915–1916); but the [[Arab Revolt]] (1916–1918) turned the tide against the Ottomans in the Middle East. In the [[Caucasus campaign]], however, the Russian forces had the upper hand from the beginning, especially after the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] (1914–1915). Russian forces advanced into northeastern Anatolia and controlled the major cities there until retreating from World War I with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] following the [[Russian Revolution]] (1917).

The [[occupation of Constantinople|occupation of Istanbul]] (1918) and [[Occupation of Smyrna|İzmir]] (1919) by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the establishment of the [[Turkish National Movement]]. Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] [[Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920).<ref name="Atatürk">{{Cite book|title=Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey|first=Andrew|last=Mango|publisher=Overlook|year=2000|isbn=978-1-58567-011-6|page=lxxviii}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Turkey}}
{{Further|Regions of Turkey|NUTS of Turkey}}

Turkey has a [[unitary state|unitary]] structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey does not have a [[federalism|federal]] system, and the provinces are subordinate to the [[central government]] in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (''vali'') and town governors (''kaymakam''). Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors (''belediye başkanı'') or elected by constituents.<ref name=justice.gov.tr>{{cite web|title=General Structure of Turkish Public Administration|url=http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|website=justice.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|access-date=14 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321203401/http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2015}}</ref> Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (''belediye meclisi'') for decision-making on municipal issues. 

Within this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 [[Provinces of Turkey|provinces]] (''il'' or ''vilayet'') for administrative purposes. Each province is divided into [[Districts of Turkey|districts]] (''ilçe''), for a total of 973 districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx|title=Ministry of Internal Affairs: Administrative Units in Turkey|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> Turkey is also subdivided into 7 [[Geographical regions of Turkey|regions]] (''bölge'') and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division.

A [[presidential system]] was adopted by [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|referendum in 2017]]; the new system came into effect with the [[2018 Turkish presidential election|presidential election in 2018]] and gives the President complete control of the [[executive (government)|executive]], including the power to issue decrees, appoint his own cabinet, draw up the budget, dissolve parliament by calling early elections, and make appointments to the bureaucracy and the courts.<ref name="EconPres2018">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/06/30/erdogan-inaugurates-a-new-political-era-in-turkey|title=Recep Tayyip the First: Erdogan inaugurates a new political era in Turkey|newspaper=The Economist|date=28 June 2018}}</ref> The office of [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] has been abolished and its powers (together with those of the [[Cabinet of Turkey|Cabinet]]) have been transferred to the President, who is the [[head of state]] and is elected for a five-year term by direct elections.<ref name="EconPres2018"/> [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] is the first president elected by direct voting.

Executive power is exercised by the President, while the [[legislature|legislative]] power is vested in the unicameral parliament, called the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The [[judiciary]] is nominally independent from the executive and the legislature, but the constitutional changes that came into effect with the referendums in [[2007 Turkish constitutional referendum|2007]], [[2010 Turkish constitutional referendum|2010]] and 2017 gave larger powers to the President and the [[ruling party]] for appointing or dismissing [[judge]]s and [[prosecutor]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44574919|title=Turkey elections: How powerful will the next Turkish president be?|publisher=BBC|author=Chris Morris|date=22 June 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref> The [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]] is charged with ruling on the conformity of [[Legal System in the Republic of Turkey|laws and decrees]] with the constitution.

[[Judicial system of Turkey|Turkey's judicial system]] has been wholly integrated with the [[Law in Europe|system of continental Europe]].{{Clarify|reason="Has been" is confusing as not clear whether still integrated. Should this be "used to"? As not integrated with EU law now.|date=March 2020}} For instance, the [[Turkish civil code (1926)|Turkish Civil Code]] has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the [[Swiss Civil Code]] and [[Swiss Code of Obligations|Code of Obligations]], and the [[Law of Germany|German Commercial Code]]. The Administrative Code bears similarities with its [[Law of France|French counterpart]], and the Penal Code with its [[Italian law codes|Italian counterpart]].<ref name=mymerhaba.com>{{cite web|title=Turkish Legal System|url=http://www.mymerhaba.com/Turkish-Legal-System-in-Turkey-213.html|website=mymerhaba.com/|access-date=14 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922212352/http://www.mymerhaba.com/Turkish-Legal-System-in-Turkey-213.html|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers. In line with this principle, judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation. The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors, the profession of judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the [[Turkish Constitution]].<ref name=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr>{{cite web|title=The Judicial System of Turkey|url=http://www.uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/THE_JUDICIAL_SYSTEM_OF_TURKEY_AND_ORGANISATION_OF_THE_MINISTRY_OF_JUSTICE.pdf|website=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|access-date=14 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211859/http://www.uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/THE_JUDICIAL_SYSTEM_OF_TURKEY_AND_ORGANISATION_OF_THE_MINISTRY_OF_JUSTICE.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, duties and jurisdiction of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts, and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.<ref name=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr />

[[Law enforcement in Turkey]] is carried out by several agencies under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministery of Internal Affairs]]. These agencies are the [[General Directorate of Security (Turkey)|General Directorate of Security]], the [[Gendarmerie General Command]] and the [[Coast Guard Command (Turkey)|Coast Guard Command]]. Furthermore, there are other law enforcement agencies with specific ([[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]], General Directorate of Customs Protection, etc.) or local (Village guards, Municipal Police, etc.) assignments that are under the jurisdiction of the president or different ministries.{{cn|date=September 2021}}

In the years of government by the AKP and Erdoğan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the Turkish judiciary has increasingly been said to be in doubt by institutions, parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of Turkey; due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors, and in their pursuit of public duty.<ref name=EU2015>{{cite web|url=http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/5%20Ekim/2015_turkey_report.pdf|title=European Commission: Turkey 2015 report|work=European Commission|date=10 November 2015|access-date=6 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818052601/http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/5%20Ekim/2015_turkey_report.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=EP2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-2016-0133+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title=European Parliament resolution of 14 April 2016 on the 2015 report on Turkey|work=European Parliament|date=14 April 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=TI2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/turkeys_institutions_are_failing_to_comply_with_good_governance_principles|title=Turkey's institutions are failing to comply with good governance principles and combat corruption|work=Transparency International|date=7 April 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/zaman-newspaper-turkey-free-speech-477859|title=As ISIS attacks mount, Turkey steps up its war on free speech|magazine=Newsweek|date=6 July 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref> The ''Turkey 2015 report'' of the [[European Commission]] stated that "the independence of the judiciary and respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and prosecutors have been under strong political pressure."<ref name=EU2015 />

[[File:Climate diagram of Turkey (Sensoy, S. et al, 2008).png|thumb|Climate diagram of Turkey<ref name="Meteo" />]]

The coastal areas bordering the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry [[summer]]s and cool to cold, wet winters.<ref name=Meteo /> Snow falls on the coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in no more than a few days.<ref name=Meteo /> However, snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.<ref name=Meteo />

Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian [[plateau]] of the interior of Turkey a [[continental climate]] with sharply contrasting [[seasons]].<ref name=Meteo />

Winters on the Anatolian plateau are especially severe. Temperatures of −30&nbsp;°C to −40&nbsp;°C (−22&nbsp;°F to −40&nbsp;°F) do occur in northeastern Anatolia, and snow may lie on the ground for at least 120 days of the year, and during the entire year on the summits of the highest mountains. In central Anatolia the temperatures can drop below -20&nbsp;°C ( -4&nbsp;°F) with the mountains being even colder.

In the late 19th century, human figure in the Western sense was being established in Turkish painting, especially with [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] (1842–1910). [[Impressionism]], among the contemporary trends, appeared later on with [[Halil Pasha (painter)|Halil Pasha]] (c.1857–1939).

The young Turkish artists sent to Europe in 1926 came back inspired by contemporary trends such as [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Expressionism]], still very influential in Europe. The later "Group D" of artists led by [[Abidin Dino]], [[Cemal Tollu]], [[Fikret Mualla]], [[Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid|Fahrünnisa Zeid]], [[Bedri Rahmi Eyuboglu|Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu]], [[Adnan Coker|Adnan Çoker]] and [[Burhan Doğançay]] introduced some trends that had lasted in the West for more than three decades. 

Other important movements in Turkish painting were the "Yeniler Grubu" (The Newcomers Group) of the late 1930s; the "On'lar Grubu" (Group of Ten) of the 1940s; the "Yeni Dal Grubu" (New Branch Group) of the 1950s; and the "Siyah Kalem Grubu" (Black Pen Group) of the 1960s.<ref name=turkresmi.com>{{cite web|title="10'Lar' Grubu", "Yenı Dal Grubu", "Sıyah Kalem Grubu"|url=http://www.turkresmi.com/klasorler/10lar_yenidal_siyahkalem/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908221749/http://www.turkresmi.com/klasorler/10lar_yenidal_siyahkalem/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2006|website=turkresmi.com|access-date=11 August 2014}}</ref>

[[Turkish carpet|Carpet (''halı'')]] and [[kilim|tapestry (''kilim'')]] [[weaving]] is a traditional Turkish art form with roots in pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of weaving carpets and tapestries in Turkey has integrated numerous cultural traditions. Apart from the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] design patterns that are prevalent, traces of [[Persian carpet|Persian]] and [[Byzantine silk#Tapestry and embroidery|Byzantine]] patterns can also be detected. There are also similarities with the patterns used in Armenian, Caucasian and Kurdish carpet designs. The arrival of Islam in Central Asia and the development of [[Islamic art]] also influenced Turkic patterns in the medieval period. The history of the designs, motifs and ornaments used in Turkish carpets and tapestries thus reflects the political and ethnic history of the Turks and the cultural diversity of [[Anatolia]]. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brueggemann |first1=Werner |last2=Boehmer |first2=Harald |title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien = Carpets of the Peasants and Nomads in Anatolia |date=1982 |publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten |location=Munich|isbn=978-3-921811-20-7 |pages=34–39 |edition=1st}}</ref>

[[Ottoman miniature]] is linked to the [[Persian miniature]] tradition, as well as strong [[Chinese painting#Late imperial China (1368–1895)|Chinese]] artistic influences. The words ''tasvir'' or ''nakış'' were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called ''nakkaşhane''.<ref name="miniature1">{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Michael|title=Figurative art in medieval Islam and the riddle of Bihzâd of Herât (1465–1535)|isbn=978-2-08-030421-6|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBIVAQAAIAAJ|access-date=11 February 2017|year=2004}}</ref> The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called ''tahrir'') with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of depth. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, more illustrations than standalone works of art.<ref name="turkishculture.org2">{{cite web|title=Turkish Miniatures|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/traditional-arts/miniatures-563.htm|website=www.turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

The earliest examples of [[Turkish paper marbling]], called ''[[Paper marbling|ebru]]'' in Turkish, are said to be a copy of the ''Hâlnâme'' by the poet Arifî. The text of this manuscript was rendered in a delicate cut paper découpage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in 1540, and features many marbled and decorative paper borders. One early master by the [[pseudonym]] of ''Şebek'' is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the ''Tertib-i Risâle-i Ebrî'', which is dated based on internal evidence to after 1615. The instructions for several ''ebru'' techniques in the text are accredited to this master. Another famous 18th-century master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing motifs and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India appears to contradict some of these reports. Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as ''hatip'' designs in Turkey today.<ref name="turkishculture.org3">{{cite web|title=The Turkish Art of Marbling (EBRU)|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/traditional-arts/marbling-113.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

[[Turkish literature]] is a mix of cultural influences. Interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts.<ref name=ottomus>{{cite web|title=Ottoman Music|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/music/classical/ottoman-music-474.htm?type=1|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=18 February 2015}}</ref> [[Turkish literature]] was heavily influenced by [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Arabic literature]] during most of the Ottoman era. 

The [[Tanzimat]] reforms of the 19th century introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the [[novel]] and the [[short story]]. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|Nâmık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''İntibâh'' (Awakening), while the journalist [[İbrahim Şinasi|Şinasi]] has written, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy "''Şair Evlenmesi''" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyat-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i Âtî'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Millî Edebiyat'' (National Literature) movement. 

[[File:Orhan Pamuk.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]]-laureate Turkish novelist [[Orhan Pamuk]] and his [[Turkish Angora|Turkish Angora cat]] at his personal writing space]]

The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by [[Nâzım Hikmet Ran|Nâzım Hikmet]], who introduced the [[free verse]] style. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the [[Garip]] movement led by [[Orhan Veli Kanık|Orhan Veli]], [[Oktay Rıfat Horozcu|Oktay Rıfat]] and [[Melih Cevdet Anday|Melih Cevdet]]. The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised, for example, in the form of the "new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures" enacted in the novels of [[Orhan Pamuk]], recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=12 October 2006}}</ref>

The origin of [[Turkish theatre]] dates back to ancient pagan rituals and oral legends. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. In time, the ancient rituals, myths, legends and stories evolved into theatrical shows. Starting from the 11th-century, the traditions of the Seljuk Turks blended with those of the indigenous peoples of Anatolia and the interaction between diverse cultures paved the way for new plays.

After the [[Tanzimat]] (Reformation) period in the 19th century, characters in Turkish theatre were modernised and plays were performed on European-style stages, with actors wearing European costumes. Following the [[Second Constitutional Era|restoration of constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected at the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, [[Darülbedayi|Darülbedayi-i Osmani]] (which became the nucleus of the [[Istanbul City Theatres]]) was established in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Numerous Turkish playwrights emerged in this era; some of them wrote on romantic subjects, while others were interested in social problems, and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. The first Turkish musicals were also written in this period. In time, Turkish women began to appear on stage, which was an important development in the late Ottoman society. Until then, female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey's ethnic minorities. Today there are numerous private theatres in the country, together with those which are subsidised by the government, such as the [[Turkish State Theatres]].<ref name="turkishculture.org4">{{cite web|title=Traditional Theatre|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/performing-arts/theatre-36.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the [[Seljuk Turks]] migrated to [[Anatolia]] and [[Persia]] in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for [[Westernization]].<ref name="soundsofanatolia">{{cite book|author=Stokes, Martin|title=Sounds of Anatolia|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2000|isbn=978-1-85828-636-5}}, pp. 396–410.</ref>

With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Music of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Music of Albania|Albanian]], [[Music of Poland|Polish]] and [[Jewish]] communities, among others.<ref name="lesartsturcs">{{cite web|url=http://www.lesartsturcs.com/|title=History of music in Turkey|work=Les Arts Turcs |date=1 May 1999}}</ref>

Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Despite this however, western music styles like [[pop music]] and [[Kanto (music)|kanto]] lost popularity to [[arabesque]] in the late 1970s and 1980s. It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With the support of [[Sezen Aksu]], the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as [[Ajda Pekkan]], [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]] and [[Sertab Erener]]. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative [[Turkish rock music|Turkish rock]], [[electronica]], [[Turkish hip hop|hip-hop]], [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[dance music]] in opposition to the mainstream corporate [[pop music|pop]] and [[Arabesque music|arabesque]] genres, which many believe have become too commercial.<ref name="musicscene">{{cite web|url=http://tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com/2006/02/istanbul-music-scene.html|title=Istanbul Music Scene|work=Yildirim, Ali.

The Byzantine era is usually dated from 330 AD, when Constantine the Great moved the Roman capital to Byzantium, which became Constantinople, until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1453. Its architecture dramatically influenced the later medieval architecture throughout Europe and the Near East, and became the primary progenitor of the Renaissance and Ottoman architectural traditions that followed its collapse. When the [[Roman Empire]] went Christian (as well as Eastwards) with its new capital at [[Constantinople]], its architecture became more sensuous and more ambitious. This new style would come to be known as Byzantine with increasingly exotic domes and ever-richer mosaics, traveled west to Ravenna and Venice and as far north as Moscow.

The [[Seljuk architecture|architecture of the Seljuk Turks]] combined the elements and characteristics of the [[Architecture of Central Asia|Turkic architecture of Central Asia]] with those of [[Persian architecture|Persian]], [[Arab architecture|Arab]], [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] architecture. The transition from Seljuk architecture to [[Ottoman architecture]] is most visible in [[Bursa]], which was the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman State]] between 1335 and 1413. Following the [[Fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul)]] in 1453, Ottoman architecture was significantly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul is one of the most famous examples of [[classical Ottoman architecture]] and was the primary residence of the [[Ottoman Sultan]]s for approximately 400 years.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/center-of-ottoman-power.html|title=Center of Ottoman Power|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Simons|first=Marlise|access-date=4 June 2009|date=22 August 1993}}</ref> [[Mimar Sinan]] (c.1489–1588) was the most important architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture. He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings that were constructed in various [[eyalet|provinces]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cadde.milliyet.com.tr/2013/12/30/HaberDetay/1656832/iSTANBUL_A_iMZASINI_ATTI|title=A list of the buildings designed by Mimar Sinan|access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by European styles, and this can be particularly seen in the [[Tanzimat]] era buildings of Istanbul like the [[Dolmabahçe Palace|Dolmabahçe]], [[Çırağan Palace|Çırağan]], [[Feriye Sarayları|Feriye]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi]], [[Küçüksu Palace|Küçüksu]], [[Ihlamur Palace|Ihlamur]] and [[Yıldız Palace|Yıldız]] [[palace]]s, which were all designed by members of the [[Balyan family]] of Ottoman Armenian court architects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Ottoman Architecture|first=Godfrey|last=Goodwin|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2003|isbn=978-0-500-27429-3}}</ref> The Ottoman era [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] on the [[Bosphorus]] also reflect the fusion between classical Ottoman and European architectural styles during the aforementioned period.

The [[First National Architectural Movement]] in the early 20th century sought to create a new architecture, which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The leading architects of this movement were [[Vedat Tek]] (1873–1942), [[Mimar Kemaleddin Bey]] (1870–1927), [[Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu]] (1888–1982) and Giulio Mongeri (1873–1953).<ref name=turkisharch>{{cite web|title=Turkish Architecture in the Republican Period |url=http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/turkish-architecture-in-the-republican-period_6.html |website=archmuseum.org |access-date=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318163506/http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/turkish-architecture-in-the-republican-period_6.html |archive-date=18 March 2015 }}</ref> Buildings from this era are the [[Istanbul Main Post Office|Grand Post Office]] in Istanbul (1905–1909), [[Tayyare Apartments]] (1919–1922),<ref name="tayyare">{{cite web|url=http://www.atelyemim.com/mimari/ramada_eng.html|title=Tayyare Apartment Building|publisher =AtelyeMim.com|access-date=2 February 2012}}</ref> [[Istanbul 4th Vakıf Han]] (1911–1926),<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/7839332|publisher=Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi-Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü|title=XIX.

[[Turkish cuisine]] is largely the heritage of [[Ottoman cuisine]]. In the early years of the Republic, a few studies were published about regional Anatolian dishes but cuisine did not feature heavily in Turkish folkloric studies until the 1980s, when the fledgling tourism industry encouraged the Turkish state to sponsor two food symposia. The papers submitted at the symposia presented the history of Turkish cuisine on a "historical continuum" that dated back to Turkic origins in Central Asia and continued through the Seljuk and Ottoman periods.<ref name=berg>{{Cite book| publisher = Berg| isbn = 978-0-85785-217-5| last1 = Claflin| first1 = Kyri W.| last2 = Scholliers| first2 = Peter| title = Writing Food History: A Global Perspective| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WUDAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1980 |year=2013}}</ref>

Many of the papers presented at these first two symposia were unreferenced. Prior to the symposia, the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularised by the publication of Süheyl Ünver's ''Fifty Dishes in Turkish History'' in 1948. This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of [[Mehmet II]]. Following the publication of Ünver's book subsequent studies were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin Ögel about the [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] origins of Turkish cuisine.<ref name=berg />

[[Ottoman cuisine]] contains elements of [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Kurdish cuisine|Kurdish]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] and [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] cuisines.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-61069-389-9| last = Kia| first = Mehrdad| title = The Ottoman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]|year=2017|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgUmDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA4}}</ref> The country's position between Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks in gaining complete control of the major [[trade route]]s, and an ideal landscape and climate allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s six hundred-year reign. [[Yogurt]] salads, fish in [[olive oil]], [[sharbat|sherbet]] and [[dolma|stuffed and wrapped vegetables]] became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from [[Austria]] and [[Ukraine]] to [[Arabia]] and [[North Africa]], used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and Western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.<ref name="foodbycountry.com">{{cite web|title=Food in Turkey – Turkish Food, Turkish Cuisine |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Spain-to-Zimbabwe-Cumulative-Index/Turkey.html|website=foodbycountry.com|access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>
