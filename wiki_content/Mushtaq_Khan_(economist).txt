==Work==

==='Good governance' and 'transformation potential'===
Khan's research has produced notable contributions to heterodox [[institutionalist political economy|institutional political economy]]; in particular, he subjects what he terms the "''[[good governance]]'' consensus" of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods institutions]] and many [[non-governmental organisations]] to a thorough critique. In several publications, he challenges the belief that the elimination of [[economic rent|rents]], [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[rent seeking|rent-seeking behaviour]] as well as [[democratisation]] and [[decentralisation]] represent the ''precondition'' for successful development.<ref>Khan, M. H., 1995. "State Failure in the Weak States: A Critique of New Institutionalist Explanations". In: Harriss, J., Hunter, J., and Lewis, C., eds. ''New Institutional Economics and Third World Development''. London: Routledge.</ref><ref>Khan, M., 1998. "Patron-Client Networks and the Economic Effects of Corruption in Asia". ''European Journal of Development Research'' 10 (1): 15-39.</ref><ref>Khan, M. H., and Jomo, K. S., eds. 2000. ''Rents, Rent-Seeking and Economic Development: Theory and Evidence in Asia.'' Cambridge: Cambridge UP.</ref><ref>Khan, M. H., 2005. "Markets, States and Democracy: Patron-Client Networks and the Case for Democracy in Developing Countries". ''Democratization'' 12 (5): 705-25.</ref> According to him, there is no historical evidence for this sequencing; indeed, he claims that all evidence suggests opposite [[causality|causal direction]], so that 'good governance' is the ''outcome'', rather than the cause, for growth.

Instead, he emphasizes the importance of ''transformation potential'', that is the capacity of states to transform rent-seeking behaviour into uses which are conducive to growth.<ref>Khan, M. H., 2004. "Evaluating the Emerging Palestinian State - 'Good Governance' versus 'Transformation Potential'". In: Khan, Giacaman, and Amundsen. ''State Formation in Palestine - Viability and Governance During a Social Transformation''. London: Routledge.</ref> On this account, notable examples include [[Four Asian Tigers|Taiwan and South Korea]] where states intervened heavily and used [[patronage|patron-client relationships]] in order to further growth.
