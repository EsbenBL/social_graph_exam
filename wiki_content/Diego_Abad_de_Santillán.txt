'''Diego Abad de Santillán''' (May 20, 1897 – October 18, 1983), born '''Sinesio Vaudilio García Fernández''', was an [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] [[activist]], [[Anarchist economics|economist]], [[author]], and a leading figure in the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[anarchism|anarchist movements]].<ref name=accumulation />{{rp|45}}

==Early years==
Born in 1897 in [[Reyero]], a mountain village in the province of [[León (province)|León]] in northwestern Spain, Santillán emigrated with his parents at the age of eight to [[Argentina]]. When he was ten years old, he attended night school while working during the day at a variety of jobs, in particular on the railways. He returned to Spain in 1912 to study for his baccalaureate in León before entering the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] in 1915 to read philosophy and literature. After the [[Anarchism in Spain#General Strike of 1917|General Strike of 1917]], he was imprisoned in [[Madrid]] where he came into contact with the anarchist movement through Tomás Herreros. After release under amnesty in 1918, Santillán returned to Argentina and worked as an activist for the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] ''[[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation|Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]'' (FORA). He edited its weekly newspaper ''La Protesta''.

==Activism in Germany, Mexico, and Argentina==
In 1922 Santillán represented FORA at the formation of the anarcho-syndicalist [[IWA–AIT|International Workingmen's Association]] (IWMA) in [[Berlin]]; while there he began to study Medicine, and came to know Elise Kater, who was to become his wife. The first of many works on the history and theory of anarchism were published at this time – ''[[Ricardo Flores Magón]]: Apostle of the [[Mexican Revolution|Mexican Social Revolution]]'' and ''Anarchism in the [[Labour Movement]]'' both appeared in 1925.

In 1926 Santillán interrupted his studies to travel to [[Mexico]], where he assisted the [[General Confederation of Workers (Mexico)|Confederación General de Trabajadores]] (CGT). Returning to Argentina, he continued his work for ''La Protesta'', as well as for a new journal, ''La Antorcha'', and completed ''The Anarchist Movement in Argentina: From Its Beginnings to 1910'' (1930). In the late 1920s Santillán was a fierce opponent of the anarchist [[Severino Di Giovanni]], whose advocation of [[propaganda of the deed]] led to a number of deaths.<ref>Fernando López Trujillo [https://web.archive.org/web/20011126013931/http://flag.blackened.net/ias/10bayer.htm An Interview] with [[Osvaldo Bayer]], Argentine Public Intellectual and Social Historian, in ''[[Perspectives on Anarchist Theory]]'', Vol. 5 – No. 2, Fall, 2001 {{in lang|en}}</ref>

When, in 1930, he was condemned to death for sedition, Santillán escaped to [[Uruguay]]. From there he travelled to Spain on the [[Second Spanish Republic|proclamation of the Republic]] in 1931, before returning to Argentina in secrecy to continue his militant activities and writing, including ''The Bankruptcy of the Capitalist Economic and Political System'' (1932), ''The Ideology of FORA and Trajectory of the Revolutionary Labour Movement in Argentina'' (1933) and ''Social Reconstruction: Foundations for a New Economic Structure in Argentina'' (1933). But by the end of 1933, he had returned once again to Spain, settling down in [[Barcelona]].

==The Spanish Revolution==
{{Anarcho-syndicalism sidebar |People}}
The following year, Santillán began work for the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI), becoming, in 1935, secretary to its Peninsular Committee, and editor of ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' and ''Tierra y Libertad''; he also founded three new journals during this period: ''Tiempos Nuevos'', ''Butlletí de la Conselleria d’Economia'' and ''Timón''. After the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Revolution]] in July 1936, he represented the FAI on the Comité de Milícies Antifeixistes de Catalunya, which co-ordinated the various militias in [[Catalonia]] – and which formed, in the early years of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] the ''de facto'' government of Catalonia. Anarchist economic theory seems to have been foremost in his mind at this time, as shown by the appearance of ''The Economic Organism of the Revolution'' (1936), published in the name of the anarchist [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT); this was later to be reissued under the title ''After the Revolution: Economic Reconstruction in Spain Today'' (1937).<ref name=accumulation />{{rp|45}}

Between December 1936 and April 1937 he served as [[Finance minister|Minister of the Economy]] (''Conseller de Economía'') for the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat of Catalonia]], while apparently maintaining anarchist principles of [[Direct democracy|free participation]] in politics. He was especially critical of the government and person of [[Juan Negrín]], and denounced the crimes of the [[Comintern]]-loyal [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|PCE]] (the Spanish Communist Party) in the Civil War. Two more books appeared at this time: ''The Revolution and the War in Spain'' (1938) and a bibliography of Argentine anarchist writings (1938). In April 1938, Santillán joined the National Committee of the Antifascist Popular Front, which formed from the union of the anarchist CNT and the socialist [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] – but with the defeat of the Republic by [[Spain under Franco|Francoist]] forces in 1939, returned via France to Argentina.

==Return to Argentina==
{{Libertarian socialism sidebar}}
From this point on, Santillán lived rather more obscurely, founding several more journals, and continuing his scholarly work, including extensive collaboration on the ''Gran Enciclopedia Argentina'', and critical analyses of the labour movement and [[Peronism]]: ''Why We Lost the War: A Contribution to the History of the Spanish Tragedy'' (1940) – later made into a film by his son, Francisco Galindo –  ''The Crisis of Capitalism and the Mission of the [[Proletariat]]'' (1946), the section on Argentina in ''The Labour Movement: Anarchism and Socialism'' Vol. III (1965), ''Contributions to a History of the Spanish Labour Movement'' (1962–1971), ''From [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]: Notes on the Modern Political History of Spain'' (1974) and ''Strategy and Tactics: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' (1976).

Further unpublished works, ''Ideas y sugestiones para una nueva estrategia revolucionaria'' (''Ideas and Suggestions for a New Revolutionary Strategy'') and ''Delincuencia política'' (''Political Criminality''), along with the rest of his extensive archives, are held in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[International Institute of Social History]].

==Final years==
Santillán returned to [[History of Spain (1975-present)|post-Franco Spain]] in 1977, at the age of 80, settling once again in Barcelona, and producing a final memoir, ''Memorias 1897–1936'' (1977). He died in Barcelona on October 18, 1983.
