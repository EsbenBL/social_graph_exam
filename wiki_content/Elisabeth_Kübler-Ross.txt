'''Elisabeth Kübler-Ross''' (July 8, 1926 – August 24, 2004) was a Swiss-American [[psychiatrist]], a pioneer in [[near-death studies]], and author of the internationally best-selling book, ''[[On Death and Dying]]'' (1969), where she first discussed her theory of the five stages of grief, also known as the "[[Kübler-Ross model]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224074917/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 24, 2009|title= Milestones |date=Aug 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}</ref>

Kübler-Ross was a 2007 inductee into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&id=222|title= Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|publisher=National Women's Hall of Fame |work=Women of the Hall| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301050227/http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php/?action=viewone&id=222 | archive-date=1 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of the "100 Most Important Thinkers" of the 20th century<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc799085/|title=Obituaries: Elisabeth Kubler-Ross|date=2004|website=Journal of Near Death Studies}}</ref> and was the recipient of nineteen honorary degrees. By July 1982, Kübler-Ross taught 125,000 students in death and dying courses in colleges, seminaries, medical schools, hospitals, and social-work institutions.<ref>"Turn on, tune in, drop dead" by Ron Rosenbaum, ''[[Harper's]]'', July 1982, pages 32–42</ref> In 1970, she delivered an [[The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality|Ingersoll Lecture]] at [[Harvard University]] on the theme ''On Death and Dying''.

==Early life and education==
Elisabeth Kübler was born on July 8, 1926, in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, into a Protestant Christian Family. She was one of a set of [[multiple birth|triplet]]s, two of whom were identical.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gill|first=Derek|date=1980|title=Quest: The Life of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross|location=United States of America|publisher=Harper & Row|pages=2–3|isbn=0-06-011543-2}}</ref> Her life was jeopardized due to complications weighing only 2 pounds at birth, but says she survived due to her mother's love and attentiveness.<ref>Newman, Laura. [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/329/7466/627.pdf Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]. (2004). ''British Medical Journal, 329 (7466),'' 627. Retrieved November 17, 2006.</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=October 14, 203|title=Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|url=https://cfmedicine.nlm.nih.gov/physicians/biography_189.html|access-date=December 11, 2020|website=Changing the Face of Medicine}}</ref> Elisabeth later contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized at age 5, during which she had her first experience with death as her roommate died peacefully. Her early experiences with death led her to believe that because death is a necessary stage of life, one must be prepared to face it with dignity and peace.

During World War II, Elisabeth worked as a laboratory assistant for refugees in Zürich at only thirteen years old. Following the war, she did relief work in France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. She would later visit the [[Majdanek concentration camp|Maidanek]] extermination camp in Poland in 1954, which sparked her interest in the power of compassion and resilience of the human spirit. The horror stories of the survivors left permanent impressions on Elisabeth, and led to her decision in dedicating her life to the help and healing of others.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Blaylock|first=B|date=2005|title=In memoriam: Elisabeth kubler-ross, 1926–2004.|journal=Families, Systems, & Health|volume=23|pages=108–109|doi=10.1037/1091-7527.23.1.108|via=EBSCO}}</ref> She was also profoundly affected by the images of hundreds of butterflies carved into some of the walls there. To Kübler-Ross, the butterflies—these final works of art by those facing death—stayed with her for years and influenced her thinking about the end of life.<ref name="Auto72-7">{{Cite web|title=Elisabeth Kubler-Ross|url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross|access-date=2020-12-13|website=Biography|language=en-us}}</ref> During this same year, she also became involved with the International Voluntary Service for Peace as an activist.<ref name=":2" />

From a young age, Elisabeth was determined to become a doctor despite her father's efforts in forcing her to become a secretary for his business. She refused him and left home at the age of sixteen.<ref name="Auto72-7"/> After this time she worked to support herself in a variety of jobs, gaining major experience in hospitals while volunteering to provide aid to refugees. Following this she went on to attend the University of Zurich to study medicine and graduated in 1957.

==Personal life==
In 1958, she married a fellow medical student and classmate from America, Emanuel ("Manny") Ross, and moved to the United States. Together, they completed their internships at Long Island's Glen Cove Community Hospital in New York.<ref name=":2" />

==Academic career==
After graduating from the University of Zurich in 1957, Kübler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continue her studies.

She began her psychiatric residency in the [[Manhattan Psychiatric Center|Manhattan State Hospital]] in the early 1960s, and began her career working to create treatment for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title "hopeless patient", a term used at the time to reference terminal patients. These treatment programs would work to restore the patient's sense of dignity and self-respect. Elisabeth also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world.<ref name=":1" />  During this time, Ross was horrified by the neglect and abuse of mental patients as well as the imminently dying.&nbsp;She found that the patients were often treated with little care or completely ignored by the hospital staff. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals. She developed a program that focused on the individual care and attention for each patient.&nbsp;This program worked incredibly well, and resulted in significant improvement in the mental health of 94% of her patients.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth|url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/elisabeth-kblerross/|access-date=2020-12-12|website=National Women's Hall of Fame|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1962, she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. There, Kübler-Ross worked as a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but she wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life.<ref name=":1" /> She states to her students,<blockquote>"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now you'll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to treat them with compassion – the same compassion that you would want for yourself"<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>Kübler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and then moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=":1" />

In November 1969, ''Life'' magazine ran an article on Kübler-Ross,  bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced Kübler-Ross's decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. Kübler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the "greatest mystery in science"—death.<ref name="Auto72-7"/>

During the 1970s Elisabeth became the champion of the world wide hospice movement. She traveled extensively to over twenty countries on six continents initiating various hospices and palliative care programs. In 1970, Kübler-Ross spoke at the prestigious Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard University on the subject of on death and dying. On August 7, 1972 she spoke to the Senate Special Committee on Aging to promote the "Death With Dignity" movement. In 1977, she was named "Woman of the Year" by ''Ladies Home Journal''.

==Healing Center==
Kübler-Ross was one of the central figures in the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Paris|first1=John J.|last2=Cummings|first2=Brian M.|date=2019-12-02|title=Elisabeth Kübler-Ross: A Pioneer Thinker, Influential Teacher and Contributor to Clinical Ethics|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2019.1674549|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics|language=en|volume=19|issue=12|pages=49–51|doi=10.1080/15265161.2019.1674549|pmid=31746716|s2cid=208184496|issn=1526-5161}}</ref>

In 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded "[[Shanti Nilaya]]" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].

In the late 1970s, after interviewing thousands of patients who had died and been resuscitated, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal "entities", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the "spirits". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G. Jackovich. In ''People'', October 29, 1979.</ref> Kubler-Ross' friend Deanna Edwards was invited to attend a service to ascertain whether allegations against Barham were true. He was found to be naked and wearing only a turban when Edwards unexpectedly pulled masking tape off the light switch and flipped on the light.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Playboy Interview with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's' Playboy Magazine, May, 1981</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100131093351/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946362-1,00.html TIME.com], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100323061347/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946362-2,00.html ''The Conversion of Kubler-Ross'', TIME, November 12, 1979]</ref><ref>''Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in the Afterworld of Entities'' by Kate Coleman, New West, 30 July 1979</ref> Despite the accusation of sexual misconduct Kübler-Ross protected him for over a year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rachael|first=Cusick|title=The Queen of Dying {{!}} Radiolab (00:41:33)|url=https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/queen-dying|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-28|website=WNYC Studios|language=en}}</ref> Then she announced the ending of her association with both Marty and Jay Barham in her "Shanti Nilaya Newsletter" (issue 7) on June 7, 1981.

==Investigations on near-death experiences==
Kübler-Ross also dealt with the phenomenon of [[near-death experiences]]. She was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife,<ref name=":1" /> serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS)<ref name=":0" /> Kübler-Ross reported her interviews with the dying for the first time in her book, ''[[On Death and Dying]]: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families'' (1969)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_KHpHlsAM4 ''Video: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross über Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) ''], abgerufen am 14. März 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.wissenschaft.de/home/-/journal_content/56/12054/62660/ ''Bild der Wissenschaft: Sind Nahtod-Erfahrungen Bilder aus dem Jenseits?''] abgerufen am 16. März 2014.</ref> Kübler-Ross went on to write more about near-death experiences (NDEs) in her books, ''On Life After Death'' 1991, and ''The Tunnel and The Light'' 1999.

==AIDS work==
She conducted many [[workshops]] on life, death, grief, and [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In December 1983, she moved both her home and workshop headquarters to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.

One of her greatest wishes was her plan to build a [[hospice]] for abandoned infants and children infected with HIV to give them a lasting home where they could live until their death. Elisabeth attempted to do this in the late 1980's in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In October 1994, she lost her house and many possessions, including photos, journals, and notes, to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>

==Death==
Kübler-Ross suffered a series of strokes between 1987 and 1995 which eventually left her partially paralyzed on her left side; in the meantime "The Healing Waters Farm" and the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Center closed. After the Virginia house fire and subsequent stroke, she moved down to Scottsdale, Arizona in October, 1994. After suffering a larger stroke a few months later she found herself living in a wheelchair and wished to be able to determine her time of death.<ref>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. {{ISBN|9781587613180}}</ref> In 1997 Oprah flew to Arizona to interview her and discuss with Elisabeth if she herself was going through the Five Stages of Grief. Further, in a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a "damned procrastinator."<ref name=":0" /> Elisabeth died, in 2004, at the age of 78 in a nursing home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in the presence of her son, daughter, and two family friends.<ref name=":0" />  She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 2005 her son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Ken Ross]] founded the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona.

== Contributions ==
Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was the first individual to transfigure the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice-care, palliative-care, and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals' lives to the public eye.<ref name=":1" /> Elisabeth was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to "treat the dying with dignity".<ref name=":0" />  Her extensive work with the dying led to the internationally best-selling book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'' in 1969, she proposed the now famous [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The Five Stages of Grief have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike. After 2000 an increasing number of companies began using the Five Stages model to explain reactions to change and loss. This is now known as the Kübler-Ross Change Curve and is used by a large variety of Fortune 500 Companies in the US and internationally. In 2018 Stanford University acquired the Kübler-Ross archives from her family and intends to build a digital library of her papers, interviews and other archival material. The American Journal of Bioethics devoted its entire December 2019 issue to the 50th anniversary of, ''On Death and Dying''. The Elisabeth Kubler-Ross Foundation continues her work through a series of international chapters around the world.

Elisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying, which are now available in 42 languages.<ref name=":0" /> At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring two books with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]] including ''On Grief and Grieving''.<ref name=":0" />
