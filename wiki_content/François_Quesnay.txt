'''François Quesnay''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa kɛnɛ|lang}}; 4 June 1694 – 16 December 1774) was a [[France|French]] [[economist]] and [[physician]] of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school.<ref>Cutler J. Cleveland, [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics "Biophysical economics"], ''Encyclopedia of Earth'', Last updated: 14 September 2006.</ref> He is known for publishing the "[[Tableau économique]]" (Economic Table) in 1758, which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats.<ref>See the biographical note in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) p. 605.</ref> This was perhaps the first work attempting to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought.

==Life==
Quesnay was born at [[Méré, Yvelines|Méré]] near [[Versailles (commune)|Versailles]], the son of an advocate and small landed proprietor. [[Apprenticeship|Apprenticed]] at the age of sixteen to a surgeon, he soon went to Paris, studied medicine and surgery there, and, having qualified as a master-surgeon, settled down to practice at [[Mantes]]. In 1737 he was appointed perpetual secretary of the academy of surgery founded by [[François Gigot de la Peyronie]], and became surgeon in ordinary to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]]. In 1744 he graduated as a doctor of medicine; he became physician in ordinary to the king, and afterwards his first consulting physician, and was installed in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. His apartments were on the ''entresol'', whence the Réunions de l'entresol{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} received their name. Louis XV esteemed Quesnay highly, and used to call him his thinker. When he ennobled him he gave him for arms three flowers of the [[pansy#Name origin and significance|pansy]]<ref name=EB1911/> (derived from ''pensée'', in French meaning ''thought''), with the [[Latin]] [[motto]] ''Propter cogitationem mentis''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taieb.net/auteurs/Quesnay/albon.html |title=Nouvelles Ephemerides, Économiques, Seconde Partie, Analyses, Et Critiques Raisonnées. N° Premier. Éloge Historique De M. Quesnay, Contenant L'Analyse De Ses Ouvrages, Par M. Le Cte D'A*** |publisher=Taieb.net |access-date=16 August 2012}}</ref>

He now devoted himself principally to [[economics|economic studies]], taking no part in the court intrigues which were perpetually going on around him. Around 1750 he became acquainted with [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay|Jacques C. M. V. de Gournay]] (1712–1759), who was also an earnest inquirer in the economic field; and round these two distinguished men was gradually formed the philosophic sect of the Économistes, or, as for distinction's sake they were afterwards called, the Physiocrates. The most remarkable men in this group of disciples were the elder [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] (author of ''L'Ami des hommes'', 1756–60, and ''Philosophie rurale'', 1763), [[Nicolas Baudeau]] (''Introduction a la philosophie économique'', 1771), [[Guillaume-François Le Trosne]] (''De l'ordre social'', 1777), [[André Morellet]] (best known by his controversy with [[Ferdinando Galiani|Galiani]] on the freedom of the grain trade during the [[Flour War]]), [[Pierre-Paul Lemercier de La Rivière de Saint-Médard|Lemercier de La Rivière]], and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|du Pont de Nemours]]. [[Adam Smith]], during his stay on the continent with the young [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]] in 1764–1766, spent some time in Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Quesnay and some of his followers; he paid a high tribute to their scientific services in his ''Wealth of Nations''.<ref name=Smith>Smith, Adam, 1937, The Wealth of Nations, N. Y.: Random House, p. 643; first published 1776.</ref><ref name=EB1911/>

Quesnay was married in 1718 to a woman named Marianne Woodsen, and had a son and a daughter; his grandson by the former was a member of the first Legislative Assembly. He died on 16 December 1774, having lived long enough to see his great pupil, [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], in office as minister of finance.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Works==
[[File:Quesnay Tableau.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tableau économique]]]]
His economic writings are collected in the 2nd vol. of the ''Principaux économistes'', published by Guillaumin, Paris, with preface and notes by Eugène Daire; also his ''Oeuvres économiques et philosophiques'' were collected with an introduction and note by August Oncken (Frankfort, 1888); a facsimile reprint of the ''Tableau économique'', from the original MS., was published by the British Economic Association (London, 1895). His other writings were the article "Évidence" in the ''Encyclopédie'', and ''Recherches sur l'évidence des vérites geometriques'', with a ''Projet de nouveaux éléments de géometrie'', 1773. Quesnay's Eloge was pronounced in the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] by Grandjean de Fouchy (see the Recueil of that Academy, 1774, p.&nbsp;134).

===Economics===
[[File:Quesnay - Tableau economique, 1965 - 5891137.tif|thumb|''Tableau economique'', 1965]]
In 1758 he published the ''[[Tableau économique]]'' (Economic Table), which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats. This was perhaps the first work to attempt to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought.<ref name="O'Hara1999">{{cite book|author=Phillip Anthony O'Hara|title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkO8Z_078GoC&pg=PA848|access-date=21 July 2012|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18718-3|page=848}}</ref>

The publications in which Quesnay expounded his system were the following: two articles, on "Fermiers" (Farmers) and on "Grains", in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1756, 1757);<ref>[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Kafker, Frank A.: ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).'' Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie Année (1990) Volume 8 Numéro 8 p. 112]</ref><ref name=EB1911/> a discourse on the law of nature in the ''Physiocratie'' of Dupont de Nemours (1768); ''Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole'' (1758), and the simultaneously published ''Tableau économique avec son explication, ou extrait des économies royales de [[Maximilien de Bethune, duc de Sully|Sully]]'' (with the celebrated motto, ''Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume; pauvre royaume, pauvre roi''); ''Dialogue sur le commerce et les travaux des artisans''; and other minor pieces.<ref name=EB1911/>

The ''Tableau économique'', though on account of its dryness and abstract form it met with little general favor, may be considered the principal manifesto of the school. It was regarded by the followers of Quesnay as entitled to a place amongst the foremost products of human wisdom, and is named by the elder Mirabeau, in a passage quoted by [[Adam Smith]],<ref name=Smith/> as one of the three great inventions which have contributed most to the stability of political societies, the other two being those of writing and of money. Its object was to exhibit by means of certain formulas the way in which the products of agriculture, which is the only source of wealth, would in a state of perfect liberty be distributed among the several classes of the community (namely, the productive classes of the proprietors and cultivators of land, and the unproductive class composed of manufacturers and merchants), and to represent by other formulas the modes of distribution which take place under systems of Governmental restraint and regulation, with the evil results arising to the whole society from different degrees of such violations of the natural order. It follows from Quesnay's theoretic views that the one thing deserving the solicitude of the practical economist and the statesman is the increase of the net product; and he infers also what Smith afterwards affirmed, on not quite the same ground, that the interest of the landowner is strictly and indissolubly connected with the general interest of the society. A small edition de luxe of this work, with other pieces, was printed in 1758 in the Palace of Versailles under the king's immediate supervision, some of the sheets, it is said, having been pulled by the royal hand. Already in 1767 the book had disappeared from circulation, and no copy of it is now procurable; but, the substance of it has been preserved in the ''Ami des hommes'' of Mirabeau, and the ''Physiocratie'' of Dupont de Nemours.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Quesnay, François|volume=22|pages=742–743|inline=1}}</ref>

===Orientalism and China===
Quesnay is known for his writings on Chinese politics and society. His book ''Le Despotisme de la Chine'', written in 1767, describes his views of the Chinese imperial system.<ref name="OEMF">{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://archive.org/details/orientalismearly00mcca|url-access=limited|date=15 July 2008|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/orientalismearly00mcca/page/n277 271]–72}}<!--|access-date=25 August 2012--></ref> He was supportive of the meritocratic concept of giving scholars political power, without the cumbersome aristocracy that characterized French politics, and the importance of agriculture to the welfare of a nation. Gregory Blue writes that Quesnay "praised China as a constitutional despotism and openly advocated the adoption of Chinese institutions, including a standardized system of taxation and universal education." Blue speculates that this may have influenced the 1793 establishment of the Permanent Settlement in [[Bengal]] by the [[British Empire]].<ref name="CC">{{cite book|author=E. S.

'''<big>On Taxation</big>'''

Quesnay acknowledged three economic classes in France: the "proprietary" class consisting of only landowners, the "productive" class of agricultural workers, and the "sterile" class of merchants. Quesnay saw no benefit to the sterile class and believed the productive to be all important. Quesnay viewed France's agriculture as backward and unproductive compared to Britain during the time he was residing in the Palace of Versailles [13] . Despite residing in the Palace, Quesnay believed agriculture was the heart of the economy and of special importance to him. Quesnay argued that taxes placed on cultivators are only harmful to society as these taxes will reduce the incentive for agricultural production. Taxing proprietors(property holders) does not destroy the means of production meaning there is no decline in output. Quesnay wanted proprietors to bear the full burden of the tax in the country as taxing cultivators is a negative consequence for everyone. Removing incentive from cultivators reduces agricultural production and the agricultural surplus Quesnay believed to be the heart of the economy [14]. Quesnay also opposed indirect taxes in contrast to direct taxes. These "indirect taxes" are placed on the French public by proprietors whose greed demands immunity from taxation. Direct taxes on proprietors has no impact on reproduction and economic decline [14]. Reducing indirect taxes and increasing direct taxes gives the French a surplus of agriculture and the funding the country needs. However, this opinion was not very popular among the wealthy of which Quesnay spent time regularly with. He spent much of his time worried for his life in the Palace.
