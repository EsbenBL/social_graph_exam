'''Roland Gerhard Fryer Jr.''' (born June 4, 1977) is an American [[economist]].  In 2007, at age 30, he became the youngest [[African Americans|African-American]] to be given [[tenure]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=":0">[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/roland_fryer_cv_march_2014.pdf Roland Fryer, "Curriculum Vitae"]</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Fryer grew up in [[Lewisville, Texas]], where he had moved with his abusive father at the age of 4. Fryer's mother left when he was very young, and his father, who beat his son, was convicted of rape, effectively leaving Fryer to fend for himself.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 30, 2005|title=Fryer interview with Tavis Smiley|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200503/20050330_fryer.html|work=[[The Tavis Smiley Show]]|publisher=PBS|access-date=2020-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211070816/https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200503/20050330_fryer.html |archive-date=2008-12-11}}</ref> Fryer became a "full fledged gangster by his teens".<ref>Levitt & Dubner, Freakonomics, 2009</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2020}} Attending [[Lewisville High School]], he starred in [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]], earning an [[athletic scholarship]] from the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. However, he never actually played for the [[Texas–Arlington Mavericks men's basketball|Texas–Arlington Mavericks]]; instead he decided to embrace academics, joining the Honors College, whose dean helped find him an academic scholarship.<ref>[http://www.uta.edu/publications/utamagazine/fall_2005/stories.php?id=287 Becky Purvis, "Ivy League Maverick"], ''UTA Magazine'', 2005.</ref> He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1998 after two and a half years while holding down a full-time job.<ref name="Contemporary_Black_Biography">[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC "Roland G.

Accessed 2009-12-20 via [[Fairfax County Public Library]].</ref> Fryer completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] in 2002. He conducted [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[University of Chicago]] with Nobel laureate economist [[Gary Becker]]. Fryer has collaborated with several other academics, including [[Steven Levitt]], the University of Chicago economist and author of ''[[Freakonomics]]'', [[Glenn Loury]], a [[Brown University]] economist, and [[Edward Glaeser]], an [[Urban economics|urban economist]] at Harvard.

Upon completing a three-year fellowship with the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]] at the end of the 2005–2006 academic year, Fryer joined Harvard's economics department as an assistant professor. In 2005, Fryer was also selected as one of the first [[Fletcher Foundation]] Fellows.

== Academic career ==

By 2005, Fryer was regarded as one of [[African-American|Black America's]] and Harvard's rising academic stars, in the aftermath of publishing numerous economics-related papers in prominent [[academic journal]]s.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen J |last=Dubner |title=Toward a Unified Theory of Black America |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/magazine/20HARVARD.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2005-03-20 |access-date=2007-09-08 }}</ref> 
In 2007, at age 30, he became the youngest African-American to ever receive [[tenure]] at Harvard ([[Noam Elkies]] was 26). In 2007, New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] appointed Professor Fryer to be the [[New York City Department of Education]]'s Chief Equality Officer. Professor Fryer both inspired and oversaw the [[Opportunity NYC]] project, which studied how students in low-performing schools respond to financial incentives, offering as much as $500 for "doing well on standardized tests and showing up for class."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Medina |title=His Charge: Find a Key to Student's Success |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/nyregion/21fryer.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref> In 2009, Fryer formed the Education Innovation Laboratory at Harvard University, and served as its Director until its closure ten years later, in 2019.<ref>Roland G.

In 2016, Fryer published a [[working paper]] concluding that although minorities (African Americans and Hispanics) are more likely to experience [[police use of force]] than whites, they were not more likely to be shot by police than whites.{{refn|name=fryer1|{{cite report|surname=Fryer|given=Roland Gerhard|author-link=Roland G.

If police are more likely to stop a black person than a white person, then the average white person that they stop might be dissimilar to the average black person (for example, the white person might be behaving in a more threatening manner), thus leading to faulty inferences about racial bias in shootings. Some of these potential differences (e.g. type of weapon held by the suspect, and whether they attacked the police officer), were accounted for in the analysis. A 2019 study by Princeton University political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks in Fryer's data are not similar.{{refn|name=Knox Lowe Mummolo 2020|{{Cite journal|last1=Knox|first1=Dean|last2=Lowe|first2=Will|last3=Mummolo|first3=Jonathan|date=2019-12-21|edition=Revised 18 May 2020|title=The Bias Is Built In: Administrative Records Mask Racially Biased Policing|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policing/66BC0F9998543868BB20F241796B79B8/core-reader|journal=[[American Political Science Review]]|issue=3|volume=114|pages=619–637|doi=10.1017/S0003055420000039|doi-access=free|issn=0003-0554|ssrn=3336338|oclc=8678024977|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108082712/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policing/66BC0F9998543868BB20F241796B79B8/core-reader|archive-date=2020-11-08|url-status=live|postscript=; minor correction in August 2020.}}<ref name="Knox Lowe Mummolo 2020 corr">{{Cite journal|last1=Knox|first1=Dean|last2=Lowe|first2=Will|last3=Mummolo|first3=Jonathan|date=2020-08-05|title=Administrative Records Mask Racially Biased Policing—CORRIGENDUM|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policingcorrigendum/CF1A1FEE35FF2111A775A8FCC2122914/core-reader|journal=[[American Political Science Review]]|issue=4|volume=114|page=1394|doi=10.1017/S0003055420000611|doi-access=free|issn=0003-0554|oclc=8675966912|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108082942/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policingcorrigendum/CF1A1FEE35FF2111A775A8FCC2122914/core-reader|archive-date=2020-11-08|url-status=live}}</ref>}} Nobel-laureate [[James Heckman]] and [[Steven Durlauf]], both University of Chicago economists, published a response to the Fryer study, writing that the paper "does not establish credible evidence on the presence or absence of discrimination against African Americans in police shootings" due to issues with [[selection bias]].<ref name="fryer1_com">{{cite journal|surname=Durlauf|given=Steven Neil|author-link=Steven Durlauf|surname2=Heckman|given2=James Joseph|author-link2=James Heckman|title=An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force: A Comment|journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]]|date=2020-07-21|volume=128|number=10|pages=3998–4002|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/710976|doi=10.1086/710976|s2cid=222811199|oclc=8672021465|issn=0022-3808|archive-url=https://archive.today/20201108063306/https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/710976|archive-date=2020-11-08}}</ref> Fryer responded by saying Durlauf and Heckman erroneously claim that his sample is "based on stops".
