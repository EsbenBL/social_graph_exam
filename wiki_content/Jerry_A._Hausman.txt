'''Jerry Allen Hausman''' (born May 5, 1946) is the John and Jennie S. MacDonald Professor of [[Economics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and a notable [[econometrician]].  He has published numerous influential papers in microeconometrics. Hausman is the recipient of several prestigious awards including the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] in 1985 and the [[Frisch medal|Frisch Medal]] in 1980.

He is perhaps most well known for his development of the [[Durbin-Wu-Hausman test]], the first easy method allowing scientists to evaluate if their [[statistical model]]s correspond to the data.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He has done extensive work in the field of [[telecommunication]]s, and is also recognized as an expert on [[antitrust]] and [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], [[public finance]] and [[tax]]ation, and [[regulation]].  Hausman also serves as the director of the MIT Telecommunications Economics Research Program.

His recent applied papers are on topics including the effect of new goods on economic welfare and their measurement in the [[Consumer Price Index|CPI]], new telecommunications technologies including cellular [[3G]] and [[broadband]], regulation of telecommunications and railroads, and competition in [[network markets]]. His recent econometrics papers include estimation of [[difference in difference]] models, [[semi-parametric duration models]], [https://economics.mit.edu/files/14516 mixed logit model, weak instruments], and [[errors in variables]] in non-standard situations.

Hausman received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Brown University]] summa cum laude in 1968, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]], [[Oxford University]], where he was a [[Marshall Scholar]], in 1973,<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=46609}}</ref> with thesis titled ''Theoretical and empirical aspects of vintage capital models''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.458576 | title = Theoretical and empirical aspects of vintage capital models | publisher = British Library EThOS | access-date = 17 May 2013}}</ref>
