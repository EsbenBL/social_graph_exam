'''Massachusetts Institute of Technology''' ('''MIT''') is a [[Private university|private]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Founded in response to the increasing [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization of the United States]], MIT adopted a European [[History of European universities|polytechnic university model]] and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and [[engineering]]. The institute has an [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|urban campus]] that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the [[Charles River]], and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], the Bates Center, and the [[Haystack Observatory]], as well as affiliated laboratories such as the [[Broad Institute|Broad]] and [[Whitehead Institute]]s.

Still, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that "the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school", a "partly unjustified" perception the committee sought to change.

These activities affected MIT profoundly.

In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published ''[[The Hidden Curriculum]],'' arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled "[[History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Course "Bibles"|course bibles]]"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Benson |first=Snyder |title=The Hidden Curriculum |year=1970 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-69043-8 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=4398&ttype=2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922160317/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=4398 |archive-date=September 22, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Mahoney |first=Matt|title=Unwritten Rules|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/mitnews/427509/unwritten-rules/|access-date=June 21, 2012|journal=[[Technology Review]]|date=May 2012}}</ref>

=== Graduate program ===
MIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and [[STEM fields]] as well as professional degrees.<ref name="Carnegie"/> The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as SM at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (ScD) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the [[MD-PhD]] (with [[Harvard Medical School]]) and a joint program in [[oceanography]] with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap4-gdr.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Graduate Education: General Degree Requirements |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |access-date=September 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/inter.gradu.html |title=Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |access-date=September 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Degrees Offered|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/degrees.html|website=MIT Facts 2017|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://mit.whoi.edu/|title=MIT-WHOI Joint Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>

Admission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).<ref>{{cite web|title=Graduate Education|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/graduate.html|work=MIT Facts 2012|publisher=MIT|access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

=== MIT Bootcamps ===
MIT Bootcamps are intense week-long innovation and leadership programs that challenge participants to develop a venture in a week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://innovation.mit.edu/resource/mit-bootcamps/|title=MIT Bootcamps|website=MIT Innovation Initiative}}</ref> Each Bootcamp centers around a particular topic, specific to an industry, leadership skill set, or emerging technology. Cohorts are organized into small teams who work on an entrepreneurial project together, in addition to individual learning and team coaching. The program includes a series of online seminars with MIT faculty, practitioners, and industry experts, innovation workshops with bootcamp instructors focused on putting the theory participants have learned into practice, coaching sessions, and informal office hours for learners to exchange ideas freely. Bootcampers are tasked with weekly "deliverables," which are key elements of a business plan, to help guide the group through the decision-making process involved in building an enterprise. The experience culminates in a final pitch session, judged by a panel of experts.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2021/ingenuity-online-virtual-mit-bootcamps-0303|title=Virtual bootcamps recruit from a wider world|website=MIT News &#124; Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}</ref>
