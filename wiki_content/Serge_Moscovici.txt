Moscovici trained as a [[mechanic]] at the Bucharest [[vocational school]] ''Ciocanul''.<ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/> Faced with an ideological choice between [[Zionism]] and [[communism]], he opted for the latter, and, in 1939, joined the then-illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]], being introduced by a clandestine activist whom he knew by the pseudonym ''Kappa''.<ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/>
 
During [[World War II]] Moscovici witnessed the [[Iron Guard]]-instigated [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Bucharest Pogrom]] in January 1941. Later the [[Ion Antonescu]] régime interned him in a [[Penal labour|forced-labor camp]], where, together with other persons of his age, he worked on construction teams until freed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] in 1944.<ref name="balzan"/><ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/><ref name="instreperes"/> During those years he taught himself [[French language|French]] and educated himself by reading philosophical works (including those of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[René Descartes]]).<ref name="balzan"/><ref name="instreperes"/>

Subsequently, Moscovici travelled extensively, notably visiting [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].<ref name="balzan"/> During the late stages of [[World War II]] he met [[Isidore Isou]], the founder of [[lettrism]], with whom he founded the artistic and literary review ''Da'' towards the end of 1944 (''Da'' was quickly [[censorship|censored]]{{by whom|date=August 2016}}).<ref name="instreperes"/> Refusing promotion on the basis of political affiliation at a time when the Communist Party participated in Romania's governments, he became instead a [[welder]] in the large Bucharest factory owned by [[Nicolae Malaxa]].<ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/>

Initially welcoming [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], Moscovici grew increasingly disillusioned with communist politics, and noted the incidence of anti-Semitism among Red Army soldiers.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Ştefan Ionescu, [http://www.idee.ro/holocaust/pdf/mem_supr.pdf ''În umbra morţii.

In [[Paris]], helped by a refugee fund, he studied [[psychology]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] while employed by an industrial enterprise.<ref name="balzan"/><ref name="instreperes"/> At the time, Moscovici became close to Paris-based writers, including the Romanian-born Jewish [[Paul Celan]] and {{ill|Isac Chiva|fr}}.<ref name="balzan"/><ref name="chiva">{{in lang|ro}} [[Isaac Chiva]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=15837&print=true "Pogromul de la Iaşi"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'' (retrieved June 17, 2007)</ref> In reference to himself, Celan, and Moscovici, Chiva later recalled: <blockquote>"For us, people on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], but who had fled communism, the first period in Paris, in a capital where the intellectual environments were developing under full-scale [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] enthusiasm, was very harsh. We were caught between a rock and a hard place: on one side, the French university environment who saw us as «[[Fascism|fascists]]». [...] On the other, the Romanian exiles, most of all the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] students, when not outright on the [[far right]], who did not shy away from denouncing us as communist «[[Mole (espionage)|moles]]» in the pay of Bucharest or [[Moscow]]."<ref name="chiva"/></blockquote>

Moscovici's 1961 thesis (''La psychanalyse, son image et son public''), directed by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Daniel Lagache]], explored the [[social representations]] of psychoanalysis in France.<ref name="instreperes"/> Moscovici also studied [[epistemology]] and [[history of science]]s with philosopher [[Alexandre Koyré]]. During the 1960s [[Princeton University]]'s [[Institute for Advanced Study]] invited him to the [[United States]]; he worked at [[Stanford University]] and at [[Yale University|Yale]] before returning to Paris to teach at the ''[[École pratique des hautes études]]''.<ref name="balzan"/><ref name="instreperes"/> Serge Moscovici served as a visiting professor at [[the New School]] in [[New York City]], at the [[Rousseau Institute]] in [[Geneva]], as well as at the ''[[Université catholique de Louvain]]'' and at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name="instreperes"/>

By 1968, together with [[Brice Lalonde]] and others, he became involved in [[green politics]], and ran in elections for the office of [[List of mayors of Paris|Mayor of Paris]] for what later became ''[[The Greens (France)|Les Verts]]''.<ref name="moscovicijurnalul"/> A [[doctor honoris causa|doctor ''honoris causa'']] of several universities, Moscovici received the [[Balzan Prize]] in 2003 for social psychology.<ref name="balzan"/>

In 1997, Serge Moscovici authored an [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] essay titled ''Chronique des années égarées'' ("Chronicle of the Mislaid Years"). It was translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Cronica anilor risipiţi'' (published by [[Polirom]] in 1999).

In commemoration of his elaborate and significant contribution to the world of psychology and society in general, several awards, medals, lectures have been established. Notable among these are:

1.Serge Moscovici Medal awarded by the European Association of Social Psychology (EASP)<ref>{{cite web|title=Serge Moscovici Medal|url=http://www.easp.eu/about/awards/serge-moscovici-medals/|publisher=European Association of Social Psychology|accessdate=2 September 2016}}</ref>

==Research==
His research focus was on [[group psychology]] and he began his career by investigating the way knowledge is reformulated as groups take hold of it, distorting it from its original form. His theory of [[social representations]] is now widespread in understanding this process of cultural  ''[[Telephone (game)|Chinese whispers]]''. Influenced by [[Gabriel Tarde]], he later criticized American research into majority influence ([[conformity (psychology)|conformity]]) and instead investigated the effects of minority influence, where the opinions of a small group influence those of a larger one.<ref name="balzan"/> He also researched the dynamics of group decisions and consensus-forming.

===Minority influence===
{{main|Conversion theory of minority influence}}
Moscovici claimed that majority influence in many ways was misleading – if the majority was indeed all-powerful, we would all end up thinking the same.<ref name="balzan"/> Drawing attention to the works of [[Gabriel Tarde]], he pointed to the fact that most major social movements have been started by individuals and small groups (e.g. [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], the [[Suffragette]] movement, [[Nazism]], etc.) and that without an outspoken minority, we would have no innovation or social change.

The study he is most famous for, ''Influences of a consistent minority on the responses of a majority in a colour perception task'', is now seen as one of the defining investigations into the effects of minority influence:
*Aims: To investigate the process of innovation by looking at how a consistent minority affect the opinions of a larger group, possibly creating doubt and leading them to question and alter their views
*Procedures: Participants were first given an eye test to check that they were not colour blind. They were then placed in a group of four participants and two confederates. they were all shown 36 slides that were different shades of blue and asked to state the colour out loud. There were two groups in the experiment. In the first group the confederates were consistent and answered green for every slide. In the second group the confederates were inconsistent and answered green 24 times and blue 12 times.
*Findings: For 8.42% of the trials, participants agreed with the minority and said that the slides were green. Overall, 32% of the participants agreed at least once.
*Conclusions: The study suggested that minorities can indeed exert an effect over the opinion of a majority. Not to the same degree as majority influence, but the fact that almost a third of people agreed at least once is significant. However, this also leaves two thirds who never agreed. In a follow up experiment, Moscovici demonstrated that consistency was the key factor in [[minority influence]]; by instructing the stooges to be inconsistent, the effect fell off sharply.
