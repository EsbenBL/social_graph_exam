'''Fritz Künkel''' (September 6, 1889 – April 1, 1956) was known both as a [[German people|German]] [[psychiatrist]] and an American psychologist.  He might best be understood as a [[social science|social scientist]] who sought to integrate psychology (especially the work of [[Freud]], [[Alfred Adler|Adler]] and [[Jung]]), [[sociology]] and [[religion]] into a unified theory of human being.  He consolidated these insights into a theory of character development and finally into his "We-Psychology".

== Biography ==
The following material comes from the brief life written by  [[John A. Sanford]] with the assistance of Kunkel's two sons.<ref>Kunkel, Fritz. (1984). ''Fritz Kunkel: Selected Writings.'' John A. Sanford ed., intro., & commentary. NJ: Paulist.</ref>

Kunkel was born the seventh of eight siblings, on a wealthy estate in Brandenburg (now Poland), on September 6, 1889.  His early life was characterized as carefree, imaginative, active and social.  While pursuing a variety of interests, he did manage to study medicine, receiving his medical degree “a few days after the beginning of the First World War” (1984, p.&nbsp;1). At the [[Battle of Verdun]], working as a battalion surgeon, he received a shrapnel wound that led to the loss of his left arm.

Around 1919-1920, Kunkel moved to Vienna, where he became associated with [[Alfred Adler]]. In 1924, he began to practice Adlerian psychotherapy in Berlin.  Over the next 10 to 15 years he built on his Adlerian foundations, publishing a dozen books and founding his unique school of "We-Psychology".

In 1920 he married Ruth Löwengard, who became his colleague and co-founder of the Adler Institute in Berlin. They had three children. After the death of Ruth in January 1932, he married Elizabeth Jensen, and they had two more children.

When Hitler came to power, Kunkel became increasingly disturbed by the restrictions being placed on psychotherapy, and he planned to immigrate to the USA with his family. He accepted an invitation by the Quakers to give a lecture tour in the United States in 1936, and again in 1939. When the war broke out in September 1939, he could not come back to Germany to pick up his family.

The oldest son came to the States in 1938, after having attended the Quaker school in [[Eerde, Ommen|Eerde]], the Netherlands, and his two siblings, also Eerde students, followed after the war. Elizabeth and her two boys joined her husband in December 1947. Kunkel continued to develop the We-Psychology and his religious psychology, while leading an active life of writing, lecturing, and psychotherapy, until his death on Easter Sunday 1956.
