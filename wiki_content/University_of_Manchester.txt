The '''University of Manchester''' is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Manchester]], England. The main campus is south of [[Manchester city centre|Manchester City Centre]] on [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]]. The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Manchester Museum]], [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], [[John Rylands Library]] and [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]]—a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Visitor attractions at The University of Manchester |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/visitor-attractions/ |publisher=University of Manchester |access-date=9 September 2014}}</ref>  

The University of Manchester is considered a [[red brick university]], a product of the civic university movement of the late 19th century. The current University of Manchester was formed in 2004 following the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and the Victoria University of Manchester.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|url=https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/umist/|website=The University of Manchester}}</ref><ref>''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (15th edn) vol.7 p.760 and vol.23, p.462.</ref> This followed a century of the two institutions working closely with one another.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The history of The University of Manchester|url=https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/|access-date=2021-07-27|website=The University of Manchester|language=en}}</ref>

The [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] was founded in 1824, as the [[Manchester Mechanics' Institute|Mechanics' Institute]]. The founders believed that all professions somewhat relied on scientific principles. As such, the institute taught working individuals branches of science applicable to their existing occupations. They believed that the practical application of science would encourage innovation and advancements within those trades and professions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our History {{!}} Mechanics Conference Centre|url=https://www.mechanicsinstitute.co.uk/our-history/|access-date=2021-07-22|website=www.mechanicsinstitute.co.uk}}</ref> The [[Victoria University of Manchester]] was founded in 1851, as Owens College. Academic research undertaken by the university would be published via the [[Manchester University Press]] from 1904.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the Victoria University of Manchester|url=https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/victoria/|access-date=2021-07-22|website=The University of Manchester|language=en}}</ref> 

The University of Manchester is a member of the [[Russell Group]], the [[N8 Group]], and the worldwide [[Universities Research Association]]. The University of Manchester has 25 Nobel laureates among its past and present students and staff, the fourth-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom. In 2019/20, the university had a consolidated income of £1.1 billion, of which £264.7 million was from research grants and contracts (6th place nationally behind [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Imperial College London|Imperial]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]).<ref name="finstat">{{cite web|url=https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=52991|title=Financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2020|publisher=University of Manchester|access-date=15 March 2021}}</ref> It has the [[List of UK universities by endowment|fifth-largest endowment]] of any university in the UK, after the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh and [[King's College London]]. 

==History==
===Origins (1824 to 2004)===
{{Main|UMIST|Victoria University of Manchester}}
[[File:Old Quadrangle, Manchester 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Quadrangle at the University of Manchester's main campus on Oxford Road.]]
The University of Manchester traces its roots to the formation of the [[Mechanics' Institute, Manchester|Mechanics' Institute]] (later [[UMIST]]) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester's pride in being the world's first industrial city.<ref name="Our History">{{cite web|url=http://www.eps.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/ | title= Our History| publisher= The University of Manchester|access-date=6 November 2014}}</ref> The English [[chemist]] [[John Dalton]], together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics' Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science.

[[John Owens (merchant)|John Owens]], a textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (around £5.6 million in 2005 prices)<ref name="National Archives Currency Converter">{{cite web|title=National Archives Currency Converter ~ 1850|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid|access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref> to found a college to educate men on non-sectarian lines. His [[trustee]]s established [[Owens College]] in 1851 in a house on the corner of [[Quay Street]] and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist [[Richard Cobden]], and subsequently housed [[County Court, Manchester|Manchester County Court]]. The locomotive designer [[Charles Beyer]] became a governor of the college and was the largest single donor to the college extension fund, which raised the money to move to a new site and construct the main building now known as the John Owens building. He also campaigned and helped fund the engineering chair, the first applied science department in the north of England. He left the college the equivalent of £10 million in his will in 1876, at a time when it was in great financial difficulty. Beyer funded the total cost of construction of the [[Beyer Building]] to house the biology and geology departments. His will also funded Engineering chairs and the [[Beyer Professor of Applied Mathematics|Beyer Professor of Applied mathematics]].

The university has a rich German heritage. The Owens College Extension Movement formed their plans after a tour of mainly German universities and polytechnics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Owens College: its foundation and growth|last=Thompson|first=Joseph|publisher=J.E.Cornish|year=1886|location=Manchester}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/owenscollegeitsf00thomuoft#page/300/mode/2up/search/german+universities|title=Owens College:it's foundation and growth|date=1883|last=Thompson|first=Joseph|publisher=Manchester J.E. Cornish}}</ref> A Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement, had studied at [[Heidelberg University]]. [[Henry Enfield Roscoe|Sir Henry Roscoe]] also studied at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen and they collaborated for many years on research projects. Roscoe promoted the German style of research-led teaching that became the role model for the red-brick universities. Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic. There were many Germans on the staff, including [[Carl Schorlemmer]], Britain's first chair in organic chemistry, and [[Arthur Schuster]], professor of physics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Portrait of a University|last=Charlton|first=H B|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1951}}</ref> There was even a German chapel on the campus.

In 1873 the college moved to new premises on Oxford Road, [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]], and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|federal Victoria University]]. The university was established and granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1880 becoming England's first civic university; it was renamed the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year.<ref>{{cite book | author=Charlton, H. B.| title=Portrait of a university, 1851–1951 | year=1951 | publisher=Manchester University Press | location=Manchester, England | pages=x, 185}}</ref> By 1905, the institutions were large and active forces. The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester's Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together.<ref name="History and Origins">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/facts/history/ |title=History and Origins |publisher=The University of Manchester |access-date=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728042524/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/facts/history/ |archive-date=28 July 2011 }}</ref>  However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees. A decade later the development was reversed.<ref name=heraldry/> The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/mar/06/highereducation.administration |title=Manchester merger creates UK's largest university|access-date=28 February 2012|work=The Guardian|date=6 March 2003|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/07/highereducation.administration|title=Super university for Manchester|access-date=28 February 2012|work=The Guardian|date=7 March 2003|first=Helen|last=Carter|location=London}}</ref>

Before the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students, with two further Nobel laureates being subsequently added. Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by [[Ernest Rutherford]], and the world's [[Manchester Baby|first electronic stored-program computer]] was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include [[physicist]]s Ernest Rutherford, [[Osborne Reynolds]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[James Chadwick]], [[Arthur Schuster]], [[Hans Geiger]], [[Ernest Marsden]] and [[Balfour Stewart]]. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by [[Paul Erdős]], [[Horace Lamb]] and [[Alan Turing]] and in philosophy by [[Samuel Alexander]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. The author [[Anthony Burgess]], [[Pritzker Prize]] and [[RIBA Stirling Prize]]-winning architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and composer [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] all attended, or worked at, Manchester.

===Post-merger (2004 to present)===
[[File:UMIST Sackville Street Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Sackville Street Building]], formerly the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|UMIST]] Main Building]]
The current University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] bestowed its [[royal charter]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3943855.stm|title=University gets royal approval|access-date=28 February 2012|work=BBC News|date=22 October 2004}}</ref> The university was named the [[Sunday Times University of the Year|''Sunday Times'' University of the Year]] in 2006 after winning the inaugural ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' University of the Year prize in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/international/news/universityoftheyear/ |title=University of the Year |publisher=University of Manchester |access-date=25 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410075916/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/international/news/universityoftheyear/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=10 April 2007}}</ref>

The founding president and [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the new university was [[Alan Gilbert (Australian academic)|Alan Gilbert]], former Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Melbourne]], who retired at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=5362 |publisher=University of Manchester |year=2010 |access-date=16 January 2010 |title=President and Vice-Chancellor to retire}}</ref> His successor was Dame [[Nancy Rothwell]],<ref name=rothswho>{{Who's Who |surname=ROTHWELL |othernames=Dame Nancy (Jane) |id=U43057 |volume=2015 |edition=online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> who had held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994. One of the university's aims stated in the ''Manchester 2015 Agenda'' is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert's aim to "establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/vision/ |title=Towards Vision |publisher=University of Manchester}}</ref> In 2011, four Nobel laureates were on its staff: [[Andre Geim]],<ref name="geims">{{Who's Who |surname=GEIM |othernames=Sir Andre (Konstantin) |id=U245770 |volume=2015 |edition=online edition via [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> [[Konstantin Novoselov]],<ref name="novswho">{{Who's Who |surname=NOVOSELOV |othernames=Sir Konstantin S. |id=U256328 |volume=2015 |edition=online [[Oxford University Press]]}}{{subscription required}}</ref> [[John Sulston|Sir John Sulston]] and [[Joseph E.

The [[EPSRC]] announced in February 2012 the formation of the [[National Graphene Institute]]. The University of Manchester is the "single supplier invited to submit a proposal for funding the new £45m institute, £38m of which will be provided by the government" – (EPSRC & [[Technology Strategy Board]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=EPSRC Press Release|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2012/Pages/graphenehub.aspx|access-date=3 February 2012|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205035919/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2012/Pages/graphenehub.aspx|archive-date=5 February 2012}}</ref> In 2013, an additional £23 million of funding from European Regional Development Fund was awarded to the institute taking investment to £61 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=9694|title=Huge funding boost for graphene Institute|access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:UOMCampusmap.jpg|thumb|A map of the university campus, with all buildings labelled.]]
The university's main site contains most of its facilities and is often referred to as the ''campus'', however Manchester is not a [[campus university]] as the concept is commonly understood. It is centrally located in the city and its buildings are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between.

The campus occupies an area shaped roughly like a boot: the foot of which is aligned roughly south-west to north-east and is joined to the broader southern part of the boot by an area of overlap between former UMIST and former VUM buildings;<ref name="googleCampusMap">{{cite news|title=Campus Map }}</ref> it comprises two parts:
*''North campus'' or ''Sackville Street Campus'', centred on [[Sackville Street (Manchester)|Sackville Street]]
*''South campus'' or ''Oxford Road Campus'', centred on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]].
The names are not officially recognised by the university, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website and roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively.

[[Fallowfield Campus]] is the main residential campus in [[Fallowfield]], approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of the main site.

There are other university buildings across the city and the wider region, such as [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] in Cheshire and One Central Park in Moston, a collaboration between the university and other partners which offers office space for start-up firms and venues for conferences and workshops,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternti.com/about/one-central.htm|title=Locations—One Central Park|last=Manchester New Technology Institute|access-date=5 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821190113/http://www.manchesternti.com/about/one-central.htm|archive-date=21 August 2008}}</ref>

===Major projects===
[[File:MIBatrium.jpg|thumb|The atrium inside the £38m [[Manchester Institute of Biotechnology]]]]
Following the merger, the university embarked on a £600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets.<ref name="AssetSale">Manchester Evening News 31 July 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/business/s/1012/1012479_cashstrapped_uni_sells_assets.html
| title = Cash-strapped uni sells assets|access-date=4 October 2007}}</ref> These include:
* £60 m Flagship ''University Place'' building (new)
* £56 m [[Alan Turing Building]] houses [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics]], replaced [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]]. Home to the Photon Sciences Institute and the [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] (new)
* £50 m Life Sciences Research Building (A. V. Hill Building) (new)
* £38 m [[Manchester Institute of Biotechnology]] (MIB) (new)
* £33 m Life Sciences and Medical and Human Sciences Building (Michael Smith Building) (new)

* £20 m [[Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre]] (WMIC) (new)
* £18 m Re-location of School of Pharmacy
* £17 m [[John Rylands Library]], Deansgate (extension & refurbishment of existing building)
* £13 m Chemistry Building
* £10 m Functional Biology Building

===Old Quadrangle===
[[File:The University of Manchester (with snow).jpg|thumb|The buildings of the University of Manchester and the Manchester Museum in Oxford Road]]
The buildings around the Old Quadrangle date from the time of Owens College, and were designed in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and his son [[Paul Waterhouse]]. The first to be built was the John Owens Building (1873), formerly the Main Building; the others were added over the next thirty years. Today, [[Manchester Museum|the museum]] continues to occupy part of one side, including the tower. The grand setting of the [[Whitworth Hall]] is used for the conferment of degrees, and part of the old [[R. C. Christie|Christie Library]] (1898) now houses Christie's Bistro. The remainder of the buildings house administrative departments. The less easily accessed Rear Quadrangle, dating mostly from 1873, is older in its completed form than the Old Quadrangle.

===Contact===
[[File:Contact Theatre 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Contact Theatre]]]]
{{Main|Contact Theatre}}
Contact stages modern live performance for all ages, and participatory workshops primarily for young people aged 13 to 30. The building on Devas Street was completed in 1999 incorporating parts of its 1960s predecessor.<ref>Hartwell, C. (2001) Manchester. London: Penguin (reissued: New Haven: Yale U. P.); p.&nbsp;311–12</ref> It has a unique energy-efficient ventilation system, using its high towers to naturally ventilate the building without the use of air conditioning. The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and ''Hot Air'', a reactive public artwork in the foyer.

===Chancellors Hotel and Conference Centre===
{{Main|Manchester Conference Centre|Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre}}
[[File:Chcc blue sky.jpg|thumb|right|Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre]]
The Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre was built around The Firs, a house built in 1850 for [[Sir Joseph Whitworth]] by [[Edward Walters]], who also designed Manchester's [[Free Trade Hall]]. Whitworth used the house as a social, political and business base, entertaining radicals such as [[John Bright]], [[Richard Cobden]], [[William Edward Forster|William Forster]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] at the time of the [[Reform Bill]] of 1867. Whitworth, credited with raising the art of machine-tool building to a previously unknown level, supported the [[Mechanics Institute]]  – the birthplace of [[UMIST]] – and was a founder of the Manchester School of Design. Whilst living there, Whitworth used land at the rear (now the site of the University's botanical glasshouses) for testing his "[[Whitworth rifle]]". In 1882, The Firs was leased to [[C.P. Scott]], editor of the [[Manchester Guardian]] and after Scott's death became the property of [[Owens College]]. It was the Vice-Chancellor's residence until 1991.

The house now forms the western wing of the Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre. The eastern wing houses the circular Flowers Theatre, six conference rooms and most of the hotel's bedrooms.

===Other notable buildings===
Other notable buildings in the Oxford Road Campus include the [[Stephen Joseph Studio]], a former German Protestant church and the Samuel Alexander Building, a [[grade II listed building]]<ref name="English Heritage – List Entry Summary – Samuel Alexander Building">{{cite web|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle_print.aspx?uid=1393664&showMap=1&showText=1|title=List Entry Summary – Samuel Alexander Building|work=[[English Heritage]]|access-date=31 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103181011/http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle_print.aspx?uid=1393664&showMap=1&showText=1|archive-date=3 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> erected in 1919 and home of the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures.

In the Sackville Street Campus is the [[Sackville Street Building]] which was formerly UMIST's "Main Building". It was opened in 1902 by the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Arthur Balfour]].<ref name="campus_history">{{cite web | title = UMIST campus history | url=http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/project/teaching/civil/historic_construction/maps/umist.php|website=Mace.manchester.ac.uk |access-date = 9 February 2008 }}</ref> Built using [[Burmantofts Pottery|Burmantofts]] [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]], the building is now [[Grade II listed]]. It was extended along Whitworth Street, towards London Road, between 1927 and 1957 by the architects [[Bradshaw Gass & Hope]], completion being delayed due to the [[Great Depression|depression in the 1930s]] and the [[Second World War]].

==Organisation and administration==
===Faculties and schools===
The University of Manchester was divided into four faculties, but from 1 August 2016 it was restructured into three faculties, each sub-divided into schools.

On 25 June 2015 The University of Manchester announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty. As a result of this review the [[University of Manchester Faculty of Life Sciences|Faculty of Life Sciences]] was to be dismantled, most of its personnel to be incorporated into a single medical/biological faculty, with a substantial minority being incorporated into a science and engineering faculty.

====Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health====
[[File:Old Medical School.jpg|thumb|Old Medical School on Coupland Street (photographed in 1908), which now houses the School of Dentistry]]
The faculty is divided into the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medical Sciences and the School of Health Sciences.

Biological Sciences have been taught at Manchester as far back as the foundation of Owens College in 1851.

In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex'' called "Stan".

The museum's first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of [[Natural History]], and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society. Due to the society's financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist [[Thomas Huxley]], [[Owens College]] accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned [[Alfred Waterhouse]], architect of London's [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public. The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.<ref>[http://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/history/ The History of The Manchester Museum, University of Manchester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627082857/http://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/history/ |date=27 June 2009 }}.

It was formed out of the merger between UMIST Students' Association and University of Manchester Union when the parent organisations UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester merged on 1 October 2004.

Unlike many other students' unions in the UK, it does not have a president, but is run by an eight-member executive team who share joint responsibility.

The University of Manchester operates sports clubs through its [[athletics union]] while student societies are operated by the Students' Union.

The university has more than 80 health and fitness classes while over 3,000 students are members of the 44 various Athletic Union clubs. The sports societies vary widely in their level and scope. Many more popular sports operate several university teams and departmental teams which compete in leagues against other teams within the university. Teams include: [[badminton]], [[lacrosse]], [[korfball]], [[dodgeball]], [[field hockey]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[Association football|football]], basketball, [[fencing]], [[netball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[water polo]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[cricket]].

The athletic union was formed at Owens College in 1885 from four clubs: rugby, lacrosse, cricket and tennis. In 1901 the women's athletic union was founded. In 1981 the two unions were amalgamated. After the acquisition of the Firs estate in [[Fallowfield]] a sports ground and pavilion were provided there. From 1940 the McDougall Centre in Burlington Street was also in use as a sports centre. [[Ron Hill]], [[Rowena Sweatman]], [[James Hickman]], [[Cyril Holmes]] and [[Harry Whittle]] are former students who have achieved Olympic success.<ref>''The Legacy of John Owens: 150 years of university teaching in Manchester''. Manchester: John Rylands Library, 2001</ref>

The [[Manchester Aquatics Centre]], the swimming pool used for the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|Manchester Commonwealth Games]] is on the campus and used for water sports. The main facilities used for sports are the Sugden Centre in Grosvenor Street, the Armitage Site near Owens Park and the Wythenshawe Sports Ground.<ref>''The University of Manchester prospectus 2005''. Manchester: University, 2005; p. 266</ref>

The university has achieved success in the [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]] (British University & College Sports) competitions, with its men's [[water polo]] 1st team winning the national championships (2009, 2010, 2011) under the tutelage of their coach Andy Howard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucs.org.uk/page.asp?section=16084&sectionTitle=Archive+10%2D11 |title=Championships |publisher=BUSA |access-date=27 June 2011}}</ref> It was positioned in eighth place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.busa.org.uk/page.asp?section=00010001000200010005&itemTitle=Championships |title=Championships |publisher=BUSA |access-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612212440/http://www.busa.org.uk/page.asp?section=00010001000200010005&itemTitle=Championships |archive-date=12 June 2007 }}</ref>

The university competes annually in 28 different sports against [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] and [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] universities in the [[Christie Cup]], which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/index.htm?id=133663 |title=Battle of the North |access-date=3 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403092000/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/index.htm?id=133663 |archive-date=3 April 2008 }}</ref> The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the [[Oxford and Cambridge rivalry]], the Christie's Championships is the oldest Inter–University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of [[Richard Copley Christie]].

Every year elite sportsmen and sportswomen are selected for membership of the ''XXI Club'', a society formed in 1932 to promote sporting excellence at the university. Most members have gained a [[sporting colours|Full Maroon]] for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level. No more than 21 active members are allowed, each elected for up to three years (after graduating they become passive members).

An example of the university clubs is the lacrosse club which was founded in the season 1883–84 and in the following years won the [[Senior Flags|North of England Flags]] twice and maintained its position among the leading English clubs. In 1885 it was one of the four founding clubs of the athletic union. The merging of Owens College with the university in 1904 affected the club by restricting the pool of players available for selection. However, when the English Universities Lacrosse Championship was set up in 1925–26 with five university teams the Manchester team won in the first season and again in 1932–33 and continued to do so in the 1930s.<ref>Melland, Charles H. (1939) "The University Lacrosse Club", in: ''The Journal of the University of Manchester'', vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 74–76</ref>

===''University Challenge'' quiz programme===
In the eight years up to 2013, Manchester has won the [[BBC Two|BBC2]] quiz programme ''[[University Challenge]]'' four times, drawing equal with [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], for the highest number of series wins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=9937|title=Manchester's Fab Four win University Challenge|access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref> Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals every year since 2005.<ref name="challenge">{{Cite news |title=Manchester wins University Challenge 2012 |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=8088 |publisher=University of Manchester |date=19 March 2012 |access-date=20 March 2012}}</ref>

In [[University Challenge 2006|2006]], Manchester beat [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], to record the university's first win in the competition. The [[University Challenge 2007|next year]], the university finished in second place after losing to the [[University of Warwick]] in the final. In [[University Challenge 2009|2009]], the team battled hard in the final against [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. At the gong, the score was 275 to 190 in favour of Corpus Christi College after a winning performance from [[Gail Trimble]]. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so the team was disqualified.

Manchester reached the semi-finals in the [[University Challenge 2010|2010]] competition before being beaten by [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]. The university did not enter the [[University Challenge 2010–11|2011 series]] for an unknown reason. However, Manchester did enter a year later and won [[University Challenge 2012]].<ref name="challenge" /> Manchester has since defended its title to win [[University Challenge 2013]], beating [[University College London]], 190 to 140.

===Student housing===
[[File:ManUni Accommodation year1.jpg|thumb|[[Ashburne Hall]], a catered accommodation offered mainly to undergraduate students, though some places are reserved for postgraduate students]]
Before they merged, the two former universities had for some time been sharing their residential facilities.

====City Campus====
=====Whitworth Park Halls of Residence=====
Whitworth Park Halls of Residence is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,085 students,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/search/details/?property=54|title=Details (The University of Manchester)|website=www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/summer2016/vacationresidence/ |title=Accommodation available at Whitworth Park Halls |access-date=10 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825231341/http://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/summer2016/vacationresidence/ |archive-date=25 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> located next to [[Whitworth Park]]. It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks which gave rise to the nickname of ’Toblerones’, after the [[Toblerone|chocolate bar]]. Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area, Allan Pluen's team is believed to have saved thousands on the final cost of the halls. They were built in the mid-1970s.

[[File:Whitworth Park Halls.jpg|thumb|Dilworth House, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence]]
The site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names of the halls. Grove House is an older building that has been used by the university for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the [[Manchester University Press]].<ref>Charlton, H. B.(1951) ''Portrait of a University''. Manchester: U. P.; pp.&nbsp;168–69</ref> The shops in Thorncliffe Place were part of the same plan and include banks and a convenience store.
Notable people associated with the halls include [[Friedrich Engels]], whose residence is commemorated by a blue plaque on Aberdeen House; the physicist [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]]; and [[Irene Khan]], Secretary General of Amnesty International.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idlo.int/english/WhoWeAre/Pages/people/ik.htm|title=Irene Khan Biography on the IDLO website|access-date=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120040/http://www.idlo.int/english/WhoWeAre/Pages/people/ik.htm|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=====Sackville Street=====
The former UMIST Campus has four halls of residence near to [[Sackville Street (Manchester)|Sackville Street]] building (Weston, Lambert, Fairfield, and Wright Robinson). Chandos Hall, a former residence, has been closed prior to demolition.

;Other accommodation
Moberly Tower has been demolished. Other residences include Vaughn House, once the home of the clergy serving the Church of the Holy Name, and George Kenyon Hall at University Place; Crawford House and Devonshire House adjacent to the Manchester Business School and Victoria Hall on Upper Brook Street.

'''Grosvenor Campus'''

The Grosvenor Halls of residence was an accommodation campus that was open until summer 2014. It was located just off Oxford Road next to the Manchester Aquatics Centre and opposite the Materials Science building. The Grosvenor Halls consisted of four different accommodation buildings, which were Grosvenor Place, Grosvenor Street Building, Bowden Court and Ronson Hall.

As a City Campus accommodation, Grosvenor Halls enjoyed widespread popularity primarily due to the convenience of its central location to University academic buildings and Manchester city centre. The halls had their own residence association, which organised social events and activities throughout the year to foster its own social community.

During its time, Grosvenor Halls certainly garnered a reputation amongst its occupants for a variety of different reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetab.com/uk/manchester/2014/03/03/things-youd-only-understand-if-you-lived-in-grosvenor-place-4017|title=Things you'd only understand if you lived in Grosvenor Place|date=3 March 2014|website=University of Manchester}}</ref> The accommodation campus continued to remain open until its closure in 2014; with demolition taking place in summer 2015 to make way for a new ‘super’ Engineering campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Manchester's New Engineering Campus |url=https://manchesterhistory.net/manchester/tours/tour9/area9page27.html}}</ref>

====Victoria Park Campus====
[[File:Dalton Ellis 2.jpg|thumb|Dalton-Ellis Hall, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence]]
[[Victoria Park, Manchester|Victoria Park]] Campus comprises several halls of residence. Among these are [[St. Anselm Hall]] with Canterbury Court, [[Dalton-Ellis Hall]], [[Hulme Hall, Manchester|Hulme Hall]] (including Burkhardt House) and Opal Gardens Hall.

====Fallowfield Campus====
The [[Fallowfield Campus]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of the Oxford Road Campus is the largest of the university's residential campuses. The [[Owens Park]] group of halls with a landmark tower is at its centre, while Oak House is another hall of residence. Woolton Hall is next to Oak House. Allen Hall is a traditional hall near [[Ashburne Hall]] (Sheavyn House being annexed to Ashburne). Richmond Park is a recent addition to the campus, as well as Unsworth Park which opened in 2019.
