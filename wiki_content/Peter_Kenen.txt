He was director of the International Finance Section at Princeton from 1971 to 1999. He is best known for his work on the theory of [[optimum currency area]]s, in which he argued that groups of countries with diversified domestic production are more likely to constitute optimum currency areas than groups whose members are highly specialized. He was one of the first to advocate [[floating exchange rate]]s for small countries.<ref>''Comment: The Currency Area Problem'' in R.A. Mundell and A.K. Swoboda (edd.), ''Monetary Problems of the International Economy'' (Chicago, 1969), pp. 95-100. Cf. Tower, Edward, and Thomas D.

Recent publications include ''Regional Monetary Integration'' (with Ellen E. Meade), published in 2008 (Cambridge).  He edited several books, including ''Managing the World Economy'' and ''Understanding Interdependence'', and was co editor of the two volume ''Handbook of International Economics''.
