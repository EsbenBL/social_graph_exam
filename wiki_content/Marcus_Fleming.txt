'''John Marcus Fleming''' (1911&nbsp;– 3 February 1976) was a British economist. He was the deputy director of the research department of the [[International Monetary Fund]] for many years; he was already a member of this department during the period of Canadian economist [[Robert Mundell]]'s affiliation. At approximately the same time as Mundell, Fleming presented similar research on [[economic stability|stabilization]] policy in open economies. As a result, today's textbooks refer to the [[Mundell–Fleming model]]. Mundell's contribution, which assumes perfect rather than imperfect capital mobility is, however, considered more important due to its depth, range, and analytical power, and more applicable to today's conditions.

He was educated at Bathgate Academy and the [[University of Edinburgh]], the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva, and the London School of Economics.
