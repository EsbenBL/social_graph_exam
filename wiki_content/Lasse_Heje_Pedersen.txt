==Work on market and funding liquidity risk==
Lasse H. Pedersen's research shows that investors need to be compensated for incurring trading costs and the risk of rising trading costs. Therefore, securities with higher market liquidity risk have higher required return, as per the liquidity-adjusted CAPM.<ref>Viral Acharya and Lasse Heje Pedersen (2005), "Asset Pricing with Liquidity Risk," Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 375-410. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Elpederse/papers/liquidity_risk.pdf</ref>

Further, many investors face funding constraints (e.g., leverage constraints and margin requirements), and funding liquidity problems affect security prices. Funding constraints raise the required return for securities with high margin requirements <ref>Nicolae Garleanu and Lasse Heje Pedersen (2011), "Margin-Based Asset Pricing and Deviations from the Law of One Price," The Review of Financial Studies, 24(6), 1980-2022. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Elpederse/papers/MarginPricingLoOP.pdf</ref> or low risk.<ref>Andrea Frazzini and Lasse Heje Pedersen (2010), "Betting Against Beta". http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/BettingAgainstBeta.pdf</ref>

His research shows how the interaction between market and funding liquidity risk can create  [[liquidity crisis|liquidity spirals and liquidity crises]].<ref>[[Markus Brunnermeier]] and Lasse H. Pedersen (2009), "Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity," The Review of Financial Studies, 22, 2201-2238. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Elpederse/papers/Mkt_Fun_Liquidity.pdf</ref> Liquidity problems affect the macro economy and imply that monetary authorities can manage leverage and margin requirements as a second monetary tool.<ref>Adam Ashcraft, Nicolae Garleanu, and Lasse H. Pedersen (2010), "Two Monetary Tools: Interest Rates and Haircuts," NBER Macroeconomics Annual, 25, 143-180. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/TwoMonetaryTools.pdf</ref>
