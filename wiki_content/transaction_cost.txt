{{Short description|Cost of making any trade}}
In [[economics]] and related disciplines, a '''transaction cost''' is a [[cost]] in making any economic [[trade]] when participating in a [[Market (economics)|market]].<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/buy-side-firms-use-tca-to-measure-execution-performance/ Buy-side Use TCA to Measure Execution Performance], FIXGlobal, June 2010</ref> [[Oliver E. Williamson]] defines transaction costs as the costs of running an economic system of companies, and unlike production costs, decision-makers determine strategies of companies by measuring transaction costs and production costs. Transaction costs are the total costs of making a transaction, including the cost of planning, deciding, changing plans, resolving disputes, and after-sales. Therefore, the transaction cost is one of the most significant factors in business operation and management.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Young|first=Suzanne|title=Encyclopedia of Corporate Social Responsibility|date=2013|chapter=Transaction Cost Economics|chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28036-8_221|access-date=2020-11-01|website=Springer Link|pages=2547–2552|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28036-8_221|isbn=978-3-642-28035-1}}</ref>

[[Oliver E. Williamson]]'s ''Transaction Cost Economics'' popularized the concept of transaction costs.<ref name=":1" /> [[Douglass C. North]] argues that [[institution]]s, understood as the set of rules in a society, are key in the determination of [[Financial transaction|transaction]] costs. In this sense, institutions that facilitate low transaction costs, boost [[economic growth]].<ref name=":0">North, Douglass C. 1992. “Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance.” San Francisco, CA: ICS Press.
</ref>

Douglass North states that there are four factors that comprise transaction costs – "measurement", "enforcement", "ideological attitudes and perceptions", and "the size of the market".<ref name=":0" /> ''Measurement'' refers to the calculation of the value of all aspects of the good or service involved in the transaction.<ref name=":0" /> ''Enforcement'' can be defined as the need for an unbiased third party to ensure that neither party involved in the transaction reneges on their part of the deal.<ref name=":0" /> These first two factors appear in the concept of ''ideological attitudes and perceptions'', North's third aspect of transaction costs.<ref name=":0" /> Ideological attitudes and perceptions encapsulate each individual's set of values, which influences their interpretation of the world.<ref name=":0" /> The final aspect of transaction costs, according to North, is ''market size'', which affects the partiality or impartiality of transactions.<ref name=":0" />

Transaction costs can be divided into three broad categories:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dahlman|first=Carl J.|year=1979|title=The Problem of Externality|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=22|issue=1|pages=141–162|issn=0022-2186|quote=These, then, represent the first approximation to a workable concept of transaction costs: search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, policing and enforcement costs.|doi=10.1086/466936|s2cid=154906153}}</ref>
* ''[[Search cost|Search and information costs]]'' are costs such as in determining that the required good is available on the market, which has the lowest price, etc.
*''Bargaining and decision costs'' are the costs required to come to an acceptable agreement with the other party to the transaction, drawing up an appropriate [[contract]] and so on. In [[game theory]] this is analyzed for instance in the [[game of chicken]]. On asset markets and in [[organizational economics]], the transaction cost is some function of the distance between the [[supply and demand]].
* ''Policing and enforcement costs'' are the costs of making sure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract, and taking appropriate action (often through the [[legal system]]) if this turns out not to be the case.

For example, the buyer of a used car faces a variety of different transaction costs. The search costs are the costs of finding a car and determining the car's condition. The bargaining costs are the costs of negotiating a price with the seller. The policing and enforcement costs are the costs of ensuring that the seller delivers the car in the promised condition.

== History of development ==

[[Image:Market-Hierarchy-Model.png|300px|right|thumb|The pool shows institutions and market as a possible form of organization to coordinate economic transactions. When the external transaction costs are higher than the internal transaction costs, the company will grow. If the internal transaction costs are higher than the external transaction costs the company will be downsized by outsourcing, for example.]]
The idea that transactions form the basis of an economic thinking was introduced by the [[Institutional economics|institutional economist]] [[John R. Commons]] (1931). He said that:

{{Quote|text=These individual actions are really trans-actions instead of either individual behavior or the "exchange" of commodities. It is this shift from commodities and individuals to transactions and working rules of collective action that marks the transition from the classical and hedonic schools to the institutional schools of economic thinking. The shift is a change in the ultimate unit of economic investigation. The classic and hedonic economists, with their communistic and anarchistic offshoots, founded their theories on the relation of man to nature, but institutionalism is a relation of man to man. The smallest unit of the classic economists was a commodity produced by labor. The smallest unit of the hedonic economists was the same or similar commodity enjoyed by ultimate consumers. One was the objective side, the other the subjective side, of the same relation between the individual and the forces of nature. The outcome, in either case, was the materialistic metaphor of an automatic equilibrium, analogous to the waves of the ocean, but personified as "seeking their level". But the smallest unit of the institutional economists is a unit of activity – a transaction, with its participants. Transactions intervene between the labor of the classic economists and the pleasures of the hedonic economists, simply because it is society that controls access to the forces of nature, and transactions are, not the "exchange of commodities", but the alienation and acquisition, between individuals, of the rights of property and liberty created by society, which must therefore be negotiated between the parties concerned before labor can produce, or consumers can consume, or commodities be physically exchanged".|sign=[[John R. Commons]]|source=''Institutional Economics'', American Economic Review, Vol.21, pp.648-657, 1931}}

The term "transaction cost" is frequently thought to have been coined by [[Ronald Coase]], who used it to develop a theoretical framework for predicting when certain economic tasks would be performed by [[business organizations|firms]], and when they would be performed on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. However, the term is actually absent from his early work up to the 1970s. While he did not coin the specific term, Coase indeed discussed "costs of using the price mechanism" in his 1937 paper ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'', where he first discusses the concept of transaction costs. This is the first time that the concept of transaction costs has been introduced into the study of enterprises and market organizations, but "transaction cost" as a formal theory started in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Ketokivi|first1=Mikko|last2=Mahoney|first2=Joseph T.|date=2017|title=Transaction Cost Economics as a Theory of the Firm, Management, and Governance|url=https://oxfordre.com/business/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190224851.001.0001/acrefore-9780190224851-e-6|access-date=2020-11-01|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Business and Management|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190224851.013.6|isbn=9780190224851}}</ref> And refers to the "Costs of Market Transactions" in his seminal work, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960). The term "Transaction Costs" itself can instead be traced back to the monetary economics literature of the 1950s, and does not appear to have been consciously 'coined' by any particular individual.<ref name="Kissell">[[Robert Kissell]] and [[Morton Glantz]], ''Optimal Trading Strategies'', AMACOM, 2003, pp. 1-23.</ref>

Arguably, transaction cost reasoning became most widely known through [[Oliver E. Williamson]]'s ''Transaction Cost Economics''. Today, transaction cost economics is used to explain a number of different behaviours. Often this involves considering as "transactions" not only the obvious cases of [[buying]] and [[selling]], but also day-to-day emotional interactions, informal [[gift]] exchanges, etc.  Oliver E. Williamson, one of the most cited social scientist at the turn of the century,<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Pessali|first=Huascar F.|date=2006|title=The rhetoric of Oliver Williamson's transaction cost economics|journal=Journal of Institutional Economics|volume=2|issue=1|pages=45–65|doi=10.1017/s1744137405000238|s2cid=59432864|issn=1744-1382}}</ref> was awarded the 2009 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]].<ref>Special Issue of Journal of Retailing in Honor of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009 to Oliver E. Williamson, Volume 86, Issue 3, Pages 209-290 (September 2010). Edited by [[Arne Nygaard]] and [[Robert Dahlstrom]]</ref>

According to Williamson, the determinants of transaction costs are frequency, [[Asset specificity|specificity]], uncertainty, limited rationality, and opportunistic behavior.

At least two definitions of the phrase "transaction cost" are commonly used in literature.  Transaction costs have been broadly defined by [[Steven N. S. Cheung]] as any costs that are not conceivable in a "[[Robinson Crusoe]] economy"—in other words, any costs that arise due to the existence of [[institution]]s.  For Cheung, if the term "transaction costs" were not already so popular in economics literatures, they should more properly be called "institutional costs".<ref name="Cheung">Steven N. S. Cheung "On the New Institutional Economics", ''Contract Economics''</ref><ref name="Werin">L. Werin and H. Wijkander (eds.), Basil Blackwell, 1992, pp. 48-65</ref>  But many economists seem to restrict the definition to exclude costs internal to an organization.<ref name="Demsetz">[[Harold Demsetz]] (2003) “Ownership and the Externality Problem.” In T. L. Anderson and F. S. McChesney (eds.) Property Rights: Cooperation, Conflict, and Law. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press</ref>  The latter definition parallels Coase's early analysis of "costs of the price mechanism" and the origins of the term as a market trading fee.

Starting with the broad definition, many economists then ask what kind of institutions (firms, markets, [[Franchising|franchise]]s, etc.) minimize the transaction costs of producing and distributing a particular good or service. Often these relationships are categorized by the kind of [[contract]] involved.  This approach sometimes goes under the rubric of [[new institutional economics]].

Technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution such as, in particular, distributed ledger technology<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Roeck|first1=Dominik|last2=Sternberg|first2=Henrik|last3=Hofmann|first3=Erik|date=2019|title=Distributed ledger technology in supply chains: a transaction cost perspective|journal=International Journal of Production Research|language=en|volume=58|issue=7|pages=2124–2141|doi=10.1080/00207543.2019.1657247|issn=0020-7543|doi-access=free}}</ref> and blockchains<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lumineau|first1=Fabrice|last2=Wang|first2=Wenqian|last3=Schilke|first3=Oliver|date=2020|title=Blockchain Governance—A New Way of Organizing Collaborations?|journal=Organization Science|volume=32|issue=2|pages=500–521|doi=10.1287/orsc.2020.1379|doi-access=free}}</ref> are likely to reduce transaction costs comparatively to traditional forms of contracting.

== Examples ==
A supplier may bid in a very competitive environment with a customer to build a [[widget (economics)|widget]].  However, to make the widget, the supplier will be required to build specialized machinery which cannot be easily redeployed to make other products.  Once the contract is awarded to the supplier, the relationship between customer and supplier changes from a competitive environment to a [[monopoly]]/[[monopsony]] relationship, known as a [[bilateral monopoly]].  This means that the customer has greater leverage over the supplier such as when price cuts occur.  To avoid these potential costs, "hostages" may be swapped to avoid this event.  These hostages could include partial ownership in the widget factory; revenue sharing might be another way.

Car companies and their suppliers often fit into this category, with the car companies forcing price cuts on their suppliers.  Defense suppliers and the military appear to have the opposite problem, with cost overruns occurring quite often. Technologies like [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) can provide technical support for these strategies.

An example of measurement, one of North's four factors of transaction costs, is detailed in Mancur Olson's work ''Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development'' (1993) – Olson writes that roving bandits calculate the success of their banditry based on how much money they can take from their citizens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=September 1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736}}</ref> Enforcement, the second of North's factors of transaction costs, is exemplified in [[Diego Gambetta]]'s book ''The Sicilian Mafia: the Business of Private Protection'' (1996). Gambetta describes the concept of the "Peppe", who occupies the role of mediator in dealings with the Sicilian mafia – the Peppe is needed because it is not certain that both parties will maintain their end of the deal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sicilian Mafia: the Business of Private Protection|last=Gambetta|first=Diego|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0674807426|pages=15}}</ref> Measurement and enforcement comprise North's third factor, ideological attitudes and perceptions – each individual's views influence how they go about each transaction.<ref name=":0" />

== Differences from neoclassical microeconomics ==

Williamson argues in ''The Mechanisms of Governance'' (1996) that Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) differs from [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical microeconomics]] in the following points:

The transaction costs frameworks reject the notion of [[Instrumental and value rationality|instrumental rationality]] and its implications for predicting behavior. Whereas instrumental rationality assumes that an actor's understanding of the world is the same as the objective reality of the world, scholars who focus on transaction costs note that actors lack perfect information about the world (due to bounded rationality).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|date=1990-10-01|title=A Transaction Cost Theory of Politics|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0951692890002004001|journal=Journal of Theoretical Politics|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=355–367|doi=10.1177/0951692890002004001|s2cid=154451243|issn=0951-6298}}</ref>

==  Game theory ==
In game theory, transaction costs have been studied by Anderlini and Felli (2006).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Anderlini|first1=Luca|last2=Felli|first2=Leonardo|date=2006|title=Transaction Costs and the Robustness of the Coase Theorem*|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=116|issue=508|pages=223–245|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01054.x|s2cid=3059129|issn=1468-0297|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3591/1/Transaction_costs_and_the_robustness_of_the_Coase_Theorem.pdf|doi-access=free}}</ref> They consider a model with two parties who together can generate a surplus. Both parties are needed to create the surplus. Yet, before the parties can negotiate about dividing the surplus, each party must incur transaction costs. Anderlini and Felli find that transaction costs cause a severe problem when there is a mismatch between the parties’ [[bargaining power]]s and the magnitude of the transaction costs. In particular, if a party has large transaction costs but in future negotiations it can seize only a small fraction of the surplus (i.e., its bargaining power is small), then this party will not incur the transaction costs and hence the total surplus will be lost. It has been shown that the presence of transaction costs as modelled by Anderlini and Felli can overturn central insights of the Grossman-Hart-Moore [[theory of the firm]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Daniel|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2016|title=Transaction costs and the property rights approach to the theory of the firm|journal=European Economic Review|volume=87|pages=92–107|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.04.013|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2016|title=The negotiators who knew too much: Transaction costs and incomplete information|journal=Economics Letters|volume=145|pages=33–37|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2016.05.009|doi-access=free}}</ref>

* Frequency of exchange refers to buyer activity in the market or the frequency of transactions between the parties occurs. The higher the frequency of transactions, the higher the relative administrative and bargaining costs.
* Asset specificity consist of site, physical asset, and human asset specificity. The asset specific investment is a specialized investment, which does not have market liquidity. Once the contract is terminated, the asset specific investment cannot to be redeployed. Therefore, a change or termination of this transaction will result in significant loss.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Coggan|first1=Anthea|last2=van Grieken|first2=Martijn|last3=Jardi|first3=Xavier|last4=Boullier|first4=Alexis|date=2017|title=Does asset specificity influence transaction costs and adoption?

* Uncertainty refers to the risks that may occur in a market exchange. The increase of environmental uncertainty will be accompanied by the increase of transaction cost, such as information acquisition cost, supervision cost and bargaining cost.
* Threat of opportunism is attributed to human nature. Opportunistic behavior of vendors can lead to higher transaction coordination costs or even termination of contracts. A company can use governance mechanism to reducing the threat of opportunism.
