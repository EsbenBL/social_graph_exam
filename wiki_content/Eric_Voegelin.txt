'''Eric Voegelin''' (born '''Erich Hermann Wilhelm Vögelin''', {{IPA-de|ˈføːgəliːn|lang}}; 1901–1985) was a German-American [[political philosopher]]. He was born in [[Cologne]], and educated in political science at the [[University of Vienna]], where he became an associate professor of [[political science]] in the law faculty. In 1938 he and his wife fled from the Nazi forces which had entered [[Vienna]]. They emigrated to the United States, where they became citizens in 1944. He spent most of his academic career at [[Louisiana State University]], the [[University of Munich]] and the [[Hoover Institution]] of [[Stanford University]].

==Early life==
Although he was born in [[Cologne]] on January 3, 1901, his parents moved to Vienna in 1910, and he eventually studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. The advisers on his dissertation were [[Hans Kelsen]] and [[Othmar Spann]]. After his [[habilitation]] there in 1928, he taught [[political theory]] and [[sociology]]. In Austria, Voegelin began lasting friendships with [[Alfred Schütz]]<ref>Szakolczai, Arpad. "Eric Voegelin and Alfred Schütz: A Friendship That Lasted a Lifetime" url = http://voegelinview.com/voegelin-schuetz-correspondence-review-pt-1/</ref> and with [[F. A. Hayek]].<ref>Federici, Michael. ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'', ISI Books, 2002, p. 1</ref>

==Career==
As a result of the [[Anschluss]] in 1938, Voegelin was fired from his job. Narrowly avoiding arrest by the [[Gestapo]] and after a brief stay in [[Switzerland]], he arrived in the United States. He taught at various universities before he joined [[Louisiana State University]]'s Department of Government in 1942. Voegelin remained in [[Baton Rouge]] until 1958, when he accepted an offer by [[Munich]]'s [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]] to fill [[Max Weber]]'s former chair in [[political science]], which had been unoccupied since Weber's death in 1920. In Munich, he founded the [[Institut für Politische Wissenschaft]]. Voegelin returned to the United States in 1969 to join [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]] on War, Revolution, and Peace as Henry Salvatori Fellow. There he continued his work until his death. He was a member of the [[Philadelphia Society]].<ref>

==Work==
In his later life Voegelin worked to account for the endemic [[political violence]] of the twentieth century, in an effort variously referred to as a [[philosophy]] of politics, history, or [[consciousness]]. In Voegelin's [[Weltanschauung]], he "blamed a flawed utopian interpretation of Christianity for spawning totalitarian movements like Nazism and Communism."<ref name=VoegelinFlanagan>{{cite journal |journal= The Walrus | first =Marci | last = McDonald |title = The Man Behind Stephen Harper | place = [[Canada|CA]] | url = http://thewalrus.ca/the-man-behind-stephen-harper/?ref=the-man-behind-stephen-harper-tom-flanagan&page= |date=October 2004 | access-date = 2013-01-18}}</ref> Voegelin eschewed any ideological labels or categorizations that readers and followers attempted to impose on his work.

Voegelin published scores of books, essays, and reviews in his lifetime. An early work was ''Die politischen Religionen'' (1938; ''The Political Religions''), on totalitarian ideologies as [[political religion]]s due to their structural similarities to [[religion]]. He wrote the multi-volume (English-language) ''Order and History'', which began publication in 1956 and remained incomplete at the time of his death 29 years later. His 1951 Charles Walgreen lectures, published as ''The New Science of Politics'', is sometimes seen as a prolegomenon to this series, and remains his best known work.  He left many manuscripts unpublished, including a history of political ideas, which has since been published in eight volumes.

''Order and History'' was originally conceived as a five-volume examination of the history of order occasioned by Voegelin's personal experience of the disorder of his time. The first three volumes, ''Israel and Revelation'', ''The World of the Polis'', and ''Plato and Aristotle'', appeared in rapid succession in 1956 and 1957 and focused on the evocations of order in the ancient [[Near East]] and Greece.

Voegelin then encountered difficulties which slowed down the publication. This, combined with his university administrative duties and work related to the new institute, meant that seventeen years separated the fourth from the third volume. His new concerns were indicated in the 1966 German collection Anamnesis: ''Zur Theorie der Geschichte und Politik''. The fourth volume, ''The Ecumenic Age'', appeared in 1974. It broke with the chronological pattern of the previous volumes by investigating symbolizations of order ranging in time from the [[Kings of Sumeria|Sumerian King List]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. Work on the final volume, ''In Search of Order'', occupied Voegelin's final days and it was published posthumously in 1987.
{{Original research inline |date=October 2007}}

One of Voegelin's main points in his later work is that our experience of transcendence conveys a sense of order. Although transcendence can never be fully defined or described, it may be conveyed in symbols. A particular sense of transcendent order serves as a basis for a particular political order. A philosophy of consciousness can therefore become a philosophy of politics. Insights may become fossilised as dogma.

Voegelin is more interested in the [[ontological]] issues that arise from these experiences than the epistemological questions of how we know that a vision of order is true or not. For Voegelin, the essence of truth is trust. All philosophy begins with experience of the divine. Since God is experienced as good, one can be confident that reality is knowable. Given the possibility of knowledge, Voegelin holds there are two modes: intentionality and luminosity.  Visions of order belong to the latter category. The truth of any vision is confirmed by its orthodoxy, by what Voegelin jokingly calls its lack of originality.

Voegelin's work does not fit in any standard classifications, although some of his readers{{Who|date=December 2017}} have found similarities in it to contemporaneous works by, for example, [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. Voegelin often invents terms or uses old ones in new ways. However, there are patterns in his work with which the reader can quickly become familiar.

Among indications of growing engagement with Voegelin's work are the 305 page international bibliography published in 2000 by Munich's [[Wilhelm Fink Verlag]]; the presence of dedicated research centers at universities in the United States, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom; the appearance of recent translations in languages ranging from Portuguese to Japanese; and the publishing of a 34 volume collection of his primary works by the [[University of Missouri]] Press and various primary and secondary works offered by the ''Eric-Voegelin-Archiv'' of [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]].

==On Gnosticism==
In his ''The New Science of Politics'', ''Order and History'', and ''Science, Politics and Gnosticism'', Voegelin opposed what he believed to be unsound [[Gnostic]] influences in politics. He defined [[gnosis]] as "a purported direct, immediate apprehension or vision of truth without the need for critical reflection; the special gift of a spiritual and cognitive elite."{{Sfn | Webb | 1981 | p = 282 | ps =: 'According to Voegelin, the claim to gnosis may take intellectual, emotional, and volitional forms.'}}  Gnosticism is a "type of thinking that claims absolute cognitive mastery of reality. Relying as it does on a claim to gnosis, gnosticism considers its knowledge not subject to criticism. Gnosticism may take transcendentalizing (as in the case of the Gnostic movement of late antiquity) or immanentizing forms (as in the case of Marxism)."

Apart from the Classical Christian writers against heresy, his sources on Gnosticism were [[secondary source|secondary]] since the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] were not yet widely available. For example, Voegelin used [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], and [[Hans Jonas]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Voegelin | first = Eric | editor1-last = Sandoz | editor1-first = Ellis | editor1-link = Ellis Sandoz | editor2-first = Gilbert | editor2-last = Weiss | editor3-last = Petropoulos | editor3-first = William | title = The Collected Works | publisher = Louisiana State University Press | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-8071-1826-5}}.</ref>

Voegelin perceived similarities between ancient Gnosticism and [[modernist]] political theories, particularly [[Communism]] and [[Nazism]]. He identified the root of the Gnostic impulse as [[social alienation|alienation]], that is, a sense of disconnection from society and a belief that this lack is the result of the inherent disorder, or even evil, of the world. That alienation has two effects:
* The first is the belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight, learning, or knowledge, called a ''Gnostic Speculation'' by Voegelin (the Gnostics themselves referred to that as ''[[gnosis]]'').
* The second is the desire to implement and or create a policy to actualize the speculation, or ''[[Immanentize the Eschaton]]'': to create a sort of [[World to come|heaven on earth]] within history.

According to Voegelin, the Gnostics really reject the Christian eschaton of the kingdom of God and replace it with a human form of salvation through esoteric ritual or practice.

The primary feature that characterizes a tendency as gnostic for Voegelin is that it is motivated by the notion that the world and humanity can be fundamentally transformed and perfected through the intervention of a chosen group of people (an elite), a man-god, or men-Gods. The ''[[Übermensch]]'' is the chosen one who has a kind of special knowledge (like magic or science) about how to perfect human existence.

That stands in contrast to a notion of redemption that is achieved through the reconciliation of mankind with the divine. [[Marxism]], therefore, qualifies as "gnostic" because it purports that the perfect society on earth can be established once capitalism has been overthrown by the proletariat. Likewise, Nazism is seen as "gnostic" because it posits that utopia can be achieved by attaining racial purity once the master race has freed itself of the racially inferior and the degenerate.

In both cases specifically analyzed by Voegelin, the totalitarian impulse is derived from the alienation of the individuals from the rest of society. That leads to a desire to dominate (''libido dominandi''), which has its roots in the Gnostic's conviction of the imperative of his vision but also in his lack of concord with a large body of his society. As a result, there is very little regard for the welfare of those who are harmed by the resulting politics, which ranges from coercive to calamitous (such as the English proverb: "You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet" or its Russian variety: "When you chop wood, chips fly").

Because Voegelin applied the concept of gnosis to a wide array of ideologies and movements such as Marxism, communism, National Socialism, progressivism, liberalism, and humanism,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new science of politics : an introduction|last=1901-1985.|first=Voegelin, Eric|date=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226861142|edition=Pbk.|location=Chicago|pages=128ff., 173ff|oclc=16992786}}</ref> critics have proposed that Voegelin's concept of Gnosis lacks theoretical precision.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secular Religion A Polemic against the Misinterpretation of Modern Social Philosophy, Science and Politics as "New Religions"|last=Hans|first=Kelsen|others=Walter, Robert, Jabloner, Clemens, Zeleny, Klaus, Franz-Steiner-Verlag Stuttgart|isbn=9783515117609|edition=2.

Rather, the term "Gnosticism" as used by Voegelin is more of an invective just as "when on the lowest level of propaganda those who do not conform with one's own opinion are smeared as communists."<ref>{{Cite book|title=A new science of politics : Hans Kelsen's reply to Eric Voegelin's "New science of politics" : a contribution to the critique of ideology|last=1881–1973.|first=Kelsen, Hans|publisher=Ontos Verlag|others=Voegelin, Eric, 1901–1985., Arnold, Eckhart.|year=2004|isbn=9783110327373|location=Frankfurt|pages=107|oclc=607253659}}</ref>

===Immanentizing the eschaton===
{{Main|Immanentize the eschaton}}

One of his most quoted passages (by such figures as [[William F. Buckley Jr.]])<ref>Buckley Jr., William F. ''Cancel Your Own Goddam Subscription: Notes & Asides from National Review'', Basic Books, 2007, pp. 23–24</ref> is:

{{quote|The problem of an [[theory of forms|eidos]] in history, hence, arises only when a Christian [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] fulfillment becomes immanentized.  Such an immanentist [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] of the [[eschatology|eschaton]], however, is a theoretical fallacy.{{Sfn | Voegelin | 1987 | p = 120}}}}

From this comes the [[catchphrase]]: "Don't [[immanentize the eschaton]]!", which simply means: "Do not try to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now" or "Don't try to create Heaven on Earth."

When Voegelin uses the term ''gnosis'' negatively, it is to reflect the word as found in the [[Manichaeism]] and [[Valentinianism]] of antiquity. As it is later then immanentized (or manifest) in modernity in the wake of [[Joachim of Fiore]] and in the various ideological movements outlined in his works.{{Sfn | Voegelin | 1987 | loc = chap. 4}} Voegelin also builds on the term "Gnosticism" as it is defined by [[Hans Jonas]] in his ''The Gnostic Religion'', in reference to [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s Gnosticism, which is to have an understanding and control over reality that makes mankind as powerful as the role of God in reality.

Voegelin was arguing from a Hellenistic position that good ''gnosis'' is derived from ''[[pistis]]'' (faith) and that the pagan tradition made a false distinction between faith and ''[[wikt:noesis|noesis]]''. Furthermore, the dualist perspective was the very essence of gnosticism via the misuse of ''[[noema]]'' and caused a destructive division between the internal and external world in human [[consciousness]]. To reconcile the internal ([[subjectivism|subjective]]) and external ([[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objective]]) world of consciousness was the restoration of order.<ref>Voegelin, Eric, ''The ecumenic age, order & History'', vol. 4, esp. Introduction & chap. 5.</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = The collected works | first = Eric | last = Voegelin | author-link = Eric Voegelin | volume = 17 | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Franz | publisher = University of Missouri Press | year = 2000}}.</ref>

===Social alienation===
Voegelin identified the root of the Gnostic impulse as [[social alienation|alienation]], (a sense of disconnection with society) and a belief that the disconnection is the result of the inherent disorder or even evil of the world. The alienation has two effects:
* The belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight, learning, or knowledge, called a ''Gnostic Speculation'' by Voegelin (the Gnostics themselves referred to it as ''gnosis'').
* The desire to create and implement a policy to actualize the speculation, or as Voegelin described it, to ''[[Immanentize the Eschaton]]'', to create a sort of heaven on earth within history by triggering the [[Apocalypse]]{{Citation needed | date = December 2013}}.

Voegelin's conception of ''gnosis'', and his analysis of Gnosticism in general was criticized by [[Eugene Webb]]. In the article "Voegelin's Gnosticism Reconsidered," Webb explained that Voegelin's concept of Gnosticism was conceived "not primarily to describe ancient phenomena but to help us understand some modern ones for which the evidence is a great deal clearer."{{Sfn | Webb | 2005}}{{Page needed | date = December 2013}}  Webb continues, "the category (of Gnosticism) is of limited usefulness for the purpose to which he put it... and the fact that the idea of Gnosticism as such has become so problematic and complex in recent years must at the very least undercut Voegelin's effort to trace a historical line of descent from ancient sources to the modern phenomena he tried to use them to illuminate."{{Sfn | Webb | 2005}}{{Page needed | date = December 2013}}

===Spiritual revival===
Voegelin's work does not lay out a program of reform or offer a doctrine of recovery from what he termed the "demono-maniacal" in modern politics. However, interspersed in his writings is the idea of a spiritual recovery of the primary experiences of divine order.  He was not interested so much in what religious dogmas might result in personal salvation but rather a recovery of the human in the classical sense of the ''daimonios aner'' (Plato's term for "the spiritual man"). He did not speculate on the institutional forms in which a spiritual recovery might take place but expressed confidence that the current 500-year cycle of secularism would come to an end because he stated that "you cannot deny the human forever."{{Citation needed | date = December 2013}}

In an essay published in 1965,<ref>"In Search of the Ground", ''Published Essays, 1953—1965'', p 239 (Collected Works Vol 11)</ref> Voegelin suggested that the Soviet Union would collapse from within because of its historical roots in philosophy and Christianity. Later, at an informal talk given at University College, Dublin, Ireland in 1972,<ref>The Irish Dialogue with Eric Voegelin: Eric Voegelin informal talk at University College, Dublin in 1972, recorded and transcribed by Brendan Purcell. The recording and transcript are available at VoegelinView. http://voegelinview.com/the-irish-dialogue-with-eric-voegelin-pt1/</ref> Voegelin suggested the Soviet Union might collapse by 1980 because of its failure to succeed in its domestic commitments and external political challenges.
