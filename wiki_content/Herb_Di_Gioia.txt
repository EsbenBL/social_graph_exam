'''Herb Di Gioia''' is an Italian, American [[documentary film|documentary film director]] who pioneered the field of "observational cinema" in his work and impacted [[visual anthropology|ethnographic film making]] through his contributions as a teacher at [[United Kingdom|Britain]]â€™s [[National Film and Television School]]. Di Gioia's films are recognized as a significant departure from the better-known works of other observational documentarians, like David and Judith MacDougall.<ref name="var">Grimshaw, Anna.

==Work==
The [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]-educated Di Gioia was not an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] by profession, but was drawn to the field by an interest in exploring the lives of ordinary people.<ref>{{cite book | last =Grimshaw | first =Anna  | title =The Ethnographers Eye: Ways of Seeing in Anthropology | publisher =Cambridge UP  | pages = 129 | isbn = 0-521-77475-6}}</ref> In the early 1970s, Di Gioia and his partner David Hancock became involved in the work of filmmaker Norman Miller, upon whom the [[National Science Foundation]] had bestowed a grant to produce a film series examining global ecological zones. Di Gioia and Hancock produced several films in [[Afghanistan]] which were incorporated into the ''Faces of Change'' Collection.<ref name="var"/>

After the death of his partner, Di Gioia focused predominantly on teaching, training anthropologyand filmmaking students at the University of Illinois Chicago's Visual Anthropology MA program in the Anthropology Department in the mid to late 1970's, then at the National Film and Television School in ethnographic filmmaking.<ref>{{cite book | last =Grimshaw  | first = Anna  |author2=Amanda Ravetz  | title = Visualizing Anthropology  | publisher = Intellect Books  | location = Bristol  | pages = 22  | isbn = 1-84150-112-3}}</ref>
