'''C. Daniel Batson''' (born March 15, 1943<ref>''U.S. Public Records Index'', Vol 1 & 2 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010.</ref>) is an [[United States|American]] social psychologist. He has two doctoral degrees, in theology (from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]) and psychology (from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]]). Batson obtained his doctorate under [[John M. Darley|John Darley]] and taught at the [[University of Kansas]]. He retired in 2006 and now is an emeritus professor in the psychology department at the University of Tennessee. He is best known for his contributions to three fields: the social psychology of [[altruism]], [[empathic concern]], and [[psychology of religion]].

==On altruism==
Batson has become well known for the [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis, which states that "feeling empathy for [a] person in need evokes motivation to help [that person] in which these benefits to self are not the ultimate goal of helping; they are unintended consequences" (Batson & Shaw 1991, p.&nbsp;114). The theory, initially proposed as an explanation of the so-called "empathy-helping relationship", implies that pure [[altruism]] is possible and that [[psychological egoism]] is false. Indeed, Aronson, Wilson and Akert (2005) have described Batson as "the strongest proponent that people often help others purely out of the goodness of their hearts" (Aronson et al., 2005, p362). Batson has published [[experimental research]] to support the empathy-altruism hypothesis against various alternative egoistic explanations. Critics who believe that all apparently altruistic actions are actually egoistic have attacked the theory (see, for example, the competing [[Negative-state relief model|negative state relief model]]). More on the empathy-altruism hypothesis can be found in a number of social psychology textbooks, including Brehm and Kassin (1996).

Batson is also the co-author of an often-cited study examining bystander intervention in theology students (Darley & Batson, 1973). In this study, students' religious views and personalities did not correlate with their willingness to help a needy bystander. Rather, the best predictor of whether a student would stop to help was how hurried they felt. Since some students were assigned work on the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]], and the assignment had no effect on their behavior, the study has been cited as evidence that exposure to the parable does not make people more helpful. There has been debate about whether Batson used appropriate statistics to analyze this study (Greenwald, 1975).

==On empathy==
Work in [[social psychology]] has for a long time been interested in the distinction between imagining the other and imagining oneself, and in particular in the emotional and motivational consequences of these two perspectives. A number of Batson's studies documented that focusing on another's feelings may evoke stronger [[empathic concern]], while explicitly putting oneself into the target's shoes induces both empathic concern and [[personal distress]]. In one such study, Batson and colleagues investigated the affective consequences of different perspective-taking instructions when participants listened to a story about Katie Banks, a young college student struggling after the death of her parents.<ref>Batson, C. D., Early, S., & Salvarini, G. (1997). Perspective taking: imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel. Personality & Social Personality Bulletin, 23, 751-758.</ref> This study demonstrated that different instructions had distinct effects on how participants perceived the target’s situation. Notably, participants imagining themselves in Katie’s place showed stronger signs of discomfort and personal distress than participants focusing on her responses and feelings, or participants instructed to take an objective, detached point of view. Also, both perspective-taking instructions differed from the detached perspective by resulting in higher empathic concern. This may help explain why observing a need situation does not always produce [[prosocial behavior]]: if perceiving another person in an emotionally or physically painful circumstance elicits personal distress, the observer may tend not to fully attend to the other's experience and as a result may not behave sympathetically.

Batson recently collaborated with [[University of Chicago]] neuroscientist [[Jean Decety]] on a study using [[functional neuroimaging]] to investigate the neural underpinnings of [[empathy]] and personal distress.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.42 | last1 = Lamm | first1 = C. | last2 = Batson | first2 = C.D. | last3 = Decety | first3 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 42–58 | pmid = 17214562 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.511.3950 | s2cid = 2828843 }}</ref> While being scanned, participants watched a series of video clips of patients undergoing painful medical treatment. They were asked to either put themselves explicitly in the shoes of the patient (imagine self), or to focus on their feelings and affective expressions (imagine other). The behavioral data confirmed that explicitly projecting oneself into an aversive situation leads to higher personal distress whereas focusing on the [[emotional]] and behavioral reactions of another's plight yields greater empathic concern and less personal distress. The neuroimaging data were consistent with this finding and provided insights into the neural correlates of these distinct behavioral responses. The self-perspective evoked stronger hemodynamic responses in brain regions involved in coding the motivational-affective dimensions of pain, including bilateral insular cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala, and various structures involved in motor preparation. The [[amygdala]] plays a critical role in the evaluation of actual or potential threats. Imagining oneself in a painful and potentially dangerous situation thus might have triggered a stronger fearful and/or aversive response than imagining someone else in the same situation.

==On religion==
Batson's most famous{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} contribution to the psychology of religion is his argument that the traditional distinction made by [[Gordon Allport]] (Allport & Ross, 1967)<ref>Allport, G. W., & Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious orientation and prejudice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-433.</ref> between intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientations{{clarify|date=May 2013}} does not exhaust all possible religious orientations; rather, he believes it is important to refer to what he calls Quest, a form of religiosity that views questions and their answers as of equal importance (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991a; 1991b). This view has been controversial, and critics have questioned whether Quest really correlates with any other variable germane to religiosity. Batson has also written about religious experiences, defending a four-stage model based on [[Graham Wallas]]'s four-stage model of problem-solving in the psychology of [[creativity]] (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).
