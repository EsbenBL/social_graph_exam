== Education ==
Browning received his undergraduate education at the [[London School of Economics]] and his doctorate from [[Tilburg University]].<ref name=Ox_bio />

== Career ==
He was previously the Director of the Center for Applied Microeconometrics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Before the appointment at University of Copenhagen, he was a Professor at [[McMaster University]], [[Canada]].

== Research ==
His work is in [[microeconomic]] analysis, with emphasis in the [[empirical]] assessments of theoretical propositions. He has worked in the areas of [[Intra-household bargaining|intrahousehold decision making]]; [[demand]] [[analysis]]; consumption and saving, and its interaction with labor supply. An important part of his work concerns the empirical assessment of rationality through the concept of [[revealed preference]], and the modeling of individual [[heterogeneity]] in applied work.
