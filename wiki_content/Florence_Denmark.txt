== Involvement with women's issues ==
Denmark has made significant strides for the field of psychology in the areas of gender differences and feminism. In her article "Women and Psychology", Denmark explores the gender differences when working in psychology at an international level.<ref name="Internat">{{cite journal|last1=Denmark|first1=Florence|title=Women and Psychology: An international perspective|journal=American Psychologist|date=Apr 1998|volume=53|issue=4|pages=465–473|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.53.4.465|pmid=9572010}}<!--|access-date=11 Apr 2016--></ref> She notes that while the gender gap has been lessened in recent years, there is still much room for improvement when it comes to sexism. In other studies,<ref name="Empower">{{cite journal|last1=Denmark|first1=Florence|title=Women, Leadership, and Empowerment|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|date=Sep 1993|volume=17|issue=3|pages=343–356|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1993.tb00491.x|s2cid=143122052}}</ref> Denmark found that when it comes to roles of higher status, women are also sexist towards women. This, according to Denmark, may also be a symptom of being exposed to sexism and undervaluing of women.

While she has spoken on behalf of women and the feminism movement, she also worked towards defeating the gender bias toward participants in psychological studies. The gender bias in research may have produced inaccurate results in many studies. Denmark's work has helped to provide valid results.<ref name="Engender">{{cite journal|last1=Denmark|first1=Florence|title=Engendering Psychology|journal=American Psychologist|date=Apr 1994|volume=49|issue=4|pages=329–334|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.49.4.329|pmid=8203804}}<!--|access-date=11 Apr 2016--></ref> Denmark has also published "Guidelines for Avoiding Sexism in Psychological Research" with a few of her colleagues. In this work, Denmark and her colleagues lay out a series of problems that emerge as a result of sexism in experimental psychology. Then, they laid out examples of what the problems might have looked like in psychology studies, and they suggested ways to solve the problems. It is important that in research, the processes that are used to select participants and the processes used to analyze the data are equal when it comes to sexes. When sexism plays a part in these processes, there is a high likelihood that sex differences are not included in the results, which could greatly affect treatment options.<ref name="Guide">{{cite journal|last1=Denmark|first1=Florence|title=Guidelines for avoiding sexism in psychological research: A report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Nonsexist Research|journal=American Psychologist|date=Jul 1988|volume=43|issue=7|pages=582–587|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.43.7.582}}<!--|access-date=28 Apr 2016--></ref>
