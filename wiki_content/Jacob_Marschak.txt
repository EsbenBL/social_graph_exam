'''Jacob Marschak''' (23 July 1898 – 27 July 1977) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]].

== Life ==
Born in a Jewish family of [[Kiev]], Jacob Marschak (until 1933 Jakob) was the son of a [[jeweller]]. During his studies he joined the [[social democratic]] [[Menshevik Party]], becoming a member of the Menshevik International Caucus. In 1918 he was the labor minister in the [[Terek Soviet Republic]]. In 1919 he emigrated to Germany, where he studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]].

In 1922–1926 he was a journalist, and in 1928 he joined the new [[Kiel]] ''[[Institut für Weltwirtschaft]]''. With the gathering Nazi storm, he emigrated to England, where he went to [[Oxford]] to teach at the Oxford Institute of Statistics, which was funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], allowing him to emigrate in 1940 to the United States. After teaching at the [[New School for Social Research]], in 1943 he went to [[University of Chicago]], where he led the [[Cowles Commission]]. He followed the commission's move to [[Yale University]], then became [[emeritus]] at [[UCLA]].

In 1972 he co-founded [[Team Theory]] with [[Roy Radner]].

Marschak was fluent in approximately one dozen languages.  Shortly before he was due to become president of the [[American Economic Association]], he died from a cardiac arrest.
