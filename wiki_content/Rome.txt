According to the [[founding myth]] of the city by the Ancient Romans themselves,<ref name="livy1797">{{cite book |publisher=Printed for A.Strahan |last=Livy |others=George Baker (trans.) |title=The history of Rome |year=1797}}</ref> the long-held tradition of the origin of the name ''Roma'' is believed to have come from the city's founder and first [[Rex (king)|king]], [[Romulus]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509038/Romulus-and-Remus |title=Romulus and Remus |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=25 November 2014 |access-date=9 March 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317100831/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509038/Romulus-and-Remus |archive-date=17 March 2015}}</ref>

However, it is a possibility that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.<ref>Cf. Jaan Puhvel: ''Comparative mythology.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London 1989, p. 287.</ref> As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name ''Roma''. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:<ref>Claudio Rendina: ''Roma Ieri, Oggi, Domani''. Newton Compton, Roma, 2007, p. 17.</ref>
* from ''Rumon'' or ''Rumen'', archaic name of the [[Tiber]], which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb ῥέω (''rhéō'') 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb ''ruō'' 'to hurry, rush';{{efn|This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]]. However, the Greek verb descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/srew-|''*srew-'']] (compare Ancient Greek ῥεῦμα (''rheûma'') 'a stream, flow, current', the Thracian river name Στρυμών (''Strumṓn'') and Proto-Germanic ''*strauma-'' 'stream'; if it was related, however, the Latin river name would be expected to begin with **''Frum-'', like Latin ''[[wikt:frigeo|frīgeō]]'' 'to freeze' from the root ''*sreyHg-'') and the Latin verb from [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₃rew-|''*h₃rew-'']].}}
* from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word 𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀 (''ruma''), whose root is ''*rum-'' "teat", with possible reference either to the [[Founding of Rome#The legend|totem wolf that adopted and suckled]] the cognately named twins [[Romulus and Remus]], or to the shape of the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill]]s;

===Earliest history===
{{Main|Founding of Rome}}
While there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] sites.<ref name="Heiken, G. 2005" /> Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from [[pastoralism|pastoral]] settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] built above the area of the future [[Roman Forum]]. Between the end of the [[Bronze Age]] and the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).<ref name=coa9>Coarelli (1984) p. 9</ref> However, none of them yet had an urban quality.<ref name=coa9 /> Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation ("[[synoecism]]") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.<ref name=coa9 /> This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the [[Subsistence economy|subsistence level]], which also allowed the establishment of [[secondary sector|secondary]] and [[tertiary sector|tertiary activities]]. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly [[Ischia]] and [[Cumae]]).<ref name=coa9 /> These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the "birth" of the city.<ref name=coa9 /> Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.<ref name="foundation">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12rome.html |title=More Clues in the Legend (or Is It Fact?) of Romulus |first=John Nobel |last=Wilford |date=12 June 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=11 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112437/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12rome.html |archive-date=17 April 2009}}</ref>

====Legend of the founding of Rome====
[[File:Kapitolinische Wölfin Museum Capitolini.jpg|thumb|''[[Capitoline Wolf]]'', a sculpture of the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|mythical she-wolf]] suckling the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]]]]

Traditional stories handed down by the [[ancient Romans]] themselves explain the earliest [[History of Rome|history of their city]] in terms of [[legend]] and [[myth]]. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], is the story of [[Romulus and Remus]], the twins who were suckled by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]].<ref name="livy1797" /> They decided to build a city, but after an argument, [[Romulus]] killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman [[annalist]]s, this happened on 21 April 753 BC.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=73}} This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the [[Trojan War|Trojan refugee]] [[Aeneas]] escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son [[Ascanius|Iulus]], the namesake of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].<ref name="livy2005">{{Cite book |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |isbn=978-0-14-196307-5 |last=Livy |title=The Early History of Rome |year=2005}}</ref>
This was accomplished by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] in the first century BC. In addition, [[Strabo]] mentions an older story, that the city was an [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadian]] colony founded by [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]]. Strabo also writes that [[Lucius Coelius Antipater]] believed that Rome was founded by Greeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.3 |title=Strabo, Geography, book 5, chapter 3, section 3 |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=21 February 2021 |archive-date=1 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301151855/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.3 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5C*.html |title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book V Chapter 3 |website=penelope.uchicago.edu |access-date=20 February 2021 |archive-date=29 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529132904/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5C%2A.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Monarchy and republic===
{{Main|Ancient Rome|Roman Kingdom|Roman Republic|Roman Empire}}
After the foundation by Romulus according to a legend,{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=73}} Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin, later by [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=73}}
[[File:Palatino (Palatine Hill, Rome).jpg|thumb|The Ancient-Imperial-Roman palaces of the Palatine, a series of palaces located in the [[Palatine Hill]], express power and wealth of emperors from Augustus until the 4th century.]]

In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[republic]]. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}

The third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264–146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212–168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-85}}

From the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} and the war against [[Jugurtha]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} there was [[Sulla's first civil war|a first civil war]] between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} A [[Third Servile War|major slave revolt]] under [[Spartacus]] followed,{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}}{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}} and then the establishment of the [[first Triumvirate]] with [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}}
[[File:Trajansmärkte Forum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial fora]] belong to a series of ''monumental fora'' (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors. Also seen in the image is [[Trajan's Market]].]]

The conquest of [[Gaul]] made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a [[Caesar's Civil War|second civil war]] against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory, Caesar established himself as [[Dictator perpetuo|dictator for life]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}} His assassination led to a [[second Triumvirate]] among [[Octavian]] (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], and to [[Final War of the Roman Republic|another civil war]] between Octavian and Antony.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=93}}

===Empire===
In 27 BC, Octavian became ''[[princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' and took the title of [[Augustus]], founding the [[principate]], a [[diarchy]] between the ''princeps'' and the senate.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=93}} During the reign of [[Nero]], two thirds of the city was ruined after the [[Great Fire of Rome]], and the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] commenced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/great-fire-rome-background/1446/|title=The Great Fire of Rome {{!}} Background {{!}} Secrets of the Dead {{!}} PBS|date=29 May 2014|website=Secrets of the Dead|language=en-US|access-date=7 April 2019|archive-date=4 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404105016/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/great-fire-rome-background/1446/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/jul19/great-fire-rome/ |title=Great Fire of Rome |last=Society |first=National Geographic |date=18 June 2014 |website=National Geographic Society |language=en |access-date=7 April 2019 |archive-date=30 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330173019/https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/jul19/great-fire-rome/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome : civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean |last=Freeman |first=Charles |isbn=978-0-19-965191-7 |edition=Third |location=Oxford |oclc=868077503 |date=March 2014}}</ref> Rome was established as a [[de facto]] empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor [[Trajan]]. Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the known world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period.

[[File:Rione X Campitelli, 00186 Roma, Italy - panoramio (128).jpg|thumb|right|[[Trajan's Column]], triumphal column and place where the relics of [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] are placed.]]
After the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into a 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260 to 274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions – Britain, Spain, and North Africa – were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}
Emperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]] which did not last. He or Constantine regionalised the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 "Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they, in turn, appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}

[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Gaius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]
After the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306–313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325–330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which, however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}

Christianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}

Rome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which were repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443, and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160–179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. The population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, the population dropped to 30,000 but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]].<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321–1308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184–185</ref> The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).

The Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the [[Catholic Church]].

After the [[Lombard invasion of Italy#Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula|Lombard invasion of Italy]] (569–572), the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality, the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between [[Byzantine Empire|the Byzantines]], the [[Franks]], and the [[Lombards]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} In 729, the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] donated the north Latium town of [[Sutri]] to the Church, starting its temporal power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} In 756, [[Pepin the Short]], after having defeated the Lombards, gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], thus creating the [[Papal States]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} Since this period, three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility (together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace), and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius, and Emperor.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} These three parties (theocratic, republican, and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} On Christmas night of 800, [[Charlemagne]] was crowned in Rome as emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Pope Leo III]]: on that occasion, the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}}

These were the times of [[Theodora (senatrix)|Theodora]] and her daughter [[Marozia]], concubines and mothers of several popes, and of [[Crescentius the Younger|Crescentius]], a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors [[Otto II]] and [[Otto III]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} The scandals of this period forced the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}}

During this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''senatore'' or ''patrizio''. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the [[Medieval commune|commune]], a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Pope [[Lucius II]] fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor [[Pope Eugenius III]]: by this stage, the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by [[Arnaldo da Brescia]], a monk who was a religious and social reformer.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by [[Adrianus IV]], which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Under [[Pope Innocent III]], whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a ''Senatore'', who was subject to the pope.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}

In this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in [[Western Europe]], often acting as arbitrators between Christian [[monarch]]s and exercising additional political powers.<ref name="Faus">Faus, José Ignacio Gonzáles.

In 1266, [[Charles of Anjou]], who was heading south to fight the [[Hohenstaufen]] on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator. Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}

[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309–1377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377–1418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

===Early modern history===
{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}
[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband Städtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]
[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]
[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]

In 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}
This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]], to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period ("the century of Leo X"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

During those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].

The period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.

The Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503–1513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].

In this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Basilica of St. Peter |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 February 1912 |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110133607/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |archive-date=10 January 2010}}</ref> (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.

Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

Beginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}

This was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

===Late modern and contemporary===
The rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798–1800), which was established under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''Département'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''Département du Tibre'' (1808–1810) and then as ''Département Rome'' (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.

In 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.

Rome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archive-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.

[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]

Soon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cederna |first1=Antonio |title=Mussolini urbanista |date=1979 |publisher=Laterza |location=Bari |pages=passim |language=it}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943, the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|was arrested on 25 July 1943]]. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on 4 June 1944.

Rome developed greatly after the war as part of the "[[Italian economic miracle]]" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' ("the sweet life"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecittà|Cinecittà Studios]]. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.

==Government==
{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}

===Local government===
Rome constitutes a comune ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''"Roma Capitale"'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode |title=Roma diventa Capitale |access-date=6 March 2012 |language=it|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode |archive-date=5 February 2012}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the ''comune'' is the ''Palazzo Senatorio'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as ''"Campidoglio"'', the Italian name of the hill.

====Administrative and historical subdivisions====
[[File:Roma - Municipi numerata.png|thumb|The ''municipi'' of Rome]]
[[File:Piazza della repubblica hdr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Piazza della Repubblica, Rome]]]]

Since 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called ''municipi'' (sing. ''municipio'') (until 2001 named ''circoscrizioni'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Territorio |publisher=Comune di Roma |access-date=5 October 2009 |url=http://www.comune.roma.it/was/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_21L?menuPage=/Area_di_navigazione/Sezioni_del_portale/Dipartimenti_e_altri_uffici/Dipartimento_XV/www-9-romastatistica-9-it/Territorio/&flagSub= |language=it}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,<ref>In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]</ref> and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roma, sì all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15 |url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml# |access-date=13 March 2013 |newspaper=Il Messaggero |date=11 March 2013|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064219/http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml |archive-date=16 March 2013}}</ref>

Rome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The "Rioni" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519060423/http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |archive-date=19 May 2009 }}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.

A new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no serious changes in the organisation of the city until 1870 when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni were created (the last one was Prati – the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] – in 1921). Afterwards, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term "quartiere" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').

===Metropolitan and regional government===
Rome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|provincia di Roma]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.<ref>Artour.

===National government===
[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]

Rome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.

==Geography==
===Location===
Rome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.

Although the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=it |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.

===Topography===
[[File:Rome by Sentinel-2, 2020-12-21.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]
[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of part of Rome's ''Centro Storico'']]
Throughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' ("GRA"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.

The ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marshland which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.

As a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.

The size of the city at the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]] is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.<ref>N.Morley, ''Metropolis and Hinterland'' (Cambridge, 1996) 33–39</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=978-0-534-57168-9|url=https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/149 |url-access=registration |page=149|edition=Third}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Storey |first=Glenn R. |year=1997 |title=The population of ancient Rome |journal=Antiquity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=71 |issue=274 |pages=966–978 |doi=10.1017/s0003598x00085859 |issn=0003-598X|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Oates |first=Whitney J. |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CP/29/2/Population_of_Rome*.html |title=The Population of Rome |journal=Classical Philology |publisher=University of Chicago Press |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1934 |issn=0009-837X |doi=10.1086/361701 |pages=101–116 |s2cid=154126945 |access-date=20 February 2021 |archive-date=29 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529132834/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CP/29/2/Population_of_Rome%2A.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Estimates of the city's population vary. A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.<ref>Arnold HM Jones The Decline of the Ancient World, Lonmans, Green and Co. Ltd, London 1966</ref> According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452, and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535–552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590–604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.<ref>Richard Krautheimer, Rome, Profile of a City, 312-1308, 2000 p. 65 {{ISBN|0-691-04961-0}}</ref> Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the [[reform of 419]].<ref>Bernard Lancon, Rome in Late Antiquity, 2001 p. 14 {{ISBN|0-415-92976-8}}</ref> Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.<ref>Neil Christie, From Constantine to Charlemagne, An Archaeology of Italy 300-800 A.D. 2006 p. 61, {{ISBN|978-1-85928-421-6}}</ref> Novel 36 of Emperor [[Valentinian III]] records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the [[Vandals]], and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the [[Early Middle Ages]] from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the [[Renaissance]].<ref>P. Llewellyn, ''Rome in the Dark Ages'' (London 1993), p. 97.</ref>

When the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}{{clarify|why?|date=March 2014}} Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.

In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2&nbsp;million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> stretching over more than {{cvt|5,000|km2}}). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426215446/http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |archive-date=26 April 2009}}</ref> The current{{when|date=August 2017}} birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pretto |first=Emiliano |title=Rome Post – what's happening in Rome |website=romepost.it |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://www.romepost.it/Rioni_of_Rome_Esquilino.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621033439/http://www.romepost.it/Rioni_of_Rome_Esquilino.htm | archive-date=21 June 2009 | url-status=unfit | access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref>

Much like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], and the city has been an important centre of religion and [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex maximus]] and later the seat of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the "Roman Religion") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the Most High, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other deities such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.
[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]
Despite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Gesù]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].

Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.

===Vatican City===
{{Main|Vatican City}}
{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}

The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along with the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].

==Pilgrimage==
[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]

Rome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the [[Middle Ages]]. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.

Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html |title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory |last=Moore |first=Malcolm |date=13 June 2007 |work=Telegraph.co.uk |access-date=22 August 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235 |archive-date=30 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430054419/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople]] in the fourth century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Other objects of pilgrimage include several catacombs built in imperial times, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the [[Jesuit]] Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.

Traditionally, pilgrims in Rome (as well as devout Romans) visit the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in the Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (an [[Early Christian]] basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above the [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano]]).

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}

Rome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of [[classical architecture]], developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name="Eyewitness">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36–37.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[neoclassical architecture]].<ref name="Eyewitness" />

====Ancient Rome====
{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}
One of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70–80 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. Important monuments and sites of ancient Rome include the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verità]].

====Medieval====
The medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious fourth century AD mosaics. Notable later medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next to the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]].

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Rome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]] by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].

{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Many of the famous city's squares – some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque – took their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], the [[Spanish Steps]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]], and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].

====Neoclassicism====
[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]]]]
In 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became the predominant influence in Roman architecture. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other government agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]] or "Altar of the Fatherland", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Tomb of Unknown Soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], who represents the 650,000 Italian soldiers who died in World War I, is located.

====Fascist architecture====
[[File:Palazzo della civiltà del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana]] in EUR district]]
{{See also|Fascist architecture}}

The Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini ordered the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of older roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the "isolation" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the "isolation" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; and [[Via della Conciliazione]].

Architecturally, Italian Fascism favoured the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named "Stile Novecento", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. Two important complexes in the latter style are the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]], and the ''Città universitaria'' ("University city"), by [[Marcello Piacentini]], also author of the controversial destruction of part of the Borgo rione to open Via della Conciliazione.

The most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by Piacentini. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called "E.42" (''"Esposizione 42"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana]] (1938–1943), and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], examples of the Rationalist style. The world exhibition never took place, because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 in fighting between the Italian and German armies and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La Défense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.

===Parks and gardens===
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}
[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the [[Villa Borghese gardens]]]]

Public parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archive-date=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |access-date=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill, comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. The [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]] is on the hill, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere, the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Roma "La Sapienza"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. There is also a notable pine wood at [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin, including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.

===Fountains and aqueducts===
{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}
[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Nicola Salvi]].]]

Rome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built-in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Société d'édition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>

During the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were "a visual representation of confidence and power".<ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.</ref>

===Statues===
{{See also|Talking statues of Rome}}
[[File:Vierströmebrunnen-Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (27903447766).jpg|thumb|right|Fontana dei Fiumi by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], 1648]]

Rome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.

===Obelisks and columns===
{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}
[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|[[Flaminio Obelisk]], [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]

The city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archive-date=6 February 2010}}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents. The [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] was inspired by [[Trajan's Column]] at [[Trajan's Forum]], which is part of the [[Imperial Fora]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roundtheworldmagazine.com/free-things-to-do-in-rome/ |title=7 Free Things To Do In Rome |publisher=roundtheworldmagazin.com |access-date=17 January 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217200236/http://www.roundtheworldmagazine.com/free-things-to-do-in-rome/ |archive-date=17 February 2017 |date=12 January 2017}}</ref>

===Bridges===
{{Main|List of bridges in Rome}}
[[File:Bridge Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]] at sunset]]

The city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the [[Tiber]]. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is [[Pons Fabricius|Ponte dei Quattro Capi]], which connects the [[Isola Tiberina]] with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are [[Pons Cestius|Ponte Cestio]], [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]] and [[Ponte Milvio]]. Considering [[Ponte Nomentano]], also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the [[Aniene]], currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |title=The Bridges of Ancient Rome |publisher=Citrag.it |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113044759/http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |archive-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> Other noteworthy bridges are [[Ponte Sisto]], the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; [[Ponte Rotto]], actually the only remaining arch of the ancient ''Pons Aemilius'', collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and [[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]], a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109154613/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |archive-date=9 January 2010}}</ref>

===Catacombs===
{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}
[[File:PiusXItomb2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Necropolis|Vatican Caves]], the place where many popes are buried]]

Rome has an extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.

==Economy==
As the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single ''Ministeri''), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]. Rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[NATO Defence College|NATO Defense College]] and the [[International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property]] (ICCROM).

Although the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry and it is largely dominated by [[service (economics)|services]], high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, [[Fiumicino]], is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: [[Enel]], [[Eni]], and [[Telecom Italia]].<ref name="Forbes">{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/03/29/06f2k_worlds-largest-public-companies_land.html |title=The World's 2000 Largest Public Companies |first=Scott |last=DeCarlo |date=30 March 2006 |work=Forbes |access-date=16 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113092755/http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/29/06f2k_worlds-largest-public-companies_land.html |archive-date=13 January 2007}}</ref>

Universities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film industry]], thanks to the Cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR); the ''Torrino'' (further south from the EUR); the ''Magliana''; the ''Parco de' Medici-Laurentina'' and the so-called ''Tiburtina-valley'' along the ancient [[Via Tiburtina]].

[[File:Teatro dell'Opera a Roma.JPG|thumb|right| The [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] at the Piazza Beniamino Gigli]]

Rome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new [[Parco della Musica]], one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]], as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1991 and the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2004|MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 2004.

Rome has also had a major impact on music history. The [[Roman School]] was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Sistine Chapel|papal chapel]], though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.

Between 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a “new Hollywood” because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=LA NEW HOLLYWOOD: IL CONTESTO POLITICO-SOCIALE|url=http://www.unife.it/letterefilosofia/comunicazione/insegnamenti/storia_cinema/materiale_didattico/a-a-2016-2017/la-new-hollywood-il-contesto-politico-sociale-i-temi-lo-stile|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125210955/http://www.unife.it/letterefilosofia/comunicazione/insegnamenti/storia_cinema/materiale_didattico/a-a-2016-2017/la-new-hollywood-il-contesto-politico-sociale-i-temi-lo-stile|archive-date=25 January 2021|access-date=2021-01-31|website=Unife.it|publisher=Università degli Studi di Ferrara|language=it}}</ref>

Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent "villas" (parks).

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Roman cuisine}}
[[File:Spaghetti alla Carbonara.jpg|thumb|left|''Spaghetti [[Carbonara|alla carbonara]]'', a typical Roman dish]]

Rome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.

Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rolland |first=Jacques |title=The food encyclopedia |publisher=Robert Rose |location=Toronto |year=2006 |isbn=0-7788-0150-0 |oclc=70176309 |page=273}}</ref>
[[File:Concia di zucchine.jpg|thumb|''Concia di zucchine'', an example of Roman-Jewish cuisine]]
The [[Testaccio]], Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, was often known as the "belly" or "slaughterhouse" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or ''vaccinari''.<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pg. 312 - 313</ref> The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the "fifth quarter".<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313"/> The old-fashioned ''[[coda alla vaccinara]]'' (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers)<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313"/> is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs.<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313"/>

In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book |title=Culinaria Italy |first=Claudia |last=Piras |publisher=Culinaria Konemann |year=2000 |isbn=3-8290-2901-2 |oclc=881159457 |page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''. Examples of Roman dishes include ''[[saltimbocca]] alla romana'' – a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; ''[[carciofi alla romana]]'' – artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; ''[[carciofi alla giudia]]'' – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; ''[[Carbonara|spaghetti alla carbonara]]'' – [[spaghetti]] with [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[pecorino]]; and ''[[Gnocchi  alla romana|gnocchi di semolino alla romana]]'' – [[semolina]] dumpling, Roman-style.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carnacina |author2=Buonassisi, Vincenzo |first=Luigi |title=Roma in Cucina |publisher=Giunti Martello |location=Milano |year=1975 |language=it}}</ref>

===Language===
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2020}}
{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}
[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]

Although associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In the highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.

[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the "''volgare''". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian but does not represent standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a "''lingua vernacola''" (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.

Contemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].

Rome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive, however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonisation and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ostler, N.|year=2007|title=Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin|location=London|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-8027-1679-8}}</ref>

Rome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.

[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country.
The city hosted the final games of the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].
The latter took place in the [[Stadio Olimpico]], which is also the shared home stadium for local [[Serie A]] clubs [[S.S. Lazio]], founded in 1900, and [[A.S. Roma]], founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the [[Derby della Capitale]] has become a staple of Roman sports culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/10/22/first11.derbies/index.html |title=Football First 11: Do or die derbies |publisher=CNN |date=22 October 2008 |access-date=5 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017011443/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/10/22/first11.derbies/index.html |archive-date=17 October 2014}}</ref>
Footballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as [[Francesco Totti]] and [[Daniele De Rossi]] (both for A.S. Roma), and [[Alessandro Nesta]] (for S.S. Lazio).

[[File:Roma - Stadio Olimpico - Stadio dei Marmi - Andrea - panoramio.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stadio dei Marmi]]]]

Rome hosted the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], with great success, using many ancient sites such as the [[Villa Borghese]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla|Thermae of Caracalla]] as venues. For the Olympic Games many new facilities were built, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was then enlarged and renewed to host several matches and the final of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]), the [[Stadio Flaminio]], the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc.

Further, Rome hosted the [[1991 EuroBasket]] and is home to the internationally recognised basketball team [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]]. [[Rugby union]] is gaining wider acceptance.
Until 2011 the [[Stadio Flaminio]] was the home stadium for the [[Italy national rugby union team]], which has been playing in the [[Six Nations Championship]] since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety.
Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as [[Rugby Roma Olimpic|Rugby Roma]] (founded in 1930 and winner of five Italian championships, the latter in 1999–2000), [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]] and [[S.S. Lazio Rugby 1927|S.S. Lazio 1927]] (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).

Every May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball ([[M. Roma Volley]]), [[team handball|handball]] or [[water polo|waterpolo]].

Rome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the [[Capitoline Hill]] and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' or ''GRA'').

Due to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal [[railway node]] for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, [[Roma Tiburtina railway station|Roma Tiburtina]], has been redeveloped as a [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] terminus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203063001/http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 December 2006 |title=Eurostar Italia Alta Velocità |date=3 December 2006}}</ref> As well as frequent high-speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna by ÖBB Austrian railways.

Rome is served by three airports. The intercontinental [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Leonardo da Vinci International Airport]], Italy's chief airport is located within the nearby [[Fiumicino]], south-west of Rome. The older [[Rome Ciampino Airport]] is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as "Ciampino Airport", as it is located beside [[Ciampino]], south-east of Rome. A third airport, the [[Roma-Urbe]] Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights.

Although the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea ([[Lido di Ostia]]), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is [[Port of Civitavecchia]], located about {{convert|62|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Porti di Roma |url=http://www.port-of-rome.org/ |access-date=6 March 2015|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307140526/http://www.port-of-rome.org/ |archive-date=7 March 2015}}</ref>

The city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |access-date=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |archive-date=17 April 2009}}</ref> Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas, where these restrictions apply, are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.

The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.

The A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.

The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500&nbsp;million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

A third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3&nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. It will partly replace the existing [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]-Pantano rail line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Kington |title=Roman remains threaten metro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/14/italy.artnews |work=[[The Guardian|Guardian]] |date=14 May 2007 |access-date=10 August 2008 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831074912/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/14/italy.artnews |archive-date=31 August 2013}}</ref> The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=Metro C, apre la Pantano-Centocelle: folla di romani all'inaugurazione |url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/ROMA/CRONACA/metro_c_atac_sindaco_apertura_pantano_centocelle/notizie/1002186.shtml |access-date=11 November 2014 |work=Il Messaggero |date=9 November 2014 |language=it|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111014416/http://ilmessaggero.it/ROMA/CRONACA/metro_c_atac_sindaco_apertura_pantano_centocelle/notizie/1002186.shtml |archive-date=11 November 2014}}</ref> The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.

A fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis, the project has been put on hold.

Above-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus, tram, metro and urban railways network is run by ''Atac S.p.A.'' (which originally stood for the Municipal Bus and Tramways Company, ''Azienda Tramvie e Autobus del Comune'' in Italian). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has {{convert|39|km|0|abbr=on}} of track and 192 stops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&i=616&o=3&m=1&a=7&ci=45&tpg=2&lingua=ITA |title=ATAC |website=atac.roma.it |language=it|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106212503/http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&i=616&o=3&m=1&a=7&ci=45&tpg=2&lingua=ITA|archive-date=6 January 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref> There is also one [[trolleybus]] line, opened in 2005, and additional trolleybus lines are planned.<ref name="juts2009">{{cite book |title=Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2009–2010 |last=Webb |first=Mary |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7106-2903-6 |location=Coulsdon |oclc=316826596}}</ref>

==International entities, organisations and involvement==
[[File:FAO sede.jpg|thumb|[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome, Circo Massimo]]

Among the [[global cities]], Rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]] and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rome, therefore, hosts foreign embassies to the Italian government, to the Holy See, to the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] and to certain international organisations. Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.

The Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the "first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.

Rome is the seat of the so-called "Polo Romano"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead |title=parlamento.it |archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).

Rome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], because the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.

Rome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.

The city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).
