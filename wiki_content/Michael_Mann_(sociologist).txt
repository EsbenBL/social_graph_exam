He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in modern history in 1963 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] in sociology in 1971 from the [[University of Oxford]]. 

Mann has been a professor of Sociology at UCLA since 1987; he was lecturer in Sociology at the [[University of Essex]] after graduation. He then became reader in Sociology at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], from 1977 to 1987. Mann was also a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the ''[[Social Evolution & History]]'' journal.

In 1984, Mann published ''The Autonomous Power of the State: its Origins, Mechanisms, and Results'' in the ''European Journal of Sociology''. Mann's works include ''The Sources of Social Power'' (four volumes) and ''The Dark Side of Democracy'', spanning the entire 20th century. He also published ''Incoherent Empire'', in which he attacks the United States' '[[War on Terror]]' as a clumsy experiment in [[neo-imperialism]].

The last two volumes of ''The Sources of Social Power, Global Empires and Revolution 1890-1945'' and ''Globalizations 1945-2011'', were published by [[Cambridge University Press|CUP]] in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Mann's work has been subject of several books, including J.A. Hall and R. Schroder (eds). ''The Anatomy of Power: Social Theory of Michael Mann'', (Cambridge UP, 2006) and R. Schroder (ed.) ''Global Powers: Michael Mann's Anatomy of 20th century and Beyond'', (Cambridge UP, 2016).

Mann was elected as a [[Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-fellowship-reaches-1000-42-new-uk-fellows-are-welcomed|title=British Academy Fellowship reaches 1,000 as 42 new UK Fellows are welcomed|date=16 Jul 2015}}</ref>
