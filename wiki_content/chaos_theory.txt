==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can, in principle, be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random. The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: how much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few days (unproven); the inner solar system, 4 to 5 million years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wisdom|first1=Jack|last2=Sussman|first2=Gerald Jay|date=1992-07-03|title=Chaotic Evolution of the Solar System|journal=Science|language=en|volume=257|issue=5066|pages=56–62|doi=10.1126/science.257.5066.56|issn=1095-9203|pmid=17800710|bibcode=1992Sci...257...56S|hdl=1721.1/5961|s2cid=12209977|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.<ref>''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189–190.</ref>

Chaos theory is a method of qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate the behavior of dynamic systems that cannot be explained and predicted by single data relationships, but must be explained and predicted by whole, continuous data relationships.

In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".<ref>Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chaos|title=Definition of chaos {{!}} Dictionary.com|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition, originally formulated by [[Robert L. Devaney]], says that to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:<ref>{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58750-1}}</ref>

# it must be [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions|sensitive to initial conditions]],
# it must be [[Mixing (mathematics)#Topological mixing|topologically transitive]],
# it must have [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]]s.

In some cases, the last two properties above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-58488-002-8 |page=117 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68755-9 |page=42 }}</ref> In the discrete-time case, this is true for all [[continuous]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2021}} [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] on [[metric space]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Banks | author2=Brooks | author3=Cairns | author4=Davis | author5=Stacey | title= On Devaney's definition of chaos | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=99|issue=4|date=1992| pages=332–334 | doi=10.1080/00029890.1992.11995856 }}</ref> In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, "sensitivity to initial conditions" need not be stated in the definition.

=== Chaos as a spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry ===
{{Main|Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics}}In continuous time dynamical systems, chaos is the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry, which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations.<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 2016|title=Introduction to Supersymmetric Theory of Stochastics|journal=Entropy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=108|doi=10.3390/e18040108|author=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|arxiv = 1511.03393 |bibcode = 2016Entrp..18..108O |s2cid=2388285|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Topological supersymmetry breaking: Definition and stochastic generalization of chaos and the limit of applicability of statistics|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1650086|doi=10.1142/S021798491650086X|author1=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|author2=Schwartz, R. N.|author3=Wang, K. L.|bibcode = 2016MPLB...3050086O |arxiv=1404.4076|s2cid=118174242}}</ref> This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models, but also for models with external noise which is an important generalization from the physical point of view, since in reality, all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]]) is a consequence of [[Goldstone's theorem]]—in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}
[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for <math>\rho</math>, <math>\sigma</math> and <math>\beta</math> were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen from the graph, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]
'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points that have significantly different future paths or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change or perturbation of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.<ref name=":1" />

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2008/obit-lorenz-0416|title=Edward Lorenz, father of chaos theory and butterfly effect, dies at 90|website=MIT News|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system could have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time, the system would no longer be predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.<ref name="RGW">{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/globalwarmingfut00watt_399 |url-access=limited |publisher=Morgan & Claypool |year=2007 |page=[https://archive.org/details/globalwarmingfut00watt_399/page/n22 17] }}</ref> This does not mean that one cannot assert anything about events far in the future—only that some restrictions on the system are present. For example, we know that the temperature of the surface of the earth will not naturally reach {{convert|100|C|F}} or fall below {{convert|-130|C|F}} on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we cannot predict exactly which day will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions, in the form of rate of exponential divergence from the perturbed initial conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LyapunovCharacteristicExponent.html|title=Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> More specifically, given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation <math>\delta \mathbf{Z}_0</math>, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by

:<math> | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |,</math>

where <math>t</math> is the time and <math>\lambda</math> is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents can exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used, because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.<ref name=":2" />

In addition to the above property, other properties related to sensitivity of initial conditions also exist. These include, for example, [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].<ref name="WerndlCharlotte" />

===Non-periodicity===

A chaotic system may have sequences of values for the evolving variable that exactly repeat themselves, giving periodic behavior starting from any point in that sequence. However, such periodic sequences are repelling rather than attracting, meaning that if the evolving variable is outside the sequence, however close, it will not enter the sequence and in fact, will diverge from it. Thus for [[almost all]] initial conditions, the variable evolves chaotically with non-periodic behavior.

===Topological mixing===
[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states <math>[x,y]</math>  passed through the logistic map. The first iterate (blue) is the initial condition, which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation <math>x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )</math>. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, <math>y</math>, was created as <math>y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k </math>, if <math>x_k + y_k <1</math> and <math>y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1</math> otherwise.]]
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')</span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1</span> also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]

[[Topological mixing]] (or the weaker condition of topological transitivity) means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Topological transitivity===
A map <math>f:X \to X</math> is said to be topologically transitive if for any pair of non-empty [[open set]]s <math>U, V \subset X</math>, there exists <math>k > 0</math> such that <math>f^{k}(U) \cap V \neq \emptyset</math>. Topological transitivity is a weaker version of [[topological mixing]]. Intuitively, if a map is topologically transitive then given a point ''x'' and a region ''V'', there exists a point ''y'' near ''x'' whose orbit passes through ''V''. This implies that is impossible to decompose the system into two open sets.<ref name="Devaney">{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}</ref>

An important related theorem is the Birkhoff Transitivity Theorem. It is easy to see that the existence of a dense orbit implies in topological transitivity. The Birkhoff Transitivity Theorem states that if ''X'' is a [[Second-countable space|second countable]], [[complete metric space]], then topological transitivity implies the existence of a [[dense set]] of points in ''X'' that have dense orbits.<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|1995}}</ref>

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.<ref name="Devaney"/> The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')</span> is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, <math>\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}</math>&nbsp;→ <math>\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}</math>&nbsp;→ <math>\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}</math> (or approximately 0.3454915&nbsp;→ 0.9045085&nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}</ref>

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),</span> are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=044101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96d4101S }}</ref>

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it is not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex, and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions. [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: <math> \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \rho x - x z - y, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} &= x y - \beta z.
\end{align} </math>
where <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> make up the [[State space representation|system state]], <math>t</math> is time, and <math>\sigma</math>, <math>\rho</math>, <math>\beta</math> are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rössler map|Rössler equations]], which have only one nonlinear term out of seven.

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], with respect to time.  As such, differential equations of the form
:: <math>J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0</math>
are sometimes called ''jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.<ref>K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons & Fractals 28, 739–746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm</ref>

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Another example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of <math>x</math> is:
:<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.</math>

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except <math>R_A=R/A=5R/3</math>, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is <math>1/2\pi R C</math>. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.

Similar circuits only require one diode<ref>[http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper352.htm "A New Chaotic Jerk Circuit"], J. C. Sprott, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems,2011.</ref> or no diodes at all.<ref>[http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper345.htm "Simple Autonomous Chaotic Circuits"], J. C. Sprott, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems--II: Express Briefs, 2010.</ref>

S. Andreatos*, and A. P. Leros, Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review, 2013.</ref> The ease of construction of the circuit has made it a ubiquitous real-world example of a chaotic system.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millennium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].<ref>Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.</ref>

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in Chihiro Hayashi's laboratory at Kyoto University, Yoshisuke Ueda was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.<ref>{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&pg=PA89 89]}}</ref>

Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]], who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

[[Edward Lorenz]] was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.<ref name=Lorenz1961>{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L|doi-access=free }}</ref> Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chaos: Making a New Science |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8|title-link=Chaos: Making a New Science }}</ref> Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year Pierre Coullet and Charles Tresser published "Itérations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation", and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]]'s article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" finally appeared in a journal, after 3 years of referee rejections.<ref name="Feigenbaum 25–52"/><ref>Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems.

Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}</ref> describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), landscape formation, [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}</ref> Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory.

=== Cryptography ===
Chaos theory has been used for many years in [[cryptography]]. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of [[cryptographic primitive]]s. These algorithms include image [[encryption algorithms]], [[hash functions]], [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|secure pseudo-random number generators]], [[stream ciphers]], [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] and [[steganography]].<ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813">{{Cite journal|last1=Akhavan|first1=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2011-10-01|title=A symmetric image encryption scheme based on combination of nonlinear chaotic maps|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=348|issue=8|pages=1797–1813|doi=10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.05.001}}</ref> The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Behnia|first1=S.|last2=Akhshani|first2=A.|last3=Mahmodi|first3=H.|last4=Akhavan|first4=A.|date=2008-01-01|title=A novel algorithm for image encryption based on mixture of chaotic maps|journal=Chaos, Solitons & Fractals|volume=35|issue=2|pages=408–419|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2006.05.011|bibcode = 2008CSF....35..408B }}</ref> From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms.<ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"/> One type of encryption, secret key or [[symmetric key]], relies on [[diffusion and confusion]], which is modeled well by chaos theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|year=2012|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun.

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|date=Dec 2005|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009|author2=Keith Walker|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812003513/http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-12|url-status=dead|citeseerx=10.1.1.105.9178}}</ref>

===Biology===
For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with [[population model]]s. Most models are [[continuous function|continuous]], but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214|doi=10.1137/120868980}}</ref> For example, a study on models of [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynx]] showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal= Computational Statistics & Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9}}</ref> Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as [[hydrology]].

Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|fetal hypoxia]] can be obtained through chaotic modeling.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0|pmid=9138960}}</ref>

===Economics===
It is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161|arxiv=1005.5384}}</ref> Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |issn=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944|s2cid=118329463 |url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/35988/1/35988.pdf }}</ref>

Chaos could be found in economics by the means of [[recurrence quantification analysis]]. In fact, Orlando et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Orlando |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Zimatore |first2=Giovanna |title=RQA correlations on real business cycles time series |journal=Indian Academy of Sciences – Conference Series |date=18 December 2017 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=35–41 |doi=10.29195/iascs.01.01.0009|doi-access=free }}</ref> by the means of the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index were able detect hidden changes in time series.

===Other areas===
In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing [[polymers]], but models using [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017}}</ref> In [[celestial mechanics]], especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular & Chaotic Dynamics |year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353|doi=10.1070/rd2001v006n04abeh000182}}</ref> Four of the five [[moons of Pluto]] rotate chaotically.

Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted).

Researchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.<ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013">{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}</ref>

Redington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits. They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session. Results were admittedly inconclusive. Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but also when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Redington|first1=D. J.|last2=Reidbord|first2=S. P.|s2cid=214722|title=Chaotic dynamics in autonomic nervous system activity of a patient during a psychotherapy session|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1992|volume=31|issue=10|pages=993–1007|pmid=1511082|doi=10.1016/0006-3223(92)90093-F}}</ref>

In their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Metcalf |first1= B. R. | last2 = Allen |first2= J. D. |editor1-first=F. D. |editor1-last= Abraham |editor2-first=A. R. | editor2-last=Gilgen |title= Chaos theory in psychology |publisher= Greenwood Press |year=1995 |chapter= In search of chaos in schedule-induced polydipsia }}</ref> maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos.  The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.

Time series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.

By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Amundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G. L.|author2=Norman E. Amundson|author3=Jim E. H.

For instance, [[team building]] and [[group development]] is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|volume=18|issue=5|pages=544–562|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|s2cid=149352680}}</ref>

Some say the chaos metaphor—used in verbal theories—grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior
provides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo |editor1-first=Gian Italo |editor1-last=Bischi  |editor2-first=Carl | editor2-last=Chiarella |editor3-first=Irina | editor3-last=Shusko |title=Global Analysis of Dynamic Models in Economics and Finance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2013 |pages=185–204 |chapter= Chaotic Dynamics in Organization Theory |isbn= 978-3-642-29503-4}}</ref>

[[File:BML N=200 P=32.png|400px|right|The red cars and blue cars take turns to move; the red ones only move upwards, and the blue ones move rightwards. Every time, all the cars of the same colour try to move one step if there is no car in front of it.

Traffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}</ref>

Chaos theory has been applied to environmental [[water cycle]] data (aka hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/chaos-hydrology/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Chaos in Hydrology|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref>  These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective.  Early studies tended to "succeed" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|date=1999-11-01|title=Does the river run wild?
