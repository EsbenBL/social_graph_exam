==Biography==
[[File:High Street, Holbeach (geograph 4099230).jpg|thumb|Angell's birthplace on High Street, Holbeach, marked by a blue plaque]]
Angell was one of six children, born to Thomas Angell Lane and Mary (née Brittain) Lane in [[Holbeach]], Lincolnshire, England.<ref name= "nobelprize-Angell"/> He was born '''Ralph Norman Angell Lane''', but later adopted '''Angell''' as his sole surname.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31809|page=2820|date= 5 March 1920}}</ref> He attended several schools in England, the [[Lycée Alexandre Ribot]] at [[Saint-Omer]] in France,<ref name= "nobelprize-Angell"/> and the [[University of Geneva]], while editing an English-language newspaper published in [[Geneva]].<ref name= "nobelprize-Angell"/>

In Geneva, Angell felt that Europe was "hopelessly entangled in insoluble problems". Then, still only 17, he emigrated to the West Coast of the United States,<ref name= "nobelprize-Angell"/> where he for several years worked as a vine planter, an irrigation-ditch digger, a cowboy, a California [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] (after filing for American citizenship), a mail-carrier, a [[Prospecting|prospector]],<ref name=BSU-Angell>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bsu.edu/library/collections/archives/normanangell/ |title=Ball State University |access-date=13 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202034/http://www.bsu.edu/library/collections/archives/normanangell/ |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and then, closer to his natural skills, as a [[reporter]] for the ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' and later the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref name="nobelprize-Angell"/>

Due to family matters he returned to England briefly in 1898, then moved to Paris to work as a sub-editor on the English-language ''[[Daily Messenger]]'',<ref name="BSU-Angell"/> and then as a staff contributor to the newspaper ''Éclair''. He also through this period acted as French correspondent for some American newspapers, to which he sent dispatches on the progress of the [[Dreyfus affair|Dreyfus]] case.<ref name= "nobelprize-Angell"/> During 1905–12, he became the Paris editor for the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.

He returned to England and, in 1914, he was one of the founders of the [[Union of Democratic Control]]. He joined the Labour Party in 1920 and was parliamentary candidate for [[Rushcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Rushcliffe]] in  the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1922]] and for [[Rossendale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rossendale]] in [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]]. He was MP for [[Bradford North (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford North]] from 1929 to 1931; after the formation of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], he announced his decision not to seek re-election on 24 September 1931.<ref>''The Times'', 25 September 1931, p. 6.</ref> In 1931 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his public and political services, and in 1933 he was presented with the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name= "nobelprize-Angell"/> He stood unsuccessfully for the [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University seat]] in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]].

From the mid-1930s, Angell actively campaigned for collective international opposition to the aggressive policies of Germany, Italy, and Japan. He went to the United States in 1940 to lecture in favour of American support for Britain in World War II, and remained there until after the publication of his autobiography in 1951. He later returned to Britain and died at the age of 94 in [[Croydon]], Surrey.<ref name= "BSU-Angell"/>

He married  Beatrice Cuvellier but they separated and he lived his last 55 years alone. He purchased [[Northey Island]], Essex, which is attached to the mainland only at low tide, and lived in the sole dwelling on the island.

His Nobel Peace Prize medal and accompanying scroll are held by the [[Imperial War Museum]].<ref name="IWM">{{cite web |title=Nobel Peace Prize gold medal 1933 |url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30011223 |website=Imperial War Museum |access-date=16 September 2018}}</ref>

==''The Great Illusion''==
{{main|The Great Illusion}}
[[File:1933 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Norman Angell.JPG|thumb|1933 Nobel Peace Prize medal awarded to Angell]]
Angell is most widely remembered for his 1909 pamphlet, ''Europe's Optical Illusion,'' which was published the following year (and many years thereafter) as the book, ''[[The Great Illusion]]''. (The anti-war film ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' took its title from his pamphlet.) The [[thesis]] of the book was that the [[Economic integration|integration]] of the economies of European countries had grown to such a degree that war between them would be entirely futile, making militarism obsolete. This quotation from the "Synopsis" to the popular 1913 edition summarizes his basic argument.

{{quote|He establishes this apparent paradox, in so far as the economic problem is concerned, by showing that wealth in the economically civilized world is founded upon [[credit (finance)|credit]] and commercial contract (these being the outgrowth of an economic interdependence due to the increasing [[division of labour]] and greatly developed communication). If credit and commercial contract are tampered with in an attempt at confiscation, the credit-dependent wealth is undermined, and its collapse involves that of the conqueror; so that if conquest is not to be self-injurious it must respect the enemy’s property, in which case it becomes economically futile. Thus the wealth of conquered territory remains in the hands of the population of such territory. When Germany annexed [[Alsace]], no individual German secured a single mark’s worth of Alsatian property as the spoils of war. Conquest in the modern world is a process of multiplying by x, and then obtaining the original figure by dividing by x. For a modern nation to add to its territory no more adds to the wealth of the people of such nation than it would add to the wealth of Londoners if the City of London were to annex the county of Hertford.<ref>{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to their Economic and Social Advantage|edition=3|publisher=G.P.

==''The Money Game''==
Angell was also the designer of ''The Money Game'', a visual method of teaching schoolchildren the fundamentals of finance and banking. First published in 1928 by [[J. M. Dent|J. M. Dent & Sons]], ''The Money Game, How to Play It: A New Instrument of Economic Education'' was both a book and a game. The bulk of the book was an essay on money and a discussion of economic theory, it also contained a summary of the game's story and an explanation of the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-21/how-depression-era-children-learned-about-money-echoes.html|title=How Depression-Era Children Learned About Money|author=Christine Riggle|date=22 March 2012|publisher=Bloomberg.com|access-date=25 March 2012}}</ref>

==Influence==
Angell's book ''The Press And The Organisation of Society'' is cited as a source in [[F. R. Leavis]]' pamphlet ''Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture'' (1930).<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Deane |title=History in our hands: a critical anthology of writings on literature, culture, and politics from the 1930s|location=London, UK|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7185-0143-8|pages=17, 20}}</ref> [[Vera Brittain]] quoted Angell's statement on "the moral obligation to be intelligent" several times in her work.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vera|last=Brittain |title=Search After Sunrise|publisher=Macmillan|year=1951|page=19}}</ref>
