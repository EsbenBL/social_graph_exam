== Biography ==
Latané received his B.A. from Yale in 1958 and his Ph.D. (under the mentorship of [[Stanley Schachter]]) from the University of Minnesota in 1963. He taught at [[Columbia University]], the [[Ohio State University]], [[Florida Atlantic University]], and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  In the 1980s, he was director of [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]]'s Institute for Research in Social Science (now the Odum Institute).  He is currently director of the Center for Human Science<ref name="gazette">{{cite web |url=http://gazette.unc.edu/archives/04mar24/file.2.html |title=Human Science Project Creates Close Community |accessdate=2004-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041111203037/http://gazette.unc.edu/archives/04mar24/file.2.html |archivedate=2004-11-11 }}</ref> in Chapel Hill, NC, which he founded.

Latané's work with Darley involved a series of experiments that staged emergencies so that the social psychologists could observe how the presence of inactive bystanders affect the subjects' helping behavior.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Problem Solving, Decision Making, and Professional Judgment: A Guide for Lawyers and Policymakers|last=Brest|first=Paul|last2=Krieger|first2=Linda Hamilton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780195366327|location=New York|pages=544}}</ref> Latané was also instrumental in introducing ideas from [[dynamical systems]] theory into [[social psychology]], demonstrating, for example, how various forms of order could emerge spontaneously in large social groups from individual's simple attempts to fit in with their local neighbors.<ref>Latané, B., & Bourgeois, M. J. (1996). Experimental evidence for dynamic social impact: The emergence of subcultures in electronic groups. Journal of Communication, 46, 35–47.</ref> He also developed the [[social impact theory]], which holds that social influence is a function of the strength (S), the immediacy (I), and number (N) of sources present, or Impact = "''f''(SIN)".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Group Dynamics|authorlink1=Donelson R. Forsyth|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson R.|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=9780495599524|location=Belmont, CA|pages=183}}</ref>

Together with [[Kipling Williams]] and Stephen Harkins, Latané introduced the term social loafing, a term that denotes people's tendency to slack off in groups due to the idea that one's personal contribution is unidentifiable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Alive|last=Breckler|first=Steven J.|last2=Olson|first2=James|last3=Wiggins|first3=Elizabeth|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2005|isbn=0534578349|location=Belmont, CA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology0000brec/page/398 398]|url=https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology0000brec/page/398}}</ref> It is the opposite of social facilitation, which denotes arousal caused by the presence of others.

Latané was twice awarded the [[AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]], in 1968 and in 1980.<ref>[http://archives.aaas.org/awards.php?a_id=24 History & Archives:  AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]</ref>
