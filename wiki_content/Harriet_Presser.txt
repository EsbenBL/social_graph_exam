'''Harriet B. Presser''' (1936–2012) was a [[sociologist]] and [[demographer]]. Having served on the faculty at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], for more than 30 years, at the time of her death she was a Distinguished University Professor.<ref>"Remembering Harriet Presser: Renowned Sociology Professor Leaves Legacy of Academic Innovation." Office of the Dean, College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, University of Maryland. Accessed 23 May 2012.[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/academics--research/shaping-the-world/remembering-harriet-presser.aspx].</ref> She was elected president of the [[Population Association of America]] for the year 1989.<ref>[http://www.populationassociation.org/sidebar/paa-fund-campaign/honored-members/harriet-b-presser/ Population Association of America. "Harriet B.

"Harriet Presser Award Statement"]</ref> and was elected as a [[Fellow of the AAAS|Fellow]] to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/newsandnotes/inside89.shtml |title=AAAS News and Notes (undated).

She was widely recognized for bringing a [[feminist]] perspective to the demographic study of such issues as [[fertility]], [[child care]], housework, and the effects of the global 24/7 service economy.

In 2009, the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population held a special session in her honor, titled "Cross-Cultural Challenges to Research on Gender and Population", at its 26th International Population Conference in Marrakesh.<ref>IUSSP International Population Conference, General Information Bulletin.

==Research contributions==

In 1969, Presser reported on the unprecedented levels of female sterilization on the island of [[Puerto Rico]]. According to her 1965 data, 34% of mothers ages 20–49 had been sterilized, resulting in a rapid drop in the island's fertility rate.<ref>Presser, Harriet B. 1969. "The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility." Population Studies 23(3).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2172875]</ref> The Puerto Rican case eventually was exposed as one of the most egregious cases of [[compulsory sterilization]] policies.

In the 1970s, she published extensively on the timing of fertility and its consequences for women's adult lives. The research helped establish the critical importance of the timing of first births and whether they were planned.<ref>Presser, Harriet B. 1969. "Early Motherhood: Ignorance or Bliss?" Family Planning Perspectives 6(1).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2133616]</ref>

In the 1980s Presser studied the challenges of [[child care]], its affordability and availability. In particular, she pointed out that as women entered the labor force at higher rates, child care posed problems both for families and for the organization of the workplace. This was the subject of her presidential address to the [[Population Association of America]], "Can We Make Time for Children?"<ref>Presser, Harriet B. 1989. "Can We Make Time for Children? The Economy, Work Schedules, and Child Care" Demography 26(4).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2061256]</ref>

In 1983, in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Presser and Virginia Cain reported that one-third of dual-earner families with children had a spouse working outside of "regular" working hours.<ref>Presser, Harriet B. and Virginia S. Cain. 1983. "Shift Work Among Dual-Earner Couples with Children." Science (18 Feb).[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/219/4586/876.short].</ref> In a subsequent study, Presser found that husbands were more likely to do housework if they were home when their wives were working. That was early evidence of how families with children juggled time demands when both spouses were working, and highlighted the inadequacy of available, affordable child care options.<ref>Presser, Harriet B. 1994. "Employment Schedules Among Dual-Earner Spouses and the Division of Household Labor by Gender." American Sociological Review 59(3).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095938].</ref>

Over the course of her research on work-family intersections, Presser played an instrumental role in establishing the need for better data collection regarding both child care arrangements and the timing of work hours (rather than simply their quantity). While much of the research on economic transformations in the late 20th century focused on [[globalization]] and changes in manufacturing, Presser's work showed that it was local pressures—especially the demands of the 24-hour service economy and the lack of child care options—that often drove families into hard choices.<ref>Maume, David J. 2005. "Tales from the Economic Frontier." Contemporary Sociology 34(5).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4147026].</ref> This line of research culminated in her 2003 book, ''Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families'', published by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], which supported the work.<ref>Presser,Harriet B. 2003. ''Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families''{{cite web |url=http://www.russellsage.org/publications/working-247-economy |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205115239/http://www.russellsage.org/publications/working-247-economy |archive-date=2010-12-05 }}.</ref>

When ''Working in a 24/7 Economy'' was published, it was featured in news reports about the family stress and health impacts of long and irregular work hours, published in the ''New York Times'',<ref>Schwartz, John. "Always on the Job, Employees Pay With Health." ''New York Times'', 5 Sept 2004, p. 1.</ref> the ''Christian Science Monitor'',<ref>Gardner, Marilyn. "More working parents play 'beat the clock'." ''Christian Science Monitor'', 2 June 2004, p. 11.</ref> and ''USA Today''.<ref>Jayson, Sharon. "When moms work nights." ''USA Today'', 12 May 2005, p. 9D.</ref> Publications that reviewed the book include ''Science''<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3841336 Gerstel, Naomi. 2005. "In Search of Time." ''Science'' 308(5719)]</ref> and the ''American Journal of Sociology''.<ref>Shelton, Beth Anne. 2005. "Book Review."
