==Intellectual Contributions==
Snow's research constitutes one of the most original and groundbreaking bodies of work in the discipline. {{Peacock-term|date=February 2013}} {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  While it addresses a number of discrete theoretical and empirical problems, it has the common goal of creating general conceptual tools to comprehend the dynamics of everyday social interaction.  Snow’s influence is particularly deep in two areas of the discipline: social movements and social inequality.

Perhaps Snow’s single greatest scholarly achievement is the creation of the “framing perspective” on social movements, which focuses on the negotiable and emergent meanings of social-movement issues, tactics, and participants.  Snow’s approach is more social psychological and agency-centered than competing perspectives.  The framing perspective focuses attention on the signifying work or meaning construction engaged in by movement adherents (e.g., leaders, activists, and rank-and-file participants) and other actors (e.g., adversaries, institutional elites, media, counter movements) relevant to the interests of movements and the challenges they mount in pursuit of those interests. Snow's work problematizes the meanings associated with relevant events, activities, places, and actors, suggesting that those meanings are typically contestable and negotiable and thus open to debate and differential interpretation. From this vantage point, mobilizing grievances are seen neither as naturally occurring sentiments nor as arising automatically from specifiable material conditions, but as the result of interactively-based interpretation or signifying work.

Snow’s research on social inequality focuses on the social psychology of extreme poverty and homelessness.  In his best-known work in this area, ''Down on Their Luck'' (University of California Press 1993, Portuguese translation 1998), Snow and co-author (and former student) Leon Anderson examine the everyday challenges faced by homeless men and women, using data from hundreds of hours of interviews, participant observation, and social service agencies.  On this unique and expansive empirical base, Snow and Anderson reveal who the homeless are, how they live, and why they have ended up on the streets.  They debunk several popular myths of the homeless with their portrayal of adaptive, resourceful, and pragmatic men and women.  Among the book’s many honors, ''Down on Their Luck'' earned a place on a list of the best ethnographies published between 1950 and 2000 by the journal ''Contemporary Sociology.''
