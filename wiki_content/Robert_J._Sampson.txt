'''Robert J. Sampson''' (born July 9, 1956, in [[Utica, New York|Utica]]) is the Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences at [[Harvard University]] and Director of the Social Sciences Program at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].  From 2005 through 2010, he served as the Chair of the Department of Sociology. In 2011–2012, he was elected as the President of the [[American Society of Criminology]].

==Career==
Before joining Harvard, Sampson taught in the Department of Sociology at the [[University of Chicago]] for twelve years and before that the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] for seven years.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marino|first1=M.|title=Profile of Robert J. Sampson|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=14 January 2008|volume=105|issue=3|pages=842–844|doi=10.1073/pnas.0711294105|pmid=18195369|pmc=2242697|bibcode=2008PNAS..105..842M|doi-access=free}}</ref> He was a senior research fellow at the [[American Bar Foundation]] from 1994 to 2002, and in the 1997–98 and 2002–03 academic years he was a fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] in [[Stanford, California]]. He was elected as a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005 and a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2006.

Sampson has published widely in the areas of crime, neighborhood effects, [[ecometrics]], and the social organization of cities. In the area of neighborhood effects and urban studies his work has focused on race/ethnicity and social mechanisms of ecological inequality, immigration and crime, the meanings and implications of "disorder," spatial disadvantage, collective civic engagement, and other topics linked to the general idea of community-level social processes. Much of this work stems from the '''Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods''' (PHDCN) for which Sampson serves as Scientific Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/PHDCN/|title=Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods &#124; NACJD}}</ref>

Sampson published his first book in 1993, co-authored with [[John Laub]], entitled ''Crime in the Making: Pathways and Turning Points Through Life'', which received the outstanding book award from the [[American Society of Criminology]].  The books detailed Sampson's [[longitudinal study]] from birth to death of 1,000 disadvantaged men born in Boston during the [[Great Depression]] era.  A second book from this research, ''Shared Beginnings, Divergent Lives: Delinquent Boys to Age 70'', published in 2003, follows up on the study by integrating personal narratives with the quantitative analysis of life-course trajectories across the seven decades in the lives of the disadvantaged subjects. The book received the outstanding book award from the [[American Society of Criminology]] in 2004.

In 2011, he and fellow sociologist John Laub received the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]] for their achievements in the field of criminology. That same year, he was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Robert+J.+Sampson&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-03-29|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>
