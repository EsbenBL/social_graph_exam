'''Judith Rich Harris''' (February 10, 1938 – December 29, 2018) was an American [[psychology]] researcher and the author of ''[[The Nurture Assumption]]'', a book criticizing the belief that parents are the most important factor in child development, and presenting evidence which contradicts that belief.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Verbruggen |first1=Robert |title=R.I.P., Judith Rich Harris: The Woman Who Showed Us How Little Parents Matter |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/r-i-p-judith-rich-harris-the-woman-who-showed-us-how-little-parents-matter/ |website=NationalReview.com |publisher=National Review |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref>
Harris was a resident of [[Middletown Township, New Jersey]].<ref>[[Malcolm Gladwell|Gladwell, Malcolm]].

==Early life, education==
Born in Brooklyn in 1938,<ref name=nyt/> Harris spent her early childhood moving around the United States until her parents eventually settled in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]]. The dry climate suited her father, who suffered from [[ankylosing spondylitis]], an [[autoimmune disease]].<ref name="HarrisBio">{{cite web|url=http://judithrichharris.info/tna/bio.htm|title=Author Profile: Judith Rich Harris|newspaper=judithrichharris.info |access-date= September 10, 2015}}</ref>

Harris graduated from [[Tucson High School]] and attended the [[University of Arizona]], and then [[Brandeis University]] where she graduated [[magna cum laude]] in 1959.<ref name="HarrisBio"/> Harris was dismissed from the Ph.D. program in psychology at [[Harvard University]] in 1960, because the 'originality and independence' of her work were not to Harvard's standards.<ref name="N-VIA-N2006">{{cite book|last1=Ridley|first1=Matt|author-link1=Matt Ridley|title=[[Nature via Nurture|Nature Via Nurture: Genes, Experience, and What Makes us Human]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-000678-5}}</ref><ref name="N-2-ALIKE">{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Judith Rich|year=2006|title=[[No Two Alike|No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality]]|publisher=[[W.

==Research: 1977–1995==
In the late 1970s, Harris developed a mathematical model of visual [[information processing]] which formed the basis for two articles in the journal Perception and Psychophysics (1979, 1984).

After 1981 she focused on textbooks about [[developmental psychology]]. With [[Robert Liebert]], she co-authored ''The Child'' (Prentice-Hall, 1984) and ''Infant and Child'' (1992).

In 1994 she formulated a new theory of [[child development]], focusing on the [[peer group]] rather than the family. This formed the basis for a 1995 article in the ''[[Psychological Review]]'',<ref name="Harris1995">{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Judith Rich|title=Where is the child's environment?

==''The Nurture Assumption''==
{{main|The Nurture Assumption}}

Harris's most famous work, ''The Nurture Assumption'', was first published in 1998, with a revised version published in 2009.<ref name=tna>{{cite web|url=http://judithrichharris.info/tna/ |title=The Nurture Assumption website (Judith Rich Harris) |publisher=Judithrichharris.info |access-date=2011-05-24}}</ref>

In this book, she challenges the idea that the personality of adults is determined chiefly by the way they were raised by their parents.<ref name=ch1>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/harris-nurture.html The Nurture Assumption, Chapter 1]</ref> She looks at studies which claim to show the influence of the parental environment and claims that most fail to control for genetic influences. For example, if aggressive parents are more likely to have aggressive children, this is not necessarily evidence of parental example; it may also be that aggressiveness has been passed down through the genes. She also points out that correlations between parent and child personalities may result as easily from child-to-parent effects as the reverse. As part of her presentation, she also argues against Frank Sulloway's theory of the effects of [[birth order]].<ref name=bo>{{cite web|url=http://judithrichharris.info/tna/birth-order/ |title=Judith Rich Harris on Birth Order |publisher=Judithrichharris.info |date=2002-02-08 |access-date=2011-05-24}}</ref> The book looks to influences outside the home as the primary socializing agents of children, with peers being particularly important in personality development. Harris argues that children identify with their classmates and playmates rather than their parents and other adults, and that personality is formed both through efforts to fit in with the group or to compete with specific others.

==''No Two Alike''==
{{main|No Two Alike}}
''[[No Two Alike|No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality]]'', was published in February 2006. Harris attempts to explain why people are so different in personality, even identical twins who grow up in the same home.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/obituaries/judith-rich-harris-dies.html?partner=rss&emc=rss |title=Judith Rich Harris, 80, Dies; Author Played Down the Role of Parents - The New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=2019-01-01 |access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref><ref name=n2a>{{cite web|url=http://judithrichharris.info/n2a/ |title=No Two Alike website (Judith Rich Harris) |publisher=Judithrichharris.info |access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref>

She proposes that three distinct systems shape personality:
*A relationship system allows us to distinguish family from strangers and tell individuals apart.
*A socialization system helps us to become members of a group and absorb the group's culture.
*A status system enables us to acquire self-knowledge by measuring ourselves against others.

''No Two Alike'' expands on some of the ideas from The ''Nurture Assumption'' and attempts to answer some of the criticisms leveled at the former book. For example, Harris denies that the message of 'The Nurture Assumption' is that "Parents are not important." Instead, she emphasizes that their importance lies, not in shaping or determining the people their children will become, but in determining to a large extent the quality of their children's first important relationships (i.e., with their parents) and the quality of life within the home. Harris claims that a happy home life in itself is a positive good—not because it necessarily will determine a happy adulthood.
