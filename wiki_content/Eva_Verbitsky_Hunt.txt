==Biography==
Born on 12 April 1934 in [[Buenos Aires]], Verbitsky was the daughter of the screenwriter [[Alejandro Verbitsky]] and the child educator Josefa Plotkin, both Jews whose parents had emigrated from Russia. When she was 17, she moved with her family to [[Mexico City]] where she developed her skills as a painter. In 1953, after graduating in anthropology from the [[Universidad Femenina de México]], she became a researcher under [[Roberto Weitlaner]] at the [[National School of Anthropology and History|Escuela Nacional de Antropología]], collaborating with [[Roberto Weitlaner]] at the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|Museo Nacional de Anthropología]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, she undertook fieldwork in Oaxaca, first studying the [[Cuicatec Indians]] and later conducting research in the [[Mixtec]] region under [[A. Kimball Romney|Kimball Romney]].<ref name="Gacs1988"/>

In 1957, thanks to Romney, Verbitsky continued her research on Mexican anthropology at the [[University of Chicago]] under [[Robert McCormick Adams Jr.]], [[Fred Eggan]] and [[Eric Wolf]], earning an M.A. in 1959 and a Ph.D. in 1962 with her thesis "The Dynamics of the Domestic Group in Two Tzeltal Villages".<ref name=obit/> In 1960, she married Robert Hunt with whom she spent 1963–64 in Mexico, conducting research into the Cuicatec Indians. She spent a period at [[Northwestern University]] in 1961,<ref name=obit/> after which she began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1965.<ref name="Gacs1988"/>

In the mid-1970s, Hunt stressed the importance of [[kinship]] in investigating the anthropology of [[Mesoamerica]], increasingly focusing on regional analysis and publishing "The Transformation of the Hummingbird: Cultural Roots of a Zinacantecan Mythical Poem" (1977) which drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ideas on structural anthropology.<ref name="Gacs1988"/>

Eva Hunt, who became a professor at [[Boston University]] in 1978, died of cancer on 29 February 1980.<ref name=obit>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Eva Verbitsky Hunt 1934–1980|doi=10.1525/aa.1981.83.4.02a00090|volume=83|issue=4|journal=American Anthropologist|pages=892–894|year = 1981|last1 = Bohannan|first1 = Paul|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=endotcom/> The Eva Hunt Teaching Fellowship was established in her honour.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Departments & People, September 1980|journal=Anthropology News|date=1980|doi=10.1111/an.1980.21.6.3.1|volume=21|issue = 6|page=3|doi-access=free}}</ref>
