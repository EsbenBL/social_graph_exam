==Bank of England==
King joined the bank in March 1991 as chief economist and executive director, after being a [[non-executive director]] from 1990 to 1991. He was appointed [[Deputy Governor of the Bank of England|Deputy Governor]] in 1997, taking up his post on 1 June 1998. In the same year, King became a member of the [[Group of Thirty]]. An [[ex-officio]] member of the bank's interest-rate setting [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] since its inception in 1997, King took part in its monthly meetings. He succeeded [[Edward George|Sir Edward George]] as governor on 1 July 2003, and was also the first incumbent governor of the Bank of England to be received in [[Audience (meeting)|audience]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/courtsocial/article1816858.ece|title=Queen invites Mervyn King, Bank of EnglandGovernor, to palace|first=Valentine|last=Low|date=25 March 2009|newspaper=The Times|access-date=13 March 2012}}</ref>

===Late 2000s financial crisis===
After becoming Bank governor, King explained that Bank of England policy was "similar to that of the Federal Reserve" under Alan Greenspan. Greenspan described his approach as "mitigat[ing] the fallout [from the bursting of a bubble] when it occurs".<ref name="king_2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2004/speech209.pdf|first=Mervyn|last=King|year=2004|title=Comments on 'Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy' by Alan Greenspan, AEA Annual Conference, 2004|access-date=30 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208164015/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2004/speech209.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> King agreed with [[Alan Greenspan]] that, "It is hard to identify asset price 'bubbles'."<ref name="king_2004"/>

[[Dean Baker]] in [[The American Prospect]] said the failure by Greenspan and King to tackle the bubbles in their respective countries' housing markets resulted in catastrophic "fallout" when the bubbles burst, resulting in the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|worst recessions]] in both countries since the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/david-ignatius-mervyn-king-not-only-incompetent-central-banker-he-also-bad-teacher|title=David Ignatius: Mervyn King Is Not Only an Incompetent Central Banker, He Also is a Bad Teacher|first=Dean|last=Baker|author-link=Dean Baker|date=11 February 2010|work=[[The American Prospect]]|access-date=9 December 2011}}</ref> UK–US inaction may be compared to action taken by China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/davies14/English|title=Chinese Finance Comes of Age|author-link=Howard Davies (economist)|first=Howard|last=Davies|date=23 June 2011|work=Finance in the 21st Century|publisher=Project Syndicate|quote=The authorities in Beijing, especially the CBRC and the People's Bank of China (the real central bank), have a good record of managing incipient booms and busts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Another result of the financial crisis was King's rejection of the bank's devout focus on price stability, or [[inflation targeting]], a policy that was instituted after [[Black Wednesday]] in 1992 and that was continued by King after becoming governor in 2003.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bernanke|first1=Ben S.|author-link1=Ben Bernanke|last2=Laubach|first2=Thomas|year=2001|orig-year=1998|title=Inflation Targeting: Lessons from the International Experience|edition=new|location=New Jersey|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-08689-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MryLRLgkjGQC&pg=PA147 147]}}</ref> One of the two early lessons King drew from crisis were that "price stability does not guarantee stability of the economy as a whole" and that "the instruments used to pursue financial stability are in need of sharpening and refining."<ref name="King speech394">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2009/speech394.pdf|title=Speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House|first=Mervyn|last=King|date=17 June 2009|access-date=14 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208152545/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2009/speech394.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Response to crisis====
King argued that when the financial crisis and bank meltdown hit in autumn 2008, he and other Western central bankers "prevented a Great Depression", in part by cutting interest rates to virtually zero.

====Banks bailout====
King had faced accusations{{Who|date=September 2011}} of refusing funding to the [[Northern Rock Bank]], precipitating a run on that bank, a situation not seen in the UK since 1914.<ref name="NS 03.10.2011">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/back-from-the-brink-by-alistair-darling|title=''Back from the Brink''|first=Robert|last=Skidelsky|date=3 October 2011|journal=New Statesman|access-date=17 October 2011|quote=[T]here were runs on the retail banks in 1914|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123212852/http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/back-from-the-brink-by-alistair-darling/|archive-date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead}}.</ref> King later said that it had been the chancellor, [[Alistair Darling]], not he, who had the final word on refusing the necessary help to Northern Rock.<ref name="Guard 06.11.2007">{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 November 2007|title=Mervyn King interview with the BBC's Robert Peston: full transcript|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/06/21|access-date=17 February 2010|location=London}}</ref>  In his [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/banking/article3347978.ece review] of King's tenure as governor, ''Times'' journalist David Wighton wrote:{{quote|Sir John Gieve, the Deputy Governor for financial stability, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was widely seen as the fall guy for the Bank's dithering over Northern Rock a few months earlier.  In fact, he had been urging King to act, and his allies accused King of failing to defend him when the chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee accused Gieve of being "asleep in the back shop while there was a mugging out front".  Gieve's mother had died at the height of the Northern Rock crisis and he had taken a few days off.  King failed to make clear to the committee that this was why his deputy had been away.  King's behaviour had been "very bad form", according to one former Bank director.<ref name="Times 14.03.2012"/>}}

In his memoirs, [[Alistair Darling]] was critical of King for emphasising [[moral hazard]]—the doctrine of not saving the banks from the consequences of their own mistakes—instead of rescuing the banks by pumping money into them as the banking-system meltdown occurred in autumn 2008.<ref name="STimes 04.09.2011">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article768648.ece|title=Brown said world's worst financial crisis would last only six months|first=Isabel|last=Oakeshott|date=4 September 2011|newspaper=The Sunday Times|access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref>  Despite his refusal to give funding to the retail banks, he retained his job, and submitted in defence to a [[Treasury Select Committee]] (New York Times/Financial Times, 20 September 2007) that his actions were on the basis that the [[Bank of England]] was the "[[lender of last resort]]" but subsequently supported moves to provide funding to those banks which had been nationalised or partly nationalised.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Political interventions===
It has been alleged that King's Mansion House speech for 2009 helped to bolster the Conservatives during the approach to the general election by issuing high-profile criticisms. King called for the break-up of the country's biggest banks, as well as arguing that, unless the bank was given more active, interventionist powers to ensure financial stability, it would be like a church: able to "do no more than issue sermons or organise burials."<ref name="King speech394"/><ref name="Times 14.03.2012"/> King later advised a rebalancing of the economy, increased saving, and an "elimination of the structural deficit".<ref name="Guardian 21.10.2009"/> In November 2009, he told MPs that the then Labour government's intention of halving the deficit over the next five years was insufficient.<ref name="ft_9-11-11">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b58982c4-ec47-11df-9e11-00144feab49a.html|title=Concern that King 'blurs line' on policy|newspaper=Financial Times|date=9 November 2010|first1=Norma|last1=Cohen|first2=Chris|last2=Giles|first3=Daniel|last3= Pimlott|access-date=13 February 2011}}</ref> In May 2010, just days after the Coalition government was formed,<ref name="ft_14-05-11">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/bfbf37ee-5e25-11df-8153-00144feab49a.html|title=King backs plans to cut deficit|newspaper=Financial Times|date=13 May 2010|first=Chris|last=Giles|access-date=14 February 2011}}</ref> King said he had spoken to Chancellor George Osborne and supported his plans to cut spending by a further £6 billion within the 2010–11 fiscal year.<ref name="ft_9-11-11"/> The Liberal Democrats did not need to be talked around to agreeing to the severity of the cuts.<ref name="ft_blog1">{{cite web|first=Alex |last=Barker|work=Financial Times|title=Mervyn King's "excessively political" interventions|url=http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2010/11/mervyn-kings-excessively-political-interventions|format=blog|date=25 November 2010|access-date=8 December 2010}}</ref>

In November 2010, it was revealed that some senior staff at the Bank of England (one of them was David Blanchflower)<ref name="DaBl 18Apr2012" /> were uncomfortable with King's endorsement of the government's public spending cuts, accusing him of overstepping the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy. King's support for the government's cuts was in spite of concerns within the bank that cutting spending so rapidly could derail the UK's nascent economic-recovery.<ref name="ft_9-11-11" /> These revelations led to accusations of King being a "[[Lib-Con coalition|coalition]] courtier"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3cdf9ebe-ed03-11df-9912-00144feab49a.html|title=King cannot be the coalition's courtier|newspaper=Financial Times|date=10 November 2010|access-date=8 December 2010}}</ref> and of making "excessively political"<ref>{{cite news|first1=Norma |last1=Cohen|first2=Daniel|last2= Pimlott|first3=Chris|last3= Giles|first4=George|last4= Parker|newspaper=Financial Times|title=Bank of England divisions are laid bare|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/25ad090e-f887-11df-8b7b-00144feab49a.html|date=25 November 2010|access-date=14 February 2011}}</ref> interventions with regard to UK economic policy.<ref name="ft_blog1" />

According to George Osborne, [[Gus O'Donnell]] made an offer to have King brief the Tories and Lib Dems during the Coalition's formative talks; however, the parties suspected they "knew what he was going to say and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. also thought it was more appropriate for our Treasury spokesmen to talk to him".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpolcon/528/10101402.htm|title= Examination of Witness (Question number 1-36): Rt Hon David Laws|date=14 October 2010|work=Lessons from the process of Government formation after the 2010 General Election|publisher=Political and Constitutional Reform Committee|access-date=25 April 2012 }} See Q20 and Q21 plus answers.</ref>

In a speech to the European Parliament in Brussels in May 2011, King commented that the Bank of England was more concerned with the broader stability of the economy and banking sector than with inflation figures: "The economic consequences of high-level indebtedness now would become more severe if rates were to rise.

In his Mansion House speech in June 2009, King criticised Chancellor [[Alistair Darling]] for resisting significant changes to the allocation of regulatory responsibilities between the FSA, the Treasury and the bank, which would have given the bank greater power to fulfil its role of ensuring economic stability.<ref>For King's previous position see {{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2004/speech222.pdf|page=4|first=Mervyn|last=King|title=Speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House|date=16 June 2004|access-date=10 March 2011|quote=[T]he Bank of England Act 1998 and the associated Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank, Treasury and FSA on financial stability .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

The BoE's Financial Policy Committee, established to identify emerging bubbles in the financial system, agreed in March 2012 to ask Parliament for new policy tools to be used to prevent another financial crisis. King said that the FPC narrowed its choice of instruments to three—the power to ensure banks have countercyclical capital buffers, the ability to force banks to hold more capital against exposure to specific sectors judged risky, and the power to set leverage ratios—because it will be important to explain to parliament and the wider public why it is or is not using them.<ref name="RBla 25Mar2012">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9165481/Sir-Mervyn-King-says-new-financial-stability-tools-are-an-experiment.html|title=Sir Mervyn King says new financial stability tools are 'an experiment'|first=Richard|last=Blackden|date=25 March 2012|newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph|access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref>
