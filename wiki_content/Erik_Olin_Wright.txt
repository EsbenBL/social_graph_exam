'''Erik Olin Wright''' (February 9, 1947 – January 23, 2019) was an American [[Analytical Marxism|analytical Marxist]] [[sociology|sociologist]] and educator, specializing in [[social stratification]] and in egalitarian alternative futures to [[capitalism]]. He was known for diverging from [[classical Marxism]] in his breakdown of the working class into subgroups of diversely held power and therefore varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. Wright introduced novel concepts to adapt to this change of perspective including deep democracy and [[interstitial revolution]].<ref name="utopias" />

==Early life and education==
Wright was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], though he was raised in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Kansas]]. Wright's parents, M. Erik Wright and Beatrice Ann (Posner) Wright were both psychology professors at the [[University of Kansas]].<ref name=nytObituary></ref><ref name=ssobit>{{cite web |url=https://www.socialsciencespace.com/2019/01/the-pragmatic-utopian-erik-olin-wright-1947-2019/ |title=The Pragmatic Utopian: Erik Olin Wright, 1947-2019 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=January 28, 2019 |website=Social Science Space }}</ref>  His parents were both Jewish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} He received two [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees, one from [[Harvard College]] (Social Studies) in 1968, and one from [[Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford]], (history) in 1970. Wright received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in Sociology from [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1976.<ref name="SSC">{{cite web |title=CURRICULUM VITAE |url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Erik%20Olin%20Wright%20Curriculum%20Vitae%20-%202013.pdf |website=ssc.wisc.edu |access-date=6 June 2021}}</ref> He became a Professor of Sociology at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]<ref name="cv" /> in 1976.<ref name="frankfurt" />

==Career==
Wright began making contributions to the intellectual community in the mid-1970s, along with a whole generation of young academics who were radicalized by the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[civil rights movement]].<ref name="ritzer" />

At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Wright supervised the dissertations of numerous young scholars who proceeded to become notable sociologists and politicians, among whom are included [[Wilmot James]], [[César Rodríguez Garavito]], and [[Vivek Chibber]].<ref name=dissent /> Wright also served on the dissertation committees of scholars who go on to make considerable contributions to the fields of [[social stratification]], social policy, and inequality including [[Gøsta Esping-Andersen]], former American Sociological Association president [[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]], and the late [[Devah Pager]].

Throughout Wright's career, he was solicited by other universities to join their sociology faculty.<ref name=dissent /> One notable such recruitment attempt occurred at [[Harvard University]] in 1981. Among Wright's supporters were [[Harrison White]], who respected Wright's work despite opposition to Wright's [[Marxist]] political commitments. Wright's opponents at Harvard included [[Daniel Bell]] and [[George Homans]], as well as university president [[Derek Bok]] who purportedly blocked the department's attempt to recruit Wright.<ref name=nyttenure>{{cite news |last=Schumer |first=Fran R. |date=October 18, 1981 |title=A Question of Sex Bias at Harvard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/magazine/a-question-of-sex-bias-at-harvard.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York }}</ref> Harvard's attempt to recruit Wright coincided with its decision to deny tenure in 1981 to [[Theda Skocpol]], a decision that was later reversed following controversy over accusations of gender discrimination.<ref name=nytskocpol>{{cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |date=January 8, 1985 |title=Harvard Reverses Tenure Decision |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/us/harvard-reverses-tenure-decision.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York }}</ref> 

In 2012, Wright was elected President of the [[American Sociological Association]].<ref name="conf" />

== Personal life ==
Wright was also an avid [[fiddle]] player, often encouraging guests to [[square dance]] at parties.<ref name="tribute" />

Wright died on January 23, 2019, from [[acute myeloid leukemia]] at a hospital in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], aged 71.<ref name=dissent /><ref name="madison" /><ref name="nytObituary" />

== Thought ==
{{original research|section|date=January 2019}}

=== Social classes ===
Wright has been described as an "influential [[new left]] theorist".<ref name="meiksins" /> His work was concerned mainly with the study of [[social class]]es, and in particular with the task of providing an update to and elaboration of the Marxist concept of class, in order to enable Marxist and non-Marxist researchers alike to use "class" to explain and predict people's material interests, lived experiences, living conditions, incomes, organizational capacities and willingness to engage in [[collective action]], political leanings, and so on. In addition, he attempted to develop class categories that would allow researchers to compare and contrast the class structures and dynamics of different [[Advanced capitalism|advanced capitalist]] and "[[post-capitalist]]" societies.

Wright has stressed the importance of:
# control over and exclusion from access to economic/productive resources;
# location within production relations;
# market capacity in exchange relations;
# differential control over income derived from the use of productive resources; and,
# differential control over labor effort in defining "class", while at the same time trying to account for the situation of expert, skilled, manager, and supervisory employees, taking inspiration from [[Max Weber|Weberian]] accounts of class and class analysis.

According to Wright, employees with sought-after and reward-inelastically supplied skills (due to natural scarcities or socially constructed and imposed restrictions on supply, such as licensing, barriers to entry into training programs, etc.) are in a "privileged [surplus] appropriation location within exploitation relations" because, while they are not capitalists, they are able to obtain more privileges through their relation to the owner of the means of production than less skilled workers and harder to monitor and evaluate in terms of labor effort. The owner(s) of the means of production or their employer in general therefore has to pay them a "scarcity" or "skill/credential" rent (thus raising their compensation above the actual cost of producing and reproducing their [[Labour power|labor power]]) and tries to "buy" their loyalty by giving them ownership stakes, endowing them with delegated authority over their fellow workers and/or allowing them to more or less be autonomous in determining the pace and direction of their work. Thus, experts, managers of experts, and executive managers tend to be closer to the interests of the employers than to other workers.

Wright's books include ''Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis'' (Cambridge, 1997), which uses data collected in various industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, Norway, and Sweden. He was a professor of sociology at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] until his death.

=== Real utopias ===
{{main|Real utopian sociology}}
Later in his career, Wright was associated with a renewed understanding of a [[socialism|socialist]] alternative, deeply rooted on social [[associative democracy]].<ref name="RU" /> The transition to this alternative, according to Wright, depends on designing and building "real utopias", the name of a research project and book of his. They'd counter prevailing institutions by advancing democratic and egalitarian principles, thereby pointing in the direction of a more just and humane world. Examples include [[Wikipedia]] and the [[Mondragon Corporation]].<ref name="RU" />
