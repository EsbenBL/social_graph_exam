'''Antiwar.com''' is a website that describes itself as devoted to [[non-interventionism]] and as opposing [[imperialism]] and [[war]]. It is a project of the [[Randolph Bourne#Randolph Bourne Institute|Randolph Bourne Institute]]. The website states that it is "fighting the next [[information warfare|information war]]: we are dedicated to the proposition that [[war hawk]]s and our leaders are not going to be allowed to get away with it unopposed and unchallenged."<ref>Cf. [http://antiwar.com/who.php “Who We Are”], Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, 2010) (April 21, 2010).</ref>

==History==
The site was founded in December 1995, as a response to the [[Bosnian war]]. It is a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit foundation, operating under the auspices of the [[Randolph Bourne Institute]], based in [[Atherton, California]]. It was previously affiliated with the [[Center for Libertarian Studies]] and functioned before that as an independent, ad-supported website.<ref>For more historical information, see [http://www.antiwar.com/faq.php “Frequently Asked Questions”], Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, 2010) (April 22, 2010).</ref>

In 2011, the site discovered it was being monitored by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].<ref>[[Justin Raimondo]], [http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2011/08/21/antiwar-com-vs-the-fbi/ The FBI vs. Antiwar.com: Secret documents reveal government spy-and-smear campaign], Antiwar.com, August 22, 2011.</ref> After their [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request failed to produce results, they worked with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Northern California which in May 2013 filed a freedom of the press lawsuit for full FBI records on Antiwar.com, [[Eric Garris]] and [[Justin Raimondo]].<ref>Ryan J. Reilly, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/21/antiwar-com-fbi-surveillance_n_3314830.html AntiWar.com Editors Sue Over FBI Surveillance], [[The Huffington Post]], May 21, 2013.</ref><ref>Julia Harumi Mass, Staff Attorney, [https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-free-speech/sloppy-fbi-work-leads-spying-journalists Sloppy FBI Work Leads to Spying on Journalists], [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Northern California press release, November 6, 2013.</ref> The documents received in November 2013 indicated that the FBI in San Francisco, and later in Newark, New Jersey, began monitoring the site after Eric Garris passed along to the FBI a threat to hack the Antiwar.com website. The FBI mistakenly took this as an actual threat against its own website and began monitoring Antiwar.com and its editors.<ref>Spencer Ackerman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/fbi-monitored-anti-war-website-in-error-documents FBI monitored anti-war website in error for six years, documents show], [[The Guardian]], November 6, 2013.</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/06/doj-fbi-monitoring-antiwar-com-document DOJ documents show FBI monitoring of antiwar.com (Documents)], The Guardian, November 6, 2013.</ref> Eric Garris demanded the FBI correct its file.<ref>Kelley Vlahos, [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/antiwar-com-editor-demands-fbi-file-fix/ Antiwar.com Editor Demands FBI File Fix], [[American Conservative]], November 15, 2013.</ref> In September 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FBI must delete its memo documenting Garris' First Amendment activities.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mackey|first=Aaron|date=2019-09-13|title=Victory!

==Stance==
The site's first objective "was to fight against intervention in the [[Balkans]] under the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton presidency]]." It "applied the same principles to Clinton's campaigns in [[Haiti]] and [[Kosovo]] and [[Operation Infinite Reach|bombings]] of [[Sudan]] and [[Afghanistan]]." Antiwar.com opposed the US wars in Iraq<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j031903.html|title=Shine, Perishing Republic, by Justin Raimondo|website=www.antiwar.com}}</ref> and Afghanistan<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/browne3.html|title=The Cycle of Violence|website=www.antiwar.com}}</ref> and generally opposes [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], including the US [[bombing]] of [[Serbia]] and continuing occupation of [[Afghanistan]]. It has also condemned aggressive military action and other forms of belligerence on the part of other governments, as well as what contributors view as the fiscal and civil liberties consequences of war.<ref>[http://antiwar.com/who.php “Who We Are”], Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, 2010) (April 21, 2010).</ref> Wen Stephenson of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described the site as marked by "a decidely {{sic}} [[right-wing]] cast of thought."<ref>Wen Stephenson, [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/citation/wc990414.htm “Not Your Father’s Antiwar Movement,”] The Atlantic Online (''Atlantic Monthly'', April 14, 1999) (April 21, 2010).</ref> Its founders characterize themselves as libertarians,<ref>[http://www.antiwar.com/faq.php “Frequently Asked Questions,”] Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, n.d.) (April 21, 2010)</ref> and the two principal co-founders were involved in [[libertarian Republican]] politics, at the time.

The site is non-partisan featuring writers such as the conservative [[Pat Buchanan]], right libertarians such as [[Ron Paul]], and left libertarians such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Juan Cole]],<ref>Crane, David Wade, "Linkages: Political Topography and Networked Topology" in ''Transmedia Frictions: The Digital, the Arts, and the Humanities'', University of California Press, July 25, 2014, p. 225</ref> and [[Code Pink]] co-founder [[Medea Benjamin]].

==Lawsuit filed against the FBI==   
In 2013, Eric Garris, Justin Raimondo, and Antiwar.com began a lawsuit against the FBI for incorrectly identifying Garris as a national security "threat," and conducting an investigation into Antiwar.com as a potential threat.  The lawsuit was conducted by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].<ref>[[Adam Klasfeld]], [https://www.courthousenews.com/antiwar-com-sues-fbi-for-threat-assessment/ “Antiwar.com Sues FBI for ‘Threat Assessment’”], ''Courthouse News Service'' (May 23, 2013)</ref> One issue was that the FBI had incorrectly naming Garris as threatening to hack the FBI website (after Garris reported a threat he received against Antiwar.com). The federal court ordered the FBI to amend their files and issue a correction to Garris.<ref>Spencer Ackerman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/fbi-monitored-anti-war-website-in-error-documents “FBI monitored anti-war website in error for six years, documents show”], ''The Guardian'' (Nov. 6, 2013)</ref> In 2017, the court ordered the FBI to give Antiwar.com access to all the records of the investigation without redaction and to pay $300,000 to the ACLU lawyers.<ref>Helen Christophi, [https://www.courthousenews.com/fbi-agrees-give-records-anti-war-reporters/ “FBI Agrees to Give Records to Anti-War Reporters”], ''Courthouse News Service'' (April 17, 2017)</ref> Antiwar.com lost the part of the case that claimed violations of the Privacy Act by the FBI.  Antiwar.com and the ACLU appealed the Privacy Act claim and the appeal went to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2019, the 9th Circuit three-judge panel unanimously ruled against the FBI and order them to expunge all records from the investigation.<ref> Eric Garris, [https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2019/06/12/antiwar-com-vs-fbi-appeal-hearing-in-the-9th-circuit-video/ “Antiwar.com vs. FBI Appeal Hearing in the 9th Circuit (video)”], ''Antiwar.com'' (June 12, 2019)</ref> Civil Liberties groups like the ACLU and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] hailed the ruling as a victory for privacy rights of journalists and activists.<ref> Aaron Mackey [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-individuals-can-force-government-purge-records-their-first-amendment “Victory!

According to [[Eric Margolis (journalist)|Eric Margolis]], "Americans would have been totally misled [in the run-up to the [[Iraq War]]] had it not been for the Internet sites like Antiwar.com; [[CommonDreams]]; [[LewRockwell.com|LewRockwell]]; and Bigeye; and magazines like ''[[The American Conservative]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]''."<ref>Eric Margolis, [http://www.bigeye.com/061603.htm “Misled Into War?
