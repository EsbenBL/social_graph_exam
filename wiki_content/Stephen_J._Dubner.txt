==Early life and education==
Born in 1963 in [[Duanesburg, New York]], to Solomon Dubner (also known as Paul) and Florence Greenglass (also known as Florence Winters and Veronica Dubner), Dubner grew up as the youngest of eight children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephenjdubner.com/journalism/033196.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621135958/http://www.stephenjdubner.com/journalism/033196.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 21, 2006|title=Choosing My Religion|last=Dubner|first=Stephen|date=March 31, 1996|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> His father, who died in 1973 when Dubner was 10 years old, worked as a copy editor at the [[The Record (Troy)|Troy Record]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/13/style/weddings-ellen-binder-stephen-dubner.html|title=Weddings: Ellen Binder, Stephen Dubner|date=1998-09-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Dubner grew up in a devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] household, his parents having converted from Judaism to Catholicism before his birth. As an adult, Dubner himself converted back to Judaism, an experience he chronicles in his first book, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Turbulent-Souls-Catholic-Return-Jewish/dp/B000HXDKAM Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family]''.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return To His Jewish Family|last=Dubner|first=Stephen|publisher=William Morrow|year=1998|isbn=978-0688151805}}</ref>

In 1984, Dubner graduated from [[Appalachian State University]] in [[North Carolina]], where he studied in the College of Fine and Applied Arts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://appalachianmagazine.org/videos/id/21|title=Alumni Awards 2012: Stephen J. Dubner '84|website=appalachianmagazine.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> There, Dubner played in a rock band, The Right Profile, which later signed with [[Arista Records]] shortly before he decided against a career in music. In 1990, Dubner earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Writing from [[Columbia University]], where he also taught English.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/about/|title=About|website=Freakonomics|language=en|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>

== Career ==

===Early work===
Dubner's first published work appeared in ''[[Highlights for Children]]'', when he was 11 years old. Since then, his journalism has been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and has been anthologized in ''[[The Best American Sports Writing]]'', ''The Best American Crime Writing'', and elsewhere.<ref name=":0" />

In 1998, Dubner wrote his first full-length book, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Turbulent-Souls-Catholic-Return-Jewish/dp/B000HXDKAM Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family]'', for which he was named a finalist for the [[Koret Jewish Book Award]].<ref name=":1" /> Dubner has since written ''[https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Hero-Worshiper-Stephen-J-Dubner/dp/0061132985 Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper]'', published in 2003, and a children's book, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Two-Belly-Buttons/dp/B001OMHVFK The Boy With Two Belly Buttons]'', published in 2007.

===''Freakonomics'' book series===
Dubner met [[Steven Levitt]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Chicago]], when his editor asked him to write a profile on Levitt for [[The New York Times Magazine|''The'' ''New York Times Magazine'']]. At the time, Dubner was writing a book on the psychology of money and didn't have much interest in meeting the young economist from Chicago. Likewise, Levitt had little interest in the profile, but agreed to a two-hour interview because his mom liked [[The New York Times Magazine|''The'' ''New York Times Magazine'']].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview|title=Freakonomics 10 years on: Stephen J Dubner and Steven D Levitt on what they got right and wrong|last=Dean|first=Michelle|date=2015-05-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Upon meeting Levitt, Dubner extended the two-hour interview to three days.

After publication of [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/magazine/probability-that-real-estate-agent-cheating-you-other-riddles-modern-life.html?sq=levitt+probability+dubner&scp=2&st=cse Dubner’s 2003 ''Times Magazine'' article], Dubner and Levitt were asked to co-write a book, which cemented their partnership. In 2005, William Morrow published [[Freakonomics|''Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything'']], a book about cheating teachers, bizarre baby-names, self-dealing Realtors, and crack-selling mama's boys.<ref name=":0" /> ''Freakonomics'' would go on to be translated into 40 languages and sell 5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=":0" />

Dubner and Levitt co-authored three other books: [[SuperFreakonomics]] (2009), [[Think Like a Freak]] (2014), and [[When to Rob a Bank]] (2015). Throughout their writings, Dubner and Levitt use economics to explore real-world phenomena, answer perplexing questions, and offer unconventional analysis.

=== ''Freakonomics Radio'' ===
In 2010, Dubner launched a weekly podcast, ''[[Freakonomics Radio]]'', which was getting 15 million global monthly downloads as of 2018.<ref name=":0" /> On March 5, 2020, Dubner appeared on the [[Joe Rogan Experience]] podcast.

Dubner also hosts ''Freakonomics Radio Live!'' (formerly ''[[Tell Me Something I Don't Know (game show)|Tell Me Something I Don’t Know)]]'', a game-show version of the podcast in which contestants share incredible, little-known facts in front of a live audience.

== Personal life ==
Dubner currently resides in [[New York City]] with his wife, documentary photographer Ellen Binder,<ref name=nyt1/> their two children, and their dog. In a 2017 [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] profile, Dubner described his ideal Sunday as one in which he walks his dog in Central Park early in the morning, watches an [[FC Barcelona]] game with his son, and spends the afternoon cooking dinner with his daughter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/nyregion/how-stephen-j-dubner-of-freakonomics-and-tell-me-something-i-dont-know-spends-his-sundays.html|title=How Stephen J.
