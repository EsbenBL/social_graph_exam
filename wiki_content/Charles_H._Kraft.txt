'''Charles H. Kraft''' (b. 1932<ref>U. S. Copyright Office</ref> in [[Connecticut]]) is an American anthropologist, linguist, [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian speaker, and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Intercultural Communication in the School of Intercultural Studies at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] in [[Pasadena, California]], where he taught primarily in the school's spiritual-dynamics concentration. In the domain of religion, his work since the early 1980s has focused on inner healing and [[spiritual warfare]].  He joined Fuller's faculty in 1969. In the 1950s he served as a [[The Brethren Church|Brethren]] [[missionary]] in northern [[Nigeria]]. He has served as a professor of African languages at [[Michigan State University]] and [[UCLA]], and taught anthropology part-time at [[Biola University]]. He holds a BA from [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]], a BD from Ashland Theological Seminary, and a PhD from the Hartford Seminary Foundation, titled "A Study Of Hausa Syntax".<ref>[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED014053], "A Study Of Hausa Syntax"</ref>

In 1982, with fellow Fuller missions professor [[C. Peter Wagner|Peter Wagner]], Kraft became an early proponent of the teaching and ministry models of [[John Wimber]], and helped popularize the "Third Wave of the Holy Spirit", which Wimber's [[Vineyard Movement]] represented.

== Main interests ==
Kraft writes and teaches about biblical Christianity and culture (including contextualization), communicating biblical Christianity, anthropology and Christianity, cross-cultural Christian theology, worldview, spiritual warfare, inner healing, generational curses, and the evils of [[Freemasonry]]. In addition to his work at Fuller, Kraft is the president and founder of Deep Healing Ministries, a deliverance ministry, and conducts seminars and exorcisms around the world. He lives in [[California]] with his wife.  He serves as the Vice-President of Hearts Set Free Ministries, where he conducts seminars on spiritual warfare, healing, and deliverance.

His most influential and controversial work is ''Christianity in Culture'' (1979). He proposed an approach to contextualization using the "dynamic equivalence" method of Bible translation as a model to describe how Christianity itself must be translated into a culture by adopting new forms that communicate biblical meanings.

He has taught and ministered in Nigeria, Korea, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Australia, India, Denmark, Norway, England, Holland, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany.
