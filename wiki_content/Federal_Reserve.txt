{{Banking in the United States}}
The '''Federal Reserve System''' (also known as the '''Federal Reserve''' or simply '''the Fed''') is the [[central bank]]ing system of the [[United States of America]]. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], after a series of [[financial panic]]s (particularly the [[panic of 1907]]) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate [[Financial crisis|financial crises]].{{refn|group=list|name=need|<ref name="mnglass"/><ref name="initial"/><ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=1–2}}</ref><ref name="FDS-H-04"/><ref name="FDS-H-05"/><ref name="FDS-H-06"/>}} Over the years, events such as the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and the [[Great Recession]] during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.<ref name="initial"/><ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=1}} "It was founded by Congress in 1913 to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system.

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] established three key objectives for [[monetary policy]] in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates.<ref>{{usc|12|225a}}</ref> The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12848.htm | title=What is the Federal Reserve's mandate in setting monetary policy? | quote=The Congress established two key objectives for monetary policy--maximum employment and stable prices--in the Federal Reserve Act.

The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the [[President of the United States|presidentially]] appointed [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|board of governors]] or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately owned commercial banks.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=v}} (See [[#Structure|structure]])</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserveonline.org | title=Federal Reserve Districts | publisher=Federal Reserve Online | date=n.d. | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413204008/http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm|url-status=dead|title=Federal Reserve Board - Advisory Councils|archive-date=April 13, 2015|website=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System}}</ref> Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some of the board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region.

It consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time (the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms). There are also various advisory councils. Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components.{{refn|group=list|name=pubpriv|<ref name="who_owns_faq">{{cite web | publisher=Federal Reserve website | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm | title=FAQ – Who owns the Federal Reserve? | access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | title=Is the Fed Private or Public? | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2200411/ | date=September 19, 2008 | first=Juliet | last=Lapidos | magazine=Slate | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Reserve System |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/toma.reserve |date=February 1, 2010 |first=Mark |last=Toma |website=EH.

The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors, and it receives all the system's annual profits, after [[dividend]]s on member banks' capital investments are paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned a net income of $100.2&nbsp;billion and transferred $97.7&nbsp;billion to the [[U.S. Treasury]].<ref name="frs bog net income press lease">{{cite news | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20160111a.htm | title=Press Release – Federal Reserve Board announces Reserve Bank income and expense data and transfers to the Treasury for 2015 | work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date=January 11, 2016 | access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> Although an instrument of the US Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."<ref>From "Who owns the Federal Reserve?", [http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm Current FAQs], Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</ref>

==Purpose==
[[File:Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Eccles Building]] in Washington, D.C., which serves as the Federal Reserve System's headquarters]]

The primary declared motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address [[bank run|banking panics]].<ref name="initial">{{harvnb|BoG|2006 | pp=1}} "Just before the founding of the Federal Reserve, the nation was plagued with financial crises. At times, these crises led to 'panics,' in which people raced to their banks to withdraw their deposits. A particularly severe panic in 1907 resulted in bank runs that wreaked havoc on the fragile banking system and ultimately led Congress in 1913 to write the Federal Reserve Act. Initially created to address these banking panics, the Federal Reserve is now charged with a number of broader responsibilities, including fostering a sound banking system and a healthy economy."</ref> Other purposes are stated in the [[Federal Reserve Act]], such as "to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting [[commercial paper]], to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/GeneralInfo/fract/ | title=Federal Reserve Act | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date=May 14, 2003 | archive-date=May 17, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517044141/http://www.federalreserve.gov/GeneralInfo/fract/}}</ref> Before the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises.

===Addressing the problem of bank panics===
{{Further|Bank run|Fractional-reserve banking}}

Banking institutions in the United States are required to hold reserves{{nsmdns}}amounts of currency and deposits in other banks{{nsmdns}}equal to only a fraction of the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called [[fractional-reserve banking]]. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a [[bank run]]. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [[lender of last resort]] when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel]] laureate [[Milton Friedman]], believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="Federal Reserve Board">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/Speeches/2003/20031024/default.htm | format=text | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

Bernanke's speech to M. Friedman|edition=New}}</ref>

====Check clearing system====
Because some banks refused to [[Clearing (finance)|clear]] checks from certain other banks during times of economic uncertainty, a check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. It is briefly described in ''The Federal Reserve System{{nsmdns}}Purposes and Functions'' as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83}}</ref>

{{quote|By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency{{nsmdns}}that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted{{nsmdns}}but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.}}

====Lender of last resort====
In the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [[lender of last resort]] to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector "clearing houses" which operated during the [[History of central banking in the United States#1837–1862: "Free Banking" Era|Free Banking Era]]; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm?js=0#l lender of last resort], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]], Retrieved May 21, 2010,</ref><ref>{{cite document|last1=Humphrey|first1=Thomas M.|title=Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History|ssrn=2125371|publisher=Social Science Research Network|date=1 January 1989}}</ref>

====Fluctuations====
Through its [[discount window]] and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).

By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.<ref name="dfeverydayecon"/> For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85&nbsp;billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [[American International Group]] (AIG).<ref name="Federal Reserve-AIG Press Release-2008-09-16">{{cite web | url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm | title=Press Release: Federal Reserve Board, with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) | date=September 16, 2008 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name="NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16">

===Central bank===
{{Further|Central bank}}
[[File:Onedolar2009series.jpg|right|thumb|Obverse of a Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] issued in 2009]]

In its role as the [[central bank]] of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [[Coins of the United States dollar|coin]] and [[Federal Reserve note|paper currency]]. The U.S. Treasury, through its [[United States Mint|Bureau of the Mint]] and [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways.<ref name="Fed_currency">{{cite web | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | url= http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html | title=How Currency Gets into Circulation |date=June 2008 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> During the [[Fiscal Year]] 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6&nbsp;billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.<ref name="Bureau_cost">{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |url=http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |title=Annual Production Figures |access-date=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125657/http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |archive-date=August 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}http://www.bep.treas.gov/resources/productionannual.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bep.gov/images/2013_CFO_Report.pdf |title=Chief Financial Officer Performance and Accountability Report |website=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |page=25 |access-date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>

====Federal funds====
{{Main|Federal funds}}

Federal funds are the reserve balances (also called [[Federal Reserve Deposits]]) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank.<ref name="fed funds">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed15.html | title=Federal Funds | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |date=August 2007 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/special_reports/instruments_of_the_money_market/pdf/full_publication.pdf |editor-first=Timothy Q. |editor-last=Cook|editor2-first=Robert K.|editor2-last=Laroche | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | title=Instruments of the Money Market | year=1993 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.

Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [[federal reserve note]]s. Private banks maintain their [[bank reserves]] in federal reserve accounts.

===Bank regulation===
The Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [[Donald L. Kohn]], vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20061103a.htm | title=Speech – Kohn, The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 3, 2006 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

{{quote|Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.

The legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.}}

The balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

====Government regulation and supervision====

Members of the board frequently testify before congressional committees such as this one. The Senate equivalent of the House Financial Services Committee is the [[Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]].]]

The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions Federal Reserve System |access-date=February 19, 2010 |quote=The Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Reserve System as a whole are all subject to several levels of audit and review. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted numerous reviews of Federal Reserve activities |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217220435/http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm |archive-date=February 17, 2010 }}</ref>

The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions, however, there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the board of governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3). See Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO's Access (GAO/T-GGD-94-44), statement of Charles A. Bowsher.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96159t.pdf| title=Federal Reserve System Current and Future Challenges Require System-wide Attention: Statement of Charles A. Bowsher | publisher=United States General Accounting Office | date=July 26, 1996 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

The board of governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve:<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=4–5}}</ref>

{{quote|The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U.S. banking system. It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks<ref>See example: {{cite web |url=http://www.state.ar.us/bank/benefits_advantages.html |publisher=Arkansas State Bank Department |title=Advantages of Being/Becoming a State Chartered Bank |date=March 31, 2009 |access-date=August 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> that are members of the Federal Reserve System, [[Bank holding company|bank holding companies]] (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and [[Edge Act]] and "agreement corporations" (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] supervises national banks, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] supervises [[state bank]]s that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.

Some regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, [[state bank]]s that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], such as the [[Truth in Lending Act|Truth in Lending]], [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|Equal Credit Opportunity]], and [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]s. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.

Members of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [[congressional committee]]s on the economy, [[monetary policy]], [[Bank regulation|banking supervision and regulation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], [[financial market]]s, and other matters.

The Board has regular contact with members of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [[President of the United States]] and has regular meetings with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.}}

There is a very strong economic consensus in favor of independence from political influence.<ref name="igmchicago.org">http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments</ref>

=====Regulatory and oversight responsibilities=====
The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in United States Code:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/301- | title=U.S. Code Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 7, Section 301. Powers and duties of board of directors; suspension of member bank for undue use of bank credit | publisher=Law.cornell.edu | date=June 22, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

{{quote|Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.}}

===National payments system===
The Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83–85}}</ref>

In the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.
The Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients{{nsmdns}}individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the [[Fedwire|Fedwire Funds Service]] and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.

===Board of governors===
{{Main|Federal Reserve Board of Governors}}

The seven-member board of governors is a large federal agency that functions in business oversight by examining national banks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>'''{{rp|12,15}}''' It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy.

===Federal Open Market Committee===
{{Main|Federal Open Market Committee}}

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the board of governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on [[open market operations]], the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=11–12}}</ref>

There is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.<ref name="igmchicago.org"/>

[[File:US Federal Reserve Banks collage 1936.jpg|thumb|The 12 Reserve Banks buildings in 1936]]

There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is responsible for member banks located in its district. They are located in [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston|Boston]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland|Cleveland]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta|Atlanta]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|St. Louis]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|Minneapolis]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City|Kansas City]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas]], and [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|San Francisco]]. The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.

The charter and organization of each Federal Reserve Bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks. Member banks do, however, elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks' boards of directors.<ref name="dfeverydayecon"/><ref name="R000107">{{cite journal | title= Money and the Federal Reserve System: Myth and Reality – CRS Report for Congress, No. 96-672 E | journal=Congressional Research Service Library of Congress | date=July 31, 1996 | first=G.

Each regional Bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their Bank. Each regional Reserve Bank's president is nominated by their Bank's board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the board of governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed.<ref name="FRB_pres">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/banks/default.htm | title= Federal Reserve Bank Presidents | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=July 20, 2011 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

Each regional Bank's board consists of nine members. Members are broken down into three classes: A, B, and C. There are three board members in each class. Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank's shareholders, and are intended to represent member banks' interests. Member banks are divided into three categories: large, medium, and small. Each category elects one of the three class A board members. Class B board members are also nominated by the region's member banks, but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public. Lastly, class C board members are appointed by the board of governors, and are also intended to represent the interests of the public.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode12/usc_sup_01_12_10_3_20_VII.html | title=US Code: Title 12, Subchapter VII – Directors of Federal Reserve Banks; Reserve Agents and Assistants | publisher=Law.cornell.edu | date=June 22, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

====Legal status of regional Federal Reserve Banks====
The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary.<ref name="Scott 8th Cir. 2005">[http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/05/04/042357P.pdf Kennedy C.

The opinion went on to say, however, that: "The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes." Another relevant decision is ''Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City'',<ref name="Scott 8th Cir. 2005"/> in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the board of governors, which is a federal agency.

Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written:<ref>Michael D. Reagan, "The Political Structure of the Federal Reserve System," ''American Political Science Review'', Vol. 55 (March 1961), pp. 64–76, as reprinted in ''Money and Banking: Theory, Analysis, and Policy'', p. 153, ed. by S. Mittra (Random House, New York 1970).</ref>
{{quote|... the "ownership" of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank "profits." ... Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.}}

[[File:Member Federal Reserve System plaque.png|thumb|Plaque marking a bank as a member]]

===Member banks===

A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank) upon meeting certain standards.

The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus.<ref>{{cite book | title=Federal Reserve Act | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm | date=December 14, 2010 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | chapter=Section 2.3 Subscription to Stock by National Banks | chapter-url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2.htm | access-date=February 6, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Federal Reserve Act | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm | date=December 14, 2010 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | chapter=Section 5.1 Amount of Shares; Increase and Decrease of Capital; Surrender and Cancellation of Stock | chapter-url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section5.htm | access-date=February 6, 2011 }}</ref> However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. From their Regional Bank, member banks with $10 billion or less in assets receive a dividend of 6%, while member banks with more than $10 billion in assets receive the lesser of 6% or the current 10-year Treasury auction rate.<ref>{{cite book | title=Federal Reserve Act | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm | date=May 24, 2018 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | chapter=Section 7 Division of Earnings | chapter-url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section7.htm | access-date=August 23, 2020}}</ref> The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the [[United States Treasury Department]]. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2&nbsp;billion and distributed $2.5&nbsp;billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7&nbsp;billion to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name="frs bog net income press lease" />

==Monetary policy==
{{Further|Monetary policy of the United States}}

The term "[[monetary policy]]" refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals. What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]] gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.<ref name="mp">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm | title= Federal Open Market Committee | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 22, 2011 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name="mpb">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/pagenotfound?aspxerrorpath=/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153340/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm|url-status=dead|title=We Apologize|archive-date=January 5, 2010|website=www.federalreserveeducation.org}}</ref>

===Interbank lending===
The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the [[federal funds rate]], which is the rate of interbank lending of [[excess reserves]]. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [[interbank lending market|interbank market]] and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three "tools" of monetary policy described in the [[Federal Reserve System#Monetary policy|''Tools'' section]] below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005:

{{quote|The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks...By conducting [[open market operations]], imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives.<ref name="BoG 2005 pp=27"/>}}

Effects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.<ref>{{cite web | title=Federal Reserve System in Action | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | access-date=November 24, 2012 | year=2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019011327/http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the [[federal funds rate]] (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm |title= Monetary Policy, Open Market Operations |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=January 26, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413160651/http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2001 }}</ref>

====Federal funds rate and open market operations====
{{Further|Open market operations|money creation|federal funds rate}}
[[File:Federal funds rate history and recessions.png|frameless|upright=2.75|right]]

The Federal Reserve System implements [[monetary policy]] largely by targeting the [[federal funds rate]]. This is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [[federal funds]], which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.

Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [[United States Treasury security]], sometimes called "Treasury bills" or more informally "T-bills" or "Treasuries". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions.<ref name="FRB of NY">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operations | publisher=New York Federal Reserve Bank |date=August 2007 | access-date=October 29, 2011}}</ref>

The Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows:<ref name="mpb"/>

{{quote|Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with{{nsmdns}}the primary dealers{{nsmdns}}compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.

Open market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.

The Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos){{nsmdns}}the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.}}

=====Repurchase agreements=====
{{Further|Repurchase agreement}}

To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [[Primary dealers|primary dealer's]] reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [[primary dealer]]'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html | title=Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of New York | website=Ny.frb.org |date=August 2007 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

====Discount rate====
{{Further|Discount window}}

The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the '''discount rate''' (a.k.a. the '''policy rate'''), which is the interest rate for "discount window lending", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 [[basis point]]s above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the "discount rate" option.<ref>Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco( 2004)</ref> The equivalent operation by the [[European Central Bank]] is referred to as the "[[marginal lending facility]]".<ref>{{cite journal| author = Patricia S. Pollard| title = A Look Inside Two Central Banks: The European System of Central Banks and the Federal Reserve System| volume = 85| issue = 2|date=February 2003| oclc = 1569030| doi = 10.3886/ICPSR01278| pages = 11–30}}</ref>

Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the [[prime rate]], which is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate.

====Reserve requirements====
Another instrument of monetary policy adjustment historically employed by the Federal Reserve System was the fractional [[reserve requirement]], also known as the required reserve ratio.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=30}}</ref> The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks,<ref name="BoG 2005 pp=27">{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=27}}</ref> which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=29–30}}</ref> The required reserve ratio is set by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=31}}</ref> The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.<ref name="hist_resreq">{{cite journal | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/0693lead.pdf | first=Joshua N. | last=Feinman | title=Reserve Requirements: History, Current Practice, and Potential Reform | journal=[[Federal Reserve Bulletin]] | pages=569–589 |date=June 1993 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

As a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve now makes interest payments on depository institutions' required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gives the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/20081006a.htm | title=  Board announces that it will begin to pay interest on depository institutions required and excess reserve balances | publisher=Federal Reserve | date=October 6, 2008 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

As of March 2020, the reserve ratio is zero for all banks, which means that no bank is required to hold any reserves, and hence the reserve requirement effectively does not exist.<ref name='fed-zero-rr'/> The reserve requirement did not play a significant role in the post-2008 interest-on-excess-reserves regime.<ref name='fed-zero-rr-pr'>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm|title=Federal Reserve Actions to Support the Flow of Credit to Households and Businesses|website=Federal Reserve System|date=March 15, 2020|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>

====New facilities====
In order to address problems related to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and [[United States housing bubble]], several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the [[Term Auction Facility]], was added on December 12, 2007. It was first announced as a temporary tool<ref name="taffaq"/> but there have been suggestions that this new tool may remain in place for a prolonged period of time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20071221b.htm | title= Federal Reserve intends to continue term TAF auctions as necessary | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=December 21, 2007 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> Creation of the second new tool, called the [[Term Securities Lending Facility]], was announced on March 11, 2008.<ref name="tslfannounce">{{cite web | title= Announcement of the creation of the Term Securities Lending Facility | url=http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080311a.htm | publisher=Federal Reserve | date=March 11, 2008 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject [[Treasury security|treasury securities]] into the banking system.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a6aFI7RKVhEA&refer=news | title=Fed Seeks to Limit Slump by Taking Mortgage Debt | date=March 12, 2008 | publisher=bloomberg.com}} "The step goes beyond past initiatives because the Fed can now inject liquidity without flooding the banking system with cash...Unlike the newest tool, the past steps added cash to the banking system, which affects the Fed's benchmark interest rate...By contrast, the TSLF injects liquidity by lending Treasuries, which doesn't affect the federal funds rate.

The Federal Reserve's response has continued to evolve since pressure on credit markets began to surface last summer, but all these measures derive from the Fed's traditional open market operations and discount window tools by extending the term of transactions, the type of collateral, or eligible borrowers.}}

A fourth facility, the Term Deposit Facility, was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010.<ref>"Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions Policy on Payment System Risk," [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-05-05/pdf/2010-10483.pdf 75 Federal Register 86 (May 5, 2010), pp. 24384–24389.]</ref> The Term Deposit Facility allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to institutions that are eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system.

It is also described in the ''Term Auction Facility FAQ''<ref name="taffaq"/>

{{quote|The TAF is a credit facility that allows a depository institution to place a bid for an advance from its local Federal Reserve Bank at an interest rate that is determined as the result of an auction. By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations, this facility could help ensure that liquidity provisions can be disseminated efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress.

In short, the TAF will auction term funds of approximately one-month maturity. All depository institutions that are judged to be in sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow at the discount window are also eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All TAF credit must be fully collateralized. Depositories may pledge the broad range of collateral that is accepted for other Federal Reserve lending programs to secure TAF credit. The same collateral values and margins applicable for other Federal Reserve lending programs will also apply for the TAF.}}

=====Term securities lending facility=====
The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28-day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.<ref name="tslffaq">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tslf_faq.html|title=Term Securities Lending Facility: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Newyorkfed.org|access-date=December 6, 2014}}</ref> Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the [[Bank of Canada]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[European Central Bank]], and the [[Swiss National Bank]]. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the [[European Central Bank]] and [[Swiss National Bank]] were increased.

=====Primary dealer credit facility=====
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) is an overnight loan facility that will provide funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.<ref name=pdcffaq/> This new facility marks a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now [[primary dealer]]s can borrow directly from the Fed when this used to be prohibited.

=====Interest on reserves=====
{{Main|Interest_on_excess_reserves#In_the_United_States_.282008-.29|l1 = Interest on excess reserves in the United States}}

{{As of|2008|10}}, the Federal Reserve banks will pay interest on reserve balances (required and excess) held by depository institutions. The rate is set at the lowest federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period of an institution, less 75[[basis point|bp]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm | title=Interest on Required Reserve Balances and Excess Balances | publisher=Federal Reserve Board | date=October 6, 2008 | access-date=October 14, 2008}}</ref> {{as of|2008|October|23}}, the Fed has lowered the spread to a mere 35 bp.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081022a.htm | title=Press Release | publisher=Federal Reserve Board | date=October 22, 2008 | access-date=October 22, 2008}}</ref>

=====Term deposit facility=====
The Term Deposit Facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks will offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible institutions. By removing "excess deposits" from participating banks, the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced, which should result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve has stated that:

{{quote| Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves when policymakers judge that it is appropriate to begin moving to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy. The development of the TDF is a matter of prudent planning and has no implication for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100430a.htm | title=Federal Reserve Board approves amendments to Regulation D authorizing Reserve Banks to offer term deposits | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=April 30, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>}}

The Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five "small-value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100510b.htm | title=Board authorizes small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=May 10, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100908a.htm | title=Board authorizes ongoing small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=September 8, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

The Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy. As stated in Bloomberg News:

{{quote| Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than $1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation. The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy, even as a weakening near-term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet.<ref>{{cite news | last = Zumbrun | first = Joshua | title = Fed to Sell Term Deposits to Ensure Exit 'Readiness' | work = Bloomberg | date = September 8, 2010 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-08/fed-to-sell-5-billion-of-term-deposits-to-ensure-readiness-.html | access-date = September 10, 2010}}</ref>}}

Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms:

{{quote| Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....

As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.

When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.<ref>[http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 Testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding "Unwinding Emergency Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs and Implications for Economic Recovery."

=====Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility=====
The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/abcpmmmf.htm | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | access-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref>

All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB.

Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria:
* was purchased by Borrower on or after September 19, 2008 from a registered investment company that held itself out as a money market mutual fund;
* was purchased by Borrower at the Fund's acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount on the ABCP through the date of its purchase by Borrower;
* was rated at the time pledged to FRBB, not lower than A1, F1, or P1 by at least two major rating agencies or, if rated by only one major rating agency, the ABCP must have been rated within the top rating category by that agency;
* was issued by an entity organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof under a program that was in existence on September 18, 2008; and
* had stated maturity that did not exceed 120 days if the Borrower was a bank or 270 days for non-bank Borrowers.

=====Commercial Paper Funding Facility=====
On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper using the new [[Commercial Paper Funding Facility]] (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3&nbsp;trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61&nbsp;trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market {{as of|2008|October|1|lc=y}}, according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70&nbsp;trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2&nbsp;trillion.<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081007/financial_meltdown.html Fed Action]   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216044105/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081007/financial_meltdown.html |date=December 16, 2008 }}https://web.archive.org/web/20151015224731/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081007/financial_meltdown.html</ref> This program lent out a total $738&nbsp;billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Wilson | first1=Linus |last2=Wu |first2=Yan | title=Does Receiving TARP Funds Make it Easier to Roll Your Commercial Paper Onto the Fed? | date=August 22, 2011 | ssrn=1911454 | publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing}}</ref>

====Quantitative policy====
A little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the ''quantitative policy''. With that, the Federal Reserve actually buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business.
The bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]] prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of $1.25&nbsp;trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=129451895 | title=Federal Reserve Mortgage Purchase Program: Planet Money | publisher=NPR | date=August 26, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Central banking in the United States, 1791–1913===
{{Main|History of central banking in the United States}}

The first attempt at a national currency was during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1775, the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills "[[Early American currency|Continentals]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uscurrency.gov/history-american-currency|title=Timeline of U.S. Currency History|publisher=U.S. Currency Education Program|access-date=June 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004114334/https://uscurrency.gov/history-american-currency|archive-date=October 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp | title="Mr. Govr.

"no state shall ..emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;"</ref>

In 1791, the government granted the [[First Bank of the United States]] a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811.<ref name="A Brief History of Our Nation's Paper Money">{{cite web | url=http://www.frbsf.org/publications/federalreserve/annual/1995/history.html | title=1995 Annual Report: A Brief History of Our Nation's Paper Money | last=Flamme | first=Karen | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco | access-date=August 26, 2010}}</ref> The First Bank of the United States came to an end under [[James Madison|President Madison]] when Congress refused to renew its charter. The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]] when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkUTaZofJYEC | publisher=Ayer Publishing | year=1978 | title=British Parliamentary reports on international finance: the Cunliffe Committee and the Macmillan Committee reports | isbn=978-0-405-11212-6 | quote=description of the founding of Bank of England: 'Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State'}}</ref> Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day.

====First Central Bank, 1791 and Second Central Bank, 1816====
The first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the [[First Bank of the United States]], chartered by Congress and signed into law by President [[George Washington]] on February 25, 1791, at the urging of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. This was done despite strong opposition from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, when Congress refused to renew it.<ref name="boshistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/about/pubs/begin.pdf |title=Historical Beginnings... The Federal Reserve |last=Johnson |first=Roger |date=December 1999 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |page=8 |access-date=July 23, 2010}}</ref>

In 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds out of the bank. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the national debt.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123491373049303821 pay off the national debt] WSJ</ref> The bank's charter was not renewed in 1836.
From 1837 to 1862, in the [[Free Banking Era]] there was no formal central bank.
From 1846 to 1921, an [[Independent Treasury System]] ruled.
From 1863 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 [[National Banking Act]] during which series of bank panics, in [[Panic of 1873|1873]], [[Panic of 1893|1893]], and [[Panic of 1907|1907]] occurred.<ref name="FDS-H-04">{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h952.html|title=Panic of 1907: J.P.

=====Federal Reserve Act, 1913=====
{{Main|Federal Reserve Act}}

[[File:Fed Reserve.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Newspaper clipping, December 24, 1913]]
The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader [[Nelson Aldrich]]. Aldrich set up two commissions – one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them.<ref name="mnwarburg"/>

In early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. [[Paul Warburg]], an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was "bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties".<ref name="Warburg document">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3815 |title=Paul Warburg's Crusade to Establish a Central Bank in the United States |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis}}</ref> After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the "Aldrich Plan", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible.<ref name="Warburg document"/> The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the Board of Directors.<ref name="ecresearch">{{cite web |url=https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/Files/Documents/Research/3328/EEB198405-REVISED1993.pdf |title=America's Unknown Enemy: Beyond Conspiracy |publisher=American Institute of Economic Research}}</ref>

Aldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[John D.

The Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data. A few websites where data is published are at the board of governors' Economic Data and Research page,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://federalreserve.gov/econresdata/default.htm | title=FRB: Economic Research & Data | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 24, 2011 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> the board of governors' statistical releases and historical data page,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases | title= Statistics: Releases and Historical Data | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=May 10, 2010 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> and at the St. Louis Fed's FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2 | title=St. Louis Fed: Economic Data – FRED | publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org | date=August 20, 2011 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> The [[Federal Open Market Committee|Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)]] examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy.<ref name="eco_ind">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/pagenotfound?aspxerrorpath=/fed101_html/policy/indicators_print.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105064959/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/indicators_print.htm|url-status=dead|title=We Apologize|archive-date=January 5, 2010|website=www.federalreserveeducation.org}}</ref>

Some criticism involves economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and [[Lawrence H.

[[File:Total Net Worth - Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations 1949-2012.jpg|thumb|Total Net Worth{{nsmdns}}Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations 1949–2012]]

The net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled ''Flow of Funds''.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/z1/ FRB: Z.1 Release – Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States, Release Dates] See the pdf documents from 1945 to 2007. The value for each year is on page 94 of each document (the 99th page in a pdf viewer) and duplicated on page 104 (109th page in pdf viewer). It gives the total assets, total liabilities, and net worth. This chart is of the net worth.</ref> At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was $64.8&nbsp;trillion.

===Money supply===
{{Further|Money supply}}

The most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Measure
!Definition
|-
| M0
|The total of all physical [[currency]], plus accounts at the central bank that can be exchanged for physical currency.
|-
|M1
|M0 + those portions of M0 held as reserves or vault cash + the amount in [[demand account]]s ("checking" or "current" accounts).
|-
|M2
|M1 + most [[savings account]]s, [[money market account]]s, and small denomination time deposits ([[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] of under $100,000).
|-
|M3
|M2 + all other CDs, deposits of [[eurodollars]] and [[repurchase agreement]]s.
|}

[[File:Components of the United States money supply2.svg|frameless|right|upright=1.8]]

The Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, saying that the data cost a lot to collect but did not provide significantly useful information.<ref name = "prxliv">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/discm3.htm | title=Discontinuance of M3 | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 10, 2005 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> The other three money supply measures continue to be provided in detail.

===Personal consumption expenditures price index===
{{Further|Personal consumption expenditures price index}}

The [[Personal consumption expenditures price index]], also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including [[United States Consumer Price Index]] and [[U.S. Producer Price Index]] prices, it is derived from the largest component of the [[gross domestic product]] in the BEA's [[National Income and Product Accounts]], personal consumption expenditures.

One of the Fed's main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed's ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success.<ref>{{harvnb|BoG|2006 | pp=10}}</ref> Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1033.pdf | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | title=Is the Fed's Definition of Price Stability Evolving? | date=November 9, 2010 | access-date=February 13, 2011}}</ref> There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific [[inflation targeting]] policy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/Speeches/2003/20030325/default.htm | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

====Inflation and the economy====
Most [[mainstream economists]] favor a low, steady rate of inflation.<ref name="econjournalwatch.org">Hummel, Jeffrey Rogers. "Death and Taxes, Including Inflation: the Public versus Economists" (January 2007).[http://econjwatch.org/articles/death-and-taxes-including-inflation-the-public-versus-economists] p.56</ref> Low (as opposed to zero or [[Deflation|negative]]) inflation may reduce the severity of economic [[recession]]s by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a [[liquidity trap]] prevents [[monetary policy]] from stabilizing the economy.<ref>"[https://archive.today/20121206000206/http://www.atypon-link.com/AEAP/doi/abs/10.1257/089533003772034934 Escaping from a Liquidity Trap and Deflation: The Foolproof Way and Others]" Lars E.O. Svensson, ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Volume 17, Issue 4
Fall 2003, pp. 145–166</ref> The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to [[monetary authority|monetary authorities]].

===Unemployment rate===
{{Further|Unemployment rate#United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|List of U.S. states by unemployment rate}}

[[File:US Seasonal Unemployment.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|United States unemployment rates 1975{{ndash}}2010 showing variance between the fifty states]]

One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment. The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation's economic health.

==Budget==
The Federal Reserve is self-funded. The vast majority (90%+) of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as "capital gains/losses" that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans.<ref>Chicago Fed – Demonstrating Knowledge of the Fed: {{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/education_resources/files/Demonstrating_Knowledge.ppt |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528063259/http://www.chicagofed.org/education_resources/files/Demonstrating_Knowledge.ppt |archive-date=May 28, 2008 }}</ref> The board of governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses, as well as the net profit or loss, is the large report simply titled, "Annual Report". It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called "Annual Report: Budget Review". These detailed comprehensive reports can be found at the board of governors' website under the section "Reports to Congress"<ref name=budget>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/default.htm | title= A–Z Listing of Board Publications | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 10, 2011 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

== Balance sheet ==
[[File:US Federal Reserve Assets.png|upright=3.65|thumb|center|Federal Reserve total assets, treasury bonds, and mortgage-backed securities, 2002–2021]]
[[File:Consolidated Statement of Condition of all Federal Reserve Banks-ASSETS.gif|thumb|right|Total combined assets for all 12 Federal Reserve Banks, 2007–2009]]
[[File:Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks-LIABILITIES.png|thumb|right|Total combined liabilities for all 12 Federal Reserve Banks, 2007–2009]]

One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or [[Balance sheet|balance statement]]). In accordance with Section 11 of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], the [[board of governors]] of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the "Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks" showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The board of governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual08/pdf/AR08.pdf | title=96th Annual Report 2008 Federal Reserve | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |date=June 2009 | access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name="balance sheet">{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current | title=Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks | access-date=March 20, 2008 | publisher=Federal Reserve }}</ref>

The Federal Reserve releases its balance sheet every Thursday.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Fed - Factors Affecting Reserve Balances - H.4.1 - Release Dates|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/|access-date=2020-10-15|website=www.federalreserve.gov|language=en}}</ref> Below is the [http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm balance sheet] {{as of|2021|April|8|lc=y}} (in billions of dollars):
