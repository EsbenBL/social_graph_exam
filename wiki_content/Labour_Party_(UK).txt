The '''Labour Party''' is a [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that has been described as an alliance of [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[trade union]]ists.<ref name="Worley2009">{{cite book|author=Matthew Worley|title=The Foundations of the British Labour Party: Identities, Cultures and Perspectives, 1900–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fki0YScKbA8C&pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-7546-6731-5|pages=1–2}}</ref> The Labour Party sits on the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum. In all general elections since [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], Labour has been either the governing party or the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition]]. There have been six Labour [[List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|prime ministers]] and thirteen Labour [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|ministries]].

The party was founded in 1900, having grown out of the [[Labour movement|trade union movement]] and [[History of the socialist movement in the United Kingdom|socialist]] [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|parties]] of the 19th century. It overtook the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to become the main opposition to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the early 1920s, forming two minority governments under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in the 1920s and early 1930s. Labour served in the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]] of 1940–1945, after which [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] established the [[National Health Service]] and expanded the [[welfare state]] from 1945 to 1951. Under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]], Labour again governed from [[Labour government, 1964–1970|1964 to 1970]] and [[Labour government, 1974–1979|1974 to 1979]]. In the 1990s, [[Tony Blair]] took Labour to the [[Centrism|centre]] as part of his [[New Labour]] project which governed under Blair and then [[Gordon Brown]] from 1997 to 2010.

The Labour Party currently forms the Official Opposition in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], having won the second-largest number of seats in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]]. The [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|leader of the party]] and [[leader of the Opposition (UK)|leader of the opposition]] is [[Keir Starmer]]. Labour is the largest party in the [[Senedd (Welsh Parliament)]], being the only party in the [[Second Drakeford government|current Welsh government]]. The party is the third-largest in the [[Scottish Parliament]], behind the [[Scottish National Party]] and the [[Scottish Conservatives]]. Labour is a member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and [[Progressive Alliance]], and holds observer status in the [[Socialist International]]. The party includes semi-autonomous [[Scottish Labour|Scottish]], [[Welsh Labour|Welsh]] and [[Labour Party in Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] branches, however it supports the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) in Northern Ireland, while still organising there. As of July 2021, Labour has around 430,000 registered members,<ref name="membership" /> one of the [[List of largest political parties|largest memberships of any party in Europe]].

=== Origins and the Independent Labour Party (1860–1900) ===
[[File:Oldlabour2.png|thumb|left|upright|The original Liberty logo, in use until 1983]]
The Labour Party originated in the late 19th century, meeting the demand for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban working class, a demographic which had increased in number, and many of whom only gained [[suffrage]] with the passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/rise_of_the_labour_party|title=BBC – History – The rise of the Labour Party (pictures, video, facts & news)|access-date=22 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213171616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/rise_of_the_labour_party|archive-date=13 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] endorsed some [[trade union sponsorship of UK Members of Parliament|trade-union sponsored candidates]]. The first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib–Lab]] candidate to stand was [[George Odger]] in the [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), the intellectual and largely middle-class [[Fabian Society]], the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]]<ref>Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation</ref> and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888–1893)|Scottish Labour Party]].

At the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], the ILP put up 28 candidates but won only 44,325 votes. [[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party, believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups. Hardie's roots as a lay preacher contributed to an ethos in the party which led to the comment by 1950s General Secretary [[Morgan Phillips]] that "Socialism in Britain owed more to Methodism than Marx".<ref>Worley, Matthew (2009). ''The Foundations of the British Labour Party''. p. 131. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6731-5}}.</ref>

=== Labour Representation Committee (1900–1906) ===
{{main|Labour Representation Committee (1900)}}
[[File:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]
In 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R. Steels, proposed in his union branch that the [[Trade Union Congress]] call a special conference to bring together all left-wing organisations and form them into a single body that would sponsor Parliamentary candidates. The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the [[Congregational Memorial Hall]] on Farringdon Street, London on 26 and 27 February 1900. The meeting was attended by a broad spectrum of working-class and left-wing organisations—the trades unions present  represented almost half of the membership of the TUC.<ref name="socialisthistorysociety.co.uk">[http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM ‘The formation of the Labour Party – Lessons for today’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622225821/http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM |date=22 June 2008 }} Jim Mortimer, 2000; Jim Mortimer was a General Secretary of the Labour Party in the 1980s</ref>

After a debate, the 129 delegates passed Hardie's motion to establish "a distinct Labour group in Parliament, who shall have their own whips, and agree upon their policy, which must embrace a readiness to cooperate with any party which for the time being may be engaged in promoting legislation in the direct interests of labour."<ref name="Collection highlights">{{cite web|title=Collection highlights|url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/|publisher=[[People's History Museum]]|access-date=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074421/http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/1906-labour-party-minutes/|archive-date=20 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This created an association called the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), meant to co-ordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trade unions and represent the working-class population.{{sfn|Thorpe|2008|p=8}} It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900 general election]], also referred to as the "Khaki election", came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively and total expenses for the election only came to £33.{{sfn|Wright|Carter|1997}} Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful: [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (British politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}

Support for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay £23,000 damages for a strike. The judgement effectively made strikes illegal, since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in opposition to the Conservatives' landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}

[[File:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party Plaque from Caroone House, 14 Farringdon Street]]
In the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]], the LRC won 29 seats—helped by a [[Gladstone–MacDonald pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}

In their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name "The Labour Party" formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}

=== Early years (1906–1923) ===
In 1907 the new party held its first annual conference in [[Belfast]], a city in which Hardie in 1905 had served as an LRC election agent for [[William Walker (trade unionist)|William Walker]]. Despite Walker's election to the party executive, the connection with the north of Ireland was brief. At the height of the [[Home Rule Crisis]] in 1913, the party, in deference to the [[Irish Labour Party]], decided not to stand candidates in Ireland, a policy the party maintained after [[Partition of Ireland|partition]] in 1921.<ref name=":3">Aaron Edwards (2015), "The British Labour Party and the tragedy of Northern Ireland Labour" in The ''British Labour Party and twentieth-century Ireland: The cause of Ireland, the cause of Labour'', Lawrence Marley ed.. Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-9601-3}}. pp. 119–134</ref> Labour was to be a British, not a United Kingdom, party.

The Belfast conference itself was remembered for first raising the question of whether sovereignty lay with the annual conference, as in the inherited tradition of trade union democracy, or with the PLP.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Emmet|date=2007|title=Centenary Article: 1907: A titanic year for Belfast Labour|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23201436|journal=Saothar|volume=32|pages=5–16|jstor=23201436|issn=0332-1169|access-date=10 August 2021|archive-date=10 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210810123233/https://www.jstor.org/stable/23201436|url-status=live}}</ref> Hardie shocked the delegates in the closing session by threatening to resign from the PLP over an amendment to a resolution on equal suffrage for women that would have bound MPs to oppose any compromise legislation that would extend votes to women on the basis of the existing property franchise. The PLP defused the crisis by allowing Hardie to vote as he wished on the subject. The precedent became the basis of a "conscience clause" in its standing orders, and would be invoked by party leader [[Michael Foot]] in 1981 to argue that the will of the conference should not always bind the PLP.<ref>Trevor Fisher (1983), ‘Crisis in the Labour Party: Keir Hardie and the 1907 conference’, ''History Today'', 33, 6 (June), pp. 12–15</ref>

The [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that trade union members would have to 'opt in' to sending contributions to Labour, rather than their consent being presumed. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the trade unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest trade unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow unions to fund Labour MPs once more without seeking the express consent of their members.

During the First World War, the Labour Party split between supporters and opponents of the conflict but opposition to the war grew within the party as time went on. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], a notable [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] campaigner, resigned as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and [[Arthur Henderson]] became the main figure of authority within the party. He was soon accepted into Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]]'s war cabinet, becoming the first Labour Party member to serve in government. Despite mainstream Labour Party's support for the coalition the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the [[Non-Conscription Fellowship]] while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes.<ref>John Foster,  "Strike action and working-class politics on Clydeside 1914–1919." ''International Review of Social History'' 35#1 (1990): 33–70.</ref> Arthur Henderson resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. The growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.

At the end of the First World War, the Government was attempting to provide support for the newly re-established [[Poland]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. Henderson sent telegrams to all local Labour Party organisations to ask them to organise demonstrations against supporting Poland, later forming the Council of Action, to further organise strikes and protests. Due to the number of demonstrations and the potential industrial impact across the country, Churchill and the Government was forced to end support for the Polish war effort.<ref>Jackson, Pete (13 October 2017).

Henderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency-based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]]. Entitled "Labour and the New Social Order", it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.<ref>Bentley B. Gilbert, ''Britain since 1918'' (1980) p 49.</ref> It was in 1918 that [[Clause IV]], as drafted by [[Sidney Webb]], was adopted into Labour's constitution, committing the party to work towards "the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange". With the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], almost all adult men (excepting only peers, criminals and lunatics) and most women over the age of thirty were given the right to vote, almost tripling the British electorate at a stroke, from 7.7&nbsp;million in 1912 to 21.4&nbsp;million in 1918. This set the scene for a surge in Labour representation in parliament.<ref name="Rosemary Rees 2003 p. 200">Rosemary Rees, ''Britain, 1890–1939'' (2003), p. 200</ref>  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923.<ref name="Glasgow Digital Library">{{cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library |access-date=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105173202/http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |archive-date=5 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split which allowed the Labour Party to gain much of the Liberals' support.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914–1935'' (1966) ch 14</ref>  With the Liberals thus in disarray, Labour won 142 seats in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], making it the second-largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government. After the election Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|leader of the Labour Party]].

=== First Labour government and period in opposition (1923–1929) ===
{{main|First MacDonald ministry}}
[[File:J. Ramsay MacDonald LCCN2014715885 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], first Labour Prime Minister (1924 and 1929–1931)]]
The [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] was fought on the Conservatives' [[protectionist]] proposals, but although they got the most votes and remained the largest party, they lost their majority in parliament, necessitating the formation of a government supporting [[free trade]]. Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons). The most significant achievement of the first Labour government was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]], which began a building programme of 500,000 [[Municipal housing|municipal houses]] for rental to low paid workers. Legislation on education, unemployment, social insurance and tenant protection was also passed. However, because the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals it was unable to implement many of its more contentious policies such as [[nationalisation]] of the coal industry, or a [[capital levy]]. Although no radical changes were introduced, Labour demonstrated that they were capable of governing.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001|pp=51–53}}

While there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, "public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement."{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=213–214}}

The government collapsed after only ten months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the forged [[Zinoviev letter]], in which Moscow talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The letter had little impact on the Labour vote—which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. However, many Labourites blamed for years their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev letter), thereby according to [[A. J. P. Taylor]] misunderstanding the political forces at work and delaying needed reforms in the party.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=219–220, 226–227}}<ref name="Charles Loch Mowat 1955 188–94">{{cite book|author=Charles Loch Mowat|author-link=C.

In opposition, MacDonald continued his policy of presenting the Labour Party as a moderate force. During the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]] the party opposed the general strike, arguing that the best way to achieve social reforms was through the ballot box. The leaders were also fearful of Communist influence orchestrated from Moscow.{{sfn|Pugh|2011|ps=, ch. 8.}} The party had a distinctive and suspicious foreign policy based on pacifism. Its leaders believed that peace was impossible because of capitalism, secret diplomacy, and the trade in armaments. That is it stressed material factors that ignored the psychological memories of the Great War, and the highly emotional tensions regarding nationalism and the boundaries of the countries.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor = 1876236|title = The Emergence of a Labor Foreign Policy in Great Britain, 1918–1929|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 28|issue = 3|pages = 247–258|last1 = Winkler|first1 = Henry R.|year = 1956|doi = 10.1086/237907|s2cid = 153518561}}</ref><ref>Kenneth E.

=== Second Labour government (1929–1931) ===
{{main|Second MacDonald ministry}}
In the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the Labour Party became the largest in the House of Commons for the first time, with 287 seats and 37.1% of the popular vote. However MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald went on to appoint Britain's first woman cabinet minister; [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].<ref>John Shepherd, The Second Labour Government: A reappraisal (2012).</ref> MacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 Labour was able to pass legislation to raise unemployment pay, improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on slum clearances.<ref>Morgan, Kevin. (2006) MacDonald (20 British Prime Ministers of the 20th Century), Haus Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-904950-61-5}}</ref>

The government soon found itself engulfed in crisis as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and eventual [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] occurred soon after the government came to power, and the slump in global trade hit Britain hard. By the end of 1930 unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.<ref name="To Build A New Jerusalem">Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus</ref> The government had no effective answers to the deteriorating financial situation, and by 1931 there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was born out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The cabinet deadlocked over its response, with several influential members unwilling to support the budget cuts (in particular a cut in the rate of unemployment benefit) which were pressed by the civil service and opposition parties. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]] refused to consider [[deficit spending]] or tariffs as alternative solutions. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11–9 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree to the cuts. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign. MacDonald was encouraged by King [[George V]] to form an all-party [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to deal with the immediate crisis.<ref>Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929–1931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).</ref><ref>Chris Wrigley, "The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931." in T.  Heppell and K. Theakston,  ''How Labour Governments Fall'' (Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2013) pp. 38–60.</ref>

The financial crisis grew worse, and decisive government action was needed, as the leaders of both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party met with King George V and MacDonald, at first to discuss support for the spending cuts but later to discuss the shape of the next government. The king played the central role in demanding a National government be formed. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed to form a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (who formed a [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] group) who stood with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin, Chamberlain) and two Liberals. MacDonald's moves aroused great anger among a large majority of Labour Party activists who felt betrayed. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52 seats. The Conservative-dominated National Government, led by MacDonald, won the largest landslide in British political history.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639239|title = Arthur Henderson and the British Political Crisis of 1931|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 117–139|last1 = Thorpe|first1 = Andrew|year = 1988|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012012}}</ref>

In 1931, Labour campaigned on opposition to public spending cuts, but found it difficult to defend the record of the party's former government and the fact that most of the cuts had been agreed before it fell. Historian Andrew Thorpe argues that Labour lost credibility by 1931 as unemployment soared, especially in coal, textiles, shipbuilding,  and steel. The working class increasingly lost confidence in the ability of Labour to solve the most pressing problem.{{sfn|Thorpe|1996}} The 2.5&nbsp;million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland were a major factor in the Labour base in many industrial areas. The Catholic Church had previously tolerated the Labour Party, and denied that it represented true socialism. However, the bishops by 1930 had grown increasingly alarmed at Labour's policies toward Communist Russia, toward birth control and especially toward funding Catholic schools. They warned its members. The Catholic shift against Labour and in favour of the National government played a major role in Labour's losses.{{sfn|Riddell|1997}}

=== Labour in opposition (1931–1940) ===
[[Arthur Henderson]], elected in 1931 to succeed MacDonald, lost his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The only former Labour cabinet member who had retained his seat, the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], accordingly became party leader.

The party experienced another split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, drawn-out decline.

Lansbury resigned as leader in 1935 after public disagreements over foreign policy. {{As of|2021}}, he is the only Labour leader to stand down from the role without contesting a general election (excluding acting leaders).{{Efn|See [[Labour Party (UK)#Electoral performance|electoral performance]] and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]].}} He was promptly replaced as leader by his deputy, [[Clement Attlee]], who would lead the party for two decades. The party experienced a revival in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], winning 154 seats and 38% of the popular vote, the highest that Labour had achieved.<ref>John Bew,  ''Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain'' (2017).</ref>

As the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased, in the late 1930s the Labour Party gradually abandoned its pacifist stance and came to support re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]], who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].<ref name="To Build A New Jerusalem" />

=== Wartime coalition (1940–1945) ===
{{see also|Churchill war ministry}}
The party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]]. When [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned in the spring of 1940, incoming [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] decided to bring the other main parties into a coalition similar to that of the First World War. Clement Attlee was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]] and a member of the war cabinet, eventually becoming the United Kingdom's first [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

A number of other senior Labour figures also took up senior positions: the trade union leader [[Ernest Bevin]], as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]], directed Britain's wartime economy and allocation of manpower, the veteran Labour statesman [[Herbert Morrison]] became [[Home Secretary]], [[Hugh Dalton]] was [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] and later [[President of the Board of Trade]], while [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A. V. Alexander]] resumed the role he had held in the previous Labour Government as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]].

Although [[Clement Attlee]] was no great radical himself,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Attlee's government proved one of the most radical British governments of the 20th century, enacting [[Keynesian]] economic policies, presiding over a policy of nationalising major industries and utilities including the [[Bank of England]], coal mining, the steel industry, electricity, gas, and inland transport (including railways, road haulage and canals).

Labour went on to win the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], but with a much-reduced majority of five seats. Soon afterwards, defence became a divisive issue within the party, especially defence spending (which reached a peak of 14% of GDP in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]),<ref name="Clark, Sir George 1987">Clark, Sir George, ''Illustrated History Of Great Britain'', (1987) Octopus Books</ref> straining public finances and forcing savings elsewhere. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], introduced charges for NHS dentures and spectacles, causing Bevan, along with [[Harold Wilson]] (then President of the Board of Trade), to resign over the dilution of the principle of free treatment on which the NHS had been established.

In the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], Labour narrowly lost to Churchill's Conservatives, despite receiving the larger share of the popular vote – its highest ever vote numerically. Most of the changes introduced by the 1945–51 Labour government were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the "[[post-war consensus]]" that lasted until the late 1970s. Food and clothing rationing, however, still in place since the war, were swiftly relaxed, then abandoned from about 1953.<ref>Bew, ''Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain'' (2017).</ref>

=== Post-war consensus (1951–1964) ===
Following the defeat of 1951, the party spent 13 years in opposition. The party suffered an ideological split, between the party's left-wing followers of [[Aneurin Bevan]] (known as [[Bevanites]]) and the right-wing of the party following [[Hugh Gaitskell]] (known as [[Gaitskellites]]) while the postwar economic recovery and the social effects of Attlee's reforms made the public broadly content with the Conservative governments of the time. The ageing Attlee contested his final general election in [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]], which saw Labour lose ground, and he retired shortly after.

Under his replacement, Hugh Gaitskell, Labour appeared more united than before and had been widely expected to win the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]], but did not. Following this internal party infighting resumed, particularly over the issues of [[nuclear disarmament]], Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and [[Clause IV]] of the Labour Party Constitution, which was viewed as Labour's commitment to [[nationalisation]] which Gaitskell wanted scrapped. These issues would continue to divide the party for decades to come.{{sfnm |1a1=Barlow |1y=2008 |1p=224 |2a1=Beech |2y=2006 |2p=218 |3a1=Clark |3y=2012 |3p=66 |4a1=Heath |4a2=Jowell |4a3=Curtice |4y=2001 |4p=106 |5a1=Heppell |5y=2012 |5p=38 |6a1=Jones |6y=1996 |6p=8 |7a1=Kenny |7a2=Smith |7y=2013 |7p=110 |8a1=Leach |8y=2015 |8p=118}}<ref name="Clause IV">{{cite book|title=Are the Lord's Listening?: Creating Connections Between People and Parliament First Report of Session 2008–09: Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ2YSkfshq0C&pg=PA162|date=1 June 2007|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-10-844466-1|page=162|access-date=7 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125064556/https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ2YSkfshq0C&pg=PA162|archive-date=25 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Gaitskell died suddenly in 1963, and this made way for [[Harold Wilson]] to lead the party.

=== Wilson government (1964–1970) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
{{main|First Wilson ministry}}
[[File:Harold Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Harold Wilson]], Prime Minister (1964–1970 and 1974–1976)]]
A downturn in the economy and a series of scandals in the early 1960s (the most notorious being the [[Profumo affair]]) had engulfed the Conservative government by 1963. The Labour Party returned to government with a 4-seat majority under Wilson in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] but increased its majority to 96 in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]].

Wilson's government was responsible for a number of sweeping social and educational reforms under the leadership of [[Home Secretary]] [[Roy Jenkins]] such as the abolishment of the [[death penalty]] in 1964, the legalisation of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] (initially only for men aged 21 or over, and only in [[England and Wales]]) in 1967 and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. Wilson's government also put heavy emphasis on expanding opportunities through education, and as such, [[comprehensive education]] was expanded and the [[Open University]] created.

Wilson's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of relatively low unemployment and economic prosperity, it was however hindered by significant problems with a large trade deficit which it had inherited from the previous government. The first three years of the government were spent in an ultimately doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to unexpectedly lose the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] to the Conservatives under [[Edward Heath]].

=== Spell in opposition (1970–1974) ===
After losing the 1970 general election, Labour returned to opposition, but retained Harold Wilson as Leader. Heath's government soon ran into trouble over [[Northern Ireland]] and a dispute with miners in 1973 which led to the "[[three-day week]]". The 1970s proved a difficult time to be in government for both the Conservatives and Labour due to the [[1973 oil crisis]], which caused high inflation and a global recession.

The Labour Party was returned to power again under Wilson a few days after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with the support of the [[Ulster Unionist]]s. The Conservatives were unable to form a government alone, as they had fewer seats despite receiving more votes numerically. It was the first general election since 1924 in which both main parties had received less than 40% of the popular vote and the first of six successive general elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid to gain a majority, a second election was soon called for [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, won a slim majority of three, gaining just 18 seats taking its total to 319.

=== Majority to minority (1974–1979) ===
{{main|Labour Government 1974–79}}
For much of its time in office the Labour government struggled with serious economic problems and a precarious majority in the Commons, while the party's internal dissent over Britain's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], which Britain had entered under Edward Heath in 1972, led in 1975 to a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|national referendum]] on the issue in which two thirds of the public supported continued membership. Harold Wilson's personal popularity remained reasonably high but he unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister in 1976 citing health reasons, and was replaced by [[James Callaghan]]. The Wilson and Callaghan governments of the 1970s tried to control [[inflation]] (which reached 23.7% in 1975<ref name="SeldonHickson2004">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Seldon|author2=Kevin Hickson|title=New Labour, old Labour: the Wilson and Callaghan governments, 1974–79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gmy8wS1bBZwC&pg=PA64|access-date=29 October 2010|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-31281-3|pages=64–|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511124955/http://books.google.com/books?id=Gmy8wS1bBZwC&pg=PA64|archive-date=11 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>) by a policy of [[Social Contract (Britain)|wage restraint]]. This was fairly successful, reducing inflation to 7.4% by 1978.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}}<ref name="SeldonHickson2004" /> However it led to increasingly strained relations between the government and the trade unions.

Fear of advances by the nationalist parties, particularly in Scotland, led to the suppression of a [[McCrone report|report from Scottish Office economist Gavin McCrone]] that suggested that an independent Scotland would be "chronically in surplus".<ref name="SNP Youth">{{cite web|url=http://www.snpyouth.org/ysi/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=24 |title=Young Scots For Independence – Revealed: True oil wealth hidden to stop independence |publisher=SNP Youth |date=12 September 2005 |access-date=13 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919150144/http://www.snpyouth.org/ysi/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=24 |archive-date=19 September 2009 }}</ref> By 1977 by-election losses and defections to the breakaway [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party]] left Callaghan heading a minority government, forced to do deals with smaller parties in order to govern. An arrangement negotiated in 1977 with [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] leader [[David Steel]], known as the [[Lib–Lab pact]], ended after one year. Deals were then forged with various small parties including the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], prolonging the life of the government.

The nationalist parties, in turn, demanded [[devolution]] to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referendums for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum]] saw a large majority vote against, while the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish referendum]] returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40% support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as the Conservatives triggered a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of confidence]] in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.

By 1978, the economy had started to show signs of recovery, with inflation falling to single digits, unemployment falling, and living standards starting to rise during the year.<ref>A Short History of the Labour Party by Henry Pelling</ref> Labour's opinion poll ratings also improved, with most showing the party to be in the lead.{{sfn|Thorpe|2001}} Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 to take advantage of the improving situation. In the event, he decided to gamble that extending the wage restraint policy for another year would allow the economy to be in better shape for a 1979 election. However this proved unpopular with the trade unions, and during the winter of 1978–79 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the "[[Winter of Discontent]]".

These industrial disputes sent the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] now led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] into the lead in the polls, which led to Labour's defeat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. The Labour vote held up in the election, with the party receiving nearly the same number of votes than in 1974. However, the Conservative Party achieved big increases in support in the Midlands and South of England, benefiting from both a surge in turnout and votes lost by the ailing Liberals.

The ''Militant'' newspaper's five member editorial board were expelled on 22 February 1983.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

The Labour Party was defeated heavily in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], winning only 27.6% of the vote, its lowest share since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], and receiving only half a million votes more than the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]], which leader Michael Foot condemned for "siphoning" Labour support and enabling the Conservatives to greatly increase their majority of parliamentary seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/9/newsid_2500000/2500847.stm |title=1983: Thatcher wins landslide victory |work=BBC News |date=9 June 1983 |access-date=13 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612170844/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/9/newsid_2500000/2500847.stm |archive-date=12 June 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The party manifesto for this election was termed by critics as "[[the longest suicide note in history]]".<ref name="longest suicide note"/>

Foot resigned and was replaced as leader by [[Neil Kinnock]], with [[Roy Hattersley]] as his deputy. The new leadership progressively dropped unpopular policies. The [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|miners' strike of 1984–85]] over coal mine closures, which divided the NUM as well as the Labour Party, and the [[Wapping dispute]] led to clashes with the left of the party, and negative coverage in most of the press.

The alliances which campaigns such as [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]] forged between [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] (LGBT) and [[Labour movement|labour groups]], as well as the Labour Party itself, also proved to be an important turning point in the progression of LGBT issues in the UK.{{sfn|Kelliher|2014}} At the 1985 Labour Party conference in Bournemouth, a resolution committing the party to support LGBT equality rights passed for the first time{{sfn|Kelliher|2014|p=256}} due to block voting support from the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].

Labour improved its performance in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102. They were now firmly re-established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats. A merger of the SDP and Liberals formed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Following the 1987 election, the National Executive Committee resumed disciplinary action against members of Militant, who remained in the party, leading to further expulsions of their activists and the two MPs who supported the group.

[[File:Old Logo Labour Party.svg|thumb|left|upright|Labour Party logo under Kinnock, Smith and Blair's leaderships]]
In November 1990 following a contested leadership election, [[Margaret Thatcher]] resigned as leader of the Conservative Party and was succeeded as leader and Prime Minister by [[John Major]]. Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories for more than a year before Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on her introduction of the unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. The change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 although Labour regained the lead more than once.

The "yo-yo" in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme "It's Time for a Change", urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a change of leader from Thatcher to Major and replaced the Community Charge. From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 "Poll of Polls" was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

The [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event, the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much-reduced majority of 21.<ref name="1992: Tories win again against odds">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm 1992: Tories win again against odds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908173422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm |date=8 September 2017 }} BBC News, 5 April 2005</ref> Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for supporters of the Labour party. For the first time in over 30 years there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government.

Kinnock then resigned as leader and was succeeded by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Once again the battle erupted between the old guard on the party's left and those identified as "modernisers".  The old guard argued that trends showed they were regaining strength under Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway SDP merged with the Liberal Party. The new [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. [[Tony Blair]] (the Shadow Home Secretary) had a different vision to traditional Labour politics. Blair, the leader of the "modernising" faction, argued that the long-term trends had to be reversed, arguing that the party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since it was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. Blair argued that the rapidly growing middle class was largely ignored, as well as more ambitious working-class families. Blair said that they aspired to become middle-class and accepted the Conservative argument that traditional Labour was holding ambitious people back to some extent with higher tax policies. To present a fresh face and new policies to the electorate, [[New Labour]] needed more than fresh leaders; it had to jettison outdated policies, argued the modernisers.<ref>David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh, ''The British general election of 1997'' (1997) pp 46–67.</ref> The first step was procedural, but essential.

This was achieved in 1995.{{sfn|Rentoul|2001|pp=249–266}}

[[Black Wednesday]] in September 1992 damaged the Conservative government's reputation for economic competence, and by the end of that year, Labour had a comfortable lead over the Tories in the opinion polls. Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong. However, Smith died from a heart attack in May 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005 | access-date=10 September 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901033201/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | archive-date=1 September 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> {{As of|2021}}, he is the last Labour leader not to have contested a general election (excluding acting leaders and the incumbent, whose tenure is ongoing).{{Refn|See [[Labour Party (UK)#Electoral performance|electoral performance]] and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]].|group=nb}}

[[Tony Blair]] continued to move the party further to the centre, abandoning the largely symbolic [[Clause IV|Clause Four]] at the 1995 mini-conference in a strategy to increase the party's appeal to "[[middle England]]". More than a simple re-branding, however, the project would draw upon the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] strategy, informed by the thoughts of the British sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]].

[[New Labour]] was first termed as an alternative branding for the Labour Party, dating from a conference slogan first used by the Labour Party in 1994, which was later seen in a draft manifesto published by the party in 1996, called ''[[New Labour, New Life For Britain]]''. It was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of [[Neil Kinnock]]. New Labour as a name has no official status, but remains in common use to distinguish modernisers from those holding to more traditional positions, normally referred to as "Old Labour".

In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Labour was re-elected for a third term, but with a reduced majority of 66 and popular vote of only 35.2%, the lowest percentage of any majority government in British history. During this election, proposed controversial posters by [[Alastair Campbell]] where opposition leader Michael Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who are both Jewish, were depicted as flying pigs were criticised as being anti-Semitic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/campbell-behind-pig-poster-7275427.html |title=Campbell 'behind pig poster' |date=13 April 2012 |access-date=14 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608121932/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/campbell-behind-pig-poster-7275427.html |archive-date=8 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The posters were referring to the expression 'when pigs fly', to suggest that Tory election promises were unrealistic.

Finance proved a major problem for the Labour Party during this period; a "[[cash for peerages]]" scandal under Blair resulted in the drying up of many major sources of donations. Declining party membership, partially due to the reduction of activists' influence upon policy-making under the reforms of [[Neil Kinnock]] and Blair, also contributed to financial problems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Between January and March 2008, the Labour Party received just over £3&nbsp;million in donations and were £17&nbsp;million in debt, compared to the Conservatives' £6&nbsp;million in donations and £12&nbsp;million in debt.<ref name="electoralcommission.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/new-figures-published-showing-political-partiesrsquo-donations-and-borrowing|title=New figures published showing political parties' donations and borrowing|date=22 May 2008|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|The Electoral Commission]]|access-date=2 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905082933/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/new-figures-published-showing-political-partiesrsquo-donations-and-borrowing|archive-date=5 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> These debts eventually mounted to £24.5&nbsp;million, and were finally fully repaid in 2015.<ref name=independent-20151126>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-pays-off-25m-debt-and-abandons-move-out-of-westminster-a6750541.html |title=Labour pays off £25m debt and abandons move out of Westminster |last=Dathan |first=Matt |newspaper=The Independent |date=26 November 2015 |access-date=27 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227214038/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-pays-off-25m-debt-and-abandons-move-out-of-westminster-a6750541.html |archive-date=27 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In mid-July 2021, the party's [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] voted to ban four far-left factions including [[Chris Williamson (politician)#The Resistance Movement|Resist]], [[Labour Against the Witchhunt]], the Labour in Exile Network and [[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)|Socialist Appeal]] on the grounds that "these organisations are not compatible with Labour's rules or our aims and values." These factions were sympathetic to former leader Jeremy Corbyn and had been accused of obstructing [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|efforts to combat antisemitism]] within the party.

{{social democracy sidebar}}
Labour is considered to be a [[centre-left]] party.{{refn|<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto2"/><ref name="auto4"/><ref name="auto3"/>{{sfn|Budge|2008|pp=26–27|ps=.{{verify source|date=January 2016}}}}}} It was initially formed as a means for the [[trade union movement]] to establish political representation for itself at [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]. The Labour Party only gained a "socialist" commitment with the original party constitution of 1918, but that "socialist" element, the original [[Clause IV]], was seen by its strongest advocates as a straightforward commitment to the "common ownership", or [[nationalisation]], of the "means of production, distribution and exchange". Although about a third of British industry was taken into public ownership after the Second World War and remained so until the 1980s, the right of the party were questioning the validity of expanding on this objective by the late 1950s. Influenced by [[Anthony Crosland]]'s book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956), the circle around party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] felt that the commitment was no longer necessary. While an attempt to remove Clause IV from the party constitution in 1959 failed, [[Tony Blair]] and the "modernisers" saw the issue as putting off potential voters,<ref name="historytoday.com">Martin Daunton [http://www.historytoday.com/martin-daunton/labour-party-and-clause-four-1918-1995 "The Labour Party and Clause Four 1918–1995"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721122126/http://www.historytoday.com/martin-daunton/labour-party-and-clause-four-1918-1995 |date=21 July 2015 }}, ''History Review 1995'' (''History Today'' website)</ref> and were successful 35 years later,<ref name="Philip Gould 2011, p.30">Philip Gould ''The Unfinished Revolution: How New Labour Changed British Politics Forever'', London: Hachette digital edition, 2011, p.30 (originally published by Little, Brown, 1998)</ref> with only limited opposition from senior figures in the party.<ref name="independent.co.uk">John Rentoul [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/defining-moment-as-blair-wins-backing-for-clause-iv-1611135.html {{"'}}Defining moment' as Blair wins backing for Clause IV"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908021337/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/defining-moment-as-blair-wins-backing-for-clause-iv-1611135.html |date=8 September 2017 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 14 March 1995</ref>

Historically influenced by [[Keynesian economics]], the party favoured [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] in the economy, and the [[Income redistribution|redistribution]] of wealth. Taxation was seen as a means to achieve a "major redistribution of wealth and income" in the October 1974 election manifesto.{{sfn|Lund|2006|p=111}} The party also desired increased rights for workers, and a [[welfare state]] including publicly funded healthcare.

=== Symbols ===
Labour has long been identified with red, a [[political colour]] traditionally affiliated with socialism and the [[labour movement]]. Prior to the red flag logo, the party had used a modified version of the classic 1924 shovel, torch, and quill emblem. In 1924 a brand conscious Labour leadership had devised a competition, inviting supporters to design a logo to replace the 'polo mint' like motif that had previously appeared on party literature. The winning entry, emblazoned with the word "Liberty" over a design incorporating a torch, shovel and quill symbol, was popularised through its sale, in badge form, for a shilling. The party conference in 1931 passed a motion "That this conference adopts Party Colours, which should be uniform throughout the country, colours to be red and gold".<ref name="ReferenceA">"Labour Party Annual Conference Report", 1931, p. 233.</ref>

[[File:Red flag.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]], originally the official flag and symbol of the Labour Party]]
Since the party's inception, the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] has been Labour's official symbol; the flag has been associated with socialism and revolution ever since the 1789 [[French Revolution]] and the [[revolutions of 1848]]. The [[Rose (symbolism)#Socialism and social democracy|red rose]], a symbol of socialism and social democracy, was adopted as the party symbol in 1986 as part of a rebranding exercise and is now incorporated into the party logo.<ref name="The Telegraph">{{cite news|title=The long and the short about Labour's red rose|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4263355/The-long-and-the-short-about-Labours-red-rose.html|access-date=31 August 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=26 June 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903182029/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4263355/The-long-and-the-short-about-Labours-red-rose.html|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The red flag became an inspiration which resulted in the composition of "[[The Red Flag]]", the official party anthem since its inception, being sung at the end of party conferences and on various occasions such as in Parliament in February 2006 to mark the centenary of the Labour Party's founding. It still remains in use, although attempts were made to play down the role of the song during New Labour.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12759902 |work=BBC News |first=Helen |last=Grady |title=Blue Labour: Party's radical answer to the Big Society? |date=21 March 2011 |access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915233157/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12759902 |archive-date=15 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Hoggart">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/28/labourconference.politicalcolumnists|title=Red Flag rises above a dodgy future|first=Simon|last=Hoggart|author-link=Simon Hoggart|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=28 September 2007|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002143642/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/28/labourconference.politicalcolumnists|archive-date=2 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The song "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]", based on a [[William Blake]] poem, is also frequently sung.<ref name="Telegraph.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8796628/Ed-Miliband-sings-The-Red-Flag-and-Jerusalem-at-the-Labour-Party-Conference.html|title=Video: Ed Miliband sings The Red Flag and Jerusalem at the Labour Party Conference|date=29 September 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909073707/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8796628/Ed-Miliband-sings-The-Red-Flag-and-Jerusalem-at-the-Labour-Party-Conference.html|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Labour Party is a membership organisation consisting of individual members and [[constituency Labour Party|constituency Labour parties]], [[affiliated trade unions]], [[socialist societies]] and the [[Co-operative Party]], with which it has an electoral agreement. Members who are elected to parliamentary positions take part in the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] (PLP). Prior to [[Brexit]] in January 2020, members also took part in the [[European Parliamentary Labour Party]] (EPLP).

The party's decision-making bodies on a national level formally include the [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] (NEC), [[Labour Party Conference]] and [[National Policy Forum]] (NPF)—although in practice the Parliamentary leadership has the final say on policy. The 2008 Labour Party Conference was the first at which affiliated trade unions and Constituency Labour Parties did not have the right to submit motions on contemporary issues that would previously have been debated.<ref name="Anger over 'union debate limit'">{{cite news |title=Anger over 'union debate limit' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7002618.stm |work=BBC News |date=19 September 2007 |access-date=13 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908173252/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7002618.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Labour Party conferences now include more "keynote" addresses, guest speakers and question-and-answer sessions, while specific discussion of policy now takes place in the National Policy Forum.
