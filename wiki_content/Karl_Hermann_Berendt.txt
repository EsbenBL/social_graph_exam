'''Karl Hermann Berendt''' (November 12, 1817 in [[Danzig]] – May 12, 1878 in [[Guatemala City]]) was a [[German-American]] [[physician]], collector, explorer and investigator of [[Mesoamerica]]n [[linguistics]].

==Biography==
He studied at various German universities, receiving his degree of [[M.D.]] at the [[University of Königsberg]] in 1842. In 1843, he began practice at [[Breslau]] and also acted as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in surgery and obstetrics at the [[University of Breslau]]. In 1848 he was a member of the [[Frankfurt parliament|Vorparlament at Frankfurt]].

His political sympathies forced him to move to America in 1851. He proceeded from [[New York City]] to [[Nicaragua]], and spent two years in the study of the [[ethnography]], [[geography]], and [[natural history]] of that region. Two years later he moved to [[Orizaba]], [[Mexico]], and thence to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], where he remained from 1855 to 1862. He then gave up medicine and devoted himself to natural science, linguistics, and ethnology, paying special attention to the [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] tribes. He spent a year in [[Tabasco]], and thence came in 1863 to the United States.

In the United States, he devoted the greater part of the following year in copying manuscripts in the library of [[John Carter Brown]]. At the request of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], he visited [[Yucatan]]. The results of this visit are published in its report for 1867. In 1869 he explored the ruins of ancient [[Centla]], in the plains of Tabasco. He visited the United States several times between this date and 1876, his last visit.

In 1874 he settled at [[Cobán]], [[Alta Verapaz Department|Vera Paz]], partly to study the Maya dialects of the region and partly to raise tobacco. At the request of the Berlin museum he spent a winter in securing and forwarding the sculptured slabs of [[Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa]], Guatemala, but an attack of fever terminated his work.

==Works==
He contributed many articles in English, German, and Spanish to such works as [[August Heinrich Petermann|Petermann]]'s ''Mittheilungen'' (Communications) and the ''Deutsch-Amerikanisches Conversations-Lexicon'' (German-American Encyclopedia). Much of his work is unpublished, some manuscripts being in the [[National Anthropological Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and others deposited in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] library as part of the [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] bequest. Among Berendt's published works are:
* ''Analytical Alphabet for the Mexican and Central American Languages'' (New York, 1869)
* ''Los escritos de D. Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta'' (Mérida, 1870)
* ''Los trabajos {{lang|es|linguisticos}} de Don Pio Perez'' (Mexico, 1871)
* ''Cartilla en lengua Maya'' (Mérida, 1871)
* "On a Grammar and Dictionary of the Carib or Karif Language," in the Smithsonian report for 1873
* "Die Indianer des Isthmus von Tehuantepec" in ''[[Zeitschrift für Ethnologie]]'', 1873
* "The Darien Language" in the ''American Historical Record'', 1874
