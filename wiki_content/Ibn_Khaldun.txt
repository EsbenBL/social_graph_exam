Ibn Khaldun's life is relatively well-documented, as he wrote an [[autobiography]] ({{lang|ar|التعريف بابن خلدون ورحلته غربا وشرقا}}, ''{{transl|ar|at-Taʻrīf bi-ibn Khaldūn wa-Riḥlatih Gharban wa-Sharqan}}''<ref>Published by Muḥammad ibn Tāwīt aṭ-Ṭanjī, Cairo 1951</ref>) ("''Presenting Ibn Khaldun and his Journey West and East''") in which numerous documents regarding his life are quoted word-for-word.

Abdurahman bin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Al-Hasan bin Jabir bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abdurahman bin Ibn Khaldun al-Hadrami, generally known as "Ibn Khaldūn" after a remote ancestor, was born in [[Tunis]] in AD 1332 (732 [[Anno hegirae|AH]]) into an upper-class [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] family of Arab descent,<ref name="WP:BOMBARD" /> the family's ancestor was a [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] who shared kinship with [[Hujr ibn 'Adi|Waíl ibn Hujr]], a companion of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. His family, which held many high offices in [[Al-Andalus]], had emigrated to [[Tunisia]] after the fall of [[Seville]] to the [[Reconquista]] in AD 1248. Under the Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]], some of his family held political office; his father and grandfather, however, withdrew from political life and joined a mystical order. His brother, Yahya Khaldun, was also a [[historian]] who wrote a book on the [[Abdalwadid]] dynasty and was assassinated by a rival for being the official [[historiographer]] of the court.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=1841 |title=Lettre à Monsieur Garcin de Tassy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blQpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA484 |journal=[[Journal Asiatique]] |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=[[Société asiatique]] |volume=3 |page=491 |number=12}}</ref>

In his autobiography, Khaldun traces his descent back to the time of Muhammad through an Arab tribe from [[Yemen]], specifically the [[Hadhramaut]], which came to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 8th century, at the beginning of the Islamic conquest: "And our ancestry is from Hadhramaut, from the Arabs of Yemen, via Wa'il ibn Hujr also known as [[Hujr ibn 'Adi]], from the best of the Arabs, well-known and respected." (p.&nbsp;2429, Al-Waraq's edition). 

However, the modern biographer Mohammad Enan emphasised the unclear origins of Ibn Khaldun relying on the fact that Ibn Khaldun's criticism of Arabs might be a valid reason to cast doubt on his Arab origin. While, Ibn Khaldun's insistence and attachment to his claim of Arab ancestry at a time of Berber dynasties domination is also a valid reason to believe his claim.<ref name="Hozien">{{cite web | last=Hozien | first=Muhammad | title=Notes on Ibn Khaludn's Life | website=You are being directed to the new muslim philosophy Website has moved to muslimphilosophy.org | url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/knts.htm#n1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Enan|first=Mohammad Abdullah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQTNO3CWmpAC&q=ancestry&pg=PA7|title=Ibn Khaldūn: His Life and Works|date=2007|publisher=The Other Press|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|language=en}}</ref>

== Education ==
His family's high rank enabled Ibn Khaldun to study with prominent teachers in [[Maghreb]]. He received a classical [[Madrasah|Islamic education]], studying the [[Quran]], which he [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized by heart]], [[Arabic language|Arabic linguistics]]; the basis for understanding the Qur'an, [[hadith]], [[sharia]] (law) and [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence). He received certification ([[ijazah]]) for all of those subjects.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Muhammad Hozien |title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Work |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913010235/http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm |archive-date=2013-09-13 |access-date=2008-09-19 |publisher=Islamic Philosophy Online}}</ref> The [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] Al-Abili of [[Tlemcen]] introduced him to [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], and he studied especially the works of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]]. At the age of 17, Ibn Khaldūn lost both his parents to the [[Black Death]], an intercontinental [[epidemic]] of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] that hit Tunis in 1348–1349.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Saudi Aramco World: Ibn Khaldun and the Rise and Fall of Empires |url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200605/ibn.khaldun.and.the.rise.and.fall.of.empires.htm |access-date=2017-12-06 |website=archive.aramcoworld.com}}</ref>

Following family tradition, he strove for a political career. In the face of a tumultuous political situation in North Africa, that required a high degree of skill in developing and dropping alliances prudently to avoid falling with the short-lived regimes of the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ibn Khaldun – His Life and Work |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913010235/http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm |archive-date=2013-09-13 |access-date=2017-12-06 |website=www.muslimphilosophy.com}}</ref> Ibn Khaldūn's autobiography is the story of an adventure, in which he spends time in prison, reaches the highest offices and falls again into exile.

At the age of 20, he began his political career in the chancellery of the Tunisian ruler Ibn Tafrakin with the position of ''Kātib al-'Alāmah'' (seal-bearer),<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/ibn-khaldun-his-life-and-works|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works {{!}} Muslim Heritage|website=muslimheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206135839/http://muslimheritage.com/article/ibn-khaldun-his-life-and-works|archive-date=2017-12-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> which consisted of writing in fine [[calligraphy]] the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, Abū Ziad, the [[sultan]] of Constantine, marched on Tunis and defeated it. Ibn Khaldūn, in any case unhappy with his respected but politically meaningless position, followed his teacher Abili to [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. There, the [[Marinid]] sultan, Abū Inan Fares I, appointed him as a writer of royal proclamations, but Ibn Khaldūn still schemed against his employer, which, in 1357, got the 25-year-old a 22-month prison sentence. Upon the death of Abū Inan in 1358, Vizier al-Hasān ibn-Umar granted him freedom and reinstated him to his rank and offices. Ibn Khaldūn then schemed against Abū Inan's successor, Abū Salem Ibrahim III, with Abū Salem's exiled uncle, Abū Salem. When Abū Salem came to power, he gave Ibn Khaldūn a ministerial position, the first position to correspond with Ibn Khaldūn's ambitions.

The treatment that Ibn Khaldun received after the fall of Abū Salem through Ibn-Amar ʻAbdullah, a friend of Ibn Khaldūn's, was not to his liking, as he received no significant official position. At the same time, Amar successfully prevented Ibn Khaldūn, whose political skills he knew well, from allying with the Abd al-Wadids in Tlemcen. Ibn Khaldūn, therefore, decided to move to [[Granada]]. He could be sure of a positive welcome there since at Fez, he had helped the Sultan of Granada, the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Muhammad V, regain power from his temporary exile. In 1364, Muhammad entrusted him with a diplomatic mission to the king of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Pedro of Castile|Pedro the Cruel]], to endorse a peace treaty. Ibn Khaldūn successfully carried out this mission and politely declined Pedro's offer to remain at his court and have his family's Spanish possessions returned to him.

In Granada, Ibn Khaldūn quickly came into competition with Muhammad's vizier, [[Ibn al-Khatib]], who viewed the close relationship between Muhammad and Ibn Khaldūn with increasing mistrust. Ibn Khaldūn tried to shape the young Muhammad into his ideal of a wise ruler, an enterprise that Ibn al-Khatib thought foolish and a danger to peace in the country. History proved al-Khatib right, and at his instigation, Ibn Khaldūn was eventually sent back to North Africa. Al-Khatib himself was later accused by Muhammad of having unorthodox philosophical views and murdered despite an attempt by Ibn Khaldūn to intercede on behalf of his old rival.

In his autobiography, Ibn Khaldūn tells little about his conflict with Ibn al-Khatib and the reasons for his departure. Orientalist [[Muhsin Mahdi]] interprets that as showing that Ibn Khaldūn later realised that he had completely misjudged Muhammad V.

Back in [[Ifriqiya]], the [[Hafsids of Bejaïa|Hafsid]] sultan of [[Béjaïa|Bougie]], Abū ʻAbdallāh, who had been his companion in prison, received him with great enthusiasm and made Ibn Khaldūn his prime minister. Ibn Khaldūn carried out a daring mission to collect taxes among the local Berber tribes. After the death of Abū ʻAbdallāh in 1366, Ibn Khaldūn changed sides once again and allied himself with the [[Sultan of Tlemcen]], Abū l-Abbas. A few years later, he was taken prisoner by [[Abu Faris Abdul Aziz]], who had defeated the sultan of Tlemcen and seized the throne. He then entered a monastic establishment and occupied himself with scholastic duties until 1370. In that year, he was sent for to Tlemcen by the new sultan. After the death of ʻAbdu l-Azīz, he resided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent.

Ibn Khaldūn's political skills and, above all, his good relationship with the wild Berber tribes were in high demand among the North African rulers, but he had begun to tire of politics and constantly switching allegiances. In 1375, he was sent by Abū Hammu, the ʻAbdu l Wadid Sultan of Tlemcen, on a mission to the Dawadida Arabs tribes of Biskra. After his return to the West, Ibn Khaldūn sought refuge with one of the Berber tribes in the west of [[Algeria]], in the town of [[Qalat Ibn Salama]]. He lived there for over three years under their protection, taking advantage of his seclusion to write the ''Muqaddimah'' "Prolegomena", the introduction to his planned history of the world. In Ibn Salama, however, he lacked the necessary texts to complete the work.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://alhassanain.org/english/?com=book&id=1008|title=Ibn Khaldun's Political and Economic Realism|date=2016-03-26|language=en}}</ref> Therefore, in 1378, he returned to his native Tunis, which had meanwhile been conquered by Abū l-Abbas, who took Ibn Khaldūn back into his service. There, he devoted himself almost exclusively to his studies and completed his history of the world. His relationship with Abū l-Abbas remained strained, as the latter questioned his loyalty. That was brought into sharp contrast after Ibn Khaldūn presented him with a copy of the completed history that omitted the usual [[panegyric]] to the ruler. Under pretence of going on the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]], something for which a Muslim ruler could not simply refuse permission, Ibn Khaldūn was able to leave Tunis and to sail to [[Alexandria]].

{{refimprovesect|date=January 2019}}
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun Statue and Square, Mohandesin, Cairo.jpg|thumbnail|Ibn Khaldun Statue and Square, [[Mohandessin]], Cairo]]
Ibn Khaldun said of Egypt, "He who has not seen it does not know the power of Islam."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-Khaldun#ref3458 | title=Ibn Khaldūn &#124; Muslim historian}}</ref> While other Islamic regions had to cope with border wars and inner strife, [[Mamluk]]s Egypt enjoyed prosperity and high culture. In 1384, the Egyptian Sultan, al-Malik udh-Dhahir [[Barquq]], made Khaldun professor of the Qamhiyyah Madrasah and the grand [[qadi]] of the [[Maliki]] school of fiqh (one of four schools, the Maliki school was widespread primarily in [[Western Africa]]). His efforts at reform encountered resistance, however, and within a year, he had to resign his judgeship. Also in 1384, a ship carrying Khaldun's wife and children sank off of Alexandria. 

After his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca in May 1388, Ibn Khaldūn concentrated on teaching at various Cairo madrasas. At the Mamluk court he fell from favor because during revolts against Barquq, he had, apparently under duress, with other Cairo jurists, issued a [[fatwa]] against Barquq. Later relations with Barquq returned to normal, and he was once again named the Maliki ''qadi''. Altogether, he was called six times to that high office, which, for various reasons, he never held long.

In 1401, under Barquq's successor, his son Faraj, Ibn Khaldūn took part in a military campaign against the [[Mongol]] conqueror, [[Timur]], who besieged [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|Damascus]] in 1400. Ibn Khaldūn cast doubt upon the viability of the venture and really wanted to stay in Egypt. His doubts were vindicated, as the young and inexperienced Faraj, concerned about a revolt in Egypt, left his army to its own devices in [[Syria]] and hurried home. Ibn Khaldūn remained at the besieged city for seven weeks, being lowered over the city wall by ropes to negotiate with Timur, in a historic series of meetings that he reported extensively in his autobiography.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bent|first=Josephine van den|date=2016-05-03|title="None of the Kings on Earth is Their Equal in ʿaṣabiyya:" The Mongols in Ibn Khaldūn's Works|journal=Al-Masāq|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–86|doi=10.1080/09503110.2016.1198535|issn=0950-3110|doi-access=free}}</ref> Timur questioned him in detail about conditions in the lands of the Maghreb. At his request, Ibn Khaldūn even wrote a long report about it. As he recognized Timur's intentions, he did not hesitate, on his return to Egypt, to compose an equally-extensive report on the history of the [[Tatars]], together with a character study of Timur, sending them to the Merinid rulers in Fez (Maghreb).

Ibn Khaldūn spent the next five years in Cairo completing his autobiography and his history of the world and acting as teacher and judge. Meanwhile, he was alleged to have joined an underground party, Rijal Hawa Rijal, whose reform-oriented ideals attracted the attention of local political authorities. The elderly Ibn Khaldun was placed under arrest. He died on 17 March 1406, one month after his sixth selection for the office of the Maliki ''qadi'' (Judge).

Concerning the discipline of [[sociology]], he described the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the inevitable loss of power that occurs when warriors conquer a city. According to the Arab scholar [[Sati' al-Husri]], the ''Muqaddimah'' may be read as a sociological work. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of ''[['aṣabiyyah]]'', which has been translated as "[[social cohesion]]", "group solidarity", or "[[tribalism]]". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion. Some of Ibn Khaldun's views, particularly those concerning the ''[[Zanj]]'' people of sub-Saharan Africa,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Negative Images of Blacks in Some Medieval Iranian Writings |last1=Southgate|first1=Minoo|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=17|issue=1|page=15|jstor=4310424|year=1984|doi=10.1080/00210868408701620}}</ref> have been cited as [[Racism|racist]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Racism: A Global Reader |editor=Kevin Reilly |editor2=Stephen Kaufman |editor3=Angela Bodino|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2003|page=123|isbn=978-0-7656-1059-1}}</ref> though they were not uncommon for their time. According to the scholar Abdelmajid Hannoum, Ibn Khaldun's description of the distinctions between [[Berbers]] and Arabs were misinterpreted by the translator [[William McGuckin de Slane]], who wrongly inserted a "racial ideology that sets Arabs and Berbers apart and in opposition" into his translation of part of''`Ibar'' translated under the title Histoire des Berbères .<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hannoum|first=Abdelmajid|date=2003|title=Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldûn Orientalist|journal=History and Theory|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–80|doi=10.1111/1468-2303.00230|jstor=3590803}}</ref>

Perhaps the most frequently cited observation drawn from Ibn Khaldūn's work is the notion that when a society becomes a great civilization, its high point is followed by a period of decay. This means that the next cohesive group that conquers the diminished civilization is, by comparison, a group of [[barbarians]]. Once the barbarians solidify their control over the conquered society, however, they become attracted to its more refined aspects, such as literacy and arts, and either assimilate into or appropriate such cultural practices. Then, eventually, the former barbarians will be conquered by a new set of barbarians, who will repeat the process.

Georgetown University Professor Ibrahim Oweiss, an economist and historian, notes that [[Joseph_Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] and [[David Hume]] both proposed a labor theory of value, though Khaldun did not refer to it as either a labor theory of value or theory.<ref>Oweiss, Ibrahim M. “Ibn Khaldun, the Father of Economics.” Georgetown University, State University of New York Press, 1988, faculty.georgetown.edu/imo3/ibn.htm.</ref>

Ibn Khaldun outlines an early example of [[political economy]]{{doubtful|date=July 2016}}. He describes the economy as being composed of [[theory of value (economics)|value-adding processes]]; that is, labor and skill is added to techniques and crafts and the product is sold at a higher value {{doubtful|date=June 2017}}.  He also made the distinction between "profit" and "sustenance", in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively.  He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work, the ''Muqaddimah''. In Al-Muqaddimah Khaldun states, “Civilization and its well-being, as well as business prosperity, depend on productivity and people’s efforts in all directions in their own interest and profit”.<ref>Khaldun, Ibn, et al. Muqaddimah - an Introduction to History. Princeton University Press, 2015.</ref>
Ibn Khaldun diverged from norms that Muslim historians followed and rejected their focus on the credibility of the transmitter and focused instead on the validity of the stories and encouraged critical thinking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://evonomics.com/amazing-north-african-scholar-beat-adam-smith-half-millennium/|title=The Amazing Arab Scholar Who Beat Adam Smith by Half a Millennium – Evonomics|date=2017-06-09|work=Evonomics|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Ibn Khaldun also outlines early theories of division of labor, taxes, scarcity, and economic growth.<ref>Irwin, Robert. Ibn Khaldun: an Intellectual Biography. Princeton University Press., 2018.</ref> 
Khaldun was also one of the first to study the origin and causes of poverty; he argued that poverty was a result of the destruction of morality and human values. <ref>Affandi, Akhmad, and Dewi Puji Astuti. “Dynamic Model of Ibn Khaldun Theory on Poverty.” Humanomics, vol. 30, no. 2, 2014, pp. 136–161.</ref> He also looked at what factors contribute to wealth such as consumption, government, and investment—a precursor to our modern GDP-formula.<ref>Affandi, Akhmad, and Dewi Puji Astuti. “Dynamic Model of Ibn Khaldun Theory on Poverty.” Humanomics, vol. 30, no. 2, 2014, pp. 136–161.</ref> Khaldun also argued that poverty was not necessarily a result of poor financial decision-making but of external consequences and therefore the government should be involved in alleviating poverty.<ref>Affandi, Akhmad, and Dewi Puji Astuti. “Dynamic Model of Ibn Khaldun Theory on Poverty.” Humanomics, vol. 30, no. 2, 2014, pp. 136–161.</ref>

Ibn Khaldun also believed that the currency of an Islamic monetary system should have [[wikt:intrinsic|intrinsic]] value and therefore be made of [[gold]] and [[silver]] (such as the [[dirham]]). He emphasized that the weight and purity of these coins should be strictly followed: the weight of one dinar should be one ''mithqal'' (the weight of 72 grains of [[barley]], roughly 4.25 grams) and the weight of 7 dinar should be equal to weight of 10 dirhams (7/10 of a ''mithqal'' or 2.96 grams).<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34-35.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt. 34–35]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Social thought ===
Ibn Khaldun's epistemology attempted to reconcile mysticism with theology by dividing science into two different categories, the religious science that regards the sciences of the Qur'an and the non-religious science. He further classified the non-religious sciences into intellectual sciences such as logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, etc. and auxiliary sciences such as language, literature, poetry, etc. He also suggested that possibly more divisions will appear in the future with different societies. He tried to adapt to all possible societies’ cultural behavior and influence in education, economics and politics. Nonetheless, he didn't think that laws were chosen by just one leader or a small group of individual but mostly by the majority of the individuals of a society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The epistemology of Ibn Khaldun|last=Ahmad|first=Zaid|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-61275-3|location=New York}}</ref>

To Ibn Khaldun, the state was a necessity of human society to restrain injustice within the society, but the state means is force, thus itself an injustice. All societies must have a state governing them in order to establish a society. He attempted to standardize the history of societies by identifying ubiquitous phenomena present in all societies. To him, civilization was a phenomenon that will be present as long as humans exist. He characterized the fulfillment of basic needs as the beginning of civilization. At the beginning, people will look for different ways of increasing productivity of basic needs and expansion will occur. Later the society starts becoming more sedentary and focuses more on crafting, arts and the more refined characteristics. By the end of a society, it will weaken, allowing another small group of individuals to come into control. The conquering group is described as an unsatisfied group within the society itself or a group of desert bandits that constantly attack other weaker or weakened societies.

In the Muqaddimah, his most important work, he discusses an introduction of philosophy to history in a general manner, based on observable patterns within a theoretical framework of known historical events of his time. He described the beginnings, development, cultural trends and the fall of all societies, leading to the rise of a new society which would then follow the same trends in a continuous cycle. Also, he recommended the best political approaches to develop a society according to his knowledge of history. He heavily emphasized that a good society would be one in which a tradition of education is deeply rooted in its culture.<ref name=":1" />
Ibn Khaldun (1987) introduced the word ''asabiya'' (solidarity, group feeling, or group consciousness), to explain tribalism. The concept of asabiya has been translated as "social cohesion," "group solidarity," or "tribalism." This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups (Rashed,2017).

Ibn Khaldun believed that too much bureaucracy, such as taxes and legislations, would lead to the decline of a society, since it would constrain the development of more specialized labor (increase in scholars and development of different services). He believed that bureaucrats cannot understand the world of commerce and do not possess the same motivation as a businessman.<ref name=":1" />

In his work the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun emphasizes human beings' faculty to think (''fikr'') as what determines human behavior and ubiquitous patterns. This faculty is also what inspires human beings to form into a social structure to co-operate in division of labor and organization.  According to Zaid Ahmand in ''Epistemology and the Human Dimension in Urban Studies'', the ''fikr'' faculty is the supporting pillar for all philosophical aspects of Ibn Khaldun's theory related to human beings’ spiritual, intellectual, physical, social and political tendencies.

Another important concept he emphasizes in his work is the mastery of crafts, habits and skills. This takes place after a society is established and according to Ibn Khaldun the level of achievement of a society can be determined by just analyzing these three concepts. A society in its earliest stages is nomadic and primarily concerned with survival, while a society at a later stage is sedentary, with greater achievement in crafts. A society with a sedentary culture and stable politics would be expected to have greater achievements in crafts and technology.<ref name=":1" />

Ibn Khaldun also emphasized in his epistemology the important aspect that educational tradition plays to ensure the new generations of a civilization continuously improve in the sciences and develop culture. Ibn Khaldun argued that without the strong establishment of an educational tradition, it would be very difficult for the new generations to maintain the achievements of the earlier generations, let alone improve them.

Another way to distinguish the achievement of a society would be the language of a society, since for him the most important element of a society would not be land, but the language spoken. He was surprised that many non-Arabs were really successful in the Arabic society, had good jobs and were well received by the community. "These people were non-Arab by descent, but they grew up among the Arabs who possessed the habit of Arabic," Ibn Khaldun once recalled, "[b]ecause of this, they were able to master Arabic so well that they cannot be surpassed."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/UmarIbnAlKhattab2Volumes|title=Umar Ibn Al Khattab (2 Volumes)|last=Umar Ibn Al Khattab (2 Volumes)|first=Umar Ibn Al Khattab|date=2017-02-05}}</ref> He believed that the reason why non-Arabs were accepted as part of Arab society was due to their mastery of the Arabic language.

Advancements in literary works such as poems and prose were another way to distinguish the achievement of a civilization, but Ibn Khaldun believed that whenever the literary facet of a society reaches its highest levels it ceases to indicate societal achievements anymore, but is an embellishment of life. For logical sciences he established knowledge at its highest level as an increase of scholars and the quality of knowledge. For him the highest level of literary productions would be the manifestation of prose, poems and the artistic enrichment of a society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IbnKhaldunsHistoryalMuqaddimah/Ibn%20khaldun's%20History%20(al-muqaddimah)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Ibn Khaldun's Historiography"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>

=== Minor works ===
From other sources we know of several other works, primarily composed during the time he spent in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]]. His first book, ''[[Lubābu l-Muhassal]]'', a commentary on the [[Islamic theology]] of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], was written at the age of 19 under the supervision of his teacher al-Ābilī in Tunis. A work on [[Sufism]], ''Shifā'u l-Sā'il'', was composed around 1373 in [[Fes, Morocco]]. Whilst at the court of [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada]], Ibn Khaldūn composed a [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|work on logic]], ''ʻallaqa li-s-Sulṭān''.

=== Egypt ===
Ibn Khaldun's historical method had very few precedents or followers in his time. While Ibn Khaldun is known to have been a successful lecturer on jurisprudence within religious sciences, only very few of his students were aware of, and influenced by, his Muqaddimah.<ref name="Simon">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Robert|title=Ibn Khaldun: History as Science and the Patrimonial Empire|date=2002|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|location=Budapest|isbn=978-963-05-7934-6|pages=18–20, 22–24|ref=Simon}}</ref> One such student, [[Al-Maqrizi]], praised the Muqaddimah, although some scholars have found his praise, and that of others, to be generally empty and lacking understanding of Ibn Khaldun's methods.<ref name=Simon />

Ibn Khaldun also faced primarily criticism from his contemporaries, particularly [[Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalani]]. These criticisms included accusations of inadequate historical knowledge, an inaccurate title, disorganization, and a style resembling that of the prolific Arab literature writer, [[Al-Jahiz]]. Al-Asqalani also noted that Ibn Khaldun was not well-liked in Egypt because he opposed many respected traditions, including the traditional judicial dress, and suggested that this may have contributed to the reception of Ibn Khaldun's historical works.<ref name=Simon /> The notable exception to this consensus was [[Ibn al-Azraq]], a jurist who lived shortly after Ibn Khaldun and quoted heavily from the first and fourth books of the Kitab al-‘Ibar, in developing a work of mirrors for princes.<ref name=Simon />

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Ibn Khaldun's work found some recognition with Ottoman intellectuals in the 17th century. The first references to Ibn Khaldun in Ottoman writings appeared in the middle of the 17th century, with historians such as [[Kâtip Çelebi]] naming him as a great influence, while another Turkish Ottoman historian, [[Mustafa Naima]], attempted to use Ibn Khaldun's cyclical theory of the rise and fall of empires to describe the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Simon /> Increasing perceptions of the decline of the Ottoman Empire also caused similar ideas to appear independently of Ibn Khaldun in the 16th century, and may explain some of the influence of his works.<ref name=Simon />

=== Europe ===
In Europe, Ibn Khaldun was first brought to the attention of the [[Western world]] in 1697, when a biography of him appeared in [[Barthélemy d'Herbelot de Molainville]]'s ''Bibliothèque Orientale''. However, some scholars believe that Ibn Khaldun's work may have first been introduced to Europe via Ibn Arabshah's biography of Tamerlane, translated to Latin, which covers a meeting between Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane.<ref name="Alatas">{{cite book|last1=Alatas|first1=Syed Farid|title=Ibn Khaldun|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-19-809045-8|pages=106–09}}</ref> According to Ibn Arabshah, during this meeting, Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane discussed the Maghrib in depth, as well as Tamerlane's genealogy and place in history.<ref name="Fischel">{{cite book|last1=Fischel|first1=Walter|title=Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane: Their Historic Meeting in Damascus, A.D. 1401 (A.H. 803)|date=1952|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles}}</ref> Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when [[Silvestre de Sacy]]'s ''Chrestomathie Arabe'' included his biography together with a translation of parts of the ''Muqaddimah'' as the ''Prolegomena''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|page=118}}</ref> In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the ''Prolegomena''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|pages=118–19}}</ref> More details on and partial translations of the ''Prolegomena'' emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858. Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|pages=119–20}}</ref> [[Reynold A. Nicholson]] praised Ibn Khaldun as a uniquely brilliant Muslim sociologist, but discounted Khaldun's influence.<ref name="Alatas" /> Spanish Philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] viewed the conflicts of North Africa as a problem that stemmed from a lack of African thought, and praised Ibn Khaldun for making sense of the conflict by simplifying it to the relationship between the nomadic and sedentary modes of life.<ref name="Alatas" />

=== Modern historians ===
British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] has called Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah "the greatest work of its kind."<ref name=Britannica>''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 15th ed., vol. 9, p. 148.</ref> [[Ernest Gellner]], once a professor of philosophy and logic at the [[London School of Economics]], considered Khaldun's definition of government<ref name="Government" group="n" /> the best in the history of political theory.<ref>Ernest Gellner, ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988), p. 239</ref>

More moderate views on the scope of Ibn Khaldun's contributions have also emerged. [[Arthur Laffer]], for whom the [[Laffer curve]] is named, acknowledged that Ibn Khaldun's ideas, as well as others, precede his own work on that curve.<ref name="Laffter at Heritage">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm |author=[[Arthur Laffer]] |date=June 1, 2004 |title=The Laffer Curve, Past, Present and Future |publisher=Heritage Foundation |access-date=2007-12-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201225944/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm |archive-date=December 1, 2007 }}</ref> 

Scottish philosopher [[Robert Flint]] praised him strongly, "as a [[theorist]] of history he had no equal in any age or country until [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] appeared, more than three hundred years later. [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Augustine]] were not his peers, and all others were unworthy of being even mentioned along with him". Ibn Khaldun's work on evolution of societies also influenced [[Egon Orowan]], who termed the concept of ''socionomy''.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/eorowan.pdf |title=Egon Orowan. 1901–1989. A Biographical Memoir |author1=F.R.N. Nabarro |author2=A.S. Argon |date=1996 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC}}</ref> While Ibn Khaldun's record-keeping is usually passed over in favor of recognizing his contributions to the science of history, Abderrahmane Lakhsassi wrote "No historian of the Maghreb since and particularly of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] can do without his historical contribution."<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

=== Public recognition ===
Public recognition of Ibn Khaldun has increased in recent years. In 2004, the [[Tunisian Community Center]] launched the first Ibn Khaldun Award to recognize a Tunisian/American high achiever whose work reflects Ibn Khaldun's ideas of kinship and solidarity. The Award was named after Ibn Khaldun for the convergence of his ideas with the organization's objectives and programs. In 2006, the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]] launched an annual essay contest<ref name="Atlas">{{cite web|title=2008 Ibn-Khaldun Essay Contest|url=http://www.atlasusa.org/V2/main/page.php?page_id=741|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912062823/http://www.atlasusa.org/V2/main/page.php?page_id=741|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-09-12|website=www.atlasusa|publisher=Atlas Economic Research Foundation}}</ref> for students named in Ibn Khaldun's honor. The theme of the contest is "how individuals, think tanks, universities and entrepreneurs can influence government policies to allow the free market to flourish and improve the lives of its citizens based on Islamic teachings and traditions."<ref name=Atlas /> In 2006, Spain commemorated the 600th anniversary of the death of Ibn Khaldun by orchestrating an exhibit titled "Encounter of Civilizations:  Ibn Khaldun."<ref>{{cite web|title=Encounter of Civilizations: Ibn Khaldun Exhibit Opens at Headquarters|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/note6056.doc.htm|website=un.org|publisher=United Nations|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref> 

In 2007, [[İbn Haldun Üniversitesi]] has opened in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] to commemorate his name. The university promotes a policy of trilingualism. The languages in question are English, Modern Turkish, and Arabic and its emphasis is on teaching social sciences. 

In 1981 U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] cited Ibn Khaldun as an influence on his [[supply-side economic]] policies, also known as [[Reaganomics]]. He paraphrased Ibn Khaldun, who said that "in the beginning of the dynasty, great tax revenues were gained from small assessments," and that "at the end of the dynasty, small tax revenues were gained from large assessments." Reagan said his goal is "trying to get down to the small assessments and the great revenues."<ref>{{cite news |last1=McFadden |first1=Robert D. |title=Reagan Cites Islamic Scholar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/02/us/reagan-cites-islamic-scholar.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 October 1981}}</ref>

* "He is considered by some as a father of modern economics, or at least a major forerunner. The Western world recognizes Khaldun as the father of sociology but hesitates in recognizing him as a great economist who laid its very foundations. He was the first to systematically analyze the functioning of an economy, the importance of technology, specialization and foreign trade in economic surplus and the role of government and its stabilization policies to increase output and employment. Moreover, he dealt with the problem of optimum taxation, minimum government services, incentives, institutional framework, law and order, expectations, production, and the theory of value".[http://www.ovidius-stec.ro/html/anale/ENG/cuprins%20rezumate/2009%20vol2.pdf Cosma, Sorinel (2009).
