'''Phillip David Cagan''' (April 30, 1927 – June 15, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] scholar and author. He was Professor of Economics Emeritus at [[Columbia University]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], Cagan and his family moved to [[Southern California]] shortly thereafter. Cagan joined the [[U.S. Navy]] at age 17 and fought in [[World War II]]. After the war, Cagan decided to go to college, and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[UCLA]] in 1948.  Cagan received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1951, and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[Economics]] in 1954 from the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="Chicago School">{{cite book | last=Van Overtveldt | first=Johan | author-link=Johan Van Overtveldt | title=The Chicago School: How the University of Chicago Assembled the Thinkers Who Revolutionized Economics and Business | year=2007 | location=Chicago | publisher=[[Agate Publishing]] | isbn=978-1-932841-14-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/chicagoschoolhow0000over }}</ref>

After graduate school, Cagan joined the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) in [[New York City]] where he worked for two years. Then Cagan re-entered academia, teaching at the University of Chicago for three years, and at [[Brown University]] for seven years.  In 1966 Cagan was hired by [[Columbia University]], where he taught economics for nearly thirty years — save for fifteen months spent in [[Washington, D.C.]], when he was on the staff of the [[Council of Economic Advisors]] (CEA).

During his time at Columbia, Cagan was also associated with the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI) in Washington, D.C., writing on public policy issues.

Cagan lived in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]] during his last years.

==Contributions to economic science==
Cagan's work focused on [[monetary policy]] and the control of [[inflation]]. Cagan has published over 100 books, journal articles, reviews, reports, and pamphlets on these and other topics in [[macroeconomics]]. He is perhaps best known for ''Determinants and Effects of Changes in the Stock of Money, 1875–1960'', a work that sought to identify the "causal relationships between changes in money, prices and output."<ref name="Determinants and Effects">{{cite book | last=Cagan | first=Phillip | author-link=Phillip Cagan | title=Determinants and Effects of Changes in the Stock of Money, 1875–1960 | year=1965 | location=New York | publisher =Columbia University Press }}</ref> The book, part of the NBER series that contained [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna J. Schwartz]]'s ''Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960'', was praised for its "careful empirical work" and called "the most complete study in the area."<ref name="Klein Review">{{cite journal | last=Klein | first=Benjamin | author-link=Benjamin Klein | title=Review: Did Monetary Forces Cause the Great Depression? | journal=The Journal of Business | volume=50 | issue=2 | pages=244–248 | year=1977 | doi = 10.1086/295938| issn=0021-9398 | jstor=2352161}}</ref>

Cagan's most important contribution to economics, however, is the article included in [[Milton Friedman]]'s edited volume ''Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money'' (1956), entitled "The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation,"<ref name="Hyper">{{Cite book | last =Cagan  | first=Phillip | author-link=Phillip Cagan | editor1-last=Friedman | editor1-first=Milton | editor1-link=Milton Friedman |  contribution=The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation | title=Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1956 | isbn=0-226-26406-8 }}</ref> a work that became an "instant classic" in the field.<ref name="Chicago School"/>

The article, which contained "extensive manipulation of [[differential equation]]s and an ingenious use of exponentially weighted averages",<ref name="Angell">{{cite journal | last1=Angell | first1=James W. | author-link=James W. Angell | title=Review: Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money | journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume=52 | issue=280 | pages=599–602 | year=1957 | doi = 10.2307/2281729| jstor=2281729 | publisher=American Statistical Association | last2=Friedman | first2=Milton | last3=Cagan | first3=Phillip | last4=Klein | first4=John J. | last5=Lerner | first5=Eugene M. | last6=Selden | first6=Richard T. }}</ref> analyzed seven [[hyper-inflation|hyperinflations]] and found that "the parameters of money [[demand function]]s estimated during [[hyperinflation]] generally satisfy the condition of dynamic [[Economic stability|stability]] that precludes the [[inflation]] from being self-generating, or displaying period-to-period oscillations."<ref name="Dynamic Stability in the Cagan Model">{{cite journal | last=Khan | first=Mohsin S. | author-link=Mohsin S.

After its publication, Cagan's article generated a significant body of work, as a number of leading [[macroeconomist]]s either reexamined or extended [[Cagan model|Cagan's model]], most notably "Barro (1970), Sargent and Wallace (1973), Frenkel (1975, 1976a, 1976b, 1977, 1979), Sargent (1977), Abel et al.

Because of the impact that this groundbreaking work had upon the economics profession, Cagan was elected Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] (the most prestigious society in the field),<ref name="Econometrica Fellows, 1975">{{cite journal | title=Election of Fellows, 1975 | journal=Econometrica | volume=44 | issue=2 | pages=415–419 | year=1976 | issn= 0012-9682 | jstor=1912742}}</ref> and was mentioned as a possible candidate for the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]].<ref name="Dave Tufte">{{cite web | last=Tufte | first=Dave | author-link=Dave Tufte | title=Nobel Prize Predictions | year=2002 | url=http://www.suu.edu/faculty/tufte/Nobel_Prize_Predictions.html | access-date=2007-08-16 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080739/http://www.suu.edu/faculty/tufte/Nobel_Prize_Predictions.html | archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> However, following his death in 2012, he is no longer eligible for a Nobel Prize.
