==Education and early career==
Raj Chetty was born in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] and lived there until the age of nine.<ref name=atlanticprofile>{{cite news | last1=Cook|first1=Gareth| date= 17 July 2019| work=[[The Atlantic]]| url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/raj-chettys-american-dream/592804/ | title= The Economist Who Would Fix the American Dream | access-date= 9 July 2020}}</ref> His family immigrated to the United States in 1988.<ref name=atlanticprofile /> Chetty graduated from [[University School of Milwaukee]] in 1997 and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] from [[Harvard University]] in 2000. He continued at Harvard to earn his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 2003<ref name="Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.macfound.org/fellows/861/|title=Raj Chetty — MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org}}</ref> with a thesis titled ''Consumption commitments, risk preferences, and optimal unemployment insurance''.<ref name="auto"/> As a sophomore in college, Chetty was told by his mentor [[Martin Feldstein]] to pursue his own ideas after proposing a counterintuitive idea that higher interest rates sometimes lead to higher investment.<ref name="Experimenter">{{Citation |last=Chesler |first=Caren |date=October 2007 |title=The Experimenter |magazine=The American |url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/september-october-magazine-contents/the-experimenter }}</ref>

In 2003, at the age of 23, Chetty became an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, becoming a tenured associate professor there at 27.<ref name="Experimenter" /> In 2009, Chetty returned to Harvard, where he was the Bloomberg Professor of Economics and the director of the Lab for Economic Applications and Policy.<ref name="Profile" /> In 2015, Chetty moved to Stanford, where he became a professor in the Economics Department.<ref name="Chetty's webpage" /> In June 2018, Raj Chetty's frequent coauthor [[John Friedman]] announced that Chetty will be returning to Harvard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/John_N_Friedman/status/1007794811112443904|title=John N.Friedman on Twitter}}</ref> In July of the same year, he became a Founding Director of Opportunity Insights with [[John Friedman]] and [[Nathaniel Hendren]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajchetty.com/chettyfiles/cv.pdf|title = Biographical Sketch: Raj Chetty}}</ref>

==Research==
In 2011 with John Friedman and [[Jonah Rockoff]], Chetty found that test-score based [[Value-added modeling|value-added measures]] are not substantially biased by unobserved student characteristics and that the students of high value-added teachers have markedly better outcomes later in life.<ref name="obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu"/> Drawing on these findings, Chetty testified in the landmark case ''[[Vergara v. California]]'' in support of the plaintiffs’ key points: that teacher quality has a direct impact on students’ achievements and that the current dismissal and seniority statutes have disparate impact on minority and low-income students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studentsmatter.org/evidence/#dr-raj-chettys-presentation-on-the-impact-of-teachers-on-student-learning-and-lifetime-success|title=Research Items Archive - Students Matter|website=Students Matter}}</ref>
