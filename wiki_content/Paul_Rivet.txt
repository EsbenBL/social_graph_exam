'''Paul Rivet''' (7 May 1876, [[Wasigny]], [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]] &ndash; 21 March 1958) was a [[French people|French]] [[ethnologist]]; he founded the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in 1937. In his professional work, Rivet is known for his theory that [[South America]] was originally populated in part by migrants who sailed there from [[Australia]] and [[Melanesia]]. He married Mercedes Andrade Chiriboga, a woman born in Cuenca, Ecuador.

==Early life and education==
Paul Rivet was born in [[Wasigny]], [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]] in 1876. He attended local schools and university, studying to be a physician.

==Career==
Trained as a physician, in 1901 he took part in the Second [[French Geodesic Mission]] for survey measurements of the length of a [[meridian arc]] to [[Ecuador]]. He remained for five years in South America, where he was mentored by [[Federico González Suárez]], an Ecuadorian bishop, historian and [[archaeologist]]. Rivet became interested in the [[indigenous peoples]], beginning an ethnographic study of the [[Huaorani people]] of the Ecuadorian Amazon, then known as the Jívaro. While in Ecuador he collected specimens of amphibians and reptiles.<ref name=EDR>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Rivet", p. 222).</ref> Returning to France, Rivet went to work with the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]], directed by [[René Verneau]].

He published several papers on his Ecuadorian research, before publishing an extended volume co-authored with René Verneau, titled ''Ancient Ethnography of Ecuador'' (1921-1922). In 1926, Rivet participated in founding the Institut d'ethnologie in [[Paris]], together with [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Emile Durkheim]], and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]]. They intended it as a collaboration among the fields of philosophy, ethnology and sociology. He taught many French ethnologists, including [[George Devereux]]. In 1928, he succeeded René Verneau as director of the National Museum of Natural History.

He continued to develop institutions for the study of mankind. In 1937 he founded the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris, which became renowned for its ethnographic research and collections. In 1942, Rivet went to [[Colombia]], where he founded the Anthropological Institute and Museum. Returning to Paris in 1945, he continued teaching while carrying on his research. His linguistic research introduced several new perspectives on the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language]]s of South America.

===Politics===
Rivet also became involved in politics, alarmed at the rise of [[Fascism]] in Europe during the 1930s. During the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], he was one of the founders of the ''[[Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes]]'', an antifascist organization created in the wake of massive riots in Paris.Rivet was a leader in the French Resistance to Nazi occupation. He narrowly escaped arrest and execution by the Nazis. Several of his colleagues, including Anatole Lewitsky and Boris Vilde were shot.

==Linguistic classification==
{{further|Classification of indigenous languages of the Americas}}
Rivet is well known for his classification of South American languages. He proposed 77 language families and about 1240 languages and dialects.<ref name="Rivet-1924">Rivet, Paul. 1924. Langues Américaines III: Langues de l’Amérique du Sud et des Antilles. In: Antoine Meillet and Marcel Cohen (ed.), ''Les Langues du Monde'', Volume 16, 639–712. Paris: Collection Linguistique.</ref> Much of his work on language classification was later incorporated by [[John Alden Mason]] and his former student [[Čestmír Loukotka]].<ref name="Campbell-SAmerica">{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |editor1-last=Grondona |editor1-first=Verónica |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Lyle |date=2012 |title=The Indigenous Languages of South America |chapter=Classification of the indigenous languages of South America |series=The World of Linguistics |volume=2 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=59–166 |isbn=978-3-11-025513-3}}</ref>

==Migration theory==
Rivet's theory asserts that [[Asia]] was the origin of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas]]. However, he also suggested that migrations to South America were made from [[Australia]] some 6,000 years before, and from [[Melanesia]] somewhat later. ''Les Origines de l'Homme Américain'' ("The Origins of the American Man") was published in 1943, and contains [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and anthropological arguments to support his thesis.

==Honors==
Rivet is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South American snake, ''[[Leptophis|Leptophis riveti]]''.<ref name=EDR/>
