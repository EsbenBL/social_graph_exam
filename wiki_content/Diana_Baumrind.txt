==Life==

Baumrind was born into a Jewish community in [[New York City]], the first of two daughters of Hyman and Mollie Blumberg. She completed her B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy at [[Hunter College]] in 1948, and her M.A. and Ph.D. in Psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="ParenthoodInAmerica"/>  Her doctoral dissertation was entitled "Some personality and situational determinants of behavior in a discussion group".<ref>{{Cite journal

After being awarded her doctorate she served as a staff psychologist at [[Cowell Memorial Hospital]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].  She was also director of two [[United States Public Health Service|U. S. Public Health Service]] projects and a consultant on a [[California]] state project.

Baumrind defined three parenting styles:

*'''Authoritarian''':  the authoritarian parenting style is characterized by high demandingness with low responsiveness.  The authoritarian parent is rigid, harsh, and demanding.  Abusive parents usually fall in this category (although Baumrind is careful to emphasize that ''not'' all authoritarian parents are abusive).
*'''Permissive''':  this parenting style is characterized by low demandingness with high responsiveness.  The permissive parent is overly responsive to the child's demands, seldom enforcing consistent rules. The "[[Spoiled child|spoiled]]" child often has permissive parents.
*'''Authoritative''':  this parenting style is characterized by high demandingness with huge responsiveness.  The authoritative parent is firm but not rigid, willing to make an exception when the situation warrants.  The authoritative parent is responsive to the child's needs but not indulgent.  Baumrind makes it clear that she favors the authoritative style.

Baumrind studied the effects of [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] on children, and concluded that mild spanking, in the context of an authoritative (''not'' authoritarian) parenting style, is unlikely to have a significant detrimental effect, if one is careful to control for other variables such as socioeconomic status.<ref>{{cite news |title= Findings Give Some Support To Advocates of Spanking |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/25/us/findings-give-some-support-to-advocates-of-spanking.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-08-25 |accessdate=2008-04-07 | first=Erica | last=Goode}}</ref>  She observed that previous studies demonstrating a correlation between corporal punishment and bad outcomes failed to control for variables such as socioeconomic status.  Low-income families are more likely to employ corporal punishment compared with affluent families.  Children from low-income neighborhoods are more likely to commit violent crimes compared with children from affluent neighborhoods.  But Baumrind believed that when appropriate controls are made for family income and other independent variables, mild corporal punishment per se does not increase the likelihood of bad outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baumrind D, Larzelere RE, Cowan PA |title=Ordinary physical punishment: is it harmful?
