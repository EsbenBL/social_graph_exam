'''As'ad AbuKhalil''' ({{lang-ar|أسعد أبو خليل}}) (born 16 March 1960) is a [[Lebanese American|Lebanese-American]] professor of [[political science]] at [[California State University, Stanislaus]].

AbuKhalil is the author of ''Historical Dictionary of Lebanon'' (1998), ''Bin Laden, Islam & America's New "War on Terrorism"'' (2002), and ''The Battle for Saudi Arabia'' (2004). 

==Biography==
AbuKhalil is a professor at California State University, Stanislaus, and was briefly a visiting professor at UC Berkeley.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090101181034/http://cmes.berkeley.edu/about/FacultyProfile.asp?ID=477 CMES Affiliated Faculty Profile. Middle Eastern Studies. As'ad Abu Khalil, Visiting Professor Fall 2007 and Spring 2008]. Berkeley University</ref><ref name=Abcarian>Robin Abcarian [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/07/entertainment/et-arab7 Between disparate worlds]. Los Angeles Times (2005-06-07). Retrieved on 2011-10-17.</ref>

==Political views==
AbuKhalil describes himself as "a former [[Marxist–Leninist]] who is now an [[anarchist]]".<ref name=Silverstein>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726141337/http://harpers.org/archive/2006/07/sb-a-statue-to-reason-1152745267 "A Statue to Reason"], Ken Silverstein, Harper's Magazine, 2006-07-13</ref>

He is an opponent of the [[Iraq War]]. He is sharply critical of [[United States]] foreign policy, and denounces the corruption of [[Fatah]] and the "vulgar anti-Jewish references” made by Hamas, but sees "Israeli terrorism" as a far greater problem in scale and magnitude.<ref name="Silverstein"/> He also criticises [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and all rival factions in Lebanon including the [[Shia]] [[Hezbollah]].{{cn|date=May 2021}}

===Israel/Palestine===
He opposes the state of Israel, stating that "Justice and freedom for the Palestinians are incompatible with the existence of the state of Israel".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/blogs/angry-corner/critique-norman-finkelstein-bds |title=A Critique of Norman Finkelstein on BDS|date=17 February 2012 |publisher=Al Akhbar |access-date=20 October 2012}}</ref> Some opponents to BDS, among them Prime Minister of Israel [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], have cited a part from AbuKhalil's article published in [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|''Al Akhbar'']] where he wrote: "Finkelstein rightly asks whether the real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel. Here, I agree with him that it is. That should be stated as an unambiguous goal. There should not be any equivocation on the subject" in their campaigns against the movement. In response, Abu Khalil wrote on his personal blog that it represented his personal position of what the goals of BDS ''should'' be, and that it was being purposefully distorted to stigmatize the movement.<ref name="bdsShould1">{{cite web |title=Roseanne and BDS and me|quote=PS And for the umpteenth time, I never said that the real aim of BDS is to tend the existence of Israel, I said that it should be that. I wish it is the case but it is not. BDS has not officially endorsed that aim of ending Zionism in Palestine|url=http://angryarab.blogspot.ca/2014/06/roseanne-and-bds-and-me.html}}</ref><ref name="bdsShould2">{{cite web |title=Netanyahu lies in citing something I said about BDS|quote=I added that: "the real aim of BDS SHOULD BE (I never said "is") to bring down the state of Israel". That statement was distorted to make me say that the real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel, which isn't true, and I wish if it were true.|url=http://angryarab.blogspot.ca/2015/06/netanyahu-lies-in-citing-something-i.html}}</ref><ref name="bdsShould3">{{cite web |title=Regarding the citation by Netanyahu of my characterization of the aims of BDS|quote=I am making it clear that it is about how BDS should be and not about how it is now. I meant that FOR ME, BDS is about ending the Zionist occupation of Palestine completely.|url=http://angryarab.blogspot.ca/2015/06/regarding-citation-by-netanyahu-of-my.html}}</ref>

He criticizes the influence of the [[Israel lobby in the United States]]. In a televised debate which aired on [[Al Jazeera]] on February 23, 2010 (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), AbuKhalil stated that US President [[Barack Obama]] "has given free rein to the Zionist lobby to do whatever it likes, both in terms of foreign policy and domestic policy." AbuKhalil also stated that "The Zionists want to muzzle us, so that we won't oppose the wars, violence, or hatred of Israel." In the same interview, Abukhalil sharply criticized MEMRI, stating that it is "a rude, propaganda-spreading organization ... which was established by a former Israeli intelligence official" (alluding to MEMRI founder, [[Yigal Carmon]]).<ref>[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2403.htm Lebanese-American Professor As'ad Abukhalil: Incitement on Saudi Media Ignored Due to Israeli Alliance with Saudi Arabia; Khairi Abaza, of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies: The Arabs Need an Arab MEMRI], MEMRITV, Clip No. 2403,  February 23, 2010.</ref>

===Lebanon===
In an interview on New TV on January 13, 2010, AbuKhalil stated that "Lebanese nationalism – just like Zionism – was founded on racism and contempt for others – whether for Lebanese of other sects or for other Arabs. ... The Lebanese people, with all its sects, has never proven that it wants, or is capable of, true coexistence. Coexistence in Lebanon is coexistence in blood, conflict, and civil strife."<ref>[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2381.htm American-Lebanese Professor As'ad Abukhalil: Just Like Zionism, Lebanese Nationalism Was Founded on Racism], MEMRITV, Clip No. 2381, January 13–17, 2010.</ref>

===News media===
In an interview which aired on [[Al Jazeera]] on October 25, 2011 (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), AbuKhalil accused the network of bias and accuses it of giving preferential treatment of "American Propaganda Officials."<ref>[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3180.htm California State University Political Scientist As'ad Abu Khalil Accuses Al-Jazeera TV of Bias and Conspiracies in Preferential Treatment of "American Propaganda Officials"], MEMRITV, Transcript, Clip No. 3180, October 25, 2011.</ref>

==The Angry Arab News Service==
[[File:As'ad AbuKhalil1.JPG|thumb|As'ad AbuKhalil addressing students in the [[University of Manchester]]]]
AbuKhalil's blog, the ''Angry Arab News Service'', was launched in September 2003. The name of the blog is taken from a phrase used by a TV producer to describe AbuKhalil's perspective.<ref name=Abcarian />

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the blog is "known for its sarcastic but knowledgeable commentary", and "stands out for its sense of humor in the dour left-wing landscape."<ref name=Abcarian /> [[Ken Silverstein]] writes that the blog often becomes "a furious stream of consciousness that lacks paragraph breaks or other typographic niceties" (though AbuKhalil is nevertheless "a terrific writer and an insightful political analyst").<ref name=Silverstein />

Commenting on his own coverage of the [[Syrian Civil War]], journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] said "I've often cited As'ad AbuKhalil as a great source on all matters Middle East and – without adopting all or even most of what he has said – he covers Syria almost every day and does it very well."<ref name=gg>{{cite news|title=Glenn Greenwald's second reader Q&A: the highlights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/22/glenn-greenwald-second-q-and-a|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 March 2013|quote=As for Syria, US involvement there has been relatively minimal. But it's a very complicated case and passions and emotions are very high, so it's the kind of issue I avoid unless and until I'm able to give it the attention it deserves and feel a reason to do so. I've often cited As'ad AbuKhalil as a great source on all matters Middle East and – without adopting all or even most of what he has said – he covers Syria almost every day and does it very well.}}</ref>
