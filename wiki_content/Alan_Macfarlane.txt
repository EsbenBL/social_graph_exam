{{Anthropology}}

'''Alan Donald James Macfarlane''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FRHistS}} (born 20 December 1941 in [[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]], [[India]]) is an anthropologist and historian, and a [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He is the author or editor of 20 books and numerous articles on the [[anthropology]] and history of England, [[Nepal]], Japan and China.<ref>[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/FILES/allbooks.html Authored and Edited Books] on Alan Macfarlane's personal website</ref> He has focused on comparative study of the origins and nature of the modern world. In recent years he has become increasingly interested in the use of visual material in teaching and research. He is a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] and the Royal Historical Society.

==Early life==
Macfarlane was born into a British family of tea planters in [[Assam]] in northeast [[India]].  He was born in Ganesh Das Hospital in the hill station of [[Shillong]], at the time the capital of undivided Assam state and now the capital of [[Meghalaya]].  His father "Mac" Macfarlane was also a reserve officer of the [[Assam Rifles]], besides being a tea planter, and his mother was the author [[Iris Macfarlane]].  The family lived in various tea estates in both [[Upper Assam]] and [[Lower Assam]], in the [[Brahmaputra]] valley.

==Career==
Macfarlane was educated at the [[Dragon School, Oxford]] and [[Sedbergh School]]. He then read Modern History at [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College, University of Oxford]], from 1960 to 1963, completing a Bachelor of Arts and went on to his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] and Doctor of Philosophy on [https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:1ffd2745-1cc7-4058-a781-5161cfd3866c ''Witchcraft prosecutions in Essex, 1560–1680: A Sociological Analysis''], in 1967. He also completed a [[Master of Philosophy]] in Anthropology on 'The regulation of marital and sexual relationships in 17th century England' at the London School of Economics in 1968 and a second Doctorate in Anthropology on 'Population and resources in central Nepal' in 1972 at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] of the [[University of London]].<ref>Snell, 1989</ref>

He went on to be a Research Fellow in History at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College, University of Cambridge]]. In 1975, he was appointed Lecturer in Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, becoming a Reader in Historical Anthropology in 1981 and then a full Professor of Anthropological Science and Personal Chair in 1991. He became [[Emeritus Professor]] of Anthropological Science at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a Life Fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]] in 2009. Professor Macfarlane received the Huxley Memorial Medal, the highest honour of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] in 2012.

===Anthropological interests===
Macfarlane's first major publication, in 1970, was ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England'', a historical study of the conditions that gave rise to English [[witchcraft]] beliefs. His approach drew on the work of classic [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] anthropologists [[Edward Evans-Pritchard]] and [[Lucy Mair]]. Also in 1970, Macfarlane published ''The Family Life of [[Ralph Josselin]]'', a study of the diary of a famous seventeenth century clergyman. His approach here, exploring the emotions, fears and relationships of an individual to attempt a historical study of private life in seventeenth century England, was reminiscent of the [[Annales School]].<ref>Snell, 1989</ref>

Macfarlane has undertaken several periods of ethnographic field research, the first of these a period in [[Nepal]] with the [[Gurung]] people. He used this period as the foundation of a 1976 study, ''Resources and Population'' a [[Malthusian]] analysis of Gurung responses to scarce resources and an expanding population. Following [[Malthus]]' demographic principles, Macfarlane warned that the Gurung might experience a 'population check' in coming decades.

===Historical interests===
Macfarlane has published extensively on English history, advancing the idea that many traits of so-called "modern society" appeared in England long before the period of modernity as defined by historians, such as [[Lawrence Stone]]. Drawing loosely on work by [[Max Weber]], Macfarlane has contrasted the defining characteristics of modern and traditional society. His 1987 book ''The Culture of Capitalism'' is a non-deterministic study of the emergence of modernity and capitalism in Western Europe.  Two further books, ''The Origins of English Individualism'' (1978) and ''Marriage and Love in England'' (1986), explore the way English family institutions and social life emerged distinctly from continental European institutions and experiences.<ref>Snell, 1989</ref>

During the 1990s, Macfarlane was invited to lecture in Japan, initiating a period of research into the distinctive emergence of modernity in Japan by contrast to England and Europe. 1997's ''The Savage Wars of Peace'' returned to Macfarlane's early interest in Malthus and demographics, comparing the modernity experiences of England and Japan. The book argues that England and Japan, both relatively large but non-remote islands, were each positioned to develop an autonomous culture while still profiting from nearby continental influence. Through different means, both Japan and England overcame the [[Malthusian trap]], keeping birth and mortality rates under control, thus providing a demographic impetus for the rise of capitalism and prosperity.<ref>Snell, 1989</ref> Macfarlane wrote an entire book dedicated to Japan published in 2007, ''Japan Through the Looking Glass''.<ref>The important Japanese demographer [[Akira Hayami]] celebrated the book: ''"Before reading your book, I had thought that the best understanding of Japan was to be found in the final pages on Japan in Fernand Braudel's 'Grammaire des Civilisations' (1987). But just twenty years later, unlike him, you came and lived in Japan several times. Although his name will be left on my list of the academic studies of Japan, I will certainly put your book first."''</ref>

==Literary works and collaborations==
Macfarlane's work on modernity acknowledges his [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] roots. His ''Riddle of the Modern World'' (2000) and ''Making of the Modern World'' (2001) are contributions to the field of history of ideas, addressing the work of [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Ernest Gellner]], [[Fukuzawa Yukichi|Yukichi Fukuzawa]] and [[Frederic William Maitland|Frederic Maitland]].<ref>White and Vann, 1983</ref>

Another strand in his work addresses the role of particular inventions in transforming history. ''The Glass [[Bathyscaphe]]: How Glass Changed the World'' (2002), co-authored with [[Gerry Martin]], discusses how the invention and use of glass facilitated European dominion overseas. Macfarlane and his mother Iris co-wrote ''Green Gold: The Empire of Tea'' (2003), presenting the thesis that tea contributed to English prosperity, preventing epidemics by requiring the boiling of water and by promoting antibiotic effects.

2005's ''Letters to Lily'' distils Macfarlane's reflections on a life of research, as addressed to his granddaughter Lily Bee. As a non-academic work it brought Macfarlane to the attention of a wider, non-scholarly audience.

Macfarlane’s work has been widely read and cited by his contemporaries.<ref>Snell, 1989</ref>
Critics have challenged the role he ascribes to English institutions in the establishment of modernity, and his moral [[relativism]] as a champion of modernity who nonetheless affirms the validity of non-Western institutions.<ref>White and Vann, 1983</ref>

Together with [[Mark Turin]], Macfarlane established the [[Digital Himalaya]] Project in December 2000 and now serves as Chairman of the Executive Board of the [[World Oral Literature Project]]. He is also a co-editor of [[The Fortnightly Review]]'s "new series" online.
