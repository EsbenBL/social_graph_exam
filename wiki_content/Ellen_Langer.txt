=== Aging ===
[[File:Ellen Langer PopTech 2013.jpg|thumb|Langer at PopTech 2013]]
Langer and colleagues have conducted multiple forms of research to promote the flexibility of aging.<ref name=Boston /> Some of her most impactful work has been her pioneering research on her famous Counterclockwise Study (1979). This study was originally published by Oxford University Press<ref name="Human Development">{{cite book |last1=Alexander (Ed.) |first1=Charles |last2=Langer (Ed.) |first2=Ellen |title=Higher stages of human development: Perspectives on adult growth. |date=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0195034837 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-98072-000 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> and later described in her best seller, ''Mindfulness''.<ref name="Mindfulness">{{cite book |last1=Langer |first1=Ellen |title=Mindfulness |date=1989 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-7382-1800-7}}</ref> It is the basis of what is now called [[Reminiscence therapy|Reminiscence Therapy]]. The study was replicated in England, South Korea and the Netherlands<ref name="Mind-set Times"/> and was the basis of a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy of Film and Television Awards]] nominated [[BBC]] series, [https://www.walltowall.co.uk/news/the-young-ones-nominated-for-bafta-in-factual-series-category_363.aspx The Young Ones]. The study has also been mentioned in other media such as [[The Simpsons]] episode [[Havana Wild Weekend]].

Other important work has shown that rewarding behaviors and following completion of memory tasks improves memory. Another study showed that simply taking care of a plant improves mental and physical health, as well as life expectancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rodin|first1=Judith|last2=Langer|first2=Ellen J.|title=Long-term effects of a control-relevant intervention with the institutionalized aged.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1977|volume=35|issue=12|pages=897–902|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.12.897|pmid=592095}}</ref> These studies were the primitive steps to creating the Langer Mindfulness Scale.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pirson |first1=Michael |last2=Langer |first2=Ellen |last3=Bodner |first3=Todd |last4=Zilcha-Mano |first4=Sigal |title=The Development and Validation of the Langer Mindfulness Scale - Enabling a Socio-Cognitive Perspective of Mindfulness in Organizational Contexts |journal=Fordham University Schools of Business Research Paper |date=October 9, 2012 |pages=54 |ssrn=2158921 }}</ref> Her research provided for improved methods in [[nursing home]]s and [[Assisted living facility|assisted living facilities]]. Additionally, in one of her most famous studies, Langer demonstrated the drastic benefits of mind/body unity theory. By having chambermaids call their everyday activity “exercise” rather than “labor,” Langer found that the chambermaids experienced a myriad of health benefits including: "a decrease in their systolic blood pressure, weight, and waist-to-hip ratio — and a 10 percent drop in blood pressure."<ref name="NPR Chambermaids">{{cite web |last1=Spiegel |first1=Alix |title=Hotel Maids Challenge the Placebo Effect |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17792517 |website=NPR}}</ref><ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett">{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/ellen-langer-science-of-mindlessness-and-mindfulness/6332| title= Ellen Langer - Science of Mindlessness and Mindfulness | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| accessdate= September 11, 2015}}</ref>

===Mindfulness===
Langer is well known for her contributions to the study of mindfulness and of mindless behaviour, with these contributions having provided the basis for many studies focused on individual differences in unconscious behavior and decision making processes in humans.<ref name=Harvard>{{cite web|last1=Scholar|first1=Harvard|title=Ellen Langer, Research|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/langer/pages/research|website=scholar.harvard.edu|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=4}}</ref> In 1989, she published ''Mindfulness'', her first book, and some have referred to her as the "mother of mindfulness".<ref name=PsychCentral/><ref name=Langer.com />  In an interview with Krista Tippett on the National Public Radio program "On Being," broadcast on Sept. 13, 2015, Langer defined mindfulness as "the simple act of noticing new things."<ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett"/>
The Langer Mindfulness Scale is still used in modern research.

== Awards ==
In 1980, she was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].<ref name=Langer.com>{{cite web|last1=Langer|first1=Ellen|title= Ellen Langer Bio |url=http://ellenlanger.com/about|website=ellenlanger.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|ref=2}}</ref><ref>https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/#gf-search-submit-btn</ref> Other honors include the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest of the [[American Psychological Association]], [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/ellen-langer-joins-group-of-geniuses/ the Liberty Science Center Genius Award], the Distinguished Contributions of Basic Science to Applied Psychology award from the [[American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology]], the James McKeen Cattel Award, and the Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize.

== Criticism ==
Her finding that taking care of a plant significantly improved health outcomes in nursing home patients was shown to be the result of a statistical error.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rodin, J., & Langer, E. J. (1978). Erratum to Rodin and Langer. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36(5), 462.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-09641-001}}</ref> In one of her famous "counterclockwise" studies, Langer claimed that when elderly men were temporarily placed in a setting that recreated their past, their health improved, and they even looked younger. However, this study was never published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The only publication of this finding is in a chapter of a book edited by Langer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ellen Langer's reversing aging experiment - Business Insider|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/ellen-langers-reversing-aging-experiment-2015-4}}</ref>

In a 2014 New York Times Magazine profile, Langer described the week-long paid adult counterclockwise retreats she was creating in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, aimed towards replicating the effects found in her New Hampshire study. According to the article, "Langer makes no apologies for the paid retreats, nor for what will be their steep price."<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|title=What if Age Is Nothing but a Mind-Set?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html?_r=0}}</ref> Langer was defiant when pressed on the ethics of her study:

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>"To my question of whether such a nakedly commercial venture will undermine her academic credibility, Langer rolled her eyes a bit. 'Look, I’m not 40 years old. I’ve paid my dues, and there’s nothing wrong with making this more widely available to people, since I deeply believe it.'"<ref name="nytimes.com"/></p>
