==Systematic treatment selection==

[[Systematic treatment selection]] (STS) is an empirically derived approach to the practice of psychotherapy.  It revolves around the use of an [[expert system]] to guide the clinician's thinking about how best to approach a particular case.  The STS model has been demonstrated to improve treatment outcomes significantly compared to treatment as usual.<ref name="r1">{{cite book | title= Prescriptive Psychotherapy | url= https://archive.org/details/prescriptivepsyc0000beut | url-access= registration | first=Larry | last=Beutler| year=2004| publisher=Oxford University | location=London | isbn=0195136691 }}</ref>
