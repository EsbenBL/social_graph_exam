'''Li Keqiang''' ({{zh|c=李克强|p=Lǐ Kèqiáng}}; born 1 July 1955) is a Chinese politician. He became [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] on 15 March 2013.

An [[economist]] by profession, Li is China's [[head of government]] as well as one of the leading figures behind China's [[Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission|Financial and Economic Affairs]], [[Central Foreign Affairs Commission|Foreign Affairs]], [[National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party|National Security]] and [[Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission|Deepening Reforms]]. He is also the second-ranked member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]], the ''de facto'' top decision-making body of the country. Li is a major part of the "[[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of Chinese leadership]]" along with [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]. Li was named the world's 12th most powerful person by ''[[Forbes]]'' in their [[Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People|list of the world's most powerful people]] in 2015 and 2016.

Li rose through the ranks through his involvement in the [[Communist Youth League]]. From 1998 to 2004, Li served as the [[Governor of Henan]] and the province's [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]]. From 2004 to 2007 he served as the Party Secretary of [[Politics of Liaoning|Liaoning]], the top political office in the province. From 2008 to 2013, Li served as the first-ranked [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice-Premier]]{{NoteTag|Li's title has been variously translated as "Executive Vice Premier" or "First Vice-Premier", though the practice of making explicit reference to the Vice Premier's rank has gradually been phased out since [[Deng Xiaoping]] last assumed the title of "First Vice Premier" during the Cultural Revolution. In state media, Li has almost always been referred to as simply the "Vice Premier".}} under then-Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], overseeing a broad portfolio which included economic development, [[price controls]], finance, [[climate change]], and macroeconomic management.<ref name="China.org.cn">{{cite web |title = China's new top Party leaders make debut |url = http://www.china.org.cn/china/18th_cpc_congress/2012-11/15/content_27120449.htm |website = China.org.cn |date = 15 November 2012 |access-date = 22 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121117235826/http://www.china.org.cn/china/18th_cpc_congress/2012-11/15/content_27120449.htm |archive-date = 17 November 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Given his Youth League experience, Li has generally been considered a political ally of former leader [[Hu Jintao]]. Li assumed the post of Premier in 2013, and has facilitated the Chinese government's shifting of priorities from export-led growth to a greater focus on internal consumption. Li has also been a major force behind the implementation of the "comprehensively deepening reforms" announced in the fall of 2013. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Made in China 2025]] is a strategic plan issued by Li and his [[Li Keqiang Government|cabinet]] in May 2015.<ref>[https://gbtimes.com/made-china-2025-plan-unveiled-boost-manufacturing "Made in China 2025" plan unveiled to boost manufacturing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725113438/https://gbtimes.com/made-china-2025-plan-unveiled-boost-manufacturing |date=25 July 2018 }} China News Service, May 2015</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Li Keqiang was born on 1 July 1955 in [[Hefei]], [[Anhui]] province. His father was a local official in Anhui.

Li graduated from Hefei No.8 Senior High School in 1974, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and was sent for rural labour in [[Fengyang County]], Anhui, where he eventually joined the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and made his way in becoming the party head of the [[Production team (China)|local production team]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} He was awarded the honour of ''Outstanding Individual in the Study of Mao Zedong Thought'' during this time.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dwnews.com/gb/MainNews/Forums/BackStage/2008_11_28_10_59_18_787.html |script-title = zh:《多维月刊》：李克强出身非平民，成长靠恩师（2） |language=zh |website = Dwnews.com |date=2008-11-28 |access-date=2013-03-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201084924/http://www.dwnews.com/gb/MainNews/Forums/BackStage/2008_11_28_10_59_18_787.html |archive-date=1 December 2008}}</ref>
Li refused his father's offer of grooming him for the local county's party leadership and entered the School of Law at [[Peking University]], where he received his [[LLB]]<ref name=rfe>{{cite news|title=Profile: Chinese First Vice Prime Minister Li Keqiang|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/china-profile-li-keqiang/24764285.html|access-date=26 August 2013|newspaper=Radio Free Europe|date=7 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201301/http://www.rferl.org/content/china-profile-li-keqiang/24764285.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and became the president of the university's student council. He earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in economics in 1995, and the prominent economist [[Li Yining]] (no relation) was his doctoral advisor. His doctoral dissertation was awarded the [[Sun Yefang]] Prize, China's highest prize in economics.<ref name="sohu">{{cite web |url=http://business.sohu.com/s2013/jrzj74/ |script-title=zh:总理恩师厉以宁 |trans-title=Li Yining: teacher of the premier |publisher=Sohu |language=zh-cn |access-date=2015-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221012303/http://business.sohu.com/s2013/jrzj74/ |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1982, Li became the [[Communist Youth League]] secretary at Peking University.<ref>{{cite book | author = Xiaobing Li | year = 2015 | title = Modern China | publisher = ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, California.|isbn=978-1610696258|page=104}}</ref> He entered the top leadership of the national organization of the Communist Youth League (CYL) in 1983 as a member of its secretariat, and has worked closely with former Party General Secretary [[Hu Jintao]], who also rose through the ranks of the CYL, ever since. Li became the organization's [[Secretary (title)|First Secretary]] in 1993 and served until 1998. He is a representative member of the first generation to have risen from the CYL leadership.

== Rising through the ranks (1998–2012) ==
=== Provincial tenures ===
Li became the youngest Chinese provincial governor in June 1998 when he was appointed governor of [[Henan Province|Henan]] at the age of 43. According to provincial officials working with him at the time, Li refused to participate in any banquets or large fancy events not related to government activities.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www3.chinesenewsnet.com/gb/MainNews/Forums/BackStage/2007_6_10_0_11_42_172.html |title = Duowei: Li Keqiang helps Henan fight off the poverty |language = zh |work = Chinese Newsnet |date = 10 June 2007 |access-date = 18 March 2013 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130102053722/http://www3.chinesenewsnet.com/gb/MainNews/Forums/BackStage/2007_6_10_0_11_42_172.html |archive-date = 2 January 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref> During his time as governor, a public sense of his "bad luck" grew due to the occurrence of three major fires in the province.<ref name=the-diplomat.com>{{cite web |url = http://apac2020.the-diplomat.com/power-players/li-keqiang/ |archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100826124714/http://apac2020.the-diplomat.com/power-players/li-keqiang/ |url-status = dead |archive-date = 26 August 2010 |title = Power Players: Li Keqiang |work=The Diplomat |date=28 September 2012 |access-date = 18 March 2013 }}</ref>

Li is known to be outspoken and led [[economic development]] in Henan, transforming the poor inland region into an attractive area for investment. Li did not spend time pursuing superficial projects. He trekked through all regions of the province trying to search for a comprehensive solution to its growing problems. Henan jumped in national GDP rankings from 28th in the early 1990s to 18th in 2004, when Li left Henan. However, his government was relatively ineffective at curbing the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic that was affecting the rural areas of the province.

Li was transferred to work as the Party Secretary in [[Liaoning]] in December 2004, taking on the top political office of the province. There he is known for the "Five-points to one Line" project, where he linked up [[Dalian]] and [[Dandong]], as well as a series of other [[Ports of China|ports]] into a comprehensive network to improve trade flow.

With his Youth League experience and his association with then paramount leader [[Hu Jintao]], Li was seen from early on in Hu's term as a contender to succeed Hu when his term as party leader ends in 2012. Li gained membership to the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] at [[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|17th Party Congress]] held in October 2007. He was succeeded in his provincial party secretary post by Governor [[Zhang Wenyue]]. While Li's political future seemed promising, he was outranked on the Standing Committee by [[Xi Jinping]], who had just left his role as party secretary of Shanghai to join the central leadership ranks in Beijing. This rank order ostensibly signaled that it would be Xi, not Li, who would eventually succeed Hu as party General Secretary and President. At the [[2008 National People's Congress]], Li was elected Vice-Premier, first in rank, reinforcing the speculation that Li would become Premier and was being groomed to succeed then-Premier [[Wen Jiabao]].<ref name="the-diplomat.com" />

During his first term in the PSC between 2007 and 2012, Li took on the most important portfolios in the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], including economic development, government budgets, land and resources, the environment, and health, ostensibly to prepare him for his upcoming premiership. He also became the head of central commissions overseeing the [[Three Gorges Dam]] and the [[South-North Water Transfer Project]], as well as the leader of steering committees in charge of health care reform, food safety, and AIDS-related work. In addition, Li was the principal lieutenant to Premier Wen Jiabao in the broad portfolios of climate change, energy, information technology, northeastern China revitalization, and developing the Chinese far west.

Li's first major appearance internationally was at the 2010 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos, Switzerland]]. The event was seen as a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for Li. At the forum, Li succinctly presented China's long-term vision for development in front of world business and political leaders.<ref name="forbes">{{cite news |last=Maidment |first=Paul |title=China's Li Delivers A Polished Future |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/davos/2010/01/28/chinas-li-delivers-a-polished-future/ |work=Forbes |date=28 January 2010 |access-date=3 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105058/http://blogs.forbes.com/davos/2010/01/28/chinas-li-delivers-a-polished-future/ |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> In particular, Li briefed the WEF on China's commitment to [[sustainable development]], [[green energy]], [[income inequality|decreasing the income gap]] and [[industrial development|modernizing key strategic industries]].<ref name="forbes"/> While reiterating Beijing's commitment to peaceful development and its focus in increasing domestic demand in the face of external pressures during the [[global financial crisis]], Li also warned against [[protectionism]], saying "opening up can be both bilateral and multilateral... in this sense, one plus one is more often than not bigger than two." He also touched upon the importance of [[international development]], and [[Global financial system|international financial reform]]. He called for a global governance structure that was "more reflective of the changes in the global political and economic landscape."<ref name="davos">{{cite web|last=Li|first=Keqiang|title=Davos Annual Meeting 2010 – Special Address by Li Keqiang|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybzXrKw6rPk|publisher=World Economic Forum|access-date=4 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917022828/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybzXrKw6rPk|archive-date=17 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2010, Li gave a speech to ministerial and provincial-level leaders about the importance of changing the economic structure of the country in order to be better poised for future growth. The speech was published with minor omissions in the 1 June issue of ''[[Qiushi]]'', the Communist Party's political theory publication. Li said that China had come to a critical historical inflection point where a fundamental shift in the structure of the economy must take place in order for the country to continue its path of growth. Li particularly emphasized the need to boost domestic [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], and emphasized the importance of continued urbanization.<ref name="qiushi">{{cite web |last=Li |first=Keqiang |trans-title=Questions Concerning Changes to China's Economic Structure |script-title=zh:关于调整经济结构促进持续发展的几个问题 |url=http://www.qstheory.cn/zxdk/2010/201011/201005/t20100527_31316.htm |publisher=Qiushi |access-date=1 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604004342/http://www.qstheory.cn/zxdk/2010/201011/201005/t20100527_31316.htm |archive-date=4 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Li also emphasized that China should be moving towards a more middle class-oriented society with an "olive"-shaped [[wealth distribution]], with the majority of the country's population and wealth belonging to the middle class.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

He has also reiterated the importance of industrialization, urbanization and [[agriculture in China|agricultural]] modernization in China in order to improve its [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], [[food security]], [[energy security]], [[affordable housing]], and [[Health in China|healthcare]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Xinhua News Agency|title=China's vice premier urges accelerating industrialization, urbanization|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/11/c_13550478.htm|publisher=Xinhuanet|access-date=22 October 2010|date=11 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014210404/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/11/c_13550478.htm|archive-date=14 October 2010}}</ref>

In August 2011, Li went on an official visit to Hong Kong, including a trip to the [[University of Hong Kong]].  The political sensitivities and heightened security surrounding the event resulted in the [[Hong Kong 818 incident]], an event that caused controversy in the territory.

At the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th Party Congress]] held in the fall of 2012, Li was elevated to the number two spot on the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC) and thereby became one of the top leaders of China. As he was expected to become Premier, this was a shift from previous convention on the PSC set in 1997 whereby the Premier ranked third, after the [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], who ranked second. This change showed that the party intended to project Li as the number two figure in the Chinese political hierarchy, behind only party General Secretary Xi Jinping. Also in that same year, he had personally met with the openly gay Ma Baoli (a policeman turned businessman) to discuss the threat posed by [[HIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2015/05/24/this-chinese-policeman-builds-the-worlds-top-gay-dating-app-now-he-wants-more-international-users/|title=This Chinese Policeman Built The World's Top Gay Dating App, Now He Wants More International Users|first=Yue|last=Wang|website=Forbes.com|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015233251/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2015/05/24/this-chinese-policeman-builds-the-worlds-top-gay-dating-app-now-he-wants-more-international-users/|archive-date=15 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In the same conversation, they discussed [[LGBT]] issues on preventing discrimination which has been interpreted as a sign that the People's Republic is slowly coming around to the idea as major Chinese businesses have already begun tapping into the [[purchasing power]] of the LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-businesses-eye-purchasing-power-of-lgbt-community-2015-03-19|title=Chinese businesses eye purchasing power of LGBT community|first=Nick|last=Horton|website=Marketwatch.com|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016081358/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-businesses-eye-purchasing-power-of-lgbt-community-2015-03-19|archive-date=16 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
[[File:Li Keqiang, Chinese and foreign press conference.jpg|thumb|March 2015, Li attends the Chinese and foreign press conference.]]

Li has an academic background in economics and is therefore a firm believer in the use of robust economic data to aid in government decision making. He is known to study economic statistics and routinely questions the reliability of the data he works with. Li has been described by international media as the pioneer behind the so-called "[[Keqiang index]]",<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/node/17681868|title = Keqiang ker-ching: How China's next prime minister keeps tabs on its economy|date = 9 December 2010|work = The Economist|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150104222826/http://www.economist.com/node/17681868|archive-date = 4 January 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> an unconventional economic measurement indicator devised by Li that was said to bypass the often unreliable official GDP numbers and thus serves as a better indicator of economic health and a more useful barometer for decision-making. Instead of gathering data on total economic output alone, Li used three other indicators to keep tabs on the economy while working in Liaoning province. These were, the railway cargo volume, electricity consumption and total loans disbursed by banks.

When Li initially entered office, China was facing numerous structural problems inherited from the previous administration. Namely, the large abundance of non-performing loans, that many of the giant infrastructure projects the country embarked on since the global financial crisis was overloaded with crushing debt and lower than expected revenues, and the increasingly large wealth gap. Under these circumstances, Li was said to have responded with what became known as "Likonomics", a term coined by economists at the investment bank [[Barclays Capital]]. Likonomics consisted of a three-prong approach that included the across-the-board reduction of debt, an end to massive stimulus practices of the Wen Jiabao government, and structural reforms.<ref name=econ2>{{cite news|title=Likonomics: what's not to like|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/07/stimulus-v-reform-china|work=The Economist|date=1 July 2013|access-date=13 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502005439/http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/07/stimulus-v-reform-china|archive-date=2 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> However, by 2014, global economic pressures and a decrease in demand of Chinese exports led to lower than expected economic growth rates. Year-on-year GDP growth amounted to less than 7.5% for the first time since 1989. Li's government then responded with tax cuts for small businesses, renovation projects of poor urban areas, and another round of rail construction, particularly focused on the country's interior.<ref name="gorge">{{cite news |last1=Chen |first1=George |title=Forget 'Likonomics', it's all about economic stimulus in China again |url=http://www.scmp.com/business/economy/article/1466473/forget-likonomics-its-all-about-economic-stimulus-china-again |work=South China Morning Post |date=7 April 2014 |access-date=23 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222001026/http://www.scmp.com/business/economy/article/1466473/forget-likonomics-its-all-about-economic-stimulus-china-again |archive-date=22 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the announcement of comprehensive reforms at the Third Plenum in 2013, Li became a leading figure of the government's reform implementation efforts. The Third Plenum called for market forces to play a "decisive" role in the allocation of resources, ostensibly looking to decrease government regulation on the free market. In early 2014, Li said that local governments were still ineffective at following the central government's reform directives, and that some governments meddle in affairs they shouldn't be involved in, and some don't pay attention to things they should be doing. Li emphasized that the success of reforms came down to "execution and implementation," and criticized local governments for failing to act in support of reforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://china.dwnews.com/news/2014-07-21/59492203.html|script-title =zh:学者称李克强style为专家治国|date =21 July 2014|publisher =Duowei News|language=zh |trans-title =Scholars say Li Keqiang style is an expert |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150123223814/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2014-07-21/59492203.html|archive-date =23 January 2015|url-status =dead}}</ref>

=== Foreign affairs ===
Li Keqiang made his first foreign visit to India on 18 May 2013 in a bid to resolve [[China-India relations|border disputes]] and to stimulate economic relations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/201351972251986773.html |title=Chinese premier visits India |work=Al Jazeera English |date=19 May 2013 |access-date=26 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314021927/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/201351972251986773.html |archive-date=14 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> He said the choice of India as the first international visit highlights Chinese importance in its relations with the country.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/20135192381468513.html |title = Chinese PM vows to build trust with India |work = Al Jazeera English |date = 19 May 2013 |access-date = 26 August 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809130107/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/20135192381468513.html |archive-date = 9 August 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China in 2015, Li and Modi took a [[selfie]] together at the [[Temple of Heaven]].

Li Keqiang also visited [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]] on his first Europe trip, and met with the two countries' leaders.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013livisit/ Li visits four countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525153732/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013livisit/ |date=25 May 2013 }} ''China Daily''</ref>

United States lieutenant general [[H. R. McMaster]] wrote of Li Keqiang that, "If anyone in the American group had any doubts about China's view of its relationship with the United States, Li's monologue would have removed them. He began with the observation that China, having already developed its [[industry 4.0|industrial]] and technological base, no longer needed the United States."<ref>{{cite web |last1=McMaster |first1=Herbert Raymond |title=How China Sees the World |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/mcmaster-china-strategy/609088/ |website=The Atlantic |date=17 April 2020 |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Reduction of bureaucracy ===
Li is especially critical of unnecessary government bureaucracy, particularly at the grassroots level. He believes that many lower-level officials fail to provide services to the public in an effective manner. Regarding his disdain for the matter, Li's many quotable anecdotes have become viral. Li referred to a case in which a citizen filling out a form to travel overseas (normal in the PRC) had to write down an emergency contact (the citizen put down their mother as the contact), and the government official overseeing the matter asked the citizen to provide a notarized document to "prove your mom is your mom."<ref name="mom">{{cite news |script-title=zh:李克强：证明"你妈是你妈"是天大笑话 |url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-05-06/59651826.html |work=Duowei News |date=6 May 2015 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518104519/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-05-06/59651826.html |archive-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Li called this incident "absolutely preposterous." In another case, he referred to a grassroots civil servant who asked for proof that a one-year old does not have a criminal record in order to deliver a government service.<ref name="cnews">{{cite news|script-title=zh:李克强屡斥"奇葩"证明 简政放权再推进|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2015/05-13/7274063.shtml|work=Chinanews|date=12 May 2015|title=Archived copy|access-date=14 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093111/http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2015/05-13/7274063.shtml|archive-date=18 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In yet another case, Li referred to a senior citizen applying for welfare benefits being forced by government employees to provide proof that "they are still alive." Regarding the latter two incidents, Li said, "this is not a joke, it's all real!"<ref name=cnews/>

=== Manufacturing and technological innovation ===
Li Keqiang, a vocal proponent of bolstering technological innovation, lamented how China was producing 800 million tons of steel annually but still importing the specialized type of stainless steel needed to make the better tip cases. The Chinese premier's comments caused consternation in China's pen industry – which was not used to being the topic of mainstream political conversation. These pen companies were once happy to manufacture shoddy pens that were sometimes exported abroad as cheap knockoffs of better brands. Now, they were being told that they were expected to do something more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38566114|title=Why the ballpoint pen has eluded China|first=Simon|last=Atkinson|date=15 October 2018|access-date=15 October 2018|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124183012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38566114|archive-date=24 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

He reiterated this point frequently during public appearances, adding that pens using domestically produced parts felt inferior to foreign ones. The ballpoint pen became a potent symbol for perceived flaws in China's economy and technological capabilities. "That's the real situation facing us", Li said at a meeting with economists in December 2015. "We cannot make ballpoint pens with a smooth writing function". In 2016 Premier Li Keqiang went on national television and bemoaned the failure of his country to produce a good quality version of this seemingly-simple implement. Locally-made versions felt "rough" compared to those from Germany, Switzerland and Japan, Mr Li complained.

On one level, whether China can make a great pen is not hugely important in the scheme of things. High-tech and innovative manufacturing lie at the heart of the central government's Made in China 2025 programme – designed to help domestic growth. Relatively low-value items, like ballpoint pens, have not been a priority. But the pen-conundrum was a symbolic one. About much more than pens, his goal is to encourage independence and innovation. The pen tip issue was first brought into the spotlight by Li Keqiang, offering an insight into a major issue confronting Chinese manufacturers – weak competitiveness in core technology. State-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co plans to mass-produce ballpoint pen tips and replace imports in two years, company officials said in 2017.<ref>State-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co plans to mass-produce these ballpoint pen tips and replace imports in two years, company officials said on Tuesday.</ref>

===Xi–Li Administration===
{{main|Xi–Li Administration}}

[[File:Xi jinping and Li keqiang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Xi Jinping (left) and Li Keqiang (right)]]

At the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee held in the fall of 2013, the Communist Party announced far reaching economic and social reforms. However, the document outlining the reforms was drafted under the leadership of Xi, [[Liu Yunshan]] and [[Zhang Gaoli]], and Li was ostensibly not involved in preparing the document. This departure from convention (Wen Jiabao was the principal drafter of documents behind the reforms announced at the Third Plenum of 2003) led to speculation that Li was becoming marginalized in the new administration, and that the widely touted "[[Xi-Li Administration]]" in fact did not exist, as power was increasingly being centralized under the hands of Xi as the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url =http://china.dwnews.com/news/2013-11-17/59347995.html|script-title =zh: 习刘张起草三中 李克强未参与引争议|date =17 November 2013|work =Duowei News|language=zh |trans-title =Xi Liu Zhang drafted three middle schools Li Keqiang did not participate in the dispute|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150123222658/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2013-11-17/59347995.html |archive-date =23 January 2015|url-status =dead}}</ref>

Following the Third Plenum of 2013, Xi amassed a series of leadership roles on four new powerful supra-ministerial bodies overseeing "[[Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms|comprehensively deepening reforms]]", [[Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization|the internet]], [[Central Leading Group for Military Reform|military reform]], and also the [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]]. The "deepening reforms" leading group was said to be encroaching on the affairs in the economic realm normally handled by the Premier, and was seen as having the effect of reducing Li's institutional power. However, Li appeared in official press releases as Xi's foremost lieutenant, being named Vice Chairman of the National Security Commission,<ref>{{cite web|title=Xi Jinping to lead national security commission|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-01/24/content_17257409.htm|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=24 January 2014|access-date=31 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203015626/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-01/24/content_17257409.htm|archive-date=3 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> in addition to becoming the deputy leader of leading groups on "deepening reforms", internet security, and [[Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs|the economy and finance]].

On 18 March 2018, Li was reappointed Premier of China after receiving 2,964 votes in favour and just two against by the [[National People’s Congress|National People's Congress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2137707/li-keqiang-endorsed-chinas-premier-while-military-commission |title=Li Keqiang endorsed as China's premier; military leaders confirmed |website=Scmp.com |access-date=15 October 2018 |date=2018-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827155325/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2137707/li-keqiang-endorsed-chinas-premier-while-military-commission |archive-date=27 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
