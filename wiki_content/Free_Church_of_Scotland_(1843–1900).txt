The '''Free Church of Scotland''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] which was formed in 1843 by a large withdrawal from the established [[Church of Scotland]] in a [[schism]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Durham|first1=James|last2=Blair|first2=Robert (preface)|title=The dying man's testament to the Church of Scotland, or, A treatise concerning scandal|date=1659|publisher=Printed for the Company of Stationers|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/dymanste00durh#page/n303/mode/1up|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> or division<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macpherson|first1=John|last2=McCrie|first2=C.

While the denomination clearly had a starting date, in their own eyes their leaders had a legitimate claim to an unbroken succession of leaders going all the way back to the [[Apostles]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=James|title=The theology and theologians of Scotland : chiefly of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|date=1888|publisher=T. & T.

The minority of the Free Church of Scotland who continued outside the union of 1900, retained the title the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

It was larger than the previous historical secessions [[First Secession|of 1733]] [[Relief Church|or 1761]]. The evangelical element had been demanding the purification of the Church, and it attacked the [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711|patronage system]], which allowed rich landowners to select the local ministers. It became a political battle between evangelicals on one side and the "Moderates" and gentry on the other. The evangelicals secured passage by the church's General Assembly in 1834, of the "Veto Act", asserting that, as a fundamental law of the Church, no pastor should be forced by the gentry upon a congregation contrary to the popular will, and that any nominee could be rejected by majority of the heads of families. This direct blow at the right of private patrons was challenged in the civil courts, and was decided (1838) against the evangelicals. In 1843, 450 evangelical ministers (out of 1,200 ministers in all) broke away, and formed the Free Church of Scotland.

Led by Dr. Thomas Chalmers (1780–1847), a third of the membership walked out, including nearly all the Gaelic-speakers and the missionaries, and most of the Highlanders. The established Church kept all the properties, buildings and endowments. The seceders created a voluntary fund of over £400,000 to build 700 new churches; 400 [[manse]]s (residences for the ministers) were erected at a cost of £250,000; and an equal or larger amount was expended on the building of 500 parochial schools, as well as a [[Edinburgh Theological Seminary|college]] in Edinburgh. After the passing of the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1872|Education Act of 1872]], most of these schools were voluntarily transferred to the newly established public school-boards.<ref>Stewart J. Brown, ''Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland'' (1982)</ref><ref>T. M. Devine, ''The Scottish Nation'' (1999) ch 16</ref>

Chalmers' ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation. That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.<ref>S. Mechie, ''The church and Scottish social development, 1780–1870'' (1960)</ref>

The first task of the new church was to provide income for her initial 500 ministers and places of worship for her people. As she aspired to be the national church of the Scottish people, she set herself the ambitious task of establishing a presence in every parish in Scotland (except in the Highlands, where FC ministers were initially in short supply.) Sometimes land owners were less than helpful such as at [[Strontian]], where the church took to a boat.

The building programme produced 470 new churches within a year and over 700 by 1847. [[Manse]]s and over 700 schools soon followed. This programme was made possible by extraordinary financial generosity, which came from the [[Evangelism|Evangelical]] awakening and the wealth of the emerging middle class.

The church created a Sustentation Fund, the brainchild of [[Thomas Chalmers]], to which congregations contributed according to their means, and from which all ministers received an 'equal dividend'. This fund provided a modest income for 583 ministers in 1843/4, and by 1900 was able to provide an income for nearly 1200. This centralising and sharing of resources was previously unknown within the Protestant churches in Scotland, but later became the norm.

==="Send back the money" campaign===
In their original fundraising activities the Free Church sent "missionaries" to the [[United States]], where they found some slave-owners particularly supportive. However, the church having accepted £3,000 in donations from this source, they were later denounced as unchristian by [[abolitionists]]. When [[Frederick Douglass]] arrived in Scotland he became a vocal proponent of the "Send back the money" campaign which urged the Free Church to return the £3,000 donation.<ref name="HRM">{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Hannah-Rose |title=Scotland - Frederick Douglass in Britain and Ireland |url=http://frederickdouglassinbritain.com/journey/scotland/ |website=frederickdouglassinbritain.com |access-date=18 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In his autobiography "My Bondage and My Freedom" Douglass (p. 386) writes: "The Free Church held on to the blood-stained money, and continued to justify itself in its position — and of course to apologize for slavery — and does so till this day. She lost a glorious opportunity for giving her voice, her vote, and her example to the cause of humanity ; and to-day she is staggering under the curse of the enslaved, whose blood is in her skirts." Douglass spoke at three meetings in Dundee in 1846. In 1844, long before Douglass' arrival, [[Robert Smith Candlish|Robert Candlish]] had spoken against slavery in a debate about a man named John Brown.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=William |author-link=William Wilson (Dundee minister)|title=Memorials of Robert Smith Candlish, D.D. : minister of St. George's Free Church, and principal of the New College, Edinburgh |date=1880 |publisher=A. and C.

===Theology===
[[File:NC from PGardens.jpg|thumb|right|[[New College, Edinburgh]] from Princes Street Gardens]]
Great importance was attached to maintaining an educated ministry within the Free Church. Because the established Church of Scotland controlled the divinity faculties of the universities, the Free Church set up its own colleges. [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]] was opened in 1850 with five chairs: Systematic Theology, Apologetics and Practical Theology, Church History, Hebrew and Old Testament, and New Testament 
Exegesis. The Free Church also set up [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Christ's College]] in Aberdeen in 1856 and [[Trinity College, Glasgow|Trinity College]] in Glagow followed later. The first generation of teachers were enthusiastic proponents of [[Westminster Confession|Westminster Calvinism]].

For example, [[David Welsh]] was an early professor. [[James Buchanan (minister)|James Buchanan]] followed Thomas Chalmers as professor of Systematic Theology when he died in 1847. [[James Bannerman (theologian)|James Bannerman]] was appointed to the chair of Apologetics and Pastoral Theology and his ''The Church of Christ'' volumes 1<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bannerman|first1=James|title=The church of Christ : a treatise on the nature, powers, ordinances, discipline, and government of the Christian church|date=1868|publisher=T.

T. Clark|location=Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/stream/churchofchristtr02bann#page/n8/mode/1up|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> were widely read. [[William Cunningham (theologian)|William Cunningham]] was one of the early Church History professors. [[John Duncan (theologian)|John "Rabbi" Duncan]] was an early professor of Hebrew.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Norman L|title=Chapters from the history of the Free church of Scotland|date=1895|publisher=Oliphant, Anderson & Ferrier|location=Edinburgh; London|pages=94–95|url=https://archive.org/stream/chaptersfromhist00walk#page/94/mode/2up/search/duncan|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> Other chairs were added such as the Missionary Chair of [[Alexander Duff (missionary)|Duff]].

This position was subsequently abandoned, as theologians such as [[Alexander Balmain Bruce|A. B. Bruce]], [[Marcus Dods (theologian)|Marcus Dods]] and [[George Adam Smith]] began to teach a more [[Liberal religion|liberal]] understanding of the faith. 'Believing criticism' of the Bible was a central approach taught by such as [[William Robertson Smith]] and he was dismissed from his chair by the Assembly in 1881.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dabney|first1=Robert Lewis|title=Discussions of Robert Lewis Dabney Vol. 1: Evangelical and Theological|pages=399–439|url=https://archive.org/stream/DiscussionsOfRobertLewisDabneyVol.1EvangelicalAndTheological/DiscussionsOfR.l.DabneyV.1#page/n417/mode/2up|access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref> Attempts were made between 1890 and 1895 to bring many of these professors to the bar of the Assembly on charges of heresy, but these moves failed, with only minor warnings being issued.

In 1892 the Free Church, following the example of the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]] and the Church of Scotland, and with union with those denominations as the goal, passed a Declaratory Act relaxing the standard of subscription to the confession. This had the result that a small number of congregations and even fewer ministers, mostly in the Highlands, severed their connection with the church and formed the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]. Others with similar theological views waited for imminent union but chose to continue with the Free Church.

Towards the end of the 19th century, Free Churches sanctioned the use of instrumental music. An association formed in 1891 to promote order and reverence in public services.

==Unions and relationships with other Presbyterians==<!-- This section is linked from [[Antidisestablishmentarianism]] -->
[[File:Reformed Scots Church Denominations.svg|thumb|500px|Timeline showing the evolution of the churches of Scotland from 1560]]
From its inception, the Free Church claimed it was the authentic Church of Scotland. Constitutionally, despite the Disruption, she continued to support the establishment principle. However some joined the United Presbyterian Church in calling for the [[Disestablishment]] of the Church of Scotland.

In 1852 the Original Secession Church joined the Free Church; in 1876 most of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Reformed Presbyterian Church]] followed suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterians]] was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC with a view to a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship between state and church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate as to what was true in religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time this difference was sufficient to preclude the union being pursued.

In the following years the Free Church Assembly showed increasing willingness for union on these open terms. However, the 'establishment' minority prevented a successful conclusion during the years between 1867–73. After negotiations failed in 1873, the two churches agreed a 'Mutual Eligibility Act' enabling a congregation of one denomination to call a minister from the other.

During this period the [[antidisestablishmentarianism|antidisestablishmentarian]] party continued to shrink and became increasingly alienated. This decline was hastened when some congregations left to form the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1893.

Starting in 1895, union began to be officially discussed once more. A joint committee made up of men from both denominations noted remarkable agreement on doctrinal standards, rules and methods. After a few concessions from both sides, a common constitution was agreed. However, a minority in the Free Church Assembly protested, and threatened to test its legality in the courts.

The respective assemblies of the churches met for the last time on 30 October 1900. On the following day the union was completed, and the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] came into being.

However, a minority of those who dissented remained outside the union, claiming that they were the true Free Church and that the majority had departed from the church when they formed the United Free Church. After a protracted legal battle, the [[House of Lords]] found in favour of the minority (in spite of the belief of most that the true kirk is above the state) and awarded them the right to keep the name [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], though the majority was able to keep most of the financial resources. (See [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] for the history of the continuing body.)

==Gaelic Moderators==
For certain years a separate Gaelic Moderator served at a separate Assembly in [[Inverness]]. This had advantages of allowing northern ministers to travel less to the Assembly. It did however create a division. In this division it was largely the northern ministers who remained in the Free Church following the Union of 1900. Known Gaelic Moderators are:<ref>Ewing, William ''Annals of the Free Church''</ref>

==Other areas==

The Free Church were spread the length and breadth of Scotland and also had churches in the northmost sectors of England and several churches in [[London]]. Their influence in other countries focused on Canada and New Zealand, where there were a high proportion of Scots. They ran a specific recruitment campaign to get Free Church ministers to go to New Zealand. Moderators in New Zealand included:

Prince Edward Island, Canada, retains a number of Free Churches of Scotland affiliated with the Synod in Scotland as missionary churches. This alliance was established by the Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland, Rev. Ewen MacDougall, in the 1930s, at the time of the establishment of the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the subsequent establishment of the United Church of Canada. The large enclave of Free Church of Scotland congregations has been attributed to a religious revival under the preaching of Rev. Donald MacDonald. The extant Church of Scotland congregations of Prince Edward Island, Canada, continue to adhere to a simple form of worship with a focus on a biblical exegesis from the pulpit, singing of the Psalms and biblical paraphrases without accompaniment or choir, led by a chanter, and prayer. The houses of worship remain simple with minimal embellishment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}
