'''The Good Judgment Project''' ('''GJP''') is a project "harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to forecast world events". It was co-created by [[Philip E. Tetlock]] (author of ''Superforecasting'' and of ''Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?''), decision scientist [[Barbara Mellers]], and [[Don A. Moore|Don Moore]], all professors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=main>{{cite web|url=http://www.gjopen.com/|title = Welcome to the Good Judgment Project|publisher = The Good Judgment Project|accessdate = May 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodjudgmentproject.com/|title = Who's who in the Good Judgment Project|publisher = The Good Judgment Project|accessdate = May 5, 2014|date = July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/opinion/brooks-forecasting-fox.html|title = Forecasting Fox|last = Brooks|first = David|date = March 21, 2013|accessdate = May 5, 2014|newspaper = [[New York Times]]}}</ref> It was a participant in the [[Aggregative Contingent Estimation]] (ACE) program of the [[Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity]] (IARPA) in the [[United States]].<ref name=project>{{cite web|url = http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/about_project.html|title = The Project|publisher = The Good Judgment Project|accessdate = May 5, 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506201121/http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/about_project.html|archivedate = May 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name=washpo>{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/26/good-judgment-in-forecasting-international-affairs-and-an-invitation-for-season-3/|title = Good judgment in forecasting international affairs (and an invitation for season 3)|last = Horowitz|first = Michael|date = November 26, 2013|accessdate = May 5, 2014|newspaper = [[Washington Post]]}}</ref> Predictions are scored using [[Brier score]]s.<ref name=predictive-heuristics-icews>{{cite web|url=http://predictiveheuristics.com/2013/11/12/prediction-and-good-judgment-can-icews-inform-forecasts/|title = Prediction and Good Judgment: Can ICEWS Inform Forecasts?|last = Dickenson|first = Matt|date = November 12, 2013|accessdate = May 24, 2014|publisher = Predictive Heuristics}}</ref> The top forecasters in GJP are "reportedly 30% better than intelligence officers with access to actual classified information."<ref name=":0" />

==History==

The Good Judgment Project began in July 2011 in collaboration with IARPA-ACE.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://goodjudgmentproject.com/blog/?p=4|title = The idea behind the Good Judgment Project|date = July 27, 2011|accessdate = May 5, 2014|publisher = The Good Judgment Project|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506202243/http://goodjudgmentproject.com/blog/?p=4|archivedate = May 6, 2014}}</ref> The first contest began in September 2011.<ref name=economist-kickoff-1/><ref name=economist-kickoff-2/> GJP was one of many entrants in the IARPA-ACE tournament, and has repeatedly emerged as the winner in the tournament.<ref name=washpo/> Starting with the summer of 2013, GJP contestants had access to the [[Integrated Conflict Early Warning System]].<ref name=predictive-heuristics-icews/>

==People==

The co-leaders of the GJP include [[Philip Tetlock]], Barbara Mellers and [[Don Moore]].<ref name=main/> The website lists a total of about 30 team members, including the co-leaders as well as [[David Budescu]], [[Lyle Ungar]], [[Jonathan Baron]], and prediction-markets entrepreneur Emile Servan-Schreiber.<ref name=team>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/|title = Team|accessdate = May 5, 2014|publisher = The Good Judgment Project}}</ref> The advisory board included [[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Robert Jervis]], [[J. Scott Armstrong]], [[Michael Mauboussin]], [[Carl Spetzler]] and [[Justin Wolfers]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Freakonomics| work = Sign Up for a Prediction Tournament| date = 2011-08-04|url=http://freakonomics.com/2011/08/04/sign-up-for-a-prediction-tournament/}}</ref> The study employed several thousand people as volunteer forecasters.<ref name='Meller2014'/> Using personality-trait tests, training methods and strategies the researchers at GJP were able to select forecasting participants with less cognitive bias than the average person; as the forecasting contest continued the researchers were able to further down select these individuals in groups of so-called ''superforecasters''. The last season of the GJP enlisted a total of 260 superforecasters.

==Research==

A significant amount of research has been conducted based on the Good Judgment Project by the people involved with it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atanasov|first=Pavel|last2=Rescober|first2=Phillip|last3=Stone|first3=Eric|last4=Swift|first4=Samuel A.|last5=Servan-Schreiber|first5=Emile|last6=Tetlock|first6=Philip|last7=Ungar|first7=Lyle|last8=Mellers|first8=Barbara|date=2016-04-22|title=Distilling the Wisdom of Crowds: Prediction Markets vs. Prediction Polls|url=https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2374|journal=Management Science|volume=63|issue=3|pages=691–706|doi=10.1287/mnsc.2015.2374|issn=0025-1909}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS12/paper/viewFile/5570/5871/ |title=The Good Judgment Project: A Large Scale Test of Different Methods of Combining Expert Predictions |last1=Ungar |first1=Lyle |last2=Mellers |first2=Barbara |last3=Satopää |first3=Ville |last4=Baron |first4=Jon |last5=Tetlock |first5=Philip E. |author5-link=Philip E.

==Good Judgment Open==

A commercial [[research spin-off|spin-off]] of the Good Judgment Project started to operate on the web in July 2015 under the name Good Judgment Inc. Starting in September 2015, Good Judgment Inc has been running a public forecasting tournament at the Good Judgment Open site.  Like the Good Judgment Project, Good Judgment Open has questions about geopolitical and financial events, although it also has questions about US politics, entertainment, and sports.
