'''Jens Weidmann''' (born 20 April 1968) is a German economist, president of the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], and Chairman of the Board of the [[Bank for International Settlements]].

Before assuming the top Bundesbank position in 2011, from February 2006, he served as Head of Division IV (Economic and Financial Policy) in the [[German Chancellery|Federal Chancellery]]. He was the chief negotiator of the Federal Republic of Germany for both the summits of the [[G8]] and the [[G20]].

== Early life and academic career ==
Weidmann was born in [[Solingen]]. In 1987, Weidmann graduated from [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] in [[Backnang]], [[Baden-Württemberg]] after which he studied economics at [[Aix-Marseille University]], the [[University of Paris]], and [[University of Bonn]]. He received his [[Diplom]] in economics in 1993. From 1993 to 1994, he commenced his doctoral studies on European monetary policy under the supervision of professor {{Interlanguage link multi|Roland Vaubel|de|vertical-align=sup}} at the [[University of Mannheim]], but later transferred back to Bonn again.<ref>[http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.ex-professor-von-jens-weidmann-der-aufgabe-nicht-gewachsen.dc141aee-9a14-4435-a98f-e7e50a3fbb40.html 'Ex-Professor von Jens Weidmann: "Der Aufgabe nicht gewachsen"'], ''Stuttgarter Zeitung'', 16 February 2011.</ref> He received his [[doctoral degree|Dr. rer. nat. pol.]] under the auspices of monetary theorist {{Interlanguage link multi|Manfred J. M. Neumann|de|vertical-align=sup}} in 1997. During his studies Weidmann had internships at the [[Banque de France]] and the [[National Bank of Rwanda]]. Due to the resulting knowledge of the French financing sector his later career in German financial politics was welcomed in France and seen as a support of the [[France–Germany relations|Franco-German twin engine]]{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}. His education has been characterized as specialising in [[monetarist]] economics.<ref name=Gu01>Traynor, I, [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/01/jens-weidmann-mario-draghi-euro 'Jens Weidmann – the man with the key to Mario Draghi's handcuffs'], ''Guardian'', 1 August 2012.</ref>

== Professional career ==
From 1997 to 1999, Weidmann worked at the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Until 2004 he worked as Secretary of the [[German Council of Economic Experts]]. During his time at the Council, he played a key role in compiling a 20-point plan for boosting growth and employment that formed the basis of then-Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]’s [[Agenda 2010]] reforms.<ref>Christian Distasio (July 6, 2011), [http://www.politico.eu/article/efficient-economist/ Efficient economist] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>

From there he moved to the [[Bundesbank]], where until 2006 he was the head of the Monetary Policy and Monetary Analysis group.

===Advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, 2006-2011===
In 2006, Weidmann began working at the [[German Chancellery|Federal Chancellery]], where he was responsible for preparing the content and strategy of the [[G-20 major economies|G-20 round]] which was formed to counter the effects of the financial crisis. When he started, he was the youngest department head in the German government.<ref>Christoph Pauly and Christian Reiermann (February 21, 2011), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/a-merkel-advisor-goes-to-frankfurt-what-awaits-weidmann-as-new-bundesbank-head-a-746725.html A Merkel Advisor Goes to Frankfurt: What Awaits Weidmann as New Bundesbank Head?] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref> Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] promoted him in December 2009 to the influential role of the Sherpa of the G8 summits<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,666452,00.html Spiegel Online: "Merkel beruft neuen Super-Sherpa"]</ref> as she considers the G8 round to be only a pre-summit of the G20 round in the field of the world-wide financial system as well as that most other subjects need a wider context than the G8 as well (compare [[Heiligendamm Process]] for G8+5).

During his time at the Federal Chancellery, Weidmann was involved in a series of major decisions in response to the financial crisis in Germany and Europe: preventing the meltdown of the bank [[Hypo Real Estate]], guaranteeing German deposits and implementing a rescue programme for the banking system, piecing together two fiscal-stimulus programmes, and setting up the Greek bail-out package and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF).<ref>Christian Distasio (July 6, 2011), [http://www.politico.eu/article/efficient-economist/ Efficient economist] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>

In 2011, Weidmann suggested to Merkel that the position of Bundesbank vice president, which had also become vacant, be filled by [[Sabine Lautenschläger]], then director of Germany's [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority]] (BaFin).<ref>Christoph Pauly and Christian Reiermann (February 21, 2011), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/a-merkel-advisor-goes-to-frankfurt-what-awaits-weidmann-as-new-bundesbank-head-a-746725.html A Merkel Advisor Goes to Frankfurt: What Awaits Weidmann as New Bundesbank Head?] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref>

=== President of the Bundesbank, 2011–present ===

In February, 2011, Weidmann was designated to succeed [[Axel A. Weber]] as president of the Deutsche Bundesbank.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.faz.net/s/Rub0E9EEF84AC1E4A389A8DC6C23161FE44/Doc~E66115796AF004491B99C2ABCC384205A~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Jens Weidmann wird Bundesbank-Präsident |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |date=16 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110216-706352.html |title=Germany's Merkel: Weidmann Will Take Up Post May 1 |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=16 February 2011 |first=Patrick |last=McGroarty }}</ref><ref>Marsh, David, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bundesbank-renationalization-under-way-2011-05-09?link=home_carousel "Bundesbank renationalization under way: Commentary: Weidmann declares return to normality"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', May 9, 2011.</ref>  In September, with the ongoing [[European sovereign debt crisis]], Weidmann was observed by a British commentator, [[David Marsh (Financial Specialist)|David Marsh]], to be taking a "cool" course relative to Chancellor Merkel. Marsh wrote that Weidmann was saying the [[European Monetary Union]] (EMU) "has to go in one of two directions. Either it takes the path of a fiscal union in which member countries fuse together their economic and financial systems into a much more robust framework that will protect them from internal dislocation. Weidmann says, coolly, this is somewhat unlikely. Or EMU remains a looser grouping of countries that will face the discipline of the financial markets if they fail to produce economic convergence," namely exit from the EMU and default, looking particularly at Greece. Marsh also noted that Merkel is committed to the first course and so may come into conflict with her one-time economic adviser Weidmann.<ref>Marsh, David, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-euro-crisis-merkel-is-replaying-1931-2011-09-26 "In euro crisis, Merkel is replaying 1931"], ''MarketWatch'', September 26, 2011, 12:01 am EDT. Retrieved 2011-09-26.</ref>

In a late November, 2011, speech in Berlin, Weidmann criticized the errors and "many years of wrong developments" of the EMU's peripheral states, particularly the wasted opportunity represented by their "disproportionate investment in private home-building, high government spending or private consumption", David Marsh reported.<ref>Marsh, David, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germanys-helmut-kohl-loses-currency-bet-2011-12-08?link=home_carousel "Germany’s Helmut Kohl loses currency bet"], ''MarketWatch'', December 8, 2011, 5:22 am EST. Retrieved 2011-12-08.</ref> In early December, with another in a string of [[Eurozone]] summits imminent, ''Bloomberg'' commented that the new [[European Central Bank|ECB]] head [[Mario Draghi]] "knows he can't afford to repeat" his predecessor [[Jean-Claude Trichet]]'s mistake of alienating the Bundesbank. Draghi was said in the report to be courting Weidmann by, among others, Julian Callow, chief European economist at [[Barclays]] in London.<ref>Black, Jeff and Simon Kennedy, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/08/bloomberg_articlesLVVOU81A74E9.DTL "Draghi Courts Bundesbank in Bid to Avoid Trichet's Bond Fate"], ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' via ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', December 8, 2011. Retrieved 2011-12-08.</ref>

In May, 2012, Weidmann's stance was characterized by US economist and columnist [[Paul Krugman]] as amounting to wanting to destroy the Euro.<ref>Krugman, Paul, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/doubling-down/ 'Doubling Down'], NY ''Times'', 8 May 2012.</ref>

Weidmann, in late August 2012, was reported to have threatened to resign as [[European sovereign-debt crisis#Spain|Draghi's July 2012 promise]] to do "whatever it takes" to save the Euro seemed likely to lead to purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds to keep interest rates in those major member economies capped at manageable levels. "In an interview with Der Spiegel last week, Weidmann said the bond buying made it look as if ECB was financing governments directly — and shouldn’t go ahead", reported another ''MarketWatch'' commentator, [[Matthew Lynn]]. Lynn further speculated on the Draghi-Weidmann interaction, reminding readers of Axel Weber's 2011 resignation over a "similar [ECB] scheme" and also of the 1992 failure of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] over German refusal to choose "printing money (taking some small risks with inflation) ... to stabilize the system".<ref>Lynn, Matthew, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamble-on-ecb-but-only-with-money-you-can-lose-2012-09-05 "Gamble on ECB, but only with money you can lose"], ''MarketWatch'',  September 5, 2012. Retrieved 2012-09-05.</ref>

On 24 February 2016, as part of the [[Bundesbank]]'s annual news conference, [[Bundesbank]] president and [[European Central Bank]] Governing Council member, Jens Weidmann, dismissed deflation in light of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]'s current stimulus program, pointing out the healthy condition of the [[Economy of Germany|German economy]] and that the [[Eurozone|euro area]] is not that bad off, on the eve of the 9–10 March 2016 meetings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bundesbank President Dismisses Deflation, Increases Tension At ECB|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3057181/bundesbank-deflation-fears-increase-tensions-with-ecb|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=24 February 2016}}</ref>

In April 2019, Weidmann's mandate as Bundesbank president was renewed for another eight years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bundesbank.de/en/tasks/topics/federal-president-of-germany-appoints-jens-weidmann-president-of-the-bundesbank-for-another-eight-years--796360|title=Federal President of Germany appoints Jens Weidmann President of the Bundesbank for another eight years|website=www.bundesbank.de|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>
