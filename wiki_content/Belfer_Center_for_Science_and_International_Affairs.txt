The '''Robert and Renée Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs''' (also known as the '''Belfer Center''') is a research center located within the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. Since 2017, the center is led by Director [[Ash Carter]], former US Secretary of Defense and Co-Director [[Eric Rosenbach]], former Assistant Secretary of Defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.belfercenter.org/about|title=About|website=Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs}}</ref>

Belfer was founded in 1973<ref>[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Organizations/Detail/?id=165758 Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs (BCSIA)], International Relations and Security Network (ISN), Zurich</ref> by biochemist [[Paul M. Doty]] as the 'Program for Science and International Affairs' within [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]<ref>[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2011/12/06/paul_doty_91_presidential_adviser_on_nuclear_arms_control/ Bryan Marquard & staff, Obituary: "Paul Doty, 91, presidential adviser on nuclear arms control"], ''[[Boston Globe]],'' 6 December 2011</ref> to provide analysis on [[arms control]] and nuclear threat reduction.  Following a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], the program was re-established as the Center for Science and International Affairs, becoming the first permanent research center at the newly formed School of Government. In 1997, following further endowment, the center was renamed as the '''Robert and Renée Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs''' in honor of [[Robert A. Belfer]], founder of Belco Oil & Gas Corporation.

In 2012, the [[Stanton Foundation]] provided funds for a paid [[Wikipedian in residence]] at the Belfer Center. This became controversial due to links between the Belfer Center and the Stanton Foundation (the directors of each are a married couple) and public concerns about [[conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]].<ref name="Daily Dot Belfer">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-paid-editing-scandal-stanton/ |title=One of Wikimedia's largest donors accused in paid editing scandal |publisher=[[The Daily Dot]] |author=Tim Sampson  |date=14 April 2014}}</ref> The center is organized into subgroups with specific areas of focus; for example, an [[energy technology]] innovation policy group led by [[Laura Diaz Anadon]].<ref name="twsScienceMag">{{cite web
