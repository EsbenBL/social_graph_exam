'''Ralf Gustav Dahrendorf, Baron Dahrendorf''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KBE|FBA}} (1 May 1929 – 17 June 2009) was a German-British [[sociologist]], philosopher, [[political scientist]] and liberal politician. A [[Conflict theory|class conflict theorist]], Dahrendorf was a leading expert on explaining and analysing class divisions in modern society. Dahrendorf wrote multiple articles and books, his most notable being ''Class Conflict in Industrial Society'' (1959) and ''Essays in the Theory of Society'' (1968).

During his political career, he was a Member of the German Parliament, [[Parliamentary Secretary of State]] at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] of Germany, [[European Commissioner for Trade]], [[European Commissioner for Science & Research|European Commissioner for Research, Science and Education]] and Member of the British [[House of Lords]], after he was created a [[life peer]] in 1993. He was subsequently known in the United Kingdom as Lord Dahrendorf.<ref name="Mann 2008 42">{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=A Survey of Modern Social Theory|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Ontario, Canada|pages=42}}</ref>

He served as director of the [[London School of Economics]] and Warden of [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]], University of Oxford. He also served as a Professor of Sociology at a number of universities in Germany and the United Kingdom, and was a Research Professor at the [[Berlin Social Science Research Center]].

==Biography==
===Family===
Dahrendorf was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, in 1929, the son of Lina and [[Gustav Dahrendorf]] and brother of [[:de:Frank Dahrendorf|Frank Dahrendorf]].<ref name="Mann 2008 42"/>

Dahrendorf was known for strongly supporting anti-Nazi activities.<ref>Grimes, William.

After this, his family moved to Berlin. In 1944, during the last year of the Second World War, he was arrested again for engaging in anti-Nazi activities and sent to a concentration camp in Poland. He was released in 1945.<ref name="nytimes.com">Grimes, William.

===Marriages and children===
Dahrendorf was married three times. He married his first wife, Vera, in 1954. She was a fellow student at the [[London School of Economics]]. Together they had three daughters: Nicola, Alexandra and Daphne Dahrendorf. [[Nicola Dahrendorf]] has worked for the United Nations and as the West Africa Regional Conflict Adviser to the UK Government.

From 1980 to 2004, he was married to historian and translator [[Ellen Dahrendorf]] (née Ellen Joan Krug), the daughter of Professor James Krug. When he was created a peer in 1993, his wife became known as Lady Dahrendorf. Ellen Dahrendorf, who is Jewish, has served on the board of the Jewish Institute for Policy Research, been chair of the British branch of the [[New Israel Fund]], and is a signatory of the [[Independent Jewish Voices]] declaration, which is critical of Israeli policies towards the Palestinians.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/05/holdjewishvoicesstatement|title=A time to speak out|date=5 February 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=22 May 2010|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/hasbara/headlines/a4-4.html|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821143039/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/hasbara/headlines/a4-4.html|archive-date=21 August 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=25 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ijv.org.uk/ |title = Independent Jewish Voices}}</ref>

===Education and career===
Ralf Dahrendorf studied [[philosophy]], [[classical philology]], and [[sociology]] at [[Hamburg University]] between 1947 and 1952. After completing his doctorate in sociology at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1954, he returned to Germany, where, from 1958, he held a succession of chairs in sociology, culminating in Konstanz University in 1969.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Cultural Theorist|last1=Cashmore|first1=Ellis|last2=Rojek|first2=Chris|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|location=New York, NY|pages=109–111}}</ref>  At this early stage in Dahrendorf's academic career, he took an interest in [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory and wrote his PhD thesis on [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of justice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Bryan|journal=Citizenship Studies|date=26 April 2010|volume=14|issue=2|page=237|doi=10.1080/13621021003594973|title=Ralf Dahrendorf on citizenship and life chances|s2cid=145360857}}</ref> Starting in the late 1950s, Dahrendorf, like Coser, argued for a "conflict theory approach to sociology."<ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Douglas|title=Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-542184-2|pages=42–43|year=2008}}</ref> He continued his academic research at [[London School of Economics]] under [[Karl Popper]] as a Leverhulme Research Scholar in 1953–1954, gaining a PhD degree in sociology in 1956. He was a professor of sociology in Hamburg (1957–1960), [[Tübingen]] (1960–1964) and [[Konstanz]] (1966–1969).<ref name="Mann 2008 42"/> He was one of the founders (1964) of the University Konstanz.<ref>{{Cite web|title=50 years of university history {{!}} 50 years University of Konstanz {{!}} Profile {{!}} About the University of Konstanz {{!}} University {{!}} University of Konstanz|url=https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/about-the-university-of-konstanz/profile/50-years-university-of-konstanz/50-years-of-university-history/|access-date=11 August 2021|website=www.uni-konstanz.de}}</ref>

From 1957 to 1959, Dahrendorf talked about "this ability to organize as the principle between quasi-groups and interest groups." Quasi-groups are defined as "those collectives that have latent identical role interests but do not experience a sense of "belongingness". Interest groups, on the other hand, "have a structure, a form of organization, a program or goal, and a personnel of members."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=Kenneth|title=Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=1-4129-1362-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarysoci00alla/page/164 164]|year=2006|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarysoci00alla/page/164}}</ref> In 1960, he became a visiting professor of Sociology at Columbia University in New York.<ref name="Lord Dahrendorf">{{cite web|last1=Pick|first1=Hella|title=Lord Dahrendorf|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/19/ralf-dahrendorf-obituary-lords-lse|website=The Guardian|date=18 June 2009|access-date=16 October 2014}}</ref>

From 1967 to 1970, he was Chairman of the [[German Sociological Association]] (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie), resigning it when he took up his office at Brussels. Between 1976 and 1979 he led the educational sub-committee of the [[Benson Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Emerald: Article Requests: Indefinite articles|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=9F328F753CC45ECD41DD5147379E5983?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1702699&history=true|access-date=|publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing]]}}</ref>

From 1968 to 1969, Dahrendorf was a member of the [[Landtag of Baden-Württemberg|Parliament of Baden-Württemberg]], and also in 1968, his links with Harvard University began.<ref name="Lord Dahrendorf" /> Dahrendorf decided to become a member of the [[Bundestag]] in 1969 during the time when Brandt formed his first SPD-FDP coalition government. After joining, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the foreign minister. Because he was placed third on the ladder of command in the foreign ministry, he did not enjoy the experience.<ref name="Lord Dahrendorf" /> From 1969 to 1970 he was a member of the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] for the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (the German liberals). From 1969 to 1970 he was also a Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1970 he became a Commissioner in the [[European Commission]] in Brussels. He was dedicated to the EU as a guarantor of [[human rights]] and liberty.<ref name="Lord Dahrendorf" />

In 1974, the BBC invited him to present the annual [[Reith Lectures]]. In this series of six radio talks, entitled ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h3x3t The New Liberty]'', he examined the definition of freedom.

From 1974 to 1984, Dahrendorf was director of the [[London School of Economics]], when he returned to Germany to become Professor of Social Science, [[University of Konstanz|Konstanz University (1984–86)]].


In 1986, Ralf Dahrendorf became a Governor of the London School of Economics. From 1987 to 1997, he was Warden of [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]] at the University of Oxford, succeeding the historian [[Raymond Carr|Sir Raymond Carr]].<ref name="Mann 2008 42"/>

In 1982, Dahrendorf was made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]. In 1988, he acquired British citizenship.<ref name="Lord Dahrendorf"/> and became known as Sir Ralf Dahrendorf (as only KBEs who are British subjects are entitled to use that title). On 15 July 1993, he was created a [[life peer]] with the title '''Baron Dahrendorf''' ''of [[Clare Market]] in the [[City of Westminster]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=53377 |date=20 July 1993 |page=12151}}</ref> Clare Market is near the London School of Economics, and is also used for car [[parking]] by LSE staff. Dahrendorf chose this name to honour the School in this way, and also as a sign of his liberal humour. He sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[cross-bencher]].

Between 2000 and 2006, Dahrendorf served as Chairman of the Judging Panel of the [https://www.firstinspires.org/ FIRST] Award for Responsible Capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|title =The FIRST International Award for Responsible Capitalism|url =http://www.firstmagazine.com/Awards}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He received the FIRST Responsible Capitalism lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. Dahrendorf insisted that even the most basic [[civil and political rights|civil rights]], including [[equality before the law|equality]] and [[freedom of expression]], be given constitutional legitimacy.<ref name="Lord Dahrendorf"/> On 11 July 2007, he was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for Social Studies.

In January 2005, he was appointed a Research Professor at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin (WZB).<ref>[http://www.wzb.eu/bal/spt/default.de.htm WZB website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20090801162802/http://www.wzb.eu/bal/spt/default.de.htm |date=1 August 2009 }}</ref>

Dahrendorf held dual citizenship in the UK and Germany. After retiring, he lived partially in Germany and partially in the United Kingdom, with one home in London and one in [[Bonndorf]] in south-western Germany. When asked which city he considered his home, he once said, "I am a Londoner".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4406145,00.html |title = German sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf dies &#124; DW &#124; 18.06.2009}}</ref> He also once said that his life was marked by a conflict between the obligation he felt to the country of his birth, Germany and the attraction he felt for Britain.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

===Death===
Dahrendorf died in [[Cologne]], Germany, aged 80, on 17 June 2009, after suffering from cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/273768,german-sociologist-ralf-dahrendorf-dead.html|title=German sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf dead|publisher=EarthTimes / DPA|access-date=18 June 2009}}</ref>

He was survived by his third wife, three daughters, and one grandchild.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

==Dahrendorf's concepts==
===''Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society''===
In 1959, Dahrendorf published in his most influential work on [[social inequality]], ''Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society.'' Despite later revisions and affirmations of his work, this book still remains as his first detailed and most influential account of the problem of social inequality in modern, or post-capitalist societies.<ref name="ReferenceA">Grabb, Edward G. "Theories of Social Inequality." Ontario: Harcourt Brace & Company. 1997</ref>

In analysing and evaluating the arguments of [[structural functionalism]] and [[Marxism]], Dahrendorf believed that neither theory alone could account for all of society. Marxism did not account for evidence of obvious [[social integration]] and cohesion. Structural functionalism, on the other hand, did not focus enough on social conflict.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB">Dahrendorf, Ralf."Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society." Stanford CA: Stanford University. 1959</ref> He also asserted that [[Karl Marx]] defined class in a narrow and historically-specific context. During Marx's time, wealth was the determining factor in attaining power. The wealthy and therefore the powerful ruled, leaving no way for the poor to gain any power or increase their position in society.

Drawing on aspects of both Marxism and structural functionalists to form his own beliefs, Dahrendorf highlighted the changes that have occurred in modern society. Dahrendorf believed in two approaches to society, Utopian and Rationalist. Utopian is the balance of values and solidity and Rationalist is the dissension and disagreement.  While he believes that both are social perspectives, the Utopian approach is most apparent in modern-day society, leaving Dahrendorf to create a balance between the two views.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rummer|first1=R.J.|title=Understanding Conflict and War: Vol. 3: Conflict In Perspective|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CIP.CHAP5.HTM|website=Marxism and Class Conflict|publisher=Sage Publications, 1977|access-date=9 October 2014}}</ref> Dahrendorf discusses literary utopias to show that the structural-functionalists idea of the social system is utopians in itself because it possess all the necessary characteristics.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/> Specifically, with democracy came voting for political parties, and increased social mobility. He believes that the struggle for authority creates conflict.<ref name="Mann 2008 43">{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=A Survey of Modern Social Theory|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Ontario, Canada|pages=43}}</ref> Money, political power, and social status were all controlled by the same group – the capitalist – which gave the workers little incentive to accept the status quo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory|last=Mann|first=Douglas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|location=Canada|pages=42–43}}</ref>

Furthermore, he believes that traditional Marxism ignores consensus and integration in modern social structures.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Dahrendorf's theory defined class not in terms of wealth like Marx, but by levels of authority.<ref name="Mann 2008 43" /> Dahrendorf combines elements from both of these perspectives to develop his own theory about class conflict in [[postcapitalism|post-capitalist]] society. Dahrendorf agrees with Marx that authority, in the 19th century, was based on income, and thus the rich bourgeoisie ruled the state. Yet things have changed then, where workers formed trade unions and allowed them to negotiate with the capitalist.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/>

===Class conflict theory===
Dahrendorf developed, cultivated, and advanced his theory of class conflict. He proposes a symbolic model of class conflict with authority as the generic form of domination, combined with a strong systematic view of society and the structuration of class relationships.<ref name=":0" /> This new theory is said to have taken place in reaction to structural functionalism and in many ways represents its antithesis. The conflict theory attempts to bring together [[structural functionalism]] and Marxism.

According to Dahrendorf, functionalism is beneficial while trying to understand consensus while the conflict theory is used to understand conflict and coercion. In order to understand structural functionalism, we study three bodies of work: Davis and Moore, Parsons, and Merton.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|title=Sociological Theory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-811167-9|date=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref name="Ritzer 2008 265">{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz/page/265 265]|isbn=978-0-07-352818-2}}</ref> Dahrendorf states that capitalism has undergone major changes since Marx initially developed his theory on [[class conflict]]. This new system of capitalism, known as [[post-capitalism]], is characterised by diverse class structure and a fluid system of power relations. Thus, it involves a much more complex system of inequality than Marx originally outlined.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Dahrendorf contends that post-capitalist society has institutionalised class conflict into state and economic spheres.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> For example, class conflict has been habituated through unions, collective bargaining, the court system, and legislative debate. In effect, the severe class strife typical of Marx's time is not longer relevant. 

Conflict theorists like Dahrendorf often took the exact opposite view of functionalists.  Whereas functionalists believe that society was oscillating very slightly, if not completely static, conflict theorists said that "every society at every point is subject to process of change".<ref name="Ritzer 2008 265" /> Conflict theorists believe that there is "dissension and conflict at every point in the social system" and "many societal elements as contributing to disintegration and change".<ref name="Ritzer 2008 266">{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz/page/266 266]|isbn=978-0-07-352818-2}}</ref> They believe order comes from coercion from those at the top, and that power is an important factor in social order. 

In developing his conflict theory, Dahrendorf recognised consensus theory was also necessary to fully reflect society. Consensus theory focuses on the value integration into society, while conflict theory focuses on conflicts of interest and the force that holds society together despite these stresses. In the past, structural functionalism was the commanding theory in sociology, until the conflict theory came along as its major challenger. However, both structural functionalism and the conflict theory have received major criticisms. In fact, Dahrendorf asserted that there has to be consensus to have conflict, as he said that the two were prerequisites for each other.<ref name="Sociological theory">{{cite book|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|title=Sociological theory|date=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-811167-9|edition=8th}}</ref> The opposite is also true, he believed –– conflict can result in cohesion and consensus.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 266" /> However, Dahrendorf did not believe the two theories could be combined into one cohesive and comprehensive theory. Instead, Dahrendorf's thesis was "the differential distribution of authority invariably becomes the determining factor of systematic social conflicts".<ref name="Ritzer 2008 266" /> "In the end, conflict theory should be seen as a litte more than a transitional development in the history of sociological theory. Although the theory failed because it didn't go far in the direction of Marxian theory, it was still early in the 1950s and 1960s for American sociology to accept a full-fledged Marxian approach. However, conflict theory was helping in setting the stage for the beginning of the acceptance by the late 1960s".<ref name="Sociological theory" />

===Authority===
Dahrendorf opposed those who studied authority on an individual level. Dahrendorf believed that Marx's theory could be updated to reflect modern society and Roman society.  He rejects Marx's two-class system as too simplistic and overly focused on property ownership.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 266"/> Due to the rise of the joint stock company, ownership does not necessarily reflect control of economic production in modern society.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Instead of describing the fundamental differences of class in terms of property, Dahrendorf claims that we must "replace the possession, or non-possession, of effective private property by the exercise of, or exclusion from, authority as the criterion of class formation".<ref name="ReferenceB"/> A crucial component to Dahrendorf's conflict theory is the idea of authority. Although it initially appears to be an individual issue and psychological, Dahrendorf argues that authority is related to positions and not to individuals.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 266"/> In this way, subordination and authority are products of expectation specified by society, and if those roles are not adhered to, sanctions are imposed. Dahrendorf expands on this idea with the notion that roles of authority may conflict when in different positions that call for different things. According to Dahrendorf, these different defined areas of society where people's roles may be different are called imperatively coordinated associations.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 268">{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz/page/268 268]|isbn=978-0-07-352818-2}}</ref> The groups of society in different associations are drawn together by their common interests. Dahrendorf explains that latent interests are natural interests that arise unconsciously in conflict between superordinates and subordinates. He defines manifest interests as latent interests when they are realised. In conclusion, Dahrendorf believes that understanding authority to be the key to understanding social conflict.

Dahrendorf, like Merton, looked at latent and manifest interests and further classified them as unconscious and conscious interests. He found the connection between these two concepts to be problematic for the conflict theory.<ref name="Sociological theory"/> Dahrendorf believed that the basis of class conflict was the division of three groups of society: quasi groups, interest groups, and conflict groups.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 268" /> Thus, society can be split up into the "command class" and the "obey class". The command class exercises authority, while the obey class not only has no authority, and but is also subservient to that of others. With a clear interplay between both class types class conflict theory sought to explain that interplay.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Robert V. |first2=Jonathan |last2=Kelley |title=Class as Conceived by Marx and Dahrendorf: Effects on Income Inequality and Politics in the United States and Great Britain |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |year=1979 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=38–58 |jstor=2094817 |doi=10.2307/2094817 }}</ref> Quasi groups are "aggregates of incumbents of positions with identical role interests".<ref name="Ritzer 2008 268"/> Interest groups are derived from the quasi groups and they are organised with members, an organisation, and a program or goal. The main difference between quasi groups and interest groups are that interest groups are able to organise and have a sense of "belonging" or identity.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Contemporary Socialand Sociological Theory|year=2006|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=California|pages=164}}</ref> Darhendorf acknowledged that other conditions like politics, adequate personnel, and recruitment would play a role along with the groups. He also believed that, under ideal circumstances, conflict could be explained without reference to other variables.<ref name="Sociological theory" /> Unlike Marx, however, he did not believe that random recruitment into the quasi group would start a conflict group. In contrast to Lewis Coser's ideas that functions of conflict maintained the status quo, Dahrendorf believed that that conflict also leads to change (in social structure) and development.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 269">{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sociologicaltheo00ritz/page/269 269]|isbn=978-0-07-352818-2}}</ref> His belief in a changing society separated Dahrendorf's ideas from Marx who supported the concept of a utopia.<ref name="Mann 2008 42"/>

===Marx and Dahrendorf's perspectives on class formation===
Marx believed history to be defined as class struggle. Marx defined class as the difference between the dominating class and those who dominate. He believed that in modern society there were three types of classes: Capitalists, workers and petite bourgeoisie. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are the pillars in the formation of classes. Marx believed that the battle between the different classes formed the concept of class phenomenon.

Marx understood that there are two classes: the rulers who control the means of production, and the ruled who worked with the means of production. Every society needs both. The conflicts between them causes a destruction of the existing societal order so that it can be replaced by a new one.

On the other hand, Dahrendorf believed that the formation of classes was the organisation of common interests. This further means that people who are in positions of authority are supposed to control subordination, meaning that sanctions could be put into effect against people who fail to obey authority commands, resulting in fines and further punishments. Dahrendorf argues that society is composed of multiple units that are called imperatively coordinated associations. He saw social conflict as the difference between dominating and subject groups in imperatively coordinated associations.<ref name=":1" />

Marx believed that class formation was based on the ownership of private property. On the contrary, Dahrendorf argued that class formation was always based on authority. He defined authority as a facet of social organisations and as a common element of social structures. There is also another difference between Marx and Dahrendorf concerning the structure of societies. Dahrendorf believed that society had two aspects: consensus and conflict, static and change, order and dissension, cohesion and the role of power, integration and conflict, and lastly consensus and constraint. He saw them all as equally the double aspects of society. On this point, Dahrendorf asserted that society could not survive without both consensus and conflict. He felt this way because without conflict, there can be no consensus, and although consensus leads to conflict, conflict also leads to consensus.

==Criticism==
The theory takes only a macrosociological perspective. The theory fails to address much of social life.<ref name="Ritzer 2008 269"/> In increasingly modern, multicultural societies, the contested concept and construct of identity received growing emphasis, and was the focus of many debates. As a consequence of the debates over identity, and inevitably in a globalising, modern, multicultural world, the issues of citizenship came into play. Specifically, the discussions analysed the ways in which citizenship contributed to the formation and construction of identities. Dahrendorf's adherence to a Marxian position seemingly prevented him from participating in these debates. Absent from Dahrendorf's theory were any significant discussions of culture, and therefore, citizenship and identity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Bryan|journal=Citizenship Studies|date=26 April 2010|volume=14|issue=2|page=241|doi=10.1080/13621021003594973|title=Ralf Dahrendorf on citizenship and life chances|s2cid=145360857}}</ref>

==Relationship to other classical theorists and perspectives==
Unlike many of the other works published by social theorists in the 1950s, Dahrendorf's work acknowledges the same class interests that worried [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Like Marx, Dahrendorf agreed that conflict is still a basic fact of social life. Dahrendorf believed that class conflict could have beneficial consequences for society, such as progressive change.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Dahrendorf is recognised for being one of the best departures from the [[structural functionalism|structural functionalist]] tradition of the 1950s. Dahrendorf criticised and wanted to challenge the "false, utopian representation of societal harmony, stability, and consensus by the structural functionalist school."<ref>Grabb, Edward G. "Theories of Social Inequality." Toronto: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston of Canada. 1984</ref> Nevertheless, Dahrendorf still shares key ideas with structural functionalists, such as a general faith in the efficacy of political and economic institutions. Like [[Max Weber|Weber]], Dahrendorf criticises Marx's view that the working class will ultimately become a homogeneous group of unskilled machine operators. Dahrendorf points out that in postcapitalist society there are elaborate distinctions regarding income, prestige, skill level, and life chances. Dahrendorf's pluralist view of class and power structures and belief that hierarchies of authority are inevitable in modern societies also reflect Weberian ideas.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

== The Ralf Dahrendorf Prize ==
Since 2019, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) has been awarding certain research projects with the Ralf Dahrendorf Prize. The prize  honours excellent research and supports the communication of scientific results to the public. Every two years, the BMBF awards prizes to researchers participating in the EU framework programme for research who have achieved exceptional success.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Birmingham researcher wins prestigious Ralf Dahrendorf Prize for Children Born of War project|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/news/2021/ralf-dahrendorf-prize-children-born-of-war.aspx|access-date=2021-11-01|website=University of Birmingham|language=en-GB}}</ref> The prize awards the winning research project with 50,000 euros, enabling winners to not only continue their research but explore different communication ideas. There is a jury made up of high class scientists and media personalities that help decide who should receive funding for their projects.<ref>{{Citation|last=Margarita|first=Angelidou|title=Co-creation Techniques and Tools for Sustainable and Inclusive Planning at Neighbourhood Level.
