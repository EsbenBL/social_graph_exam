==Scholarly Work==

He directed (with [[Alejandro Portes]]) the landmark [[Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study]] (CILS),<ref>[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/20520 Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), 1991-2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111183233/http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/20520 |date=November 11, 2013 }}</ref> begun in 1991; and, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, the [[Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles]] (IIMMLA) study.<ref>[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/22627 Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA), 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019115711/http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/22627 |date=October 19, 2009 }}</ref>  He also directed the first National Survey of Immigration Scholars (NASIS) in the United States.

In substance, Professor Rumbaut is known as one of the original architects of the segmented-assimilation paradigm of immigrant incorporation.  Developed in the 1990s, the paradigm argues that the experiences of recent immigrant groups are more diverse than either the classic assimilation or ethnic disadvantage perspectives suggests.  It posits three alternative pathways for the children of immigrants.

The first is the conventional upward trajectory toward assimilation.  The second is a process called selective acculturation, in which some groups try to inspire achievement in their children by referencing the traditional values of the home country, such as a dedication to education.  The third and most controversial pathway is known as downward mobility, in which members of the most disadvantaged groups face substantial structural barriers to advancement, such as poor urban schools and employment discrimination.  Children in these disadvantaged contexts may become racialized or turn to attitudes and behaviors considered oppositional to the mainstream, such as rejecting school or joining a street gang.  The extent to which downward mobility is occurring remains contested and has inspired many studies.  Because educational attainment is a primary marker of immigrant mobility, much of this research focuses on the education of immigrants’ children.

He has published over 150 articles and book chapters, and a dozen books, two of which have been translated into other languages.  Among his books are the critically acclaimed ''Immigrant America: A Portrait'' (with Alejandro Portes; 3rd ed. 2006);<ref name="ucpress1">[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520250413 Immigrant America, Revised, Expanded, and Updated - Alejandro Portes, Ruben G.
