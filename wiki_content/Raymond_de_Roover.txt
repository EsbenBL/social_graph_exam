==Life==
De Roover was born in Antwerp on 28 August 1904.<ref name=Verlinden>Charles Verlinden, "Roover (Raymond-Adrien-Marie De)", in ''[[Biographie Nationale de Belgique]]'', [http://www.academieroyale.be/Academie/documents/FichierPDFBiographieNationaleTome2098.pdf vol. 40, (supplement 12)] (Brussels, 1977), 737-740.</ref> He studied commercial and financial science at the Higher Institute of Commerce Saint-Ignace (the origin of the [[University of Antwerp]]) and began working as a bookkeeper while spending his free time studying the history of bookkeeping.<ref name=Verlinden/> In 1928 he published a study of [[Jan Ympijn]], who had written the first Flemish treatise on double-entry bookkeeping (published 1543).<ref name=Verlinden/> In 1929 he came across the accounts of the exchange merchants Colaert van Marke and Willem  Ruweel in Bruges city archives, their records having been sequestered by the city at their bankruptcy in 1369.<ref name=Verlinden/> This led to a number of publications, including a 1937 article in ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]''.

In 1936 De Roover married the American historian [[Florence Edler de Roover|Florence Edler]], and emigrated to the United States.<ref name=Verlinden/> He studied for an [[MBA]] at [[Harvard Business School]], graduating in 1938, and in 1943 obtained a doctorate in economics from the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1940 he was naturalised as a US citizen.<ref name=Verlinden/> His early research had focused on the technicalities of banking and exchange in medieval Flanders. In the United States, he expanded his research to the history of the [[Medici Bank]] and to more abstract medieval economic thought.

After graduating from Chicago, De Roover taught in turn at [[Wells College]], [[Illinois University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Boston College]], before his 1961 appointment at [[Brooklyn College]] in the [[City University of New York]].<ref name=Verlinden/> He was also a visiting lecturer at various European universities.<ref name="acton">''Journal of Markets & Morality'' Volume 10, Number 1 (Spring 2007): 1–3 Raymond de Roover’s Enduring Contribution to Economic History.
