The Ukrainian Delegation, headed by Yasko, refrained from participating in the PACE Autumn session 2019. It was a sign of protest against Russia's reinstatement to the Assembly without meeting the requirements of the Assembly resolutions adopted in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine.<ref>https://ukr.lb.ua/world/2019/09/29/438511_ielizaveta_yasko_vidmovlyatisya_vid.html</ref>

Instead, Yasko held consultations with the representatives of other delegations, including those who voted in favour of Russia's return to the organisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/politics/viyna-z-rosiyeyu-ekologiya-gender-i-didzhitalizaciya-progamma-ukrajini-v-parye-novini-ukrajini-50065264.html|title = Голова української делегації в ПАРЄ: Ніякого співробітництва з дипломатами РФ — інтерв'ю НВ}}</ref> This resulted in the establishment of the informal inter-parliamentary group Baltic Plus, together with the delegations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia. The aim of the inter-parliamentary group is to produce joint efforts to combat Russia’s efforts to undermine the efficiency and legitimacy of PACE and to present a positive agenda on culture, migration, human rights and digitalisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rada.gov.ua/preview/anonsy_podij/183909.html|title = Спільне робоче засідання членів делегації Верховної Ради України в ПАРЄ з членами делегацій країн Балтік+}}</ref>

On 16 January 2020, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] sent its delegation to the 2020 winter PACE session. Yasko explained the return with the "need to battle [for Ukraine] in new conditions at all possible grounds".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/articles/2020/01/16/7105134/|title=Боротися, а не здаватися: чому українські депутати вирішили їхати до ПАРЄ}}</ref>

Ukrainian delegation initiated concerns regarding the credentials of Russian delegation in the Assembly and spoke against nominating Petr Tolstoi for the Vice President of PACE. It justified its concerns by Russia's systemic failure to comply with the Assembly’s resolutions concerning Ukraine and Georgia and presence of Russian MPs elected in the fake elections in the occupied Crimea. Yasko also noted that the goals for the delegation for the Winter Session 2020 would be the de-occupation of Crimea, countering Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, liberation of political prisoners, implementation of [[Minsk Protocol|Minsk agreements]], enhancement of the international sanctions, as well as fight against authoritarianism in Russia itself.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-XupQShSiA</ref>

== Political views and statements ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2021}}
In March 2020 Yasko, along with colleagues from the [[Servant of the People party|Servant of the People Party]], opposed the proposed establishment of an Advisory Council within the framework of the [[Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine|Minsk Trilateral Contact Group]]. Yasko argued that the Advisory Council’s establishment would change the format of the negotiations, turning the Russian Federation into an observer rather than a direct participant in the conflict, that it would carry with it recognition of the representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, considered by Ukraine as "terrorist organizations", as legitimate representatives of ORDLO (temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine), that it would undermine the Ukrainian position in international courts and the potential for compensation for Ukraine for damages and losses caused by Russia. According to Yasko, approving the Advisory Council format would risk bringing defeat for Ukraine on international platforms, the lifting of international sanctions imposed on Russia during the course of its armed aggression, and defeat for Ukraine in its efforts to fight for the truth about Russian aggression in the information war.

On 16 March 2019, along with other MPs, Yelyzaveta Yasko signed a letter to the Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Oleksiy Danilov, requesting the dismissal of his advisor Serhiy Syvokho in connection with his statements regarding ‘internal conflict in Donbas’, which ran contrary to Ukrainian law, where the Russian Federation is officially recognised as an aggressor country against Ukraine.

Along with a group of other deputies from ‘Servant of the People’, Yelyzaveta Yasko publicly supported draft law 3260, on amendments to legislative acts of Ukraine to improve certain mechanisms for regulating banking activities. It has been identified as being crucial to unblocking Ukraine’s cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, and aims to prevent Ukraine from defaulting. In a post on her Facebook page, Yasko stated: ‘This bill will make it impossible to repeal the NBU’s decision on the nationalisation/liquidation of banks and unfairly compensating their former owners.’

She authored or co-authored bills on granting the status of participant in hostilities to volunteers, on the ethical principles of members of parliament, on the creation of the National Agency of Ukraine for Overcoming the Consequences of Armed Aggression of the Russian Federation, one the transparent regulation of lobbying, on improving the effectiveness of anti-corruption law enforcement, and on equal gender representation.

Yasko was one of the initiators of the bill on the Verkhovna Rada’s appeal to the parliaments of other states and parliamentary assemblies of international organisations to condemn Russian armed aggression and human rights violations in occupied Crimea. She was also one of the initiators of the Verkhovna Rada’s statements on non-recognition of the legitimacy of the so-called elections in Crimea and Sevastopol, and on the inadmissibility of restoring large-scale water supply along the North Crimean Canal to occupied Crimea.

She has her own blog on the website of ‘[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]’.
