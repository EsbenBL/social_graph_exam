'''António de Oliveira Salazar''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Tower and Sword|GCTE]] [[Military Order of Saint James of the Sword|GCSE]] [[Order of Infante D. Henrique|GColIH]] [[Order of the Colonial Empire|GCIC]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|l|ə|ˈ|z|ɑr}}, {{IPAc-en|USalso|ˌ|s|ɑː|l|-}}, {{IPA-pt|ɐ̃ˈtɔni.u ð(ɨ) ɔliˈvɐjɾɐ sɐlɐˈzaɾ|lang}}; 28 April 1889 – 27 July 1970) was a Portuguese economist who served as the [[prime minister of Portugal]] from 1932 to 1968. He was responsible for the {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}} ("New State"), the [[corporatist]] [[authoritarian]] government that ruled [[Portugal]] until 1974. 

A trained [[economist]], Salazar entered public life as finance minister with the support of President [[Óscar Carmona]] after the Portuguese ''[[coup d'état]]'' of [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|28 May 1926]]. The military of 1926 saw themselves as the guardians of the nation in the wake of the instability and perceived failure of the [[First Portuguese Republic|First Republic]], but they had no clue how to address the critical challenges of the hour.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=2}} Within one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilized Portugal's currency. Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=94}} He promoted civilian administration in the authoritarian regime when the politics of more and more countries were becoming militarized.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=2}} Salazar's aim was the de-politicization of society, rather than the mobilization of the populace.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=2}} However, Portugal remained largely underdeveloped, its population relatively poor and with low education attainment when compared to the rest of Europe.<ref name="mattoso94" />

Opposed to [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]] and [[syndicalism]], Salazar's rule was [[conservative]] and [[nationalist]] in nature. Salazar distanced himself from fascism and Nazism, which he criticized as a "pagan [[Caesarism]]" that recognized neither legal, religious nor moral limits.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=68}} Unlike [[Mussolini]] or [[Hitler]], throughout his life Salazar avoided populist rhetoric.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=68}} Salazar was generally opposed to the concept of political parties when, in 1930, he created the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]]. Salazar described and promoted the party as a "non-party",{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=43}} and announced that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=43}} Salazar promoted [[Catholicism]], but argued that the role of the Church was social, not political, and negotiated the [[Concordat of 1940]] that kept the church at arm's length. One of the mottos of the Salazar regime was {{lang|pt|Deus, Pátria e Família}} (meaning "God, Fatherland and Family") but he never turned Portugal into a [[confessional state]].{{sfn|Gallagher|1983|p=60}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=64}}

With the {{lang|pt|Estado Novo}} enabling him to exercise vast political powers, Salazar used censorship and the secret police to quell opposition, especially any that related to the [[communist movement]]. He supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and played a key role in keeping Portugal and Spain neutral during World War II while still providing aid and assistance to the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]].<ref>Winston Churchill, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1943/oct/12/agreement-with-portugal 12 October 1943 Statement in the House of Commons]</ref>{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=123}}{{sfn|Rendel|1957|p=37}} Despite being a [[European interwar dictatorships|dictatorship]], Portugal under his rule took part in the founding of some international organizations. Portugal was one of the 12 founding members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) in 1949, joined the [[European Payments Union]] in 1950 and was one of the founding members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1960, and a founding member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in 1961. Under his rule, Portugal also joined the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in 1961 and began the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. The doctrine of [[pluricontinentalism]] was the basis of his territorial policy, a conception of the [[Portuguese Empire]] as a unified state that spanned multiple continents.

The {{lang|pt|Estado Novo}} collapsed during the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, four years after Salazar's death. Evaluations of his regime have varied, with supporters praising some of its outcomes and critics denouncing other outcomes and its methods. However, there is a general consensus that Salazar was one of the most influential figures in Portuguese history. In recent decades, "new sources and methods are being employed by Portuguese historians in an attempt to come to grips with the dictatorship which lasted 48 years."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filipe Ribeiro De Meneses |title=Review: The Origins and Nature of Authoritarian Rule in Portugal, 1919–1945 |journal=Contemporary European History |year=2002 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=153–163 |doi=10.1017/S096077730200108X |jstor=20081821 |s2cid=162411841 |url=http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/11494/1/FRDM_Origins_2002.pdf }}</ref>

== Background ==

=== Family ===
[[File:Birthplace Salazar.jpg|thumb|left|The birthplace of Salazar]]
Salazar was born in Vimieiro, near [[Santa Comba Dão]] ([[Viseu District]]), to a family of modest income on 28 April 1889.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=10–11}} His father, a small landowner, had started as an agricultural labourer and became the manager for the Perestrelos, a family of rural landowners of the region of [[Santa Comba Dão]] who possessed lands and other assets scattered between [[Viseu]] and [[Coimbra]].{{sfn |Meneses|2009|p=12}} He was the only male child of two fifth cousins, António de Oliveira (1839–1932) and his wife Maria do Resgate Salazar (1845–1926).{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=10–11}} His four older sisters were Maria do Resgate Salazar de Oliveira, an elementary school teacher; Elisa Salazar de Oliveira; Maria Leopoldina Salazar de Oliveira; and Laura Salazar de Oliveira, who in 1887 married Abel Pais de Sousa, brother of Mário Pais de Sousa, who served as Salazar's Interior Minister.

=== Education ===
Salazar attended the primary school in his small village and later went to another primary school in [[Viseu]]. At age 11, he won a free place at Viseu's [[seminary]], where he studied for eight years, from 1900 to 1908.{{sfn|Kay|1970| p=11}} Salazar considered becoming a [[priest]], but like many who entered the seminary very young, he decided not to proceed to the priesthood after receiving holy orders.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=11}} He went to [[Coimbra]] in 1910 during the first years of the [[Portuguese First Republic]] to study law at the [[University of Coimbra]].{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=12}} During these student years in Coimbra, he developed a particular interest in finance and graduated in law with distinction, specialising in finance and economic policy. He graduated in 1914, with 19 points out of 20,{{sfn|Kay|1970| p=24}} and in the meantime, became an [[assistant professor]] of [[economic policy]] at the Law School. In 1917, he assumed the chairs of economic policy and finance at the University by appointment of the professor [[José Alberto dos Reis]]. In the following year, Salazar was awarded his [[doctorate]].{{sfn|Kay|1970| p=24}}

== Politics and ''Estado Novo'' ==

=== Background ===
{{further|First Portuguese Republic}}
Salazar was twenty-one years old at the time of the revolution of 5 October 1910, which overthrew the Portuguese monarchy and instituted the First Portuguese Republic. The political institutions of the First Republic lasted until 1926, when it was replaced by a military dictatorship. This was first known as the "Ditadura Militar" (Military Dictatorship) and then, from 1928, as the "[[Ditadura Nacional]]" (National Dictatorship).

The era of the First Republic has been described as one of "continual anarchy, government corruption, rioting and pillage, assassinations, arbitrary imprisonment and religious persecution".{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=26}} It witnessed the inauguration of eight presidents, 44 cabinet re-organisations and 21 revolutions.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=46}}{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=26}} The first government of the Republic lasted less than 10 weeks and the longest-ruling government lasted little over a year. Revolution in Portugal became a byword in Europe. The cost of living increased twenty-fivefold, while the currency fell to a {{frac|1|33}} part of its gold value. Portugal's public finances entered a critical phase, having been under imminent threat of default since at least the 1890s.<ref name="LIFE">{{cite news |date=29 July 1940|title=Portugal: The War Has Made It Europe's Front Door|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65|newspaper=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |access-date=30 April 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Derrick|1938| p=39}} The gaps between the rich and the poor continued to widen. The regime led Portugal to enter World War I in 1916, a move that only aggravated the perilous state of affairs in the country. Concurrently, the Catholic Church was hounded by the anti-clerical [[Freemasonry in Portugal|Freemasons]] of the Republic and political assassination and terrorism became commonplace. Between 1920 and 1925, according to official police figures, 325 bombs burst in the streets of Lisbon.{{sfn|Derrick|1938|pp=38–44}} The British diplomat [[George William Rendel|Sir George Rendel]] said that he could not describe the "political background as anything but deplorable... very different from the orderly, prosperous and well-managed country that it later became under the government of Senhor Salazar".{{sfn|Rendel|1957|p=37}} Salazar would keep in mind the political chaos of this time when he later ruled Portugal.

Public discontent led to the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]], which was welcomed by most civilian classes.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|pp=47, 92}} At the time, the prevailing view in Portugal was that political parties were elements of division and that parliamentarianism was in crisis. This led to general support, or at least tolerance, of an authoritarian regime.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=81}} The new Portuguese anti-parliamentarism was a reaction to previous experience with the system. Liberalism and Parliamentarism may have worked in Great Britain and the United States, but the Portuguese argued that liberalism was inappropriate in their nation and culture.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=82}}

=== Early path ===
As a young man, Salazar's involvement in politics stemmed from his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] views, which were aroused by the new anti-clerical stance of the First Republic. He became a member of the non-politically affiliated Catholic movement ''[[Centro Académico de Democracia Cristã]]'' (Academic Centre for Christian Democracy).{{sfn |Meneses|2009|p=14}} Salazar rejected the monarchists because he felt that they were opposed to the social doctrines espoused by [[Pope Leo XIII]] to which he was very sympathetic. He was a frequent contributor to journals concerned with social studies, especially the weekly ''O Imparcial'', which was directed by his friend (and later Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon) [[Manuel Gonçalves Cerejeira]].{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=23}} Local press described him as "one of the most powerful minds of the new generation."{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=24}}

In 1921, Salazar was persuaded to stand as a candidate for election to parliament, though he did so reluctantly. He appeared once in the chamber and never returned, struck by the disorder he witnessed and a feeling of futility. Salazar was convinced that liberal individualism had led to fragmentation of society and a perversion of the democratic process.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=32}}

[[File:Desfile de tropas 28 de Maio 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Military procession of General Gomes da Costa and his troops after the 28 May 1926 ''coup d'état''.]]
After the ''coup d'état'' of 28 May 1926, Salazar briefly joined the government of [[José Mendes Cabeçadas]] as [[Minister of Finance]]. On 11 June, a small group of officers drove from Lisbon to Santa Comba Dão to persuade him to be Minister of Finance. Salazar spent five days in Lisbon. The conditions he proposed to control spending were refused, he quickly resigned, and in two hours he was on a train back to Coimbra University, explaining that because of the frequent disputes and general disorder in the government, he could not do his work properly.{{sfn|Kay|1970| p=38}}

Portugal's overriding problem in 1926 was its enormous public debt, much of which was owed to foreign entities. Several times between 1926 and 1928, Salazar turned down appointment to the finance ministry. He pleaded ill-health, devotion to his aged parents and a preference for the academic cloisters. In 1927, under the ministry of [[João José Sinel de Cordes|Sinel de Cordes]], the public deficit kept on growing. The government tried to obtain loans from [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]], but the conditions were considered unacceptable. With Portugal under the threat of an imminent financial collapse, Salazar finally agreed to become its 81st Finance Minister on 26 April 1928 after the republican and Freemason [[Óscar Carmona]] was elected president. However, before accepting the position, he personally secured from Carmona a categorical assurance that as finance minister he would have a free hand to veto expenditure in all government departments, not just his own. Salazar was the financial czar virtually from the day he took office.

Within one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilised Portugal's currency. Restoring order to the national accounts, enforcing austerity and red-penciling waste, Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses, an unparalleled novelty in Portugal.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=94}}

In July 1929, Salazar again presented his resignation. His friend Mário de Figueiredo, Minister of Justice, passed new legislation that facilitated the organisation of religious processions. The new law outraged the republicans, triggered a cabinet crisis, and Figueiredo threatened to resign. Salazar advised Figueiredo against resigning, but told his friend he would join him in his decision. Figueiredo did resign, and Salazar – at that time hospitalised due to a broken leg – followed suit on 3 July. Carmona went personally to the hospital on the 4th and asked Salazar to change his mind. Prime Minister [[José Vicente de Freitas]], who took issue with Carmona's policies, left the cabinet. Salazar remained in the cabinet as Minister of Finance, but with additional powers.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=64}}

Salazar stayed on as finance minister while military prime ministers came and went. From his first successful year in office, he gradually came to embody the financial and political solution to the turmoil of the military dictatorship, which had not produced a clear leader. Finally, on 5 July 1932, President Carmona appointed Salazar as the 100th prime minister of Portugal, after which he began to operate closer to the mainstream of political sentiment in his country.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=80}} The authoritarian government consisted of a right-wing coalition, and he was able to co-opt the moderates of each political current with the aid of censorship and repression directed against those outside of it. Those perceived to be genuine fascists were jailed or exiled.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=79}} Conservative Catholics were Salazar's earliest and most loyal supporters, whereas conservative republicans who could not be co-opted became his most dangerous opponents during the early period. They attempted several coups, but never presented a united front, consequently these attempts were easily repressed. Never a true monarchist, Salazar nevertheless gained most of the monarchists' support, as [[Manuel II of Portugal]], the exiled and deposed last king of Portugal, always endorsed Salazar. Later, in 1932, it was due to Salazar's actions that the deposed king was given a state funeral. The [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|National Syndicalists]] were torn between supporting the regime and denouncing it as bourgeois. They were granted enough symbolic concessions for Salazar to win over the moderates, but the rest were repressed by the political police. They were silenced shortly after 1933 as Salazar attempted to prevent the rise of [[National Socialism]] in Portugal.

Salazar's rise to power was facilitated by the public image he cultivated as an honest and effective finance minister, the strong support of President Carmona and shrewd political positioning.

=== Formation of the ''Estado Novo'' ===

Salazar based his political philosophy on a close interpretation of the [[Catholic social doctrine]], much like the contemporary regime of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in Austria.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=162}} The economic system, known as [[corporatism]], was based on similar interpretations of the papal encyclicals ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' ([[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]], 1891){{sfn|Kay|1970|p=63}} and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' ([[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], 1931),{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=63}} which were meant to prevent class struggle and transform economic concerns secondary to social values. ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' argued that labor associations were part of the natural order, like the family. The right of men to organise into trade unions and to engage in labor activities was thus inherent and could not be denied by employers or the state. ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' provided the blue print for the erection of the corporatist system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=97}}

A new constitution was drafted by a group of lawyers, businessmen, clerics and university professors, with Salazar the leading spirit and [[Marcelo Caetano]] also playing a major role.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=98}} The constitution created the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] ("New State"), in theory a corporatist state representing interest groups rather than individuals. He wanted a system in which the people would be represented through corporations, rather than through divisive parties, and where national interest was given priority over sectional claims. Salazar thought that the party system had failed irrevocably in Portugal.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=53}}

Unlike Mussolini or [[Hitler]], Salazar never had the intention to create a party-state. Salazar was against the whole-party concept and in 1930 he created the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] a single-party, which he marketed as a "non-party", {{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=43}} announcing that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=43}} The National Union became an ancillary body, not a source of political power.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=43}} The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it, the goal was to strengthen and preserve traditional values rather than to induce a new social order. At no stage did it appear that Salazar wished it to fulfill the central role the Fascist Party had acquired in Mussolini's Italy, in fact it was meant to be a platform of conservatism, not a revolutionary vanguard.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=44}} Ministers, diplomats and civil servants were never compelled to join the National Union.{{sfn|Gallagher|1990|p=167}}

The legislature, called the National Assembly, was restricted to members of the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]]. It could initiate legislation, but only concerning matters that did not require government expenditures.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}} The parallel [[Corporative Chamber]] included representatives of municipalities, religious, cultural and professional groups and of the official workers' syndicates that replaced free trade unions.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}}

According to Howard Wiarda, "the men who came to power in the Estado Novo were genuinely concerned with the poverty and backwardness of their nation, divorcing themselves from Anglo-American political influences while developing a new indigenous political model and alleviating the miserable living conditions of both rural and urban poor.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=88}}

The new constitution introduced by Salazar established an anti-parliamentarian and authoritarian government that would last until 1974. The president was to be elected by popular vote for a period of seven years. On paper, the new document vested sweeping, almost dictatorial powers in the hands of the president, including the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}} The president was elevated to a position of preeminence as the "balance wheel", the defender and ultimate arbiter of national politics.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}} {{efn|According to a dispatch from the British Embassy in Lisbon of that time: "Generally speaking, this novel constitution is receiving the marked approval which it deserves. It has a certain Fascist quality in its theory of 'corporations', which is a reversion to medieval from the 18th-century doctrines. But this quality, unsuited to our Anglo-Saxon tradition, is not out of place in a country which has hitherto founded its democracy on a French philosophy and found it unsuited to the national temperament". The British Embassy also pointed out that Portugal's illiteracy made elections difficult and illusory.<ref>*{{cite web|title=British Embassy in Lisbon despatch on draft constitution|url=http://www.cphrc.org/index.php/documents/docnesta/203-1932-07-09-british-embassy-in-lisbon-despatch-on-draft-constitution|website=Contemporary Portuguese History Online|publisher=The Contemporary Portuguese History Research Centre|access-date=26 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518054411/http://www.cphrc.org/index.php/documents/docnesta/203-1932-07-09-british-embassy-in-lisbon-despatch-on-draft-constitution|archive-date=18 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>}} President Carmona, however, had allowed Salazar more or less a free hand since appointing him prime minister and continued to do so; Carmona and his successors would largely be figureheads as he wielded the true power. Wiarda argues that Salazar achieved his position of power not just because of constitutional stipulations, but also because of his character: domineering, absolutist, ambitious, hardworking and intellectually brilliant.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=101}}

The corporatist constitution was approved in the national [[1933 Portuguese constitutional referendum|Portuguese constitutional referendum]] of 19 March 1933.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}}{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} A draft had been published one year before, and the public was invited to state any objections in the press.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} These tended to stay in the realm of generalities and only a handful of people, less than 6,000, voted against the new constitution. {{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} The new constitution was approved with 99.5% of the vote, but with 488,840 abstentions{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} (in a registered electorate of 1,330,258) counting as "yes".<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & Stöver, P.

[[File:União Nacional Flag.svg|thumb|right|200px|Putative flag of the National Union, to which Salazar belonged.]]
The year 1933 marked a watershed in Portuguese history. Under Salazar's supervision, [[Pedro Teotónio Pereira|Teotónio Pereira]], the Sub-Secretary of State of Corporations and Social Welfare, reporting directly to Salazar, enacted extensive legislation that shaped the corporatist structure and initiated a comprehensive social welfare system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=109}} This system was equally anti-capitalist and anti-socialist. The corporatisation of the working class was accompanied by strict legislation regulating business. Workers' organisations were subordinated to state control, but granted a legitimacy that they had never before enjoyed and were made beneficiaries of a variety of new social programs.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=132}} Nevertheless, it is important to note that even in the enthusiastic early years, corporatist agencies were not at the centre of power and therefore corporatism was not the true base of the whole system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=155}}

In 1934, Salazar exiled [[Francisco Rolão Preto]] as a part of a purge of the leadership of the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Portuguese National Syndicalists]], also known as the ''camisas azuis'' ("Blue Shirts"). Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as "inspired by certain foreign models" (meaning German [[Nazism]]) and condemned their "exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the ''Estado Novo''. Salazar's own party, the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]], was formed as a subservient umbrella organisation to support the regime itself, and therefore did not have its own philosophy. At the time, according to Kay, many European countries feared what he described as "the destructive potential of communism". Salazar not only forbade [[Marxism|Marxist]] parties, but also revolutionary fascist-syndicalist parties. One overriding criticism of his regime is that stability was bought and maintained at the expense of suppression of human rights and liberties.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}}

The corporatist state had some similarities to Italian fascism and the original ''[[fascist corporatism|corporativismo]]'' of [[Benito Mussolini]], but considerable differences in its moral approach to governing.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=50–51}} Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his [[Labour Charter of 1927]],{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=98}} he distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] political system that recognised neither legal nor moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. Just before World War II, Salazar made this declaration: {{blockquote|"We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimise, or break up the family. We are against class warfare, irreligion and disloyalty to one's country; against serfdom, a materialistic conception of life, and might over right."{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=68}}}} Scholars such as [[Stanley G. Payne]], [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher]], [[Juan José Linz]], [[António Costa Pinto]], [[Roger Griffin]], [[Robert Paxton]] and Howard J. Wiarda, prefer to consider the Portuguese [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] as conservative authoritarian rather than fascist. On the other hand, some Portuguese scholars like [[Fernando Rosas]], Manuel Villaverde Cabral, Manuel de Lucena and Manuel Loff think that the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] should be considered fascist.<ref name="Rosas">{{cite book|author1=Fernando Rosas|title=Salazar e os Fascismos: Ensaio Breve de História Comparada|year=2019|publisher=Edições Tinta-da-China|lang=pt}}</ref> [[Stanley G.

Historian [[Robert Paxton]] observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. He wrote, "In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization." He went on to observe that Salazar "crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization."<ref>Robert O. Paxton, "The five stages of fascism." ''Journal of Modern History'' 70.1 (1998): 1–23, quotes  at pp 3, 17.</ref>

=== Securing the regime ===
Salazar relied on [[secret police]] to enforce the policies he wished to implement. The ''[[PVDE|Polícia de Vigilância e de Defesa do Estado]] (PVDE)'' ("State Defence and Surveillance Police") was established in 1933. It was replaced in 1945 by the remodeled ''Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado (PIDE)'' ("International and State Defence Police"), which lasted until 1969 (and from that year to 1974 under [[Marcelo Caetano]], it was the ''Direcção Geral de Segurança (DGS)'' ("General Security Directorate")). The secret police existed not only to protect national security in a modern sense, but also to suppress the regime's political opponents, especially those associated with the international [[communist]] movement or the [[Soviet Union]], which was seen by the regime as a menace to Portugal.

==== Spanish Civil War ====
The [[Spanish Civil War]], which began in July 1936, was the ostensible reason for the radicalisation of the regime. Internally, the regime had to face a monarchist revolt in 1935, a threatened leftist coup in 1936 and several bombs and conspiracies in 1936 and 1937, including an attempt to assassinate Salazar in 1937. At the same time, Spanish [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] agents were active in Lisbon and Spanish troops were deployed on Portugal's vulnerable border, severely threatening Portuguese sovereignty.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=160}}

At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Salazar took up additional portfolios as minister of war and minister of foreign affairs, while retaining direction of the ministry of finance, thus concentrating even more power in his hands.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=160}}

Salazar supported [[Francisco Franco]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] in their war against the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Second Republic forces]], as well as the anarchists and the communists. The Nationalists lacked access to seaports early on, so Salazar's Portugal helped them receive armaments shipments from abroad, including [[military logistics|ordnance]] when certain Nationalist forces virtually ran out of ammunition. Consequently, the Nationalists called Lisbon "the port of Castile".<ref>Beevor, Antony. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' p. 97. {{ISBN|0911745114}}</ref> Later, Franco spoke of Salazar in glowing terms in an interview in the ''Le Figaro'' newspaper: {{blockquote|"The most complete statesman, the one most worthy of respect, that I have known is Salazar. I regard him as an extraordinary personality for his intelligence, his political sense and his humility. His only defect is probably his modesty."{{sfn| Lochery|2011|p=19}}}} On 8 September 1936, a naval revolt took place in Lisbon. The crews of two naval Portuguese vessels, The [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque]] and the [[Portuguese destroyer Dão|Dão]], mutinied. The sailors, who were affiliated with the Communist Party, confined their officers and attempted to sail the ships out of Lisbon to join the Spanish Republican forces fighting in Spain. Salazar ordered the ships to be destroyed by gunfire.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=160}}{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=200}} The following day, loyalty oaths became mandatory for all members of the civil service and censorship was severely tightened. Every government functionary was forced to declare that he repudiated communism. This crusade aimed to root out not only communists but also the democratic opposition.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=160}} The convicted sailors from the 1936 naval revolt were the first to be sent to the [[Tarrafal camp|Tarrafal prison camp]] established by Salazar in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] to house political prisoners. It was labeled the "slow death camp" where dozens of political prisoners (mostly communists, but also adherents of other ideologies), were imprisoned under inhumane unhealthy conditions in exceedingly hot weather and died.<ref>[http://www.ces.uc.pt/eventos/pdfs/Apresenta_FILME.pdf Tarrafal: Memórias do Campo da Morte Lenta/ by Diana Andringa]</ref>

In January 1938, Salazar appointed [[Pedro Teotónio Pereira]] as special liaison of the Portuguese government to Franco's government, where he achieved great prestige and influence.{{sfn|Hoare|1946|p=45}} In April 1938, Pereira officially become a full-rank Portuguese ambassador to Spain, and he remained in this post throughout World War II.{{sfn|Kay|1970| p=117}}

Just a few days before the end of the Spanish Civil War, on 17 March 1939, Portugal and Spain signed the [[Iberian Pact]], a non-aggression treaty that marked the beginning of a new phase in Iberian relations. Meetings between Franco and Salazar played a fundamental role in this new political arrangement.<ref>Maria Inácia Rezola, "The Franco–Salazar Meetings: Foreign policy and Iberian relations during the Dictatorships (1942–1963)" ''E-Journal of Portuguese History'' (2008) 6#2 pp. 1–11. [http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/html/issue12/html/mrezola.html online]</ref> The pact proved to be a decisive instrument in keeping the Iberian Peninsula out of Hitler's continental system.{{sfn|Hoare|1946|p=58}}

==== Assassination attempt ====
The decisive conservatism of the regime naturally drew opposition. Emídio Santana, founder of the ''Sindicato Nacional dos Metalúrgicos'' ("Metallurgists National Union") and an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] who was involved in clandestine activities against the dictatorship, attempted to assassinate Salazar on 4 July 1937. Salazar was on his way to Mass at a private chapel in a friend's house on Barbosa du Bocage Avenue in Lisbon. As he stepped out of his [[Buick Limited#Buick Series 90 Limited (1936-1942)|Buick]] limousine, a bomb hidden in an iron case exploded only {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} away. The blast left Salazar untouched, but his chauffeur was rendered deaf. A year later, the bishops of the country argued in a collective letter that it was an "act of God" that had preserved Salazar's life. The official car was replaced by an armoured [[Chrysler Imperial]].<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [[Agência Lusa]], [http://www.destak.pt/artigos.php?art=1842 Único atentado contra o ditador Oliveira Salazar foi há 70 anos], in [[Destak.pt]]</ref> Sought by the ''PIDE'', Emídio Santana fled to Britain, where he was arrested by British police and returned to Portugal. He was then sentenced to 16 years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitarq.dgarq.gov.pt/details?id=4289177|title=''Emídio Santana''|publisher=Arquivo Nacional Torre do Tombo|access-date=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017020927/http://digitarq.dgarq.gov.pt/details?id=4289177|archive-date=17 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== World War II ===
{{further|Portugal in World War II}}
Salazar had experienced the social turmoil caused by [[World War I]], in which Portugal participated during the period of the First Republic; [[World War II]] followed its course while he was in power. Salazar was widely praised{{Fact|date=January 2021}} for keeping Portugal neutral during the Second World War. From the war's very beginning in 1939, Salazar was convinced that Britain would suffer injury, but remain undefeated, that the United States would step into the conflict and that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] would win. The American journalist Henry J. Taylor commented, "I found not another continental European leader who then agreed with him".<ref>Henry Jay Taylor, ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', 2 October 1968, as cited in {{harvnb|Kay|1970|p=123}}</ref>

==== Neutrality ====
In 1934, several years before the war began, Salazar clarified in an official speech that Portuguese nationalism did not include "the pagan ideal and anti-human to deify a race or empire",<ref>António de Oliveira Salazar, "O Espírito da Revolução", speech at the Salazar's official visit to Porto in 28 April 1934, in  Discursos e Notas Políticas, Vol. 1, pp. 324–326.</ref> and again, in 1937, Salazar published a book wherein he criticised the [[Nuremberg Laws]] passed in 1935 in Germany, considering it regrettable that German nationalism was "wrinkled by racial characteristics so well marked," which had imposed "the legal point of view, the distinction between citizens and the subject – and this at the risk of dangerous consequences."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Salazar|first1=António de Oliveira|title=Como se Levanta um Estado|date=1977|publisher=Golden Books|location=Lisbon|pages=69}}</ref> Salazar thought regarding World War II, "a German victory spelt disaster for the rule of law and for peripheral, agricultural, countries such as Portugal."<ref>{{cite book|author=Filipe Ribeiro De Meneses|title=Salazar: A Political Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EtmJAwAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Enigma Books|page=223|isbn=978-1-929631-90-2}}</ref> Salazar's dislike of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime in Germany]] and its imperial ambitions was tempered only by his view of the German Reich as a bastion against the spread of communism rather than an allied nation. He had favoured the Spanish nationalist cause out of fear of a communist invasion of Portugal, yet he was uneasy at the prospect of a Spanish government bolstered by strong ties with the [[Axis powers]].{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=121–122}} 

Salazar's policy of neutrality for Portugal in World War II thus included a strategic component. The country still held overseas territories that Portugal could not defend from military attack.  Siding with the Axis would have brought Portugal into conflict with Britain, likely resulting in the loss of its colonies, while siding with the Allies risked the security of the home country on the mainland. A conflict with Britain would have been economically costly, as Portugal relied on British transports of goods from Portuguese colonies to the mainland.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Golson|first=Eric|date=2020|title=The Allied Neutral?

On 1 September 1939, at the start of World War II, the Portuguese Government announced that the 600-year-old [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] remained intact, but that since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, Portugal was free to remain neutral in the war and would do so. In an [[aide-mémoire]] of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding.{{sfn|Leite|1998|pp=185–199}}

==== Responses ====
British strategists regarded Portuguese non-belligerency as "essential to keep Spain from entering the war on the side of the Axis".{{sfn|Leite|1998|pp=185–199}} Britain recognised Salazar's important role on 15 May 1940, when Douglas Veale, Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed him that the University's [[Hebdomadal Council]] had "unanimously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you [Salazar] to accept the Honorary Degree of [[Doctor of Civil Law]]".{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=240}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/oxford-in-portugal/query/lisbon |title=Oxford In Portugal 1941 |date=1941|publisher=British Pathé |access-date=7 June 2014}}</ref> In September 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] wrote to Salazar to congratulate him for his policy of keeping Portugal out of the war, avowing that "as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question."{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=240}} [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], the British Ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping Iberia neutral during World War II, and lauded him for it. Hoare averred that "Salazar detested Hitler and all his works" and that his corporative state was fundamentally different from a Nazi or fascist state, with Salazar never leaving a doubt of his desire for a Nazi defeat.{{efn|name=fn-full-Hoare|Hoare asserted that, in his 30 years of political life, he had met most of the leading statesmen of Europe, and regarded Salazar very highly among those. Salazar was to him a learned and impressive thinker, part professor, part priest, part recluse of unshakable beliefs in the principles of European civilisation. He regarded him as ascetic, concentrated on serving his country, with an encyclopedic knowledge of Europe, and indifferent to ostentation, luxury or personal gain. Hoare strongly believed in Salazar as "being a man of one idea – the good of his country – not wanting to endanger the work of national regeneration to which he had devoted the whole of his public life."{{sfn|Hoare|1946|pp=124–125}}}} Historian [[Carlton J. H. Hayes|Carlton Hayes]], a pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism, was the American Ambassador in Spain during the war. He met Salazar in person and also praised him, expressing a similar opinion to Hoare's in his book ''Wartime Mission in Spain''.{{efn|name=fn-full-Hayes|Hayes wrote of Salazar, claiming he "didn't look like a regular dictator. Rather, he appeared a modest, quiet, and highly intelligent gentleman and scholar (…) literally dragged from a professorial chair of political economy in the venerable University of Coimbra a dozen years previously in order to straighten out Portugal's finances, and that his almost miraculous success in this respect had led to the thrusting upon him of other major functions, including those of Foreign Minister and constitution-maker."{{sfn|Hayes|1945|p=36}}{{sfn| Hayes|1945|p=119}}}} In November 1943, the British Ambassador in Lisbon, [[Ronald Hugh Campbell|Sir Ronald Campbell]], wrote, paraphrasing Salazar, that "strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits accruing from Portugal's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in our favour Spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If this had happened the Peninsula would have been occupied and then North Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the Axis."<ref>Leite, 'Document 2: Telegram From Sir Ronald Campbell'</ref>[[File:Lockheed Hudson - Royal Air Force Coastal Command- No. 247 Group Operations in the Azores, 1943-1945. CA37.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Air Force Coastal Command in the Azores.]]
Sir Ronald Campbell saw Salazar as fundamentally loyal to the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. When in May 1943, in the [[Washington Conference (1943)|Third Washington Conference, codenamed Trident]], the conferees agreed on the occupation of the Azores ([[Operation Alacrity]]){{sfn |Meneses|2009|p=278}} <ref>{{cite web|title=The Papers of George Catlett Marshall, ed.

He recalled that at the outset of the war, Salazar had remained neutral with British approval and stated that "he [Salazar] would answer the call if it were made on grounds of dire necessity". The British Ambassador was correct, and when in August 1943 the British requested military base facilities in the Azores, invoking the alliance, Salazar responded favourably and quickly:{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=123}} Portugal allowed these bases, letting the British use the Azorean ports of Horta (on the island of Faial) and Ponta Delgada (on the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]]), and the airfields of [[Lajes Field]] (on Terceira Island) and Santana Field (on São Miguel Island).{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=123}} From November 1943, when the British gained use of the Azores, to June 1945, 8,689 US aircraft departed from Lajes, including 1,200 B-17 and B-24 bomber aircraft ferried across the Atlantic. Cargo aircraft carried vital personnel and equipment to North Africa, to the United Kingdom and – after the Allies gained a foothold in Western Europe – to [[Orly Airport|Orly Field]] near Paris. Flights returning from Europe carried wounded servicemen. Medical personnel at Lajes handled approximately 30,000 air evacuations ''en route'' to the United States for medical care and rehabilitation. Use of Lajes Field reduced flying time between Brazil and West Africa from 70 hours to 40, a considerable reduction that enabled aircraft to make almost twice as many crossings, clearly demonstrating the geographic value of the Azores during the war. The British diplomat [[George William Rendel|Sir George Rendell]] stated that the Portuguese Republican Government of [[Bernardino Machado]] was "far more difficult to deal with as an ally during the First War than the infinitely better Government of Salazar was as a neutral in the Second."{{sfn|Rendel|1957|p=37}}

==== Refugees ====
The principal reason for the neutrality of Portugal in World War II was strategic, and within the compass of the overall objectives of the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]]. This modest, but complex role allowed Portugal to rescue a large number of war refugees.{{sfn|Leite|1998|pp=185–199}}

Portugal's official nationalism was not grounded in race or biology. Salazar argued that Portuguese nationalism did not glorify a single race because such a notion was pagan and anti-human. In 1937, he published a book entitled ''Como se Levanta um Estado'' (''How to Raise a State''), in which he criticised the philosophical ideals behind Nazi Germany's [[Nuremberg laws]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Salazar, António de Oliveira – 'Como se Levanta um Estado', {{ISBN|978-9899537705}}</ref> In 1938, he sent a telegram to the Portuguese Embassy in [[Berlin]], ordering that it should be made clear to the German Reich that Portuguese law did not allow any distinction based on race, and that therefore, [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jewish]] citizens could not be discriminated against.<ref>Dez anos de Política Externa, Vol. 1, p. 137.

On 26 June 1940, four days after France's capitulation to Germany, Salazar authorised the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ([[HIAS]]-HICEM) in Paris to transfer its main office to Lisbon. According to the Lisbon Jewish community, Salazar held [[Moisés Bensabat Amzalak]], the leader of the Lisbon Jewish community, in high esteem, and allowed Amzalak to play an important role in getting Salazar's permission for the transfer.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cilisboa.org/sections/tikva_04/bu_4_35_hist.htm |title= Moses Bensabat Amzalak |last1= Levy |first1= Samuel |language= pt |publisher= Israeli Community in Lisbon |access-date= 6 August 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203440/http://www.cilisboa.org/sections/tikva_04/bu_4_35_hist.htm |archive-date= 23 September 2015 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= [[Israel Goldstein|Goldstein]]| first=Israel |year=1984 |title=My World as a Jew: The Memoirs of Israel Goldstein|publisher= Associated University Presses |page=413 |isbn=978-0-8453-4780-5}}</ref>

The Portuguese Ambassador in Budapest, [[Carlos Sampaio Garrido]], helped large numbers of Hungarian Jews who came to the Portuguese diplomatic mission in 1944 seeking Portuguese protection. On 28 April 1944, the Gestapo raided the ambassador's home and arrested his guests. The ambassador, who physically resisted the police, was also arrested, but managed to have his guests released on the grounds of [[extraterritoriality]] of diplomatic legations.{{sfn|Milgram|2011|p=264}} In 2010, Garrido was recognised as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by Yad Vashem.

Following the German occupation of Hungary, in response to a request from Britain and the United States who wanted neutral countries to downgrade their diplomatic presence in Hungary, Salazar recalled Garrido and left the chargé d'affaires, [[Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho]] in his place. Branquinho, in close coordination with Salazar, issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families and risked his life renting houses and apartments to shelter and protect the refugees from deportation and murder. Branquinho saved an estimated 1,000 Hungarian Jews. Branquinho's case differs from that of Sousa Mendes in at least three respects. He was deliberately setting out to save Jews, he had the full backing of the authorities in Lisbon, and was in the heart of a Nazi regime, in 1944, when the [[Holocaust]] was at its peak, while Sousa Mendes was at Bordeaux in 1940 before the Holocaust had started. Branquinho’s name has been engraved in the [[Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park|Raoul Wallenberg-memorial]] at the [[Dohány Street Synagogue]] in Budapest, but in Portugal he remains largely unknown.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=126}} Branquinho was finally recalled to Lisbon on 30 October 1944.{{sfn|Pimentel|Ninhos|2013|p=343-350}} [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]] argues that Branquinho's case has been largely overlooked, relative to  Sousa Mendes, probably owing to the fact that he was coordinating his actions with Salazar and that weakens the core argument in the Sousa Mendes legend that he was defying a tyrannical superior.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=126}} Gallagher argues that the disproportionate attention given to Sousa Mendes suggests that wartime history is in danger of being used in contemporary Portugal as a political weapon.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|p=126}} Tom Gallagher is not alone in classifying as  disproportionate the attention given to Sousa Mendes episode; the Portuguese historian Diogo Ramada Curto also thinks that "the myth of an Aristides who opposed Salazar and capable of acting individually, in isolation, is a late invention that rigorous historical analysis does not confirm."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ramada Curto |first1=Diogo |title=O desconhecido Veiga Simões |url=https://expresso.pt/cultura/2017-11-05-O-desconhecido-Veiga-Simoes |access-date=4 April 2021 |work=Jornal Expresso |date=5 November 2017 |language=pt-PT}}</ref>

Other Portuguese who deserve credit for saving Jews during the war include Professor Francisco Paula Leite Pinto and [[Moisés Bensabat Amzalak]]. A devoted Jew and a supporter of Salazar, Amzalak headed the Lisbon Jewish community for 52 years, from 1926 until 1978. In 1943, Amzalak and Leite Pinto, under Salazar's supervision, initiated a rescue mission. Francisco de Paula Leite Pinto, at that time the General Manager of the Beira Alta Railway, which operated the line from [[Figueira da Foz]] to the Spanish frontier, organized several trains that brought refugees from Berlin and other European cities to Portugal.{{sfn|Gallagher|2020|pp=124,125}} Amzalak was also able to persuade Salazar to instruct consuls in territories under Nazi occupation to validate all passports held by Jews, even though these documents were known to be far from "kosher".{{sfn|Goldstein|1984|p=68}}

Large numbers of political dissidents, including [[Abwehr]] personnel, sought refuge in Portugal after the [[20 July plot|plot of 20 July 1944]] to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Until late 1942, immigration was very restricted. In cases in which refugees were suspected to desire not simply to pass through Portugal in transit to their destination, but rather intended to remain in the country, the consulates needed to get a previous authorization from Lisbon. This was frequently the case with foreigners of indefinite or contested nationality, stateless individuals, Russians, and Jews expelled from their countries of origin.<ref name="Spared Lives">Spared Lives, The Action of Three Portuguese Diplomats in World War II – Documentary e-book edited by the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation</ref>

The number of refugees who escaped through Portugal during the war has been estimated to range from a few hundred thousand to one million, large numbers considering the size of the country's population of about 6 million at that time.<ref>Neil Lochery estimates a high end number of one million.</ref> After the war, Portugal kept on welcoming and supporting refugees. In an operation organised by [[Caritas Portugal]] from 1947 to 1952, 5,500 Austrian children, most of them orphans, were transported by train from Vienna to Lisbon and then sent to the foster care of Portuguese families.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sobral|first=Claudia|year=2013|title=Depois da guerra, o paraíso era Portugal|trans-title=After the war the paradise was Portugal|url=http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/depois-da-guerra-o-paraiso-era-portugal-1581863#/0|language=pt|newspaper=Público|location=Portugal|access-date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

Among the many refugees accepted into Portugal for political and religious asylum, [[Miklós Horthy]], the war-time leader of Hungary, who had participated alongside the Germans, was granted asylum status. In 1950, the Horthy family managed to find a home in Portugal, thanks to [[Miklós Horthy Jr.|Miklós Jr.'s]] contacts with Portuguese diplomats in Switzerland. Horthy and members of his family were relocated to the seaside town of [[Estoril]], in the house address Rua Dom Afonso Henriques, 1937 2765.573 Estoril.

==== Maintaining the regime ====
In October 1945, Salazar announced a liberalisation program designed to restore civil rights that had been suppressed during the Spanish Civil War and World War II in hopes of improving the image of his regime in Western circles. The measures included parliamentary elections, a general political amnesty, restoration of freedom of the press, curtailment of legal repression and a commitment to introduce the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. The regime started to organise itself around a broad coalition, the [[Movement of Democratic Unity]] (MUD), which ranged from ultra-Catholics and fringe elements of the extreme right to the [[Portuguese Communist Party]]. Initially, the MUD was controlled by the moderate opposition, but soon became strongly influenced by the Communist Party, which controlled [[Juvenile MUD|its youth wing]]. In its leadership were several communists, among them [[Octávio Pato]], [[Salgado Zenha]], [[Mário Soares]] (later President), [[Júlio Pomar]] and [[Mário Sacramento]].<ref>Rosas, Fernando (dir.) (1995). ''Revista História'' (History Magazine) – Number 8 (New Series)</ref> This influence led the MUD to be outlawed by the government in 1948 after several waves of suppression. Restrictions that had been temporarily lifted were then gradually reinstated.

[[File:PIDE Badge.png|thumb|right|The ''PIDE'''s badge.]]
As the [[Cold War]] started, Salazar's ''Estado Novo'' remained rigidly authoritarian. Salazar had been able to hold onto power by virtue of the public's recollection of the chaos that had characterised Portuguese life before 1926. However, by the 1950s, a new generation emerged that had no collective memory of this instability. The clearest sign of this came in the [[1958 Portuguese presidential election|Portuguese presidential election of 1958]]. Most neutral observers believed that the candidate of the democratic opposition, [[Humberto Delgado]], would have defeated the candidate of the Salazar regime, [[Américo Tomás]], had the election been conducted fairly. Delgado was well aware that the president's power to sack the prime minister was theoretically the only check on Salazar's power, and stated that if elected, his first policy would be to dismiss Salazar.{{fact|date=August 2021}} Delgado was able to rally support from a wide range of opposition viewpoints. Among his supporters were some controversial figures, namely the press campaign manager [[Francisco Rolão Preto]], a former Nazi sympathiser and former leader of the Blue Shirts, arrested and exiled by the regime in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[António Costa Pinto|Costa Pinto]] |first=António |date=2000|title=The Blue Shirts – Portuguese Fascists and the New State|location= New York|publisher=Social Science Monographs, Boulder – Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-88033-982-7}}</ref> Official figures credited Delgado with one-fourth of the votes, in total approximately a million–well behind Tomás. Salazar was alarmed enough by the episode that he pushed through a constitutional amendment transferring election of the president to the two parliamentary bodies, which were both firmly under his control. Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese military and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile. Much of his banishment was spent in Brazil and later in Algeria, as a guest of [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Later, in 1965, he was lured into an ambush by the ''PIDE'' (the regime's secret police) near the border town of [[Olivenza]] and killed, alongside his Brazilian secretary Arajaryr Moreira de Campos. An official statement claimed that Delgado was shot and killed in self-defence, despite Delgado being unarmed; de Campos' body bore marks of strangulation.{{sfn |Meneses|2009|pp=584–586}} 

In 1968, Salazar suffered a [[brain hemorrhage]] when he fell in a bath.<ref name="dn.sapo.pt">[https://web.archive.org/web/20181206192616/https://www.dn.pt/arquivo/2009/interior/salazar-da-sic-caiu-na-banheira-e-nao-da-cadeira-1149435.html 'Salazar fell in a bathtub, not from a chair' (Portuguese language)]</ref> As he became incapacitated, President Tomás, after hearing from various experts, appointed [[Marcelo Caetano]] in his place with some reluctance. Despite the injury, Salazar lived for another two years. When he unexpectedly recovered lucidity, his intimates did not tell him he had been removed from power, instead allowing him to "rule" in privacy until his death in July 1970.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|pp=608–609}}

=== Colonial policies ===
During the last years of the monarchy and of the First Republic in Portugal, an attempt was made to obtain firmer control over the claimed African possessions. One reason the government dragged itself into [[World War I]] was the defence of the African empire, considered a part of the national identity.

[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|Portuguese overseas territories in Africa during the ''Estado Novo'' (1933–1974): [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] were by far the largest territories.]]
Salazar briefly served as minister of colonies before assuming the premiership, and in that capacity he prepared the Colonial Act of 1930,<ref>[http://dre.pt/pdfgratis/1930/07/15600.pdf Colonial Act, original text, in Portuguese, in ''Diário do Governo''].</ref> which centralised the administration of the overseas territories in his own system and proclaimed the need to bring indigenous peoples into western civilisation and the Portuguese nation. [[Assimilado|Assimilation]] was the main objective, except for the Atlantic colony of [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]] (which was seen as an extension of Portugal), the [[Portuguese India|Indian colonies]], and [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] (which were seen as having their own forms of "civilization"). As it had been before Salazar's tenure in the office, a clear legal distinction continued to be made between indigenous peoples and other citizens – the latter mostly Europeans, some Creole elites, and a few black Africans. A special statute was given to native communities to accommodate their tribal traditions. In theory, it established a framework that would allow natives to be gradually assimilated into Portuguese culture and citizenship, while in reality the percentage of assimilated African population never reached one percent.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=212–215}}

In 1945, Portugal still had an extensive colonial empire that encompassed [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé e Príncipe]], [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (including [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]), [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] in Africa; [[Portuguese India]] in South Asia; and [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]] in the [[Far East]]. Salazar wanted Portugal to be relevant internationally, and the country's overseas colonies made that possible.

In 1947, Captain [[Henrique Galvão]], a Portuguese parliamentarian, submitted a report disclosing the situation of forced labor and precarious health services in the Portuguese colonies of Africa. The natives, it said, were simply regarded as beasts of burden. Galvão's courageous report eventually led to his downfall, and in 1952, he was arrested for subversive activities.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=215}} Although the ''Estatuto do Indigenato'' ('Indigenous Statute') set standards for [[Indigenous peoples|indigenes]] to obtain Portuguese citizenship until it was abolished in 1961, the conditions of the native populations of the colonies were still harsh, and they suffered inferior legal status under its policies.<ref name="GuedesLopes2007">{{cite book|author1=Armando Marques Guedes|author2=María José Lopes|author3=Stephen Ellis|title=State and Traditional Law in Angola and Mozambique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cYkAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Almedina|page=60|isbn=9789724030517}}</ref><ref name="Cook2001">{{cite book|author=Bernard A.

By requiring all African men to pay a tax in Portuguese currency, the government created a situation in which a large percentage of men in any given year could only earn the specie needed to pay the tax by going to work for a colonial employer. In practice, this enabled settlers to use forced labor on a massive scale, frequently leading to horrific abuses.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=212–215}}

Following the Second World War, the colonial system was subject to growing dissatisfaction, and in the early 1950s the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]] launched a process of decolonization. [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]] and [[French colonial empire|France]] followed suit. Unlike the other European colonial powers, Salazar attempted to resist this tide and maintain the integrity of the empire.

In order to justify Portugal's colonial policies and Portugal's alleged [[civilising mission]], Salazar ended up adopting [[Gilberto Freyre]]'s theories of [[Lusotropicalism]], which maintained that the Portuguese had a special talent for adapting to environments, cultures, and the peoples who lived in the tropics in order to build harmonious multiracial societies.  Such a view has long been criticised, notably by [[C. R. Boxer|Charles R. Boxer]], a prominent historian of colonial empires.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|pp=358–359}}{{efn| For a critical look at the theory of lusotropicalism see for instance "Angola under the Portuguese: The Myth and the Reality" by Gerald J. Bender Where Bender, a Professor in the School of International Relations at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and a former member of the Board of Directors of the African Studies Association (U.S.A.) from 1979 to 1987, demolishes the theory of lusotropicalism}}

In general, the defense of the Portuguese colonial empire was consensual in Portuguese society. Most of Salazar's political opponents (with the exception of the Portuguese Communist Party) also strongly favoured colonialist policies. This was the case with João Lopes Soares (father of [[Mário Soares]]), who had been minister of colonies, [[José Norton de Matos|General Norton de Matos]], the leader of the opposition supported by [[Mário Soares]]{{efn|Norton de Matos, who had been governor-general of Angola during the First Republic, published a book in 1953 titled ''África Nossa'' (Our Africa) wherein he defended colonialist policies far more aggressive than those of Salazar and supported the idea of massive territorial occupation by Portuguese white settlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=[[José Norton de Matos|Norton de Matos]]|first=José|date=1953|title=África Nossa: O que Queremos e o que não Queremos nas Nossas Terras de África|language=pt|location=Oporto|publisher=Marânus|asin=B004PVOVDW}}</ref> }} and [[António Sérgio]], a prominent Salazar opponent.

Salazar's reluctance to travel abroad, his increasing determination not to grant independence to the [[Portuguese empire|colonies]], and his refusal to grasp the impossibility of his regime outliving him marked the final years of his tenure. "Proudly alone" was the motto of his final decade. For the Portuguese ruling regime, the overseas empire was a matter of national identity.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

[[File:MatasdorioOnzo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portuguese soldiers on patrol in Angola.]]

In the 1960s, armed revolutionary movements and scattered guerrilla activity reached Mozambique, Angola, and Portuguese Guinea. Except in Portuguese Guinea, the Portuguese army and naval forces were able to suppress most of these insurgencies effectively through a well-planned counter-insurgency campaign using light infantry, militia, and special operations forces. However, despite the early military successes, Colonel [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] quickly pointed out that there could be no permanent military solution for Portugal's colonial problem. In 1961, General [[Júlio Botelho Moniz]], after being nominated Minister of Defense, tried to convince President [[Américo Tomás]] in a constitutional "coup d'état" to remove an aged Salazar from the premiership. Botelho Moniz ended up being removed from his government position. His political ally [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] was nonetheless allowed to publish a letter in the newspaper "Diario Popular" reiterating his view that a military solution in Africa was unlikely.

In the 1960s, most of the world ostracised the Portuguese government because of its colonial policy, especially the newly independent African nations. Domestically, factions within Portugal's elite, including business, military, intellectuals and the church started to challenge Salazar and his policies. Later, despite tentative overtures towards an opening of the regime, Marcelo Caetano balked at ending the colonial war, notwithstanding the condemnation of most of the international community. The [[Carnation Revolution]] brought retreat from the colonies and acceptance of their independence, the subsequent power vacuum leading to the inception of newly independent communist states in 1975, notably the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]], which promptly began to expel all of their white Portuguese citizens.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 |title= Flight from Angola |newspaper =The Economist |location =London |date=16 August 1975}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090113204408/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 13 January 2009 |title= Dismantling the Portuguese Empire |newspaper=Time |location =New York |date=7 July 1975}}</ref> As a result, over a million Portuguese became destitute [[refugee]]s&nbsp;– the ''[[White African#Portuguese in Africa|retornados]]''.

==== Goa dispute ====
{{further|Indian annexation of Goa}}
Of the colonies remaining to Portugal at the end of World War II, [[Goa]] was the first to be lost (in 1961). A brief conflict drew a mixture of worldwide praise and condemnation for Portugal. In India, the action was seen as a liberation of territory historically Indian by reason of its geographical position, while Portugal viewed it as an aggression against its national soil and its own citizens.

After India gained [[Independence of India|independence]] on 15 August 1947, the British and French vacated their colonial possessions in the new country. Subsequently, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] initiated proceedings to find a diplomatic solution to the Goa problem. The Portuguese had been in Goa since 1510, while an independent India had only just been established. Nehru argued that the Goans were Indians by every standard and that Goa was a colony ruthlessly administered by a racist and fascist colonial regime, "just a pimple on the face of India", in his famous phrase. Salazar maintained that in spite of Goa's location and the nature of Portugal's political system, it was a province of Portugal as integral to his nation as the [[Algarve]]. Salazar further asserted that Goans nowhere considered or called themselves Indians, but rather deemed themselves to be Portuguese of Goa and that Goans were represented in the Portuguese legislature; indeed, some had risen to the highest levels of government and the administration of Portuguese universities. The Goans had Portuguese citizenship with full rights, thus access to all governmental posts and the ability to earn their living in any part of the Portuguese territories.

Throughout the debate between Salazar and Nehru, many Goans seem to have been apathetic regarding either position,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bravo |first=Philip |year=1998 |title=The Case of Goa: History, Rhetoric and Nationalism |url= http://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/pi/article/view/1400/945 |journal= Past Imperfect |volume=7 |access-date=2 June 2014}}</ref> and there were no signs in Goa of discontentment with the Portuguese regime.{{sfn|Kay| 1970|p=305}} Reports from ''Times'' correspondents suggested that not only were the residents of Goa unexcited by the prospect of Indian sovereignty, but that even the diaspora was less energised than the Indian government was prone to suggest.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=305}}  Contrary to what these politically motivated sources suggest, Goa did have a vigorous and well-established anti-colonial movement led by prominent figures such as [[ Tristão de Bragança Cunha]] with ties to the Indian National Congress{{cn|date=September 2021}}

With an Indian military operation imminent, Salazar ordered Governor General [[Manuel António Vassalo e Silva|Manuel Vassalo e Silva]] to fight to the last man  and adopt a [[scorched earth policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goacom.com/culture/history/church.html |title=A Summary of the Early History of Goa |publisher=GOACOM |date=4 April 1916 |access-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402200720/http://www.goacom.com/culture/history/church.html |archive-date=2 April 2012 }}</ref>
Eventually, India launched [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]] in December 1961 to evict Portugal from [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed in action, and the Portuguese Navy frigate [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Alfonso de Albuquerque'']] was destroyed, before General Vassalo e Silva surrendered. Salazar forced the general into exile for disobeying his order to fight to the last man and surrendering to the [[Indian Army]].

Support and opposition to India's action was on expected lines. Statements of support came from the Arab states, newly independent Ceylon and Indonesia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries. Statements deploring India's resort to force in Goa, Daman, and Diu were primarily made by  countries with overseas colonies, including the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and some other Western countries notably the United States, Canada and Australia, apart from regional rivals China and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/tomzgroup/pmwiki/uploads/1074-1962-03-KS-b-RCW.pdf|title= India, Portugal, Indian |page= 18659|publisher= Keesing's Record of World Events|date=March 1962|access-date=2 June 2014 }}</ref>

==== Aid to Rhodesia ====
{{further|Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence}}
Salazar was a close friend of [[Rhodesia]]n [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]]. After Rhodesia proclaimed its [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] from Britain in 1965, Portugal supported it economically and militarily through neighbouring [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Portuguese Mozambique]] until 1975, even though it never officially recognised the new Rhodesian state, which was governed by a white minority elite. In 1975, the [[Mozambican Liberation Front]] took over the rule of Mozambique following negotiations with the new Portuguese regime installed by the Carnation Revolution. Ian Smith later wrote in his biography ''[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|The Great Betrayal]]'' that had Salazar lasted longer than he did, the Rhodesian government would have survived to the present day, ruled by a black majority government under the name of [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

=== International relations after World War II ===
[[File:Truman signing North Atlantic Treaty.jpg|thumb|[[President Truman]] signing the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] with Portuguese Ambassador [[Pedro Teotónio Pereira|Teotónio Pereira]] standing behind.]]
Despite the authoritarian character of the regime, Portugal did not experience the same levels of international isolation as Spain did following World War II. Unlike Spain, Portugal under Salazar was accepted into the [[Marshall Plan]] (1947–1948) in return for the aid it gave to the Allies during the final stages of the war. Furthermore, also unlike Spain, it was one of the 12 founding members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) in 1949, a reflection of Portugal's role as an ally against communism during the Cold War in spite of its status as the only non-democratic founder. In 1950, Portugal joined the [[European Payments Union]] and participated in the founding of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1960 and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in 1961. It joined the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in 1962, and finally, Portugal signed a free trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] in 1972, still under the auspices of the ''Estado Novo''.<ref>Nicolau Andresen, "The Salazar Regime and European Integration, 1947–1972," ''European Review of History'' (2007) 14#2 pp. 195–214.</ref>

[[File:Elementos da escola salazarista.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Required elements of primary schools during the ''Estado Novo'': a crucifix and portraits of Salazar and Américo Tomás.]]

Under Salazar the number of elementary schools grew from 7,000 in 1927 to 10,000 in 1940. While the illiteracy rate under the twenty years of the First Republic had only dropped a modest 9%, under Salazar in twenty years, the illiteracy rate dropped 21%, from 61.8% in 1930 to 40.4% in 1950. In 1940, the regime celebrated the fact that for the first time in Portuguese History, the majority of the population could read and write.{{sfn|Ramos|2010|p=641}}

In 1952 a vast multi-pronged “Plan for Popular Education” was launched with the intent of finally extirpating illiteracy and putting into school every child of school age.

In the 1960s, Portugal founded universities in the overseas provinces of Angola and Mozambique (the [[University of Luanda]] and the [[University of Lourenço Marques]]). In 1971, it recognised the [[Portuguese Catholic University]], and by 1973 founded several state-run universities across [[mainland Portugal]] (the [[Minho University]], the [[New University of Lisbon]], the [[University of Évora]], and the [[University of Aveiro]]). In addition, the long-established universities of Lisbon and Coimbra were greatly expanded and modernised. New buildings and campuses were constructed, such as the ''Cidade Universitária'' (Lisbon) and the ''Alta Universitária'' (Coimbra).

The last two decades of the Estado Novo, from the 1960s to the 1974 Carnation Revolution were marked by strong investment in [[Education in Portugal|secondary and university education]], which experienced one of the fastest growth rates of Portuguese education in history.

=== Economic policies ===
After the politically unstable and financially chaotic years of the [[Portuguese First Republic]], financial stability was Salazar's highest priority. His first incursions into Portuguese politics as a member of the cabinet were during the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'', when Portugal's public finances were in a critical state, with an imminent threat of default since at least the 1890s.{{sfn|Derrick|1938| p=39}} After Salazar became prime minister, he levied numerous taxes to balance the Portuguese budget and pay external debts. Salazar's first years were marked by the [[Great Depression]] and the Second World War. The first era of his rule was thus an economic program based on the policies of [[autarky]] and [[economic interventionism|interventionism]], which were popular in the 1930s as a response to the Great Depression.<ref name="mattoso94">{{cite book |last1=Mattoso |first1= José|last2= Rosas |first2= Fernando |year=1994 |title= História de Portugal: o Estado Novo|language= pt|volume=VII |location=Lisbon |publisher=Estampa|page= 251 |isbn=978-9723310863}}</ref> Under Salazar, the Portuguese budget went from insolvency to showing a substantial surplus every year from 1928. Portugal's credit worthiness rose in foreign markets and the external floating debt was completely paid. However, Portugal remained largely underdeveloped, its population relatively poor and with low education attainment when compared to the rest of Europe.

[[Conservative]] Portuguese scholars such as [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]]<ref name="GrandesPortugueses">{{in lang|pt}} {{YouTube|XLZ-IEi7poE|Os Grandes Portugueses: Prof. Dr. António de Oliveira Salazar, in RTP}}, [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]] in [[The Greatest Portuguese]]</ref> and Rui Ramos<ref name="ionline.pt">[http://www.ionline.pt/conteudo/31720-historia-portugal-luta-faccoes-os-salazaristas História de Portugal.

On the other hand, historians such as the leftist politician [[Fernando Rosas]] claim that Salazar's policies from the 1930s to the 1950s led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration that turned Portugal into one of the poorest countries in Europe. From the 1950s, the picture changed{{failed verification|date=January 2021}}, and even leftist historians recognise{{original research inline|date=January 2021}} "that industrial growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s was generally quite positive and, given Portugal's basic problems, could probably have only been improved slightly by a more creatively liberal regime".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=cities_pubs |title=Historian Stanley Payne on Fernando Rosas works and Anne Pitcher's works |access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref>

Throughout the 1950s, Salazar maintained the same [[import substitution]] approach to economic policy that had ensured Portugal's neutral status during World War II. From 1950 until Salazar's death, Portugal saw its GDP per capita increase at an annual average rate of 5.7%. The rise of new technocrats in the early 1960s with a background in economics and technical-industrial expertise led to a new period of economic fostering, with Portugal as an attractive country for international investment. Industrial development and economic growth would continue throughout the 1960s. During Salazar's tenure, Portugal participated in the founding of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1960 and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1961. In the early 1960s, Portugal also added its membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and the [[World Bank]]. This marked the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy. Portuguese foreign trade increased by 52% in exports and 40% in imports. The economic growth and levels of capital formation from 1960 to 1973 were characterised by an unparalleled{{peacock inline|date=January 2021}} robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9%), industrial production (9%), private consumption (6.5%) and gross fixed capital formation (7.8%).<ref name="Estampa">{{cite book |last1=Mattoso |first1= José|last2= Rosas |first2= Fernando |year=1994 |title= História de Portugal: o Estado Novo|language= pt|volume=VII |location=Lisbon |publisher=Estampa|page= 474 |isbn=978-9723310863}}</ref>

Despite the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against guerrilla groups, Portuguese economic growth from 1960 to 1973 under the ''Estado Novo'' created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe.{{original research inline|date=January 2021}} In 1960, after nearly 30 years of Salazar's rule, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38% of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of Salazar's rule in 1968, it had risen to 48%; and in 1973, under the leadership of [[Marcelo Caetano]], Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4% of the EC-12 average.<ref>Eric Solsten, ed.

=== Religious policies ===
For forty years, Portugal was governed by a man that had been educated at a seminary, had received minor orders, and had considered becoming a priest.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=11}} Before accepting the office of minister of finance, Salazar had been associated with several Catholic movements and had developed a very close friendship with [[Manuel Gonçalves Cerejeira]], who in 1929 would become [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Cardinal-Patriarch]] of Lisbon. During their university years at Coimbra they shared a house, an old convent known as "Os Grilos".{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=19}}

In July 1929, with Salazar acting as minister of finance, the government revoked a law that had facilitated the organisation of religious processions. Salazar presented his written resignation to the prime minister saying, "Your Excellency knows that I never asked for anything that might improve the legal status of Catholics". He carefully avoided adding more problems to an already troubled nation, but he could not accept the "violation of rights already conceded by law or by former government to Catholics or the Church in Portugal". {{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=64}}

[[File:Cristo Rei (vista lateral).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lateral view of [[Christ the King (Almada)|Christ the King]], [[Almada]].]]
Despite his identification with the Catholic lobby before coming to power and the fact that he based his political philosophy around a close interpretation of the Catholic social doctrine, he did nothing directly for religion in the initial phase of his rule. He wanted to avoid the divisiveness of the First Republic, and he knew that a significant part of the political elite was still anti-clerical. Church and State remained apart. {{sfn|Kay|1970|p=359}} No attempt was made to establish a theocratic policy. The Church's lost property was never restored.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=359}}

In 1932, Salazar declared the Catholic political party (''Centro Católico'') to be unnecessary, since all political parties were to be suppressed, and he "invited" its members to join his own political organization, the National Union. The role of the Church should be social and not political, he argued. In reaction, Cardinal-Patriarch Cerejeira founded ''Acção Católica'' in 1933 and continued to agitate for political power until 1934, when Pope Pius XI told Cerejeira that he should focus on social, not political, issues. In the 1933 Constitution, Article 45 provided for freedom of public and private worship for all religions, together with the right to establish Church organizations and associations in accordance with the norms of law and order.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=359}}

Salazar based his political theory on the doctrines of the popes and throughout the 1930s achieved great prestige in the Catholic world. In 1936, the episcopate expressed its full support for the regime in a Carta Pastoral, reaffirmed the following year by the head of the Portuguese Catholic Church. Pope Pius XII said, "I bless him with all my heart, and I cherish the most ardent desire that he be able to complete successfully his work of national restoration, both spiritual and material".<ref>Cited from ''The Whole Truth About Fatima'', Vol. II, p. 412.</ref> In 1938, [[Fordham University]], a university founded by the Catholic Diocese of New York, granted Salazar the Honorary Doctorate of Law. Salazar wanted to reinstate the Church to its proper place, but also wanted the Church to know its place and keep it. He made it clear when he declared, "The State will abstain from dealing in politics with the Church and feels sure that the Church will refrain from any political action."{{sfn|Egerton|1943|p=301}}{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=359–360}}

In May 1940, a [[Concordat of 1940|Concordat between the Portuguese state and the Vatican]] was signed.<ref>[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/topic-38751.834 Full text Salazar's concordat (1940) available online in this link]</ref> There were difficulties in the negotiations that preceded its signing; the Church remained eager to re-establish its influence, whereas Salazar was equally determined to prevent any religious intervention within the political sphere, the exclusive preserve of the State. The legislation of the parliamentary republic was not fundamentally altered: religious teaching in schools remained voluntary, while civil marriages and civil divorce were retained and religious oaths were not re-established. The Bishops were to be appointed by the Holy See, but final nomination required the government's approval. The clergy were subject to military service, but in the form of pastoral care to the armed forces and, in time of war, also to the medical units. {{sfn|Egerton|1943|p=301}} The Church could establish and maintain private schools, but they would be subject to state supervision. The Catholic religion and morality were to be taught in public schools unless parents had requested the contrary. {{sfn|Egerton|1943|p=301}} Catholics who celebrated canonical marriages were not allowed to obtain a civil divorce. The law stated that "It is understood that by the very fact of the celebration of a canonical marriage, the spouses renounce the legal right to ask for a divorce." Despite this prohibition, nearly 91% of all marriages in the country were canonical marriages by 1961.<ref>Fundação Francisco Manuel dos Santos: Statistical date can be found in the following link: [http://www.pordata.pt/Portugal/Casamentos+n%C3%A3o+cat%C3%B3licos+entre+pessoas+do+sexo+oposto+(percentagem)-420]</ref>{{efn| Salazar's concordat outlived him and outlived the ''Estado Novo'' by 30 years; a new one was signed by Prime Minister [[José Manuel Barroso]] in 2004. Salazar's text was slightly amended in 1975 in order to allow civil divorce in Catholic marriages, while keeping all the other articles in force. (Additional Protocol to the 1940 Concordat, Decreto n.º 187/75, Signed by President [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]])}}

Pinto and Rezola argue that a key strategy Salazar used to stabilise his regime was to come to terms with the Catholic Church through the Concordat. Anti-clericalism would be discouraged and the Church would have an honored and central position in Portuguese life. The Church agreed to stay out of politics, but it did operate numerous social groups for adults and youth. The Church role became a major pillar of the New State's "limited pluralism."<ref>António Costa and Maria Inácia Rezola, "Political Catholicism, Crisis of Democracy and Salazar's New State in Portugal," ''Totalitarian Movements & Political Religions'' (2007) 8#2 pp. 353–368.</ref><ref>Tom Gallacher, "Portugal," in Tom Buchanan and Martin Conway, eds, ''Political Catholicism in Europe, 1918–1965'' (Oxford University Press, 1996).</ref>

Despite this landmark agreement, Church-state relations and inter-Church relations in Portugal were not without some tensions through the 1940s. Some prominent oppositionist priests, such as Abel Varzim and Joaquim Alves Correia, openly supported the [[Movement of Democratic Unity|MUD]] in 1945 and the granting of more social rights to the workers. Abel Varzim, who had been a supporter of the regime, attacked Salazar and his claims of the Catholicism of the corporatist state, arguing that the regime was not true to Catholic social teaching as the people suffered in poverty. Varzim's newspaper, ''O Trabalhador'' (''The Worker''), was closed in 1948.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=327}} In his personal diary he wrote: "o estado-salazar é quem manda na igreja" ("In Portugal the Salazar-State rules the church"). Joaquim Alves Correia was forced into exile in the United States, where he died in 1951. The opposition candidate in the 1958 presidential election, [[Humberto Delgado]], a Roman Catholic and a dissident of the regime, quoted [[Pope Pius XII]] to show how the social policies of the regime were against the social teachings of the Church. That same year, in July 1958, Salazar suffered a severe blow from the bishop of Porto, Dom [[António Ferreira Gomes]], who wrote a critical letter to the Council President criticizing the restrictions on human rights and denouncing the harshness of Portugal's poverty. It was time, he said, for the Church to come out of the catacombs and speak its mind.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=359–360}} Salazar was furious. The bishop was not formally exiled, but he decided to leave the country, and it appears that Lisbon made it clear to Rome that the bishop's presence in Portugal would not be appropriate.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=359–360}}

After the [[Second Vatican Council]], a large number of Catholics became active in the democratic opposition.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=362}} The outbreak of the colonial wars in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique – in March 1961, January 1963 and September 1964 respectively – exacerbated the divisions within the Catholic sector along progressive and traditionalist lines. The pope's decision to travel to Bombay in December 1964 to take part in the Eucharistic Congress represented for the Portuguese head of government – who saw in India little more than the illegal occupier of Goa since December 1961 – no less than a direct affront to the nation as a whole. On 21 October 1964, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Franco Nogueira, officially defined the visit as an ''agravo gratuito''.

Directly linked with the pope's visit to India, a second event of significant importance preceded the pope's visit to Portugal: the attribution of the [[Golden Rose]] to the [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] sanctuary on 13 May 1965. Paul VI officially announced his intention to take part in the Fiftieth Anniversary celebrations of the first reported Fátima apparition – also the twenty-fifth of the consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by Pius XII – during his General Audience of 3 May 1967. From the very start, he made every effort to remove any political significance from his visit. It was effectively limited to a single day in Fátima, not Lisbon, and the pope made use of [[Monte Real Air Base]] instead of Lisbon airport, which would have given a far more official nature to the pilgrimage.

Religions other than the Catholic faith had little or no expression in Portugal. Throughout the period of Salazar's ''Estado Novo'' there was no question of discrimination against the Jewish and Protestant minorities, and the ecumenical movement flourished.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=362}}

[[File:Cartel-Oliveira Salazar.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Azulejo]] with a quote from Salazar, in ''[[Esposende]]''.]]
The Portuguese literary historian António José Saraiva, a communist and a fierce lifelong political opponent of Salazar, claimed that one who reads Salazar's ''Speeches and Notes'' is overwhelmed by the clarity and conciseness of style, the most perfect and captivating doctrinal prose that exists in Portuguese, underscored by a powerful emotional rhythm. According to Saraiva, Salazar's prose deserves a prominent place in the history of Portuguese literature, and only political barriers have deprived it of the place. Saraiva says it is written with the clarity of the great prose of the 17th century, cleansed of all the distractions and sloppiness that often obscures the prose of the Portuguese scholars.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=António José Saraiva |title=Salazarismo |journal=Revista Expresso |date=22 April 1989 |volume=IV |issue=22 |page=15 |language=pt |quote={{lang|pt|...a sua prosa digna de entrar na história da literatura portuguesa.}} }}</ref><ref name="Medina2000">{{cite book |author=João Medina |title=Salazar, Hitler e Franco: estudos sobre Salazar e a ditadura |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhgkAQAAIAAJ |year=2000 |publisher=Livros Horizonte |language=pt |isbn=978-9722410748 |page=245 }}</ref><ref name="Moncure1992">{{cite book |author=James A.

In 1968, Salazar suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on his right hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |title=O fim de Salazar |url=https://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/o-fim-de-salazar/ |publisher=[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]] |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref> Most sources maintain that it occurred when he fell from a chair in his summer house in the [[Fort of Saint Anthony of Barra]]. In February 2009, there were anonymous witnesses who admitted, after some investigation into Salazar's best-kept secrets, that he had fallen in a bath instead of from a chair.<ref name="dn.sapo.pt" /> After the incident, Salazar's life went on normally. Sixteen days later, Salazar admitted he felt sick and he was admitted to [[Hospital de São José]] two days later. Believing that the 79-year-old prime minister would die soon after the fall, President [[Américo Tomás]] dismissed Salazar and replaced him with [[Marcelo Caetano]]. Despite the injury, Salazar lived for a further twenty-three months. When he unexpectedly recovered lucidity, his intimates did not tell him he had been removed from power, instead allowing him to “rule” in privacy until his death on 27 July 1970.{{sfn |Meneses|2009|pp=608–609}}

== Evaluation ==
[[File:Foto 3 Visita Salazar obras Ponte Coimbra015.jpg|thumb|right|Salazar (centre, with glasses) observing [[Edgar Cardoso]]'s maquette of the Santa Clara bridge. Located in [[Coimbra]], it was concluded in 1954.]]

Due to Salazar's long rule, a detached evaluation of him is difficult.  He is considered either a saviour of interwar Portugal and an exponent of Christian philosophy in politics, or a fascist-leaning dictator who obstructed his country's democratic evolution.

In 1983, historian [[Thomas Gerard Gallagher|Tom Gallagher]] criticised Salazar's excessive promises, writing that  "Salazar was being deceitful when he told [[António Ferro]] in 1938, 'I estimate that within five years every child in this country will have the opportunity to read and write.' His true policy had been revealed six years earlier when he stated categorically, 'I consider more urgent the creation of elites than the necessity to teach people how to read.'"{{sfn|Gallagher|1983|p=99}} In a 2018 retrospective, Gallagher argues that Salazar focused Portugal on the conservative values of family, local community and the Catholic faith. He rejected the secularism and anticlericalism of the French Revolution, which had a stronghold in the cities but was weak in rural areas. Negative traits that were seen in the governments of other parts of Europe were not prevalent. He never claimed the superiority of a pure Portuguese stock. There was no policy of antisemitism and he helped Jews escape the Nazis. Catholicism was emphasised but the bishops and the pope had to keep their place in the system he quietly controlled without fanfare or charisma.  Nationalism was used as a major justification for building a huge global empire that long outlasted those of France, Britain and the others. Salazar also succeeded in using national pride to overwhelm localism and the bitter factionalism that had long troubled the nation before 1930. His coalition brought together monarchists, moderate republicans, businessmen, churchmen, landowners and the military. Each of these groups understood that only with him in charge could their privileges be guaranteed. He believed in stability not democracy, but Portugal remained poor as Europe flourished in the 1960s and 1970s. He spent large sums on soldiers to fight for control of the many colonies; it was a losing battle and by this time the old man was himself losing prestige and stature. He always rejected goals such as modernity and progress and liberalism in favour of tradition, stability and conservatism, and the themes are still echoed into the 21st century by his admirers.<ref>Tom Gallagher,  "Salazar: Portugal's Great Dictator A contemporary of Hitler, Franco and Mussolini, Salazar is remembered by some of his compatriots as the greatest figure in the nation's history. Why?" ''History Today'' (Sept 2018) 68#9 [https://www.historytoday.com/tom-gallagher/salazar-portugals-great-dictator online]</ref>

Historian [[Neill Lochery]] claims Salazar was one of the most gifted men of his generation and hugely dedicated to his job and country.{{sfn|Lochery|2011|pp=14–15}} According to American scholar J. Wiarda, despite certain problems and continued poverty in many sectors, the consensus among historians and economists is that Salazar in the 1930s brought remarkable improvements in the economic sphere, public works, social services and governmental honesty, efficiency and stability.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=156}}<ref>See other comments for the 1930s achievements in ''Time'' Magazine 1935, ''Life'' magazine 1940, and books from: Derrick ''The Portugal Of Salazar'', William C. Atkinson ''The Political Structure of the Portuguese New State'' pp. 346–354', Jacques Ploncard d'Assac ''Salazark'', Freppel Cotta ''Economic Planning in Corporative Portugal''.</ref>

[[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], the British Ambassador in Spain, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping the Iberian peninsula neutral during World War II, and lauded him. Hoare asserted that, in his 30 years of political life, he had met most of the leading statesmen of Europe, and regarded Salazar highly among those. Salazar was to him a learned and impressive thinker – part professor, part priest, part recluse of unshakable beliefs. He regarded him as ascetic, concentrated on serving his country, with an encyclopedic knowledge of Europe and indifferent to ostentation, luxury or personal gains. Hoare strongly believed in Salazar as "being a man of one idea – the good of his country", not wanting to endanger the work of national regeneration to which he had devoted the whole of his public life.{{sfn|Hoare|1946|pp=124–125}}

Historian [[Carlton J. H. Hayes|Carlton Hayes]], a pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism, was the American Ambassador in Spain during World War II. He met Salazar in person and agreed with Ambassador Hoare.  Hayes wrote that Salazar 'didn't look like a regular dictator. Rather, he appeared a modest, quiet, and highly intelligent gentleman and scholar...literally dragged from a professorial chair of political economy in the venerable University of Coimbra a dozen years previously in order to straighten out Portugal's finances, and that his almost miraculous success in this respect had led to the thrusting upon him of other major functions, including those of Foreign Minister and constitution-maker.'{{sfn|Hayes|1945|p=36}} Hayes appreciated Portugal's endeavours to form a truly neutral peninsular bloc with Spain, an immeasurable contribution – at a time when the British and the United States had much less influence – towards counteracting the propaganda and appeals of the Axis.{{sfn| Hayes|1945|p=119}}

Belgian diplomat André de Staercke, dean of NATO's ambassadors, who served for almost 24 years on the alliance council, developed a close and long friendship with Salazar. In his memoirs, Staercke dedicates a full chapter to Salazar and ranks Salazar, together with Churchill and [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] as one of the three greatest political leaders he has met in his life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Staercke|first1=André de|title=Mémoires sur la Régence et la Question Royale.|date=2003|publisher=Editions Racine|location=Bruxelles|isbn=978-2873863166|page=24}}</ref>

The Portuguese literary historian, António José Saraiva, a communist and a fierce lifelong political opponent of Salazar, claimed that "Salazar was, undoubtedly, one of the most remarkable men in the history of Portugal and possessed a quality that remarkable men do not always have: the right intention."<ref>Saraiva, António José, ''Expresso'' journal of 22 April 1989. In Portuguese: "Salazar foi, sem dúvida, um dos homens mais notáveis da História de Portugal e possuía uma qualidade que os homens notáveis nem sempre possuem: a recta intenção."</ref>

Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] spoke effusively of Salazar in an interview published by France's ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper: "The most complete statesman, the one most worthy of respect, that I have known is Salazar. I regard him as an extraordinary personality for his intelligence, his political sense and his humility. His only defect is probably his modesty."{{sfn| Lochery|2011|p=19}} This was, however, in response to Salazar helping his cause, which, in turn, was meant to prevent Portugal from communism and the chaos of the First Republic.

The Portuguese historian, scholar, and editor, [[A. H. de Oliveira Marques]], wrote of Salazar: "He considered himself the guide of the nation, believed that there were things which only he could do ('unfortunately there are a lot of things that seemingly only I can do' – official note published in September 1935) and convinced more and more of his countrymen of that too... He became more and more of a dictator, more and more inclined to deify himself and to trust others less."<ref name="Marques1972">{{cite book|author=A.

In November 1965, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine said of Salazar: "Every four years, Premier António de Oliveira Salazar preserves Portugal's image as a democracy by blowing the dust off a few selected "opposition" leaders and relaxing police controls just enough for a few weeks to permit them to run for Portugal's 130-seat National Assembly. There are a few cracks in the facade. The assembly functions only as a rubber stamp. The opposition candidates are usually feeble old men left over from a regime that was discredited and overthrown four decades ago, and Salazar decides what they can and cannot talk about..."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Editorial series |title=Portugal: Against the Situation |volume=86 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834552,00.html |work=Time Magazine  |issue=20 |publisher=Time Inc. |date=12 November 1965 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801215922/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C834552%2C00.html |archive-date=1 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Portuguese poet, writer, and literary critic [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote that Salazar was "capable of governing within the limits of his area of expertise, which is financial science, but not (capable of governing) with the lack of limits of government in general", adding that "What is wrong, here, is not that Sr. Oliveira Salazar is Minister of Finance, which I accept is right, but that he is minister of everything, which is more questionable."<ref name=Barreto2008>{{cite web|author1=José Barreto|title=Salazar and the New State in the writings of Fernando Pessoa|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Salazar+and+the+New+State+in+the+writings+of+Fernando+Pessoa.-a0188159484|website=The Free Library|publisher=Portuguese Studies|date=22 September 2008}}</ref>

The American author and political scientist, [[Paul H. Lewis]], wrote of Salazar: "Though he never took Holy Orders he continued to live the solitary, ascetic life of a priest – never marrying, and devoting all his time, first to his academic career as an economist at Coimbra University, and later to running the government. He was cold, intellectual, and dedicated – a man of "painful reserve: an almost Manichean fastidiousness, implying, perhaps a distaste for sex, and always a total involvement with his job."<ref name=JOP1978>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Paul H.|title=Salazar's Ministerial Elite, 1932–1968|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1978|volume=40|issue=3|pages=622–647|doi=10.2307/2129859|jstor=2129859|s2cid=153641614}}</ref>

In 2006 and 2007 two public opinion television shows aroused controversy. Salazar was elected the "Greatest Portuguese Ever" with 41 per cent of votes on the show ''[[Os Grandes Portugueses]]'' ("The Greatest Portuguese") from the [[RTP1]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grandes Portugueses – Informação – Especializada – RTP|url=http://www.rtp.pt/programa/tv/p21257|access-date=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216165335/http://www.rtp.pt/programa/tv/p21257|archive-date=16 February 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rtp.pt/wportal/sites/tv/grandesportugueses/SondagemGrandesPortugueses.pdf Poll] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927132115/http://www.rtp.pt/wportal/sites/tv/grandesportugueses/SondagemGrandesPortugueses.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }} Technically correct poll made by the TV station RTP and Eurosondagem, following the victory of Salazar in its television show 'Os Grandes portugueses', at http://www.rtp.pt</ref> He was presented by the scholar [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]], who described being confronted with some "reactions of perplexity, surprise, aggressiveness and even hostility" after having accepted the task.<ref name="GrandesPortugueses" /> Salazar was also declared "Worst Portuguese Ever" in a public poll by the satirical debate program ''Eixo do Mal'' ("Axis of Evil") on the channel [[SIC Notícias]]. However, the official poll results for both of the two rounds hosted by this latter program show that the public had actually voted [[Mário Soares]], a major opponent of Salazar and his regime, as "Worst Portuguese Ever".<ref>{{cite web|first1=Poll|last1=Official Blog|title=O Pior Português de Sempre|url=https://piorportugues.blogs.sapo.pt/|access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref><ref>Official poll results for the first part, started on 2006-12-01, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090525092048/http://vota.sapo.pt/poll_stats2.php?poll=1495 votação]</ref><ref>Official poll results for the final round, started on 2007-02-05, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020035234/http://vota.sapo.pt/poll_stats2.php?poll=1908 votação]</ref> This led to viewers expressing concerns about the reliability and seriousness of the show, with the controversy extending to the poll on the show ''The Greatest Portuguese'', which Mário Soares called "total nonsense from start to end".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mário Soares: Programa "Grandes Portugueses" é um disparate Cultura : TV e Cinema Diário Digital|url=https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=261832|access-date=3 May 2015|journal=Diário Digital / Lusa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103009/http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=261832|archive-date=18 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Years previously, a survey from the channel [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação|SIC]] had also rated Salazar as 'The Greatest Portuguese Figure of the 20th Century'.

In 2011, during the [[2010–14 Portuguese financial crisis|Portuguese financial crisis]] when the country was nearing the end of the center-left government of [[José Socrates]] and had to request international financial assistance, [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]], the Portuguese military officer who was the chief strategist of the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in Lisbon, stated that he wouldn't have started the revolution if he had known what the country would become after it.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.dn.pt/portugal/se-soubesse-como-o-pais-ia-ficar-nao-fazia-a-revolucao-1829262.html «Se soubesse como o País ia ficar, não fazia a revolução»], [[Diário de Notícias]] (13 April 2011)</ref> He also stated that the country would need a man as honest as António de Oliveira Salazar to deal with the crisis, but from a non-[[fascist]] perspective.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.dn.pt/dossiers/tv-e-media/revistas-de-imprensa/noticias/interior/otelo-precisamos-de-um-homem-honesto-como-salazar-1835446.html <<Otelo: precisamos de um homem honesto como Salazar>>], in [[Diário de Notícias]] (21 April 2011)</ref>

=== After Salazar ===

Salazar saw no prospects for his regime beyond his death.<ref name="GrandesPortugueses" /> Nonetheless, the ''Estado Novo'' persisted under the direction of [[Marcelo Caetano]], Salazar's longtime aide as well as a well-reputed scholar of the University of Lisbon Law School, statesman and distinguished member of the regime who co-wrote the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1933|Constitution of 1933]].{{Fact|date=January 2021}} Caetano tried to blunt the harsher edges of the regime he helped create, but the meager reforms he was able to wring out of the hardline elements of the government did not go nearly far enough for elements of the population who wanted more freedom. The ''Estado Novo'' eventually fell on 25 April 1974 with the [[Carnation Revolution]].

== Distinctions ==

=== Orders ===
Salazar was made member of the following Portuguese Orders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ordens Honorificas Portuguesas|url=http://www.ordens.presidencia.pt/|website=Página Oficial das Ordens Honorificas Portuguesas|publisher=Presidência da República Portuguesa|access-date=26 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911070650/http://www.ordens.presidencia.pt/|archive-date=11 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
*[[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]] (15 April 1929)
*Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Colonial Empire]] (21 April 1932)
*Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] (28 May 1932, first civilian to receive such honor){{sfn|Meneses|2009|pp=76–77}}
*[[Grand Collar]] of the [[Order of Prince Henry]] (4 October 1968)

He also received several other similar distinctions from countries including France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Romania and Spain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salazar – O Obreiro da Pátria|url=http://www.oliveirasalazar.org/galeria.asp?idTema=82|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref>

=== Academic distinctions ===
Salazar was conferred with the following academic distinctions.
*[[Oxford University]], 1939, Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law.
*[[Fordham University]], 1938, Honorary Doctorate of Law.<ref>Newspaper Archive of Southern Cross, 30 June 1938, p. 8/24</ref>

The bridge across the Tagus connecting Lisbon to Almada was named the [[25 de Abril Bridge|Ponte Salazar]] (Salazar Bridge) upon completion. Built by the ''Estado Novo'' 6 months ahead of schedule and under budget, it was the 5th longest suspension bridge in the world and the longest outside of the US. It was then renamed "25 April Bridge". [[Estádio da Machava|Salazar Stadium]], a noteworthy multi-purpose stadium built in Mozambique during the ''Estado Novo'', was named after Salazar. With 1975's new government it began to degrade. It was renamed Stadium of Machava.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clube Ferroviário de Moçambique – Estádio da Machava (antigo Salazar)|url=http://www.sislog.com/ferroviario/article.php3?id_article=46|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> Many places across the country (streets, avenues, squares) were named after Salazar. They were renamed since 1974, especially in district capitals. Around 20 localities still reference Salazar today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salazar "sobrevive" na toponímia nacional em 20 localidades portuguesas |publisher=Público, Comunicação Social|url=http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/salazar-sobrevive-na-toponimia-nacional-em-20-localidades-portuguesas-1376410|date=24 April 2009|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> There are also some [[azulejo]]s with quotes of Salazar.

In popular culture, Salazar's Cake (''Bolo de Salazar'') is the name given to a cake that Salazar used to eat sometimes. It is cheap and simple, perhaps with similarities to [[sponge cake]]. Kitchen cake spatulas are sometimes referred to as 'Salazar' in Portugal for their effectiveness in not leaving any residue behind.

A wine brand called ''Terras de Salazar'' ("Lands of Salazar") was approved in 2011 by the national institute. It never reached the market due to the owner's economic troubles.<ref>{{cite news|title=INPI autorizou vinho com o nome de Salazar |newspaper=Diário de Notícias|url=https://www.dn.pt/dossiers/tv-e-media/revistas-de-imprensa/noticias/interior/inpi-autorizou-vinho-com-o-nome-de-salazar-2916434.html|date=29 November 2012|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> In 2012, the City Council of Salazar's hometown Santa Comba Dão announced a brand called Memories of Salazar for a range of regional products, notably wine. It was rejected by the same institute for offensiveness and the possibility of public disorder. The mayor claimed the refusal was ridiculous and will not give up or drop the name Salazar from future brand name proposals. He is considering submitting Vineyards of Salazar, as "memories" of the regime could be one reason to add to the refusal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Santa Comba Dão queria lançar vinho "Memórias de Salazar" mas marca foi chumbada|publisher=Público, Comunicação Social|last=Ribeiro|first=Graça Barbosa|url=http://fugas.publico.pt/Noticias/313615_santa-comba-dao-queria-lancar-vinho-memorias-de-salazar-mas-marca-foi-chumbada|date=28 November 2012|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref>

The brand ''Salazar – O Obreiro da Pátria'' ("Salazar – Fatherland's Workman") is registered and runs the website www.oliveirasalazar.org, an archive of various documents related to Salazar.

Salazar originated the [[HCESAR]] keyboard layout, introduced by means of a decree of 17. July 1937.
