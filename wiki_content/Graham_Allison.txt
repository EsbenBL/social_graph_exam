'''Graham Tillett Allison Jr.''' (born March 23, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[political scientist]] and the Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/graham-allison|title=Graham Allison|website=www.hks.harvard.edu}}</ref> He is renowned for his contribution in the late 1960s and early 1970s to the bureaucratic analysis of [[decision making]], especially during times of crisis. His book ''Remaking Foreign Policy: The Organizational Connection'', co-written with Peter Szanton, was published in 1976 and had some influence on the foreign policy of the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]] who took office in early 1977. Since the 1970s, Allison has also been a leading analyst of U.S. [[national security]] and defense policy, with a special interest in [[nuclear weapons]] and [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/graham-allison|title=Graham Allison|website=www.hks.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref>

==Biography==
Allison is from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. He attended [[Davidson College]] for two years, then graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1962 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree. Allison then completed a two-year [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree at [[Oxford University]] as a [[Marshall Scholar]] in 1964 and returned to Harvard to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science in 1968. In 1979 Allison received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates – Uppsala University, Sweden|first=David|last=Naylor|website=www.uu.se}}</ref>

Allison has spent his entire academic career at Harvard, as an assistant professor (1968), associate professor (1970), then full professor (1972) in the department of government. He was [[dean (education)|dean]] of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] from 1977 to 1989 while the School increased in size by 400% and its endowment increased by 700%. He was director for the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] from 1995 until 2017, when he was succeeded by former Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Martha|title=Ash Carter to head Belfer Center|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/03/former-u-s-secretary-of-defense-to-head-harvards-belfer-center/|access-date=6 April 2018|work=[[The Harvard Gazette]]|date=March 28, 2017}}</ref> Allison remains [[Douglas Dillon]] Professor of Government.

Allison has also been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies (1973–74); consultant for the [[RAND Corporation]]; member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]; member of the visiting committee on foreign policy studies at the [[Brookings Institution]] (1972–77); and a member of the [[Trilateral Commission]] (1974–84 and 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trilateral.org/page/7/membership|title=Membership – The Trilateral Commission|website=trilateral.org|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> He was among those mentioned to succeed [[David Rockefeller]] as President of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. In 2009 he was awarded the [[NAS Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=NASNuclear>{{cite web|title=NAS Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_behavioral_research|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|access-date=16 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040753/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_behavioral_research|archive-date=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Analyst work==
Allison has been heavily involved in [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. defense policy]] since working as an advisor and consultant to [[the Pentagon]] in the 1960s. He has been a member of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]'s [[Defense Policy Board]] from 1985. He was a special advisor to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] (1985–87) and the [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy and Plans]] (1993–1994), where he coordinated strategy and policy towards the states of the former [[Soviet Union]]. President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Allison the Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, for "reshaping relations with [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Kazakhstan]] to reduce the former Soviet nuclear arsenal". He was also an informal advisor to [[Michael Dukakis]]'s 1988 presidential campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/31/us/dukakis-learned-lesson-as-teacher.html|title=Dukakis Learned Lesson as Teacher|last1=Gold|first1=Allan R.|date=1988-08-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-06-01|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Academic work==
Allison is best known as a political scientist for his book ''[[Essence of Decision]]: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis'' (1971), in which he developed two new theoretical paradigms – an organizational process model and a bureaucratic politics model – to compete with the then-prevalent approach of understanding [[foreign policy]] decision-making using a [[rational actor]] model. ''Essence of Decision'' swiftly revolutionized the study of decision-making in political science and beyond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/essence-decision-explaining-cuban-missile-crisis-2nd-ed|title=Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis, 2nd ed.|website=Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|language=en|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref>

==Thucydides trap==
{{Main|Thucydides Trap}}
In the book ''Destined for War'', Allison uses the phrase the '''Thucydides Trap'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> which, according to him, refers to the theory that "when one great power threatens to displace another, war is almost always the result".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Allison |first1=Graham |title=The Thucydides Trap |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/09/the-thucydides-trap/ |agency=FP |publisher=FP |date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> Allison's term follows the ancient text ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', in which [[Thucydides]] wrote, "What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta."<ref>{{cite news |author=Ben Schott |author-link=Ben Schott |title=The Thucydides Trap |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/the-thucydides-trap/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 31, 2011 |access-date=2013-06-07}}</ref> The term appeared in a paid opinion advertisement in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on April 6, 2017, on the occasion of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]'s meeting with Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]], which stated, "Both major players in the region share a moral obligation to steer away from Thucydides's Trap."<ref>{{cite news |title=Advertisement |author=Zhu Dongyang ([[Xinhua News Agency]]) |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> Allison asserts that circumstances at the start of [[World War I]] (involving British fears about Germany), the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and the [[Thirty Years' War]] (involving French insecurity about the Habsburg empires of Spain and Austria) exhibit the trap.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/09/the-thucydides-trap/|title=The Thucydides Trap|last=Allison|first=Graham|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref>

Both Allison's conception of Thucydides's Trap and its applicability to U.S.-Chinese relations have encountered heavy scholarly criticism.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Waldron|first=Arthur|date=2017-06-12|title=There is no Thucydides Trap|url=http://supchina.com/2017/06/12/no-thucydides-trap/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=SupChina}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Feng|first1=Huiyun|title=China's Challenges and International Order Transition: Beyond "Thucydides's Trap"|last2=He|first2=Kai|date=2020|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-13176-1|location=Ann Arbor, MI|language=en|doi=10.3998/mpub.11353648|hdl=2027/fulcrum.0g354g88p}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Chan|first=Steve|title=Thucydides's Trap?: Historical Interpretation, Logic of Inquiry, and the Future of Sino-American Relations|date=2020|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-13170-9|location=Ann Arbor, MI|language=en|doi=10.3998/mpub.11387628|hdl=2027/fulcrum.pv63g2033}}</ref> In March 2019, the ''Journal of Chinese Political Science'' dedicated a special issue to the topic,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Chunman|last2=Pu|first2=Xiaoyu|date=2019-01-25|title=Introduction: Can America and China Escape the Thucydides Trap?|journal=Journal of Chinese Political Science|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s11366-019-09609-y|s2cid=159291437|issn=1080-6954}}</ref> suggesting [[Power transition theory|power transition]] narratives do appear to matter with regard to domestic perception.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gries|first1=Peter|last2=Jing|first2=Yiming|date=2019-07-04|title=Are the US and China fated to fight?

==Controversy==
From 2012 to 2013, the Belfer Center (through the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]) paid an editor to cite Allison's scholarly writings in various  articles. Funding for the position came from the Stanton Foundation, for which Graham Allison's wife, Liz Allison, was one of two trustees. The editor also made "supposedly problematic edits" based heavily on work of other scholars affiliated with the Belfer Center.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tim|first1=Sampson|title=One of Wikimedia's largest donors accused in paid editing scandal|url=https://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-paid-editing-scandal-stanton/|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=April 2, 2017}}</ref>
