'''Stanley Milgram''' (August 15, 1933 – December 20, 1984) was an American [[social psychologist]], best known for his controversial [[Milgram experiment|experiments on obedience]] conducted in the 1960s during his professorship at [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref name="Blass, T. 2004">Blass, T. (2004). ''The Man Who Shocked the World: The Life and Legacy of Stanley Milgram''. {{ISBN|0-7382-0399-8}}</ref>

Milgram was influenced by the events of the [[Nazi Holocaust|Holocaust]], especially the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], in developing the experiment. After earning a PhD in [[social psychology]] from [[Harvard University]], he taught at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and then for most of his career as a professor at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]], until his death in 1984.

His [[small-world experiment]], while at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], led researchers to analyze the degree of connectedness, including the [[six degrees of separation]] concept. Later in his career, Milgram developed a technique for creating interactive hybrid social agents (called [[cyranoid]]s), which has since been used to explore aspects of social- and self-perception.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the [[history of social psychology]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Milgram as the 46th-most-cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell III |first9=John L. |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913 |s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

Milgram's interest in the Holocaust had its basis in what his biographer, Professor [[Thomas Blass]], referred to as Milgram's "lifelong identification with the [[Jewish people]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/sommersemester2012/schluesselstudiendersozialpsychologiea/blass_historicalperspmilgram_ampsychol2009.pdf |title=From New Haven to Santa Clara : A Historical Perspective on the Milgram Obedience Experiments |author=Thomas Blass |website=Uni-muenster.de |access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref>  Author Kirsten Fermaglich wrote that Milgram as an adult had "a personal conflict as a Jewish man who perceived himself both as an outsider, a victim of the Nazi destruction, and as an insider, as scientist."<ref name="google3">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31JEAHwiZ_EC&q=%22stanley+milgram%22+jewish&pg=PA100 |title=American Dreams and Nazi Nightmares: Early Holocaust Consciousness and ... |author=Kirsten Fermaglich |page=100 |access-date=May 5, 2016|isbn=9781584655497 |year=2007 }}</ref>  Alexandra stated that Milgram's Jewish identity led to his focus on the Holocaust and his obedience-to-authority research.<ref name="google3"/> He shared this as well with Herbert Winer, one of his obedience study subjects, who noted after speaking to Milgram about the experiment that "Milgram was very Jewish. I was Jewish. We talked about this. There was obviously a motive behind neutral research."<ref name="google3"/>

Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in [[Greenwich Village]] in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHgWLPas4bYC&q=%22Stanley+Milgram%22+synagogue&pg=PA74 |title=The Man Who Shocked the World: The Life and Legacy of Stanley Milgram |author=Thomas Blass |page=74 |date= February 24, 2009|access-date=May 5, 2016|isbn=9780465008070 }}</ref> At the time of his death, Milgram lived in [[New Rochelle, New York]].<ref name = NYTObit/>

Milgram's father worked as a baker, providing a modest income for his family until his death in 1953 (upon which Stanley's mother took over the bakery). Milgram attended PS 77 and [[James Monroe High School (New York City)|James Monroe High School]] in the Bronx (which he graduated from in three years),<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="encyclopedia.com"/> and excelled academically and was a great leader among his peers. One of Milgram's classmates at James Monroe High School was [[Philip Zimbardo]], the architect of the [[Stanford prison experiment]]. Milgram and Zimbardo also shared an affinity for the popular television program ''[[Candid Camera]]'' and an admiration for its creator, [[Allen Funt]].<ref name="ShockMachine">{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Gina |title=Behind the Shock Machine: the untold story of the notorious Milgram psychology experiments |date=2013 |publisher=The New Press |isbn=978-1595589217 }}</ref><ref name="CandidCamera">{{cite book |last1=Milgram |first1=Stanley |title=The Individual in a Social World: Essays and Experiments |date=1977 |publisher=Addison Wesley |pages=324–332}}</ref>

By the time he was college age, his family had moved to nearby [[Queens]].<ref name="uni-muenster.de"/> In 1954, Milgram received his bachelor's degree in political science from [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College in New York]], which he attended tuition-free.<ref name="Blass, T. 2004"/> He also studied at [[Brooklyn College]], where he received A-grades in "Psychology of Personality" and "An Eclectic Approach to Social Psychology".<ref name="books.google.com"/> He applied to a PhD program in [[social psychology]] at [[Harvard University]], and was initially rejected due to an insufficient background in psychology (he had not taken any undergraduate courses in psychology at Queens College). He was eventually accepted to Harvard in 1954 after first enrolling as a student in Harvard's Office of Special Students.<ref name="Blass, T. 2004"/>

=== Professional life ===
In 1961, Milgram received a PhD in social psychology from Harvard. He became an assistant professor at Yale in the fall of 1960. He served as an assistant professor in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard from 1963 to 1966 on a three-year contract.  The contract was then extended for one additional year, but with the lower rank of a lecturer.<ref>{{cite web|title = Stanley Milgram|url = http://faculty.frostburg.edu/mbradley/psyography/stanleymilgram.html|website = faculty.frostburg.edu|access-date = October 23, 2015}}</ref>  Most likely because of his controversial [[Milgram Experiment|obedience experiment]], Milgram was denied tenure at Harvard.

In 1967 he accepted an offer to become a tenured full professor at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]], and he taught at City University until he died in 1984.<ref name="Blass, T. 2004"/><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdYPAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149 |title=OCR Psychology: AS Core Studies and Psychological Investigations |author1=Philip Banyard |author2=Cara Flanagan |page=149 |date= September 5, 2013|access-date=May 5, 2016|isbn=9781135049317 }}</ref> Milgram had a number of significant influences, including psychologists [[Solomon Asch]] and [[Gordon Allport]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Cary L.

==Obedience to authority==
[[File:Milgram Experiment.png|thumb|200px|Setup of the Milgram Experiment]]
{{main|Milgram experiment}}
In 1963, Milgram submitted the results of his obedience experiments in the article "Behavioral Study of Obedience". In the ensuing controversy, the [[American Psychological Association]] held up his application for membership for a year because of questions about the ethics of his work, but eventually did grant him full membership. Ten years later, in 1974, Milgram published ''Obedience to Authority''.  He won the [[AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]] in 1964, mostly for his work on the social aspects of obedience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.aaas.org/awards.php?a_id=24 |title=AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research |website=Archives.aaas.org |access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref> Inspired in part by the 1961 trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], his models were later also used to explain the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre]] (including authority training in the military, depersonalizing the "enemy" through racial and cultural differences, etc.).  He produced a film depicting his experiments, which are considered classics of social psychology.

An article in ''American Psychologist''<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = A cognitive reinterpretation of Stanley Milgram's observations on obedience to authority|last = Nissani|first = Moti|date = 1990|journal = American Psychologist|doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.45.12.1384|volume=45|issue = 12|pages=1384–1385}}</ref> sums up Milgram's obedience experiments: <blockquote>In Milgram's basic paradigm, a subject walks into a laboratory believing that they are about to take part in a study of memory and learning.  After being assigned the role of a teacher, the subject is asked to teach word associations to a fellow subject (who in reality is a collaborator of the experimenter). The teaching method, however, is unconventional—administering increasingly higher electric shocks to the learner. Once the presumed shock level reaches a certain point, the subject is thrown into a conflict. On the one hand, the strapped learner demands to be set free, he appears to suffer pain, and going all the way may pose a risk to his health. On the other hand, the experimenter, if asked, insists that the experiment is not as unhealthy as it appears to be, and that the teacher must go on. In sharp contrast to the expectations of professionals and laymen alike, some 65% of all subjects continue to administer shocks up to the very highest levels.</blockquote>More recent tests of the experiment have found that it only works under certain conditions; in particular, when participants believe the results are necessary for the "good of science".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bad Show|url=http://www.radiolab.org/2012/jan/09/whos-bad/|publisher=WNYC|access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

According to Milgram, "the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions.  Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow."  Thus, "the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter."<ref>{{Cite book|title = Obedience to Authority|last = Milgram|first = Stanley|publisher = Harper & Row|year = 1974|location = New York|pages = xii, xiii}}</ref> Besides this hypothetical agentic state, Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject's obedience: politeness, awkwardness of withdrawal, absorption in the technical aspects of the task, the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human, a belief that the experiment served a desirable end, the sequential nature of the action, and anxiety.

A competing explanation<ref name=":0" /> of Milgram's results invokes [[belief perseverance]] as the underlying factor.   What "people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity . . . as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures.'"

Inspired by the horrific events of Nazi Germany, Milgram's obedience experiments have been used to explain a range of social influences on the individual—including how police interrogators can get innocent people to confess to crimes they did not commit.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kassin | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = The social psychology of false confessions | journal = Social Issues and Policy Review | volume = 9 | pages = 24–49 | doi = 10.1111/sipr.12009 }}</ref> At the same time, these experiments have come under attack. Some critics questioned whether subjects sensed the unreality of the situation. Others questioned the relevance of the laboratory setting to the real world.

The most devastating criticisms involved the ethics of the basic experimental design. Professor Milgram, for his part, felt that such misgivings were traceable to the unsavory nature of his results: "Underlying the criticism of the experiment," Milgram wrote, "is an alternative model of human nature, one holding that when confronted with a choice between hurting others and complying with authority, normal people reject authority."<ref>{{Cite book|title = Obedience to Authority|last = Milgram|first = Stanley|publisher = Harper & Row|year = 1974|location = New York|page = 169}}</ref>

Daniel Raver looks back:<blockquote>Even though Milgram's personal interests were diverse, his greatest contribution to psychology came through one set of experiments, but in that set he contributed monumentally.  He helped justify a science some dismiss as unimportant, contributed to the understanding of humanity, and, even if by way of attacks against him, contributed to the consideration of the treatment of research participants.</blockquote>

==Small-world phenomenon==
{{main|Small-world experiment}}
The [[six degrees of separation]] concept was examined in Milgram's 1967 "small-world experiment", which tracked chains of acquaintances in the United States. In the experiment, Milgram sent several packages to 160 random people living in Omaha, Nebraska, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a set final individual, a stockbroker from Boston, Massachusetts. Each "starter" received instructions to mail a folder via the U.S. Post Office to a recipient, but with some rules. Starters could only mail the folder to someone they actually knew personally on a first-name basis. When doing so, each starter instructed their recipient to mail the folder ahead to one of the latter's first-name acquaintances with the same instructions, with the hope that their acquaintance might by some chance know the target recipient.

Given that starters knew only the target recipient's name and address, they had a seemingly impossible task.  Milgram monitored the progress of each chain via returned "tracer" postcards, which allowed him to track the progression of each letter. Surprisingly, he found that the very first folder reached the target in just four days and took only two intermediate acquaintances. Overall, Milgram reported that chains varied in length from two to ten intermediate acquaintances, with a median of five intermediate acquaintances (i.e. six degrees of separation) between the original sender and the destination recipient.

Milgram's "six degrees" theory has been severely criticized. He did not follow up on many of the sent packages, and as a result, scientists are unconvinced that there are merely "six degrees" of separation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uaf.edu/northern/big_world.html |title=Could It Be A Big World After All? |publisher=Uaf.edu |access-date=June 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301152432/http://www.uaf.edu/northern/big_world.html |archive-date=March 1, 2009 }}</ref> Elizabeth DeVita–Raebu has discussed potential problems with Milgram's experiment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elizabeth DeVita–Raebu |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/feb/if-osama.s-only-6-degrees-away-why-can.t-we-find-him |title=If Osama's Only 6 Degrees Away, Why Can't We Find Him? &#124; Human Origins |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=January 28, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

In 2008, a study by Microsoft showed that the average chain of contacts between users of its '.NET Messenger Service' (later called [[Microsoft Messenger service]]) was 6.6 people.<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=0803.0939 |title=Planetary-Scale Views on an Instant-Messaging Network|author1=Jure Leskovec|author2=Eric Horvitz|class=physics.soc-ph|year=2008}}</ref>

==Lost letter experiment==
Milgram developed a technique, called the "lost letter" experiment, for measuring how helpful people are to strangers who are not present, and their attitudes toward various groups.  Several sealed and stamped letters were planted in public places, addressed to various entities, such as individuals, favorable organizations like medical research institutes, and stigmatized organizations such as "Friends of the Nazi Party".  Milgram found most of the letters addressed to individuals and favorable organizations were mailed, while most of those addressed to stigmatized organizations were not.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDPftmVO5lYC |title=Social Research Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches |author=Harvey Russell Bernard |access-date=May 5, 2016|isbn=9780761914037 |year=2000 }}</ref><ref name="everything1">{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Stanley%2520Milgram |title=Stanley Milgram |publisher=Everything2.com |access-date=June 22, 2010}}</ref>

==Anti-social behavior experiment==
In 1970–71, Milgram conducted experiments which attempted to find a correlation between [[media consumption]] (in this case, watching television) and anti-social behavior.  The experiment presented the opportunity to steal money, donate to charity, or neither, and tested whether the rate of each choice was influenced by watching similar actions in the ending of a specially crafted episode of the popular series ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]''.<ref name="everything1"/>

==Cyranoids==
{{main|Cyranoid}}
In 1977 Milgram began piloting an experimental procedure that aimed to operationalize the mind-body fusion fantasy explored in the [[Edmond Rostand]] play [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|''Cyrano de Bergerac'']]. In the story, Cyrano supplies Christian with amorous prose so that they may jointly woo Roxane (each being incapable, given their respective physical and linguistic limitations, of doing so on their own).

Milgram trained [[Speech shadowing|speech shadowers]] to replicate in real-time spontaneous prose supplied by a remote "source" by-way-of discreet radio transmission during face-to-face dialogue with naïve "interactants".<ref>Milgram, S. (1984). Cyranoids. In Milgram (Ed), The individual in a social world. New York: McGraw-Hill</ref> In homage to Cyrano, he referred to the hybrid agent formed by combining the words of one individual with the body of another as a "[[cyranoid]]". In his studies, interactants repeatedly failed to detect that their interlocutors were merely speech shadowing for third parties, implicitly and explicitly attributing to them communicative autonomy. Milgram referred to this phenomenon as the "cyranic illusion". This illusion held even in circumstances involving high disparity between shadower and source, such as when he sourced for child shadowers while being interviewed by panels of teachers (naïve to the deception) tasked with assessing each child's intellectual abilities.

Milgram hoped that the cyranoid method could evolve into a useful means of interactively exploring phenomena related to social behavior and self-perception (e.g., racial, gender, and age-based [[Stereotype|stereotyping]] and [[Behavioural confirmation|behavioral confirmation]]).

In 1975, [[CBS]] presented a made-for-television movie about obedience experiments, ''[[The Tenth Level]]'', with [[William Shatner]] as Stephen Hunter, a Milgram-like scientist. Milgram was a consultant for the film, though his personal life did not resemble that of the Shatner character. In this film, incidents were portrayed that never occurred in the followup to the real-life experiment, including a subject's psychotic episode and the main character saying that he regretted the experiment. When asked about the film, Milgram told one of his graduate students, [[Sharon Presley]], that he was not happy with the film and told her that he did not want his name to be used in the credits.

In 1986, musician [[Peter Gabriel]] wrote a song called "We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)", referring mistakenly to the percentage of test subjects who refused to continue administering shocks. Gabriel's intent was optimistic: not everyone was willing to obey authority and shock to the highest level. The actual percentage was 35. Quoted in an article in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine in September 1986:

<blockquote>"At first this seems a very negative thing," says Gabriel, "but I was comforted that some had the strength to rebel, and in the ''So'' version of the song, which I’ve been performing in concert since around 1980, the emphasis is shifted to the positive side."<ref>{{cite web | title=Gabriel | work=Spin Magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=772AV6upth4C&q=1986%20gabriel%20tour%20milgram's%2037&pg=PA70 | access-date=2015-09-12| last1=Media | first1=Spin L.L.C | date=September 1986 }}</ref></blockquote>

[[Milgram experiment|Milgram 18]] was reproduced to test the participants in a 2008 television special ''[[The Heist (Derren Brown special)|The Heist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derren-brown-the-specials/episode-guide/series-19/episode-1 |title=Derren Brown: The Specials - Derren Brown: The Heist |publisher=Channel 4 |access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref> Created by [[Derren Brown]] and [[Andy Nyman]] for British station [[Channel 4]], the Milgram experiment helped determine which candidates were the most responsive to authority. The four most responsive and psychologically sound candidates at the end of the show were indirectly given the opportunity to rob a (fake) armoured bank van.

In March 2010, French television channel [[France 2]] broadcast ''Jusqu'où va la télé'', describing the results of a fake game show that they had run 80 times (each time independently, and with a new contestant and audience). The contestants received instructions to administer what they thought would be near fatal electric shocks to another "contestant" (really an actor) when that other contestant erred on memorized word-associations. Encouraged by the show's host and by an unprimed studio audience, the vast majority followed instructions even as the "victim" screamed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7457780/French-contestants-torture-each-other-on-TV-Game-of-Death.html |title=French contestants torture each other on TV Game of Death |newspaper=Telegraph |date=March 17, 2010 |access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref>

In 2010, luxury brand [[Enfants Perdus]] released a collection called "Milgram", in which the designers drew themes and inspiration from the Milgram experiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enfantsperdus.com/collections.html |title=Collections |publisher=Enfants Perdus |access-date=May 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602025437/http://www.enfantsperdus.com/collections.html |archive-date=June 2, 2016 }}</ref> The design team has referenced the discussions about the human condition and the revelations of the human condition in numerous interviews.

In 2015, an experimental biopic about Milgram called ''[[Experimenter (film)|Experimenter]]'' was released, directed by [[Michael Almereyda]].  [[Peter Sarsgaard]] stars as Stanley Milgram.
