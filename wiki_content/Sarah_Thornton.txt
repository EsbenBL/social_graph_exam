== ''Club Cultures: Music, Media, and Subcultural Capital'' ==
In ''Club Cultures: Music, Media, and Subcultural Capital'' (1995), Thornton examines the shift from live to recorded music for public dancing (from record shops to raves) and the resistance to recording technology's enculturation of the "authentic," valued cultural form. The book also analyzes the dynamics of "[[hip (slang)|hipness]]," critiquing [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s theory of [[cultural capital]] with her own formulation of "subcultural capital." The study responds to earlier works such as [[Dick Hebdige]]'s 1979 book ''[[Subculture: The Meaning of Style]].'' It does not see media as a reflection of social groups, but as integral to their formation.<ref name=":1" /><blockquote>
Contrary to youth subcultural ideologies, "subcultures" do not [[germinate]] from a seed and grow by force of their own energy into mysterious ‘movements’ only to be belatedly digested by the media. Rather, media and other culture industries are there and effective right from the start. They are central to the process of subcultural formation.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|title=Club cultures: music, media and subcultural capital|last=Thornton|first=Sarah|publisher=Polity Press|year=1995|isbn=9780745614434|location=Cambridge, UK|page=117}}</ref></blockquote>The book is described by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Tony Jefferson as "theoretically innovative" and "conceptually adventurous".<ref>{{Citation|title=Resistance through rituals: youth subcultures in post-war Britain|year=2006|last1=Hall|last2=Jefferson|first1=Stuart|first2=Tony|orig-year=1975|pages=xix–xx|contribution=Introduction|edition=2nd|location=New York City Oxford, UK|publisher=Routledge|oclc=489757261|author-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|editor-last1=Hall|editor-first1=Stuart|editor-last2=Jefferson|editor-first2=Tony|editor-link1=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)}} {{ISBN|9781134346530}}.</ref>

== ''Seven Days in the Art World'' ==
''[[The New York Times]]'<nowiki/>'' Karen Rosenberg said that ''Seven Days in the Art World'' (2008) "was reported and written in a heated market, but it is poised to endure as a work of sociology...[Thornton] pushes her well-chosen subjects to explore the questions ‘What is an artist?’ and ‘What makes a work of art great?’"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/books/28artbw.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all|title=Words worth a thousand paintings|date=28 November 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]&nbsp; Holiday Gift Guide|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Karen|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref>

In the UK, Ben Lewis wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that ''Seven Days'' was "a Robert Altmanesque panorama of...the most important cultural phenomenon of the last ten years".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article4875086.ece|title=Seven days in the art world by Sarah Thornton ''(book review)''|date=5 October 2008|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|url-access=subscription |last1=Lewis|first1=Ben|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref> While Peter Aspden argued in the ''Financial Times'' that "[Thornton] does well to resist the temptation to draw any glib, overarching conclusions.

[[András Szántó]] reviewed ''Seven Days in the Art World'': "Underneath [the book's] glossy surface lurks a sociologist's concern for institutional narratives as well as the ethnographer's conviction that entire social structures can be apprehended in seemingly frivolous patterns of speech or dress."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.artworldsalon.com/blog/2008/10/message-in-a-bottle/|title=Message in a bottle ''(book review)''|date=29 October 2008|work=ArtWorld Salon|last1=Szántó|first1=András|author-link1=András Szántó|access-date=28 June 2009}}</ref>

== ''33 Artists in 3 Acts'' ==
Thornton's book ''33 Artists in 3 Acts'' (2014) looks at the lives and work of figures "from all over the art ecosystem, from the market-driven mogul ([[Jeff Koons]]) to the profoundly intellectual performance artist ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] professor [[Andrea Fraser]]) to the impish prankster (Italian conceptual artist [[Maurizio Cattelan]].)"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-sarah-thornton-20141123-story.html|title='33 Artists' paints behind-the-scene picture of the art world|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> The central question guiding the book is: What defines an artist in the 21st century?

''33 Artists in 3 Acts'' received praise for its academic approach and "attention to detail and illustration of subtleties that bring her interviewees to life....
