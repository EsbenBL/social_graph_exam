'''Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born June 5 1961) is an American-British professor of [[political science]], and head of the Department of Government at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Professor Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey (FBA) |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/cheryl-schonhardt-bailey |website=London School of Economics and Political Science |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref>

She has published many books and articles on British trade policy in the nineteenth century, most notably ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081006003150/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10874 From the Corn Laws to Free Trade: Interests, Ideas, and Institutions in Historical Perspective.]''Her articles appear in [[American Political Science Review]], ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100422222256/http://www.princeton.edu/~piirs/publications/world_politics.html World Politics]'', the ''[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=JPS British Journal of Political Science]'', ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050603021106/http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/ Political Analysis]'', [http://www.apsanet.org/content_2819.cfm PS: Political Science and Politics], and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110608073243/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0264-2824 Parliamentary History]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey |url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SkZCfgIAAAAJ&hl=en |website=Google Scholar Citations |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref>

She obtained her bachelor's degree in political science from [[Boise State University]], and both her MA and PhD degrees in Political Science from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=https://personal.lse.ac.uk/schonhar/docs/cheryl_schonhardt-bailey_cv.pdf |website=Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref>

Her current research interests include the quantification and spatial analysis of textual data in the form of  (a) political deliberation, particularly in monetary policy making settings (e.g., the [[United States Congress]], the [[Federal Open Market Committee]]); (b) speeches of leading politicians ([[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[John Kerry]]), and [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]]; and (c) legislative debates. By measuring the words, arguments and debates of politicians and policy makers, she aims to gauge the extent to which ideas, interests and institutions shape political behaviour.

She was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy|fellow]] of the [[British Academy]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-fellowship-reaches-1000-42-new-uk-fellows-are-welcomed|title=British Academy Fellowship reaches 1,000 as 42 new UK Fellows are welcomed|date=16 Jul 2015}}</ref>
