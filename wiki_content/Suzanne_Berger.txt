'''Suzanne Doris Berger''' (born 1939)<ref name=AAAS /> is an American [[political scientist]]. She is the Raphael Dorman and Helen Starbuck Professor of Political Science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and director of the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative. A leading authority in [[comparative politics]] and [[political economy]], she has pointed to the centrality of politics in mediating and redirecting ostensibly transcendent forces, such as economic modernization and [[globalization]].

==Education==
She attended [[Antioch College]] for two years before transferring to the [[University of Chicago]] where she received her [[B.A.]] with honors in 1960. She then studied at [[Harvard University]] where she received both an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sociology.columbia.edu/pdf-files/whitfordcv.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180816/http://www.sociology.columbia.edu/pdf-files/whitfordcv.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-21 |df= }}</ref>

==Career==
Berger joined the faculty at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dizikes |first1=Peter |title=In Profile: Suzanne Berger |url=http://news.mit.edu/2011/profile-berger-1011 |website=news.mit.edu |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> She published her first book, Peasants against Politics, in 1972, which included articles related to French politics in light of industrialization.<ref name = "Dizikes">{{cite web |author1=Peter Dizikes |title=Standing Up for Manufacturing |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/426423/standing-up-for-manufacturing/ |website=technologyreview.com |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |date=December 20, 2011}}</ref> During her time at MIT, she was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1978.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> By 1995, she was elected Director of MIT's International Science and Technology Initiative and appointed the Raphael Dorman and Helen Starbuck Professor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Provost names Berger to direct new international program |url=http://news.mit.edu/1995/berger-0125 |website=news.mit.edu |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |date=January 25, 1998}}</ref> She also developed a new subject called "Globalization" to be taught in the political science department.<ref>{{cite web |title=DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE |url=http://web.mit.edu/annualreports/pres98/11.14.html |website=mit.edu |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |date=1998}}</ref>

During the 2002–03 academic year, she received the Dean's Award for Distinguished Service to the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Science.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Award Winning Political Science Faculty, Academic Year 2002–2003 |journal=PS: Political Science & Politics |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=741–746 |doi=10.1017/S1049096503003044 |year=2003 }}</ref> In her 2005 book ''How We Compete'', based on a five-year study by the MIT Industrial Performance Center, she presents the result of case studies of over 500 international companies to discover which practices are succeeding in today’s global economy, which are failing, and why. She paints a far more complicated picture than the black-and-white presentations by most promoters and opponents of globalization. Cheap labor is not the answer, [[offshoring]] is not a fatality, and the avenues open to companies are much wider than is generally imagined.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Sarah H |title=Professor sizes up competition in new book |url=http://news.mit.edu/2006/berger-0208 |website=news.mit.edu |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |date=February 8, 2006}}</ref>  She was appointed chevalier of France's [[Légion d'Honneur]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Stephanie Schorow |title=Berger receives French Legion of Honor medal |url=http://news.mit.edu/2009/french-award-0127 |website=news.mit.edu |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |date=January 27, 2009}}</ref>
