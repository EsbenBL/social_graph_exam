'''Emily Greene Balch''' (January 8, 1867 – January 9, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] [[economics|economist]],  [[sociologist]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]]. Balch combined an academic career at [[Wellesley College]] with a long-standing interest in social issues such as [[poverty]], [[Child labour|child labor]], and [[immigration]], as well as settlement work to uplift poor immigrants and reduce juvenile delinquency.

She moved into the peace movement at the start of World War I in 1914, and began collaborating with [[Jane Addams]] of Chicago. She became a central leader of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) based in Switzerland,<ref>{{Citation|last=Confortini|first=Catia C.|title=Race, Gender, Empire, and War in the International Thought of Emily Greene Balch|date=2021|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/womens-international-thought-a-new-history/race-gender-empire-and-war-in-the-international-thought-of-emily-greene-balch/26A5AA586D587FE8383CB111BA357B28|work=Women's International Thought: A New History|pages=244–265|editor-last=Rietzler|editor-first=Katharina|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-49469-4|access-date=2021-03-06|editor2-last=Owens|editor2-first=Patricia}}</ref> for which she won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1946.<ref name="Clark1987">{{cite book|author=Judith Freeman Clark|title=Almanac of American Women in the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryMqAAAAYAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-022658-7|page=88}}</ref>

==Life==
Balch was born to a prominent Yankee family in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]], Massachusetts, a neighborhood of Boston,<ref name="Clark1987"/> the daughter of Francis V. and Ellen (née Noyes) Balch. Her father was a successful lawyer and  one time secretary to United States Senator [[Charles Sumner]].<ref>1870 United States Federal Census</ref> She graduated from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1889 after reading widely in the classics and languages and focusing on economics. She did graduate work in Paris and published her research as ''Public Assistance of the Poor in France'' (1893). She did settlement housework in Boston before deciding on an academic career.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

She then studied at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Berlin, and began teaching at [[Wellesley College]] in 1896. She focused on immigration, consumption, and the economic roles of women. In 1913, she was appointed to serve as Professor of Economics at Wellesley, following the resignation of political economist [[Katharine Coman]], who had founded the Department.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/05/04/issue.html?action=click&contentCollection=Archives&module=ArticleEndCTA&region=ArchiveBody&pgtype=article|title=Farewell dinner to Miss Coman|date=4 May 1913|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref> That same year, Balch was promoted from Associate Professor to Professor of Political Economy and of Political and Social Science.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1913/03/30/archives/new-wellesley-dean-miss-alice-vinton-walte-chosen-by-the-board-of.html|title=New Wellesley dean|date=30 March 1913|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

Balch served on numerous state commissions, such as the first commission on minimum wages for women. She was a leader of the [[Women's Trade Union League]], which supported women who belonged to labor unions. She published a major sociological study of ''Our Slavic Fellow Citizens'' in 1910.<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-04-29}} including the Nobel Lecture, April 7, 1948 ''Toward Human Unity or Beyond Nationalism''
</ref>

She was a longtime pacifist, and was a participant in Henry Ford's International Committee on Mediation. When the United States entered the war, she became a political activist opposing conscription in espionage legislation, and supporting the civil liberties of conscientious objectors. She collaborated with [[Jane Addams]] in the Women's Peace party and numerous other groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/58fyh3nm9780252028885.html|title=UI Press {{!}} Jane Addams, Emily G.

In a letter to the president of Wellesley, she wrote we should follow "the ways of Jesus." Her spiritual thoughts were that American economy was  "far from being in harmony with the principles of Jesus which we profess."<ref>Mercedes Moritz Randall, ''Improper Bostonian: Emily Greene Balch, Nobel Peace Laureate, 1946'' (1964) pp. 364, 378.</ref> Wellesley College terminated her contract in 1919. Balch served as an editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', a well-known magazine of political commentary.<ref name="Nobel"/>

Balch converted from [[Unitarianism]] and became a [[Quaker]] in 1921. She stated, "Religion seems to me one of the most interesting things in life, one of the most puzzling, richest and thrilling fields of human thought and speculation... religious experience and thought need also a light a day and sunshine and a companionable sharing with others of which it seems to me there is generally too little... The Quaker worship at its best seems to me give opportunities for this sort of sharing without profanation."<ref>Randall, ''Improper Bostonian'', p. 60</ref>

Her major achievements were just beginning, as she became an American leader of the international peace movement. In 1919, Balch played a central role in the International Congress of Women. It changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and was based in [[Geneva]].

She was hired by the League as its first international Secretary-Treasurer, administering the organization's activities. She helped set up summer schools on peace education and created new branches in over 50 countries. She cooperated with the newly established [[League of Nations]] regarding drug control, aviation, refugees, and disarmament. In World War II, she favored Allied victory and did not criticize the war effort, but she did support the rights of [[conscientious objector]]s.<ref>Suzanne Niemeyer, editor, ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography: vol. IV'' (1990) pp. 1806–14</ref>
