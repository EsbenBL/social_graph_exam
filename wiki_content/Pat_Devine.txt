'''Pat Devine''' is a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[Socialist economics|socialist economist]] concerned mainly with [[industrial economics]] and [[comparative economic systems]].

Devine made one of the most thorough descriptions of a future [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalistic economy]] which is based upon [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]] by those affected by the use of it, with [[Economic system|allocation]] of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[capital goods]] made by a form of [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized participatory economic planning]] called negotiated coordination of those at the most localised level of economic production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gesd.free.fr/devine.pdf |title=Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> This model is notable for specifying an array of social ownership rights and an analytic distinction between [[market forces]] and market relations. Another key aspect of Devine’s work has been a close reading of the notorious [[Economic calculation problem|economic calculation debate]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/bernard.leask/renewal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313140029/http://www3.sympatico.ca/bernard.leask/renewal.html |archivedate=2006-03-13 }}</ref> and later attempts to offer a serious response{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} to the objections by the [[Austrian school|Austrian school of economic theory]]. Similarly, Devine's work on the subject of industrial planning has largely constituted an extended critique of the Austrian theory of [[entrepreneurship]]. In this vein, Devine has argued that "a major weakness in the modern Austrian School's emphasis on the need for tacit knowledge to be socially mobilised by entrepreneurs participating in the market process is that participation is restricted to those with access to [[Capital (economics)|capital]], thus ignoring the tacit knowledge of the majority of people".<ref>Devine, Pat. "Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination, Science & Society 2002</ref>

Devine is a joint author of the book ''An Introduction to Industrial Economics'' and author of ''Democracy and Economic Planning''.  He and collaborators Fikret Adaman and Begum Ozkaynak are particularly notable for their elaboration of a visionary socialist model that they call participatory planning. The most significant influences on Devine's economic thought were [[Karl Marx]] and the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition associated with [[Antonio Gramsci]] as well as the [[Economic anthropology|economo-anthropologic theories]] of [[Karl Polanyi]].

As of 2008, Devine is an honorary research fellow at [[Manchester University]]. He began his academic studies in economics at [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]].
