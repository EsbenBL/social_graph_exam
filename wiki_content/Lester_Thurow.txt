Thurow was a longtime advocate of a political and economic system of the Japanese and European type, in which governmental involvement in the direction of the economy is far more extensive than is the case in the [[United States]] – a model that has come to be known as "Third Way" philosophy. Thurow supported a more universal patent system as a requirement for a knowledge-based economy, where governments would assess the value of infringements of intellectual property against their companies by competitors in foreign jurisdictions and allow these companies to match that.<ref name=thurow/><ref>[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/view.html?pg=3 ''Wired'' Magazine – Interview and Description of Thurow's Patents Plan]</ref>
