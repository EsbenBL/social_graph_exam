Ivan Pavlov, the eldest of eleven children,<ref name="Credo Reference">{{cite book|title=Ivan Petrovich Pavlov|work=Biographical Dictionary of Psychology|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0415285612|editor1=Sheehy, Noel |editor2=Chapman, Antony J. |editor3=Conroy, Wendy A. }}</ref> was born in [[Ryazan]], [[Russian Empire]]. His father, Peter Dmitrievich Pavlov (1823–1899), was a village [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian orthodox]] priest.<ref name=nobelbio>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine 1904 Ivan Pavlov|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1904/pavlov-bio.html|publisher=Nobelmedia|access-date=2 February 2012}}</ref> His mother, Varvara Ivanovna Uspenskaya (1826–1890), was a devoted homemaker. As a child, Pavlov willingly participated in house duties such as doing the dishes and taking care of his siblings. He loved to garden, ride his bicycle, row, swim, and play [[gorodki]]; he devoted his summer vacations to these activities.<ref>{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|p=8}}</ref> Although able to read by the age of seven, Pavlov was seriously injured when he fell from a high wall onto a stone pavement. As a result of the injuries he sustained<ref>{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|p=9}}</ref> he did not begin formal schooling until he was 11 years old.<ref name="Credo Reference"/>

Pavlov attended the Ryazan church school before entering the local theological seminary. In 1870, however, he left the seminary without graduating to attend the university at St. Petersburg. There he enrolled in the physics and math department and took natural science courses. In his fourth year, his first research project on the physiology of the nerves of the pancreas<ref>{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|pp=9–11}}</ref> won him a prestigious university award. In 1875, Pavlov completed his course with an outstanding record and received the degree of Candidate of Natural Sciences. Impelled by his overwhelming interest in physiology, Pavlov decided to continue his studies and proceeded to the [[Imperial Academy of Medical Surgery]]. While at the academy, Pavlov became an assistant to his former teacher, [[Elias von Cyon]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Todes, Daniel Philip |title=Pavlov's Physiology Factory: Experiment, Interpretation, Laboratory Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FpobBC2V1oC&pg=PA50|year=2002|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6690-6|pages=50–}}</ref> He left the department when de Cyon was replaced by another instructor.

After some time, Pavlov obtained a position as a laboratory assistant to Konstantin Nikolaevich Ustimovich at the physiological department of the Veterinary Institute.<ref>{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|p=12}}</ref> For two years, Pavlov investigated the circulatory system for his medical dissertation.<ref name="Credo Reference"/> In 1878, Professor [[Sergey Botkin|S. P. Botkin]], a famous Russian clinician, invited the gifted young physiologist to work in the physiological laboratory as the clinic's chief. In 1879, Pavlov graduated from the Medical Military Academy with a gold medal award for his research work. After a competitive examination, Pavlov won a fellowship at the academy for postgraduate work.<ref>{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|p=13}}</ref> The fellowship and his position as director of the Physiological Laboratory at Botkin's clinic enabled Pavlov to continue his research work. In 1883, he presented his doctor's thesis on the subject of ''The centrifugal nerves of the heart'' and posited the idea of ''nervism'' and the basic principles on the trophic function of the nervous system. Additionally, his collaboration with the Botkin Clinic produced evidence of a basic pattern in the regulation of reflexes in the activity of circulatory organs.

==Influences==
He was inspired to pursue a scientific career by [[Dmitry Pisarev|D. I. Pisarev]], a literary critique and natural science advocate of the time and [[Ivan Sechenov|I. M. Sechenov]], a Russian physiologist, whom Pavlov described as 'The father of physiology'.<ref name=nobelbio/>

==Career==
After completing his doctorate, Pavlov went to Germany, where he studied in [[Leipzig]] with [[Carl Ludwig]] and Eimear Kelly in the Heidenhain laboratories in [[Breslau]]. He remained there from 1884 to 1886. Heidenhain was studying digestion in dogs, using an exteriorized section of the stomach. However, Pavlov perfected the technique by overcoming the problem of maintaining the external nerve supply. The exteriorized section became known as the Heidenhain or Pavlov pouch.<ref name="Credo Reference"/>

In 1886, Pavlov returned to Russia to look for a new position. His application for the chair of physiology at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] was rejected. Eventually, Pavlov was offered the chair of pharmacology at [[Tomsk University]] in Siberia and at the [[University of Warsaw]] in Poland. He did not take up either post. In 1890, he was appointed the role of professor of Pharmacology at the Military Medical Academy and occupied the position for five years.<ref name="Asratyan 1953 17–18">{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|pp=17–18}}</ref> In 1891, Pavlov was invited to the [[Institute of Experimental Medicine]] in St. Petersburg to organize and direct the Department of Physiology.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Windholz|first1=George|title=Ivan P.

Over a 45-year period, under his direction, the institute became one of the most important centers of physiological research in the world.<ref name=nobelbio/> Pavlov continued to direct the Department of Physiology at the institute, while taking up the chair of physiology at the Medical Military Academy in 1895. Pavlov would head the physiology department at the academy continuously for three decades.<ref name="Asratyan 1953 17–18"/>

Starting in 1901, Pavlov was nominated over four successive years for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He did not win the prize until 1904 because his previous nominations were not specific to any discovery, but based on a variety of laboratory findings.<ref name="Credo Reference2">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ivan Pavlov|encyclopedia=Science in the Early Twentieth Century: An Encyclopedia.}}</ref> When Pavlov received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] it was specified that he did so "in recognition of his work on the physiology of digestion, through which knowledge on vital aspects of the subject has been transformed and enlarged".<ref name="Nobel_1904"/>

It was at the Institute of Experimental Medicine that Pavlov carried out his classical experiments on the digestive glands. That is how he eventually won the Nobel prize mentioned above.<ref>{{harvp|Asratyan|1953|p=18}}</ref> Pavlov investigated the [[stomach|gastric]] function of dogs, and later, children,<ref>{{cite book|editor=Reagan, Leslie A.|title=Medicine's moving pictures|year=2007|publisher=University of Rochester Press|location=Rochester, NY|isbn=978-1-58046-234-1|page=285|display-editors=etal}}</ref> by externalizing a [[salivary gland]] so he could collect, measure, and analyze the [[saliva]] and what response it had to food under different conditions. He noticed that the dogs tended to salivate before food was actually delivered to their mouths, and set out to investigate this "psychic secretion", as he called it.

[[File:Ivan Pavlov NLM2.jpg|thumb|Ivan Pavlov in 1890]]
Pavlov's laboratory housed a full-scale kennel for the experimental animals. Pavlov was interested in observing their long-term physiological processes. This required keeping them alive and healthy to conduct chronic experiments, as he called them. These were experiments over time, designed to understand the normal functions of animals. This was a new kind of study, because previously experiments had been "acute," meaning that the dog went through [[vivisection]] which ultimately killed the animal in the process.<ref name="Credo Reference2"/>

A 1921 article by S. Morgulis in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' was critical of Pavlov's work, raising concerns about the environment in which these experiments had been performed. Based on a report from [[H. G. Wells]], claiming that Pavlov grew potatoes and carrots in his lab, the article stated, "It is gratifying to be assured that Professor Pavlov is raising potatoes only as a pastime and still gives the best of his genius to scientific investigation".<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.53.1360.74|pmid=17790056|title=Professor Pavlov|year=1921 |author=Morgulis, S.|journal=Science|volume=53|issue=1360|pages=74|bibcode=1921Sci....53Q..74M|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448261}}</ref> That same year, Pavlov began holding laboratory meetings known as the 'Wednesday meetings' at which he spoke frankly on many topics, including his views on psychology. These meetings lasted until he died in 1936.<ref name="Credo Reference2"/>

Pavlov was highly regarded by the Soviet government, and he was able to continue his research until he reached a considerable age. He was praised by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/jan/24.htm|title=Concerning The Conditions Ensuring The Research Work Of Academician I.

[[File:Nesterov-Pavlov.jpg|thumb|260px|Pavlov in 1935, by [[Mikhail Nesterov]]|left]]
In 1923, he stated that he would not sacrifice even the hind leg of a frog to the type of social experiment that the regime was conducting in Russia. Four years later he wrote to Stalin, protesting at what was being done to Russian intellectuals and saying he was ashamed to be a Russian.<ref name="cavendish9"/> After the murder of [[Sergei Kirov]] in 1934, Pavlov wrote several letters to [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] criticizing the mass persecutions which followed and asking for the reconsideration of cases pertaining to several people he knew personally.<ref name="cavendish9"/>

Conscious until his final moment, Pavlov asked one of his students to sit beside his bed and to record the circumstances of his dying. He wanted to create unique evidence of subjective experiences of this terminal phase of life.<ref>Chance, Paul (1988). ''Learning and Behaviour''. Wadsworth Pub. Co. {{ISBN|0-534-08508-3}}. p. 48.</ref> Pavlov died of [[double pneumonia]] at the age of 86. He was given a grand funeral, and his study and laboratory were preserved as a museum in his honour.<ref name="cavendish9"/> His grave is in the Literatorskie mostki (writers' footways) section of [[Volkovo Cemetery]] in St. Petersburg.

==Reflex system research==
{{for|broader coverage of 'Pavlovian response'|Classical conditioning}}
{{See also|Reflex}}

Pavlov contributed to many areas of physiology and neurological sciences. Most of his work involved research in [[temperament]], [[classical conditioning|conditioning]] and [[Reflex action|involuntary reflex actions]].
Pavlov performed and directed experiments on digestion, eventually publishing ''The Work of the Digestive Glands'' in 1897, after 12 years of research. His experiments earned him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1904/press.html |title=1904 Nobel prize laureates |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=10 December 1904 |access-date=15 April 2012}}</ref> These experiments included surgically extracting portions of the digestive system from animals, severing nerve bundles to determine the effects, and implanting [[fistula]]s between digestive organs and an external pouch to examine the organ's contents. This research served as a base for broad research on the [[digestive system]].

Further work on reflex actions involved involuntary reactions to stress and pain.

==Research on types and properties of nervous systems==
[[File:One of Pavlov's dogs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|One of Pavlov's dogs with a surgically implanted [[cannula]] to measure [[saliva]]tion, [[taxidermy|preserved]] in the Pavlov Museum in [[Ryazan]], Russia]]
Pavlov was always interested in biomarkers of temperament types described by Hippocrates and Galen. He called these biomarkers "properties of nervous systems" and identified three main properties: (1) strength, (2) mobility of nervous processes and (3) a balance between excitation and inhibition and derived four types based on these three properties. He extended the definitions of the four temperament types under study at the time: phlegmatic, choleric, sanguine, and melancholic, updating the names to "the strong and impetuous type, the strong equilibrated and quiet type, the strong equilibrated and lively type, and the weak type."

Pavlov and his researchers observed and began the study of [[transmarginal inhibition]] (TMI), the body's natural response of shutting down when exposed to overwhelming stress or pain by electric shock.<ref>Mazlish, Bruce (1995), ''Fourth Discontinuity: The Co-Evolution of Humans and Machines'', Yale University Press, pp. 122–123, {{ISBN|0-300-06512-4}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2021}} This research showed how all temperament types responded to the stimuli the same way, but different temperaments move through the responses at different times. He commented "that the most basic inherited difference ... was how soon they reached this shutdown point and that the quick-to-shut-down have a fundamentally different type of nervous system."<ref>Rokhin, L, Pavlov, I and Popov, Y. (1963), ''Psychopathology and Psychiatry'', Foreign Languages Publication House: Moscow.</ref>

==Pavlov on education==
The basics of Pavlov's classical conditioning serve as a historical backdrop for current learning theories.<ref>{{cite book|last1=William Moore|first1=J.|last2=Manning|first2=S. A.|last3=Smith|first3=W. I.|isbn=978-0070429024|title=Conditioning and Instrumental Learning|date=1978|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|location=New York, NY|pages=52–61}}</ref> However, the Russian physiologist's initial interest in classical conditioning occurred almost by accident during one of his experiments on digestion in dogs.<ref name=Tarpy>{{cite book|last1=Tarpy|first1=Roger M.|title=Basic Principles of Learning|date=1975|publisher=Scott, Foresman and Company|location=Glenview, IL|pages=15–17}}</ref> Considering that Pavlov worked closely with animals throughout many of his experiments, his early contributions were primarily about animal learning. However, the fundamentals of classical conditioning have been examined across many different organisms, including humans.<ref name=Tarpy /> The basic underlying principles of Pavlov's classical conditioning have extended to a variety of settings, such as classrooms and learning environments.

[[Classical conditioning]] focuses on using preceding conditions to alter behavioral reactions. The principles underlying classical conditioning have influenced preventative antecedent control strategies used in the classroom.<ref name=Kern>{{cite journal|last1=Kern|first1=Lee|last2=Clemens|first2=Nathan H.|title=Antecedent strategies to promote appropriate classroom behavior|journal=Psychology in the Schools|date=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=65–75|doi=10.1002/pits.20206}}</ref> Classical conditioning set the groundwork for the present day behavior modification practices, such as antecedent control. Antecedent events and conditions are defined as those conditions occurring before the behavior.<ref name=Alberto>{{cite book|last1=Alberto|first1=Paul A.|last2=Troutman|first2=Anne C.|title=Applied Behavior Analysis for Teachers|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=New Jersey|edition=Ninth}}</ref> Pavlov's early experiments used manipulation of events or stimuli preceding behavior (i.e., a tone) to produce salivation in dogs much like teachers manipulate instruction and learning environments to produce positive behaviors or decrease maladaptive behaviors. Although he did not refer to the tone as an antecedent, Pavlov was one of the first scientists to demonstrate the relationship between environmental stimuli and behavioral responses. Pavlov systematically presented and withdrew stimuli to determine the antecedents that were eliciting responses, which is similar to the ways in which educational professionals conduct functional behavior assessments.<ref name=Stichter>{{cite journal|last1=Stichter|first1=Janine P.|last2=Randolph|first2=Jena K.|last3=Kay|first3=Denise|last4=Gage|first4=Nicholas|s2cid=31417515|title=The use of structural analysis to develop antcedent-based interventions for students with autism|journal=Journal of Austim Development Disroder|date=2009|volume=39|issue=6|pages=883–896|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0693-8|pmid=19191017}}<!--|access-date=7 July 2015--></ref> Antecedent strategies are supported by empirical evidence to operate implicitly within classroom environments. Antecedent-based interventions are supported by research to be preventative, and to produce immediate reductions in problem behaviors.<ref name=Kern />

==Legacy==
The concept for which Pavlov is famous is the "[[Classical conditioning|conditioned reflex]]" (or in his own words the ''conditional reflex''), which he developed jointly with his assistant Ivan Tolochinov in 1901 (although [[Edwin B. Twitmyer]], at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], published similar research in 1902, a year before Pavlov published his). The concept was developed after observing the rates of salivation in dogs. Pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them, rather than simply salivating in the presence of the food. If a buzzer or metronome was sounded before the food was given, the dog would later come to associate the sound with the presentation of the food and salivate upon the presentation of the sound stimulus alone.<ref>{{cite book

Tolochinov, whose own term for the phenomenon had been "reflex at a distance", communicated the results at the Congress of Natural Sciences in [[Helsinki]] in 1903.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pavlov |first= I.

As Pavlov's work became known in the West, particularly through the writings of [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]], the idea of "conditioning" as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of [[comparative psychology]], and the general approach to psychology that underlay it, [[behaviorism]]. Pavlov's work with classical conditioning was of huge influence to how humans perceive themselves, their behavior and learning processes and his studies of classical conditioning continue to be central to modern behavior therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Plaud, J. J.|author2=Wolpe, J. |year=1997|title=Pavlov's contributions to behavior therapy: The obvious and the not so obvious|journal=American Psychologist|volume= 52|issue=9|pages=966–972|pmid=9382243|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.9.966}}</ref> The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] observed that "[w]hether Pavlov's method's can be made to cover the whole of human behaviour is open to question, but at any rate they cover a very large field and within this field they have shown how to apply [[scientific method]]s with quantitative exactitude".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=The Scientific Outlook|date=1931|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|location=London|page=56}}</ref>

Pavlov's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science, but also popular culture. Pavlovian conditioning is a major theme in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s [[dystopian]] novel, ''[[Brave New World]]'', and in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''.

It is popularly believed that Pavlov always signaled the occurrence of food by ringing a bell. However, his writings record the use of a wide variety of stimuli, including electric shocks, [[whistle]]s, [[metronome]]s, [[tuning fork]]s, and a range of visual stimuli, in addition to the ring of a bell. In 1994, Catania cast doubt on whether Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his experiments.<ref>[[A. Charles Catania|Catania, A. Charles]] (1994); ''Query: Did Pavlov's Research Ring a Bell?'', Psycoloquy Newsletter, Tuesday, 7 June 1994</ref> Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlov's contemporaries [[Vladimir Bekhterev|Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev]] and John B. Watson. Roger K. Thomas, of the University of Georgia, however, said they had found "three additional references to Pavlov's use of a bell that strongly challenge Littman's argument".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?article=5.80 |author=Thomas, Roger K. |year=1994|title=Pavlov's dogs "dripped Saliva at the Sound of a Bell"|journal=Psycoloquy|volume= 5|issue=80}}</ref> In reply, Littman suggested that Catania's recollection, that Pavlov did not use a bell in research, was "convincing ... and correct".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?5.49 |author=Littman, Richard A. |year=1994|title=Bekhterev and Watson Rang Pavlov's Bell|journal=Psycoloquy|volume= 5|issue=49}}</ref>

In 1964 the psychologist [[H. J. Eysenck]] reviewed Pavlov's "Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes" for the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'': Volume I – "Twenty-five Years of Objective Study of the Higher Nervous Activity of Animals", Volume II – "Conditioned Reflexes and Psychiatry".<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5401.111-b|title=Pavlov's Writings|year=1964|last1=Eysenck|first1=H.

The Pavlov Institute of Physiology of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] was founded by Pavlov in 1925 and named after him following his death.<ref>[http://www.infran.ru/history_eng.htm Pavlov Institute of Physiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313175854/http://www.infran.ru/history_eng.htm |date=13 March 2015 }}. infran.ru</ref>

==Awards and honours==

==Personal life==
Ivan Pavlov married Seraphima Vasilievna Karchevskaya on 1 May 1881, whom he had met in 1878 or 1879 when she went to St. Petersburg to study at the Pedagogical Institute. Seraphima, called Sara for short, was born in 1855. In her later years, she suffered from ill health and died in 1947.

The first nine years of their marriage were marred by financial problems; Pavlov and his wife often had to stay with others to have a home, and for a time, the two lived apart so that they could find hospitality. Although their poverty caused despair, material welfare was a secondary consideration. Sara's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. When she conceived again, the couple took precautions, and she safely gave birth to their first child, a boy whom they named Mirchik; Sara became deeply depressed following Mirchik's sudden death in childhood.

Ivan and Sara eventually had four more children: Vladimir, Victor, Vsevolod, and Vera.<ref name=nobelbio/> Their youngest son, Vsevolod, died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 1935, only one year before his father.<ref>{{cite book|last=Babkin|first=B.P.|title=Pavlov, A Biography|year=1949|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago and London|pages=27–54|url=https://archive.org/details/pavlovabiography010332mbp|isbn=978-1406743975}}</ref> Pavlov was an atheist.<ref>Pavlov's follower E.M. Kreps asked him whether he was religious. Kreps writes that Pavlov smiled and replied: "Listen, good fellow, in regard to [claims of] my religiosity, my belief in God, my church attendance, there is no truth in it; it is sheer fantasy. I was a seminarian, and like the majority of seminarians, I became an unbeliever, an atheist in my school years."
