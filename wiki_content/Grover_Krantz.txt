'''Grover Sanders Krantz''' (November 5, 1931 – February 14, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[physical anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]]; he was one of few scientists not only to research [[Bigfoot]], but also to express his belief in the animal's existence. Throughout his professional career, Krantz authored more than 60 academic articles and 10 books on [[human evolution]],<ref name="Tyler">{{cite news |first=Donald |last=Tyler E. |title=An expert on human evolution, a long-distance driver |url=http://wsm.wsu.edu/stories/2002/August/krantz.html |newspaper=Washington State Magazine |publisher=Washington State University |date=August 2002 |access-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news |title=Grover Krantz |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1386841/Grover-Krantz.html |agency=Telegraph.co.uk |date=March 6, 2002 |access-date=September 12, 2009 |quote=He joined Washington State University in 1968 as a physical anthropologist, and, over subsequent years published 10 books and more than 60 articles on human anthropology. | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> and conducted field research in [[Europe]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and [[Java]].<ref name="Carlson">{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Carlson |title=Using His Cranium: Grover Krantz's Last Wish Was to Remain With His Friends.

Outside of Krantz's formal studies in [[evolutionary anthropology]] and [[primatology]], his cryptozoological research on Bigfoot drew heavy criticism and accusations of "[[fringe science]]" from his colleagues, costing him research grants and promotions, and delaying his [[tenure]] at the university.<ref name="Tyler"/><ref name="Paulson"/> Further, his articles on the subject were rejected by peer-reviewed scholarly journals.<ref name="Paulson">{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Paulson |title=A student of Sasquatch, Prof. Grover Krantz, dies |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/58730_grover18.shtml |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=February 18, 2002 |access-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> However, Krantz was tenacious in his work and was often drawn to controversial subjects, such as the [[Kennewick Man]] remains, arguing for their preservation and study.<ref name="Rahner"/> He has been described as having been the "only scientist" and "lone professional" to seriously consider Bigfoot in his time, in a field largely dominated by amateur [[naturalists]].<ref name="Regal2008">{{cite journal|last=Regal |first=Brian |date=June 2008 |title=Amateur versus professional: the search for Bigfoot |journal=Endeavour |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=53–7 |doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2008.04.005 |url=http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Bigfoot%20article.Endeavour.pdf |access-date=September 11, 2009 |pmid=18514914 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528021504/http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Bigfoot%20article.Endeavour.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Barcott">{{cite journal|last=Barcott |first=Bruce |date=August 2002 |title=''Sasquatch Is Real!''

With the submission of his doctoral dissertation, titled ''The Origins of Man'', Krantz obtained his doctorate in anthropology from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1971.<ref name="Regal2009"/>

===Professional career===
In the early 1960s, Krantz worked as a technician at the [[Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Berkeley, California]] before acquiring a full-time teaching position at [[Washington State University]], where he taught from 1968 until his retirement in 1998.<ref name="Carlson"/><ref name="Coleman"/><ref name="Rahner"/> He was a popular professor despite giving notoriously difficult exams, and often ate lunch with students and talked about anthropology, [[unified field theory]] in physics, [[military history]], and current events.<ref name="Tyler"/><ref name="Carlson"/> After his death, a scholarship named after Krantz was established at the University to promote "interest in the fields of physical/biological anthropology, linguistic archaeology, and/or human demography."<ref>{{cite web |title=Department Scholarships |url=http://libarts.wsu.edu/anthro/scholarship.html |publisher=Department of Anthropology, Washington State University |access-date=September 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616013356/http://libarts.wsu.edu/anthro/scholarship.html |archive-date=June 16, 2009 }}</ref>

In the 1970s, Krantz studied the fossil remains of ''[[Ramapithecus]]'', an extinct genus of primates then thought by many anthropologists to be ancestral to humans, although Krantz helped prove this notion false.<ref name="Paulson"/> Krantz's research on ''[[Homo erectus]]'' was extensive, including studies of [[phonemic]] speech and theoretical hunting patterns, and argued that this led to many of the anatomical differences between ''H. erectus'' and modern humans. He also wrote an influential paper on the emergence of humans in [[prehistoric Europe]] and the development of [[Indo-European languages]], and was the first researcher to explain the function of the [[mastoid process]].<ref name="Tyler"/> His professional work was diverse, including research on the development of Paleolithic [[stone tools]], [[Neanderthal]] taxonomy and culture, the [[Quaternary extinction event]], [[sea level]] changes,<ref name="Coleman"/> and the evidence of sex in the human fossil record.<ref>Krantz, Grover S. "The Fossil Record of Sex." In: ''Sexual Dimorphism in Homo Sapiens: A Question of Size'', ed. Roberta L. Hall (New York: Praeger, 1982), pp. 85–105.</ref>

In 1996 Krantz was drawn into the [[Kennewick Man]] controversy, arguing both in academia and in court that direct lineage to extant human populations could not be demonstrated.<ref name="Rahner">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Rahner |title=Grover Krantz, foremost Bigfoot expert, dies at 70 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020218&slug=bigfoot18m |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=February 18, 2002 |access-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> In an interview appearing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Krantz stated his view that "this skeleton cannot be racially or culturally associated with any existing American Indian group" and "the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|Native Repatriation Act]] {{sic}} has no more applicability to this skeleton than it would if an early Chinese expedition had left one of its members there."<ref name="Preston">{{cite magazine |last=Preston |first=Douglas |date=June 16, 1997|title=The Lost Man |magazine=The New Yorker |volume=73 |issue=16 |pages=70–81 |issn=0028-792X |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1997/06/16/1997_06_16_070_TNY_CARDS_000377250 |access-date=September 13, 2009 }}</ref> In 2001 he attempted to submit the last paper he wrote before his death, titled "Neanderthal Continuity in View of Some Overlooked Data," although it was rejected by the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', with then editor Benjamin Orlove stating that it did not make enough reference to the most current research.<ref name="Regal2009"/>

===Bigfoot research===
Krantz's specialty as an anthropologist included all aspects of human evolution, but he was best known outside of academia as the first serious researcher to devote his professional energies to the scientific study of Bigfoot, beginning in 1963.<ref name="Regal2009"/> Because his cryptozoology research was ignored by mainstream scientists, despite his academic credentials, in a bid to find an audience Krantz published numerous books aimed at casual readers and also frequently appeared in television documentaries, including ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'', ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'', and ''[[Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science]]''.<ref name="Regal2009"/>

Krantz's studies of Bigfoot, which he called "Sasquatch," (an [[Anglicization]] of the [[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]] word ''sásq’ets'' ({{IPA-sal|ˈsæsqʼəts|IPA}}, meaning "wild man")<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 422. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3576-2}}</ref> led him to believe that this was an actual creature. He theorized that sightings were due to small pockets of surviving [[Gigantopithecus|gigantopithecines]], with the progenitor population having migrated across the [[Bering land bridge]], which was later used by [[Models of migration to the New World|humans to enter North America]]. (''Gigantopithecus'' lived alongside humans but is thought to have gone extinct 100,000 years ago in eastern Asia, while the Bering land bridge existed between 135,000 to 70,000 years BP.)<ref name="Christmas">{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Christmas |title=Giant ape lived alongside humans |url=http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3637 |newspaper=Daily News |publisher=McMaster University |date=November 7, 2005 |access-date=September 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206215219/http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3637 |archive-date=February 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In January 1985 Krantz tried to formally name Bigfoot by presenting a paper at the meeting of the [[International Society of Cryptozoology]] held in [[Sussex, England]], assigning it the [[binomen]] ''Gigantopithecus blacki'', although this was not permitted by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] because ''G. blacki'' was an existing [[taxon]] and because the creature was lacking a [[holotype]].<ref name="Regal2009"/><ref name="Meldrum2007">{{cite journal|last1=Meldrum|first1=D. Jeffrey|title=Ichnotaxonomy of giant hominid tracks in North America|journal=Bulletin of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History|date=2007|issue=42, Cenozoic Vertebrate Tracks and Traces|pages=225–232|url=https://econtent.unm.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/bulletins/id/377/rec/46}}</ref> Krantz argued that his [[plaster casts]] were suitable holotypes, later suggesting ''G. canadensis'' as a name.<ref name="Regal2008"/><ref name="Meldrum2007"/> Krantz then tried to have his paper, titled "A Species Named from Footprints," published in an academic journal although it was rejected by reviewers.<ref name="Regal2009"/>

After seeing footage stills of the [[Patterson–Gimlin film]] which appeared on the February 1968 cover of ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', Krantz was skeptical, believing the film to be an elaborate hoax, saying "it looked to me like someone wearing a gorilla suit"<ref name="Regal2008"/> and "I gave Sasquatch only a 10 percent chance of being real."<ref name="Barcott"/> After years of skepticism, Krantz finally became convinced of Bigfoot's existence after analyzing the "Cripplefoot" [[plaster cast]]s gathered at [[Bossburg, Washington]] in December 1969. Krantz later studied the Patterson–Gimlin film in full, and after taking notice of the creature's peculiar gait and purported anatomical features, such as flexing leg muscles, he changed his mind and became an advocate of its authenticity.<ref name="Regal2008"/> While in Bossburg, he also met [[John Willison Green]] and the two remained friends until Krantz's death.

The Cripplefoot tracks, left in snow, purportedly showed microscopic [[dermal ridges]] (fingerprints) and injuries tentatively identified as [[clubfoot]] by primatologist [[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]].<ref name="Regal2008"/> Krantz asked Dutch professor A.G. de Wilde of the [[University of Groningen]] to examine the prints, who concluded that they were "not from some dead object with ridges in it, but come from a living object able to spread its toes."<ref name="Regal2009"/> Krantz also attempted to have both the [[FBI]] and [[Scotland Yard]] study the dermal ridge patterns, and was told by renowned fingerprint expert John Berry, an editor of the journal ''Fingerprint Whorld'', that Scotland Yard had concluded the prints were "probably real."<ref name="Regal2009"/> To his disappointment, a subsequent 1983 article in the journal ''Cryptozoology'', titled "Anatomy and Dermatoglyphics of Three Sasquatch Footprints,"<ref name="Krantz1983">{{cite journal|last=Krantz |first=Grover S. |year=1983 |title=Anatomy and Dermatoglyphics of Three Sasquatch Footprints |journal=Cryptozoology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=53–81 |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/dermal.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126163625/http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/dermal.html |archive-date=November 26, 2009 }}</ref> was largely ignored.<ref name="Regal2009"/>

After constructing biomechanical models of the Cripplefoot casts by calculating their distance, leverage, weight dynamics and distribution, and comparing the data to the track's heel, ankle and toe base, Krantz concluded that the footprints had been left by an animal about 2.44&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) tall and weighing roughly 363&nbsp;kg (800&nbsp;lb).<ref name="Regal2009"/> The morphological detail in the cast, particularly impressions of the [[thenar eminence]] muscle, also helped convince Krantz, who argued that a hoax "would require someone quite familiar with the anatomy of the human hand to make the connection between a non-opposable thumb and an absence of the thenar eminence."<ref name="Regal2008"/><ref name="Barcott"/><ref name="Regal2009"/> This culminated in Krantz's first publication on the subject of Bigfoot,<ref name="Regal2009"/> with his article "Sasquatch Handprints" appearing in the journal ''North American Research Notes'' in 1971.<ref name="Krantz1971">{{cite journal |last=Krantz |first=Grover S. |date=Fall 1971 |title=Sasquatch Handprints |journal=Northwest Anthropological Research Notes |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=145–51 }}</ref>

Shortly before his death, Krantz also examined the [[Skookum cast]]. He did not publicly endorse its authenticity, saying in an interview with ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine, "I don't know what it is. I'm baffled. Elk. Sasquatch. That's the choice."<ref name="Barcott"/>

===Personal life and death===
[[File:Washington - Smithsonian Museum - Grover Krantz & Clyde.jpg|thumb|upright|Skeletons of Grover Krantz and his dog, Clyde, at the [[Smithsonian Museum]].]]
Grover Krantz had one brother, Victor Krantz, who worked as a photographer at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name="Carlson"/> Krantz was married four times and divorced three times. His first wife was Patricia Howland, whom he married in 1953; he was later married to Joan Brandson in 1959 and [[Evelyn Einstein]] in 1964.<ref name="Chou&Kerrins2012"/> He married his fourth wife, Diane Horton, on November 5, 1982.<ref name="Tyler"/> He also had a stepson, Dural Horton. Krantz was a road enthusiast and frequently took road trips, traveling to all 48 continental states.<ref name="Tyler"/> In 1984, he received high scores on the [[Miller Analogies Test]] and was subsequently accepted into the high IQ society [[Intertel]].<ref name="Chou&Kerrins2012"/> On March 3, 1987, Krantz debated [[Duane Gish]] on creationism and evolution at Washington State University; the well-publicized three-hour debate was attended by more than 1000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ntserver1.wsulibs.wsu.edu/masc/finders/ctsmall.htm#25 |title=Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections |publisher=Washington State University Libraries |date=June 24, 2013 |access-date=13 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Creationism vs. Evolution: 1,000 attend three-hour debate between scientist and theologian |author=Fisher, David |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j04tAAAAIBAJ&pg=4636%2C315513 |newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News |date=March 4, 1987 |volume=94 |issue=54 |pages=1, 12|access-date=12 July 2013}}</ref>

On [[Valentine's Day]] 2002, Krantz died in his [[Port Angeles, Washington]] home from [[pancreatic cancer]] after an eight-month battle with the disease.<ref name="Telegraph"/><ref name="Carlson"/><ref name="Coleman"/><ref name="Rahner"/> At his request, there was no funeral.<ref name="Carlson"/><ref name="Coleman"/> Instead, his body was shipped to the [[body farm]] at the [[University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility]], where scientists study human decay rates to aid in forensic investigations.<ref name="Carlson"/> In 2003, his skeleton arrived at Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]] and was laid to rest in a green cabinet, alongside the bones of his three favorite [[Irish Wolfhound]]s – Clyde, Icky, and Yahoo – as was his last request (See "Epilogue" by Dave Hunt of the Smithsonian in ''Only A Dog'').<ref name="Carlson"/>

In 2009, Krantz's skeleton was painstakingly articulated and, along with the skeleton of one of his dogs, included on display in the Smithsonian's "Written in Bone: Forensic Files of the 17th Century Chesapeake" exhibition at the National Museum of Natural History. His bones have also been used to teach [[forensics]] and advanced [[osteology]] to [[George Washington University]] students.<ref name="Carlson"/>
