The '''University of Lausanne''' ('''UNIL'''; {{lang-fr|links=no|Université de Lausanne}}) in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] was founded in 1537 as a school of [[theology]], before being made a university in 1890. The university is the second oldest in Switzerland, and one of the oldest universities in the world to be in continuous operation. As of fall 2017, about 15,000 students and 3,300 employees study and work at the university. Approximately 1,500 international students attend the university (120 nationalities), which has a wide curriculum including exchange programs with world-renowned universities.

Since 2005, the university follows the requirements of the [[Bologna process]]. The 2011 [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]<ref name="timeshighereducation.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2011/world-ranking|title=World University Rankings|date=13 April 2015|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref> ranked the University of Lausanne 116th globally. The [[CWTS Leiden Ranking|CWTS Leiden Ranking 2015]] ranks the University of Lausanne 11th in Europe and 41st globally, out of 750 universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leidenranking.com/|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking|website=CWTS Leiden Ranking|access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref>

Together with the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)]] the university forms a vast [[Lausanne campus|campus]] at the shores of [[Lake Geneva]].

== History ==
[[Image:Palais de Rumine 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Palais de Rumine]], one of the former buildings of the University of Lausanne]]
[[File:Bibliothèque cantonale et universitaire de Lausanne.jpg|thumb|''Unithèque'' building houses one of the two sites of the [[Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne]] on the main campus of the UNIL]]

The university was founded in 1537 as the ''Schola Lausannensis'', one year after [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] conquered the territory of Vaud from the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. At the time it was a school of [[theology]] with the purpose of training pastors for the church.<ref name=Dictionnaire/> It enjoyed great renown for being the first and, until the establishment of the [[University of Geneva|Academy of Geneva]] in 1559, the only French language Protestant school of theology. In its early years it became a center of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] learning, with thinkers such as [[Corderius]] and [[Celio Secondo Curione]] among its professors.<ref name=Dictionnaire>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]]|title=Université de Lausanne|language=fr|author=Nicole Meystre-Schaeren}}</ref> In the 17th century it became known as the '''Academy of Lausanne''' (''Académie de Lausanne'').<ref name=Dictionnaire/> As the centuries passed, the number of faculties increased and diversified until, in 1890, the Academy received the name and status of a university.

In 1909, [[Archibald Reiss|Rudolphe Archibald Reiss]] founded the first school of [[forensic science]] in the world: the {{lang|fr|Institut de police scientifique}}.

From 1970, the university moved progressively from the old centre of Lausanne, around the Cathedral and Château, to its present site at [[Dorigny university campus|Dorigny]].

The end of the 20th century witnessed the beginnings of an ambitious project aiming at greater co-operation and development among the French-speaking universities of Lausanne, Geneva, and Neuchâtel, together with the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)]]. Among others, this led to the transfer of the sections of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry from the university to the EPFL; the funds that were made available following this transfer were invested in the development of the life sciences at the university, including the creation of a Center for Integrative Genomics.

In 2003, two new faculties were founded, concentrating on the life and human sciences: the Faculty of Biology and Medicine and the Faculty of Geosciences and Environment.

On 1 January 2014, the [[Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration]] (IDHEAP) was integrated into the University of Lausanne.<ref>[http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/central/shared/docs/rapport_12.pdf Rapport annuel 2012 de l'Université de Lausanne], www.unil.ch (page visited on 30 May 2013).</ref>

Since August 2021, the rector of the University of Lausanne is [[Frédéric Herman]]; before then, the university was led by [[Nouria Hernandez]] (2016-2021) and by Dominique Arlettaz (2006-2016).
