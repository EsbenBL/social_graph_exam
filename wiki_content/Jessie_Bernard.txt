'''Jessie Shirley Bernard''' (born '''Jessie Sarah Ravitch''', 1903 – 1996) was an American [[sociologist]] and noted [[feminist]] scholar. She was a persistent forerunner of feminist thought in American sociology and her life's work is characterized as extraordinarily productive spanning several intellectual and political eras.<ref>Myers, Kristen A., Anderson, Cynthia D. & [[Barbara Risman|Risman, Barbara J.]] "Feminist Foundations: Toward Transforming Sociology". SAGE Publishers, 1998, p.78</ref> Bernard studied and wrote about women's lives since the late 1930s and her contributions to [[social sciences]] and [[feminist theory]] regarding women, sex, marriage, and the interaction with the family and community are well noted. She has garnered numerous honors in her career and has several awards named after her, such as the [[Jessie Bernard Award]].<ref>Lengermann, PM and Niebrugge, J.

==Early life==
Jessie Bernard (born Jessie Sarah Ravitch) was born and raised in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. She was the third of four children born to Jewish-Romanian parents, Bessie Kanter and David Soloman Ravitch. In the 1880s her parents immigrated separately to the United States from [[Transylvania]] (today in [[Romania]]). Bernard's father started out delivering dairy products in Minneapolis, later became a [[haberdasher]] and finally a real estate broker. At the time, the Ravitch family were the only Jewish-immigrant family to reside in a middle-class community. With regards to Bernard's education, her parents believed she was better off pursuing an education in business school. However, Bernard graduated from public high school in 1920 and left home to study in [[social sciences]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.51-52</ref><ref>Bannister,  Robert C. "Jessie Bernard".[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/bernard-jessie]. Retrieved 30 November 2010</ref>

==Education and career==

===University of Minnesota===
Bernard completed her undergraduate and post-graduate studies at the [[University of Minnesota]]. She earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] ([[magna cum laude]]) in 1923 and her [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[sociology]] in 1924. Her MA thesis was titled "Changes of Attitudes of Jews in the First and Second Generation" that earned her the Harris Prize. During her studies here she became actively involved in attempts to establish [[sociology]] as a recognized profession within American academia and she actively participated in the injection of empirical research into meetings of the [[American Sociological Society]]. Bernard studied with [[Pitirim Sorokin]] (founder of the sociology department at [[Harvard]]) and became research assistant to her sociology professor, Luther Lee Bernard.

===Washington University in St Louis===
At [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Bernard continued her research and later earned her PhD in [[sociology]] in 1935. Together, the Bernards challenged the dominance of the [[University of Chicago]] in the field of sociology that ultimately saw their involvement in the creation of the [[American Sociological Review]].

===Lindenwood College===
Bernard took up a teaching position at [[Lindenwood College]] in 1940 where she remained teaching for the next 7 years. Following the events of [[World War II]], in particular the [[Nazi Holocaust]], Bernard started to move away from the [[positivistic]] approach dominant in social science and became increasingly supportive of the social contextuality of all knowledge. This time would also mark her movement toward a feminist position in sociology as seen in the [[qualitative research]] and critical analysis prevalent in her later work.<ref>Lengermann, PM and Niebrugge, J. "Contemporary Feminist Theory" in Sociological Theory by George Ritzer (ed). 1996. p.452</ref><ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref>

===Penn State University===
In 1947, her husband negotiated positions as lecturers for Bernard and himself at [[Penn State University]]. Bernard managed to establish her own academic independence and became a [[Full Professor]] of sociology. She remained here for the larger part of her academic career. During her time as professor she became a founding member of the Society for the Study of Social Problems and helped legitimize [[feminist studies]]. She retired as [[Professor Emeritus]] from Penn State University at age 62.<ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref><ref>Love, Barbara J. "Feminist Who Changed America: 1963–1975". University of Illinois Press, 2006. p.40</ref>

===Retirement===
Although her retirement marked her movement out of academic life, Bernard devoted herself to writing and research on a full-time basis as well as remaining an active feminist in the women's movement for the next two decades. This would also be the period of her life that saw extraordinary productivity in terms of her research and writings. She published the majority of her books in this period as well as several articles and presentations, establishing herself as a leading contributor to professional and lay understandings of the [[sociology of gender]]. Her work was further marked by a critical rejection of sociology as a [[positivistic]] science to the extent where she rethought her early writings in light of a feminist position.<ref>Lengermann, PM and Niebrugge, J. "Contemporary Feminist Theory" in Sociological Theory by George Ritzer (ed). 1996. p.452-453</ref>

This period of Bernard's life would also see her as president of the Eastern Sociological Association, president and founding member of the Society for the Study of Social Problems, founding board member of the Center for Women Policy Studies as well as member of the boards of Urban Institute Women's Program and the [[Women's Equity Action League]]. During this time she was also a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]]. Bernard lectured at professional meetings and universities around the world and met women from all over the world in international women's meetings. In 1977, Bernard became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}</ref> WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

==Research and writings==
Bernard characterized her own work as a movement towards contemporary feminism or what she also referred to as "the feminist enlightenment".<ref>Bernard, J. "The Female World from a Global Perspective", 1987, cited in Lengermann, PM and Niebrugge, J. "Contemporary Feminist Theory" in Sociological Theory by George Ritzer (ed). 1996. p.452</ref> Since the mid-1940s, Jessie's focus was to increase understanding of the effects of sexism on women's experience of marriage, parenting, education and economic life. This ultimately formed the largest part of her contributions to sociology and feminist theory. To sum up her contribution to sociology in her own words:

:"I am concerned, as any fair-minded person must be, with the effects of sexism on the position of women in our profession and in our society; but I am also concerned, as any dedicated sociologist must be, with its effects on our discipline as well. Important as are the costs to women of the male bias in sociology, on which a considerable literature exists, I am concerned here not with them but rather with the costs of this bias to the discipline itself. I am not, therefore asking what sociology can do for women - for example, by filling in the gaps in our knowledge about them, itself a significant contribution - but rather what women (and sympathetic male colleagues) can do for sociology." .<ref>Bernard, Jessie. "My Four Revolutions: An Autobiographical History of the ASA". The American Journal of Sociology, 78(4):776</ref>

bernard's research (statistical analysis of health and mortality data) published in ''The Paradox of the Happy Marriage'' (1971) and ''The Future of Marriage'' (1972) illustrated that marriage was good for men, but not for women. She argued that men and women live in different worlds and perceive of marriage differently. She attributed this to the gendered nature of social structures in society.<ref>Love, Barbara J. "Feminist Who Changed America: 1963–1975". University of Illinois Press, 2006. p.40</ref><ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref> Building on her previous work and research, Bernard later published ''The Female World'' (1981) and ''The Female World from a Global Perspective'' (1987). In "The Female World" (1981) she argued that although men and women move in geographically similar places, households, political and economic arenas, they actually live in different single-sex worlds. In "The Female World from a Global Perspective" (1987) she mapped differences among women in terms of life expectancy, nutrition, wealth, literacy, work and politics as well as how [[racism]], [[classism]], and [[imperialism]] divide their worlds.<ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref>

==Honors and recognition==
Bernard was awarded the title "Research Scholar ''Honoris Causa''" by [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1965. In 1976 the [[American Sociological Association]] established the [[Jessie Bernard Award]] for "work that has enlarged the horizons of the discipline of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society" in Bernard's honor.<ref>Martin, Patricia Y. "The Significance of the Jessie Bernard Award [http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/julyaugust09/bernard_0709.html], American Sociological Association Network. Retrieved 1 December 2010.</ref> In 1976, Bernard received the Achievement Award from the [[American Association of University Women]]. On her 85th birthday The Center for Women's Policy Studies  honored Bernard by the creation of the Jessie Bernard Wise Women Award in recognition of "women leaders, activists and scholars whose lives and work demonstrate and advocacy of feminist enlightenment".<ref>Love, Barbara J. "Feminist Who Changed America: 1963–1975". University of Illinois Press, 2006. p.40</ref>  She was honored by numerous associations and institutions of higher education in recognition of her work and contributions to sociology, feminist theory and the women's movement.<ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref><ref>"Jessie Bernard [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02740.html], Jewish Virtual Library. Retrieved 1 December 2010</ref>

== Personal life ==
After working as research assistant to her sociology professor, Luther Lee Bernard for 4 years, she married him on September 23, 1925. Their union was considered controversial by some given that Luther was 23 years her senior and non-Jewish. The Bernards moved several times due to Luther's various appointments at academic institutions as a professor at [[Cornell University]], [[Tulane University]], and [[University of North Carolina]] before finally settling at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1929.<ref>Lengermann, PM and Niebrugge, J. "Contemporary Feminist Theory" in Sociological Theory by George Ritzer (ed). 1996. p.452</ref><ref>Bannister,  Robert C. "Jessie Bernard". [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/bernard-jessie]. Retrieved 30 November 2010</ref><ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref> During her time at Washington University in St. Louis, Bernard struggled to obtain personal and professional independence and she separated from her husband in 1936 for a period of four years until the couple reconciled in 1940.  Despite Luther's initial objections, they overcame their differences and started a family.<ref>Lengermann, PM and Niebrugge, J. "Contemporary Feminist Theory" in Sociological Theory by George Ritzer (ed). 1996. p.452</ref><ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S. "Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century". Harvard University Press, 2004. p.52</ref> Her start at Lindenwood College was marked by the birth of her first child, Dorothy Lee, in 1941 and the birth of her second child, Claude, in 1945. Bernard gave birth to their third child, David, in 1950 during her time at Penn State University. Unfortunately, Luther died of cancer the next year and Bernard had to raise their children as a [[single-parent]]. She died in 1996.<ref>Ware, Susan and Braukman, Lorraine S.
