'''Vanderbilt University''' (informally '''Vandy''' or '''VU''') is a [[private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Founded in 1873, it was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], who provided the school its initial $1-million endowment; Vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="revu">{{cite web |title=Quick Facts |publisher=Vanderbilt University |url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/about/facts/ |access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>

In the years before the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church South]] had been considering the creation of a regional university for the training of [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] in a location central to its congregations.<ref name="Carey">{{cite book |title= Chancellors, Commodores & Coeds: A History of Vanderbilt University |last=Carey |first= Bill |year= 2003 |publisher= Clearbrook Press Publishing |location= Nashville, TN |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-ls_Nq2dDgC |isbn=978-0-9725680-0-5 }}</ref> Following lobbying by Nashville bishop [[Holland Nimmons McTyeire]], church leaders voted to found "The Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South" in Nashville in 1872.<ref name="Carey" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Stowell |first=Daniel W. |date=1998 |title=Rebuilding Zion: The Religious Reconstruction of the South, 1863–1877 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mpgc1TxrwoC&pg=RA2-PA1863|location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514981-4}}</ref> However, lack of funds and the ravaged state of the [[Reconstruction Era]] South delayed the opening of the college.<ref name="Carey" />

===Split with the Methodist Church===

During the first 40 years, the Board of Trust, and therefore the university, was under the control of the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] (the governing body) of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].<ref name="Carey" /> Tension grew between the university administration and the Conference over the future of the school, particularly over the methods by which members of the Vanderbilt Board of Trust would be chosen, and the extent that non-Methodists could teach at the school.<ref name="Carey" />

Conflicts escalated after [[James Hampton Kirkland|James H. Kirkland]] was appointed chancellor in 1893.<ref name="Carey" /> Then the Southern Methodist Church congregations raised just $50,000 in a campaign to raise $300,000.<ref name="Carey" />

In 1905, Kirkland Hall burnt down, only to be rebuilt shortly after.<ref name="hooblernash" /> Meanwhile, the Board of Trust voted to limit Methodist representation on the board to just five bishops.<ref name="Carey" /> Former faculty member and bishop [[Elijah Hoss]] led a group attempting to assert Methodist control.<ref name="Carey" /> In 1910, the board refused to seat three Methodist bishops.<ref name="Carey" /> The Methodist Church took the issue to court and won at the local level. On March 21, 1914, the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] ruled that the Commodore, and not the Methodist Church, was the university's founder and that the board could therefore seat whomever it wished.<ref name="Carey" /> The General Conference in 1914 voted 151 to 140 to sever its ties with Vanderbilt; it also voted to establish a new university, [[Southern Methodist University]], and to greatly expand [[Emory University]].<ref name="Carey" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/nhn.slate/nh00073.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822033735/http://pages.prodigy.net/nhn.slate/nh00073.html|archive-date=August 22, 2010 |title=Vanderbilt University and Southern Methodism|first=Frank|last=Gulley|access-date=February 20, 2008}}</ref>

Housing the Science Library, the School of Engineering, and all the science and math departments of the College of Arts and Science, this complex sits between the original campus and the Medical Center.<ref name="campus map" /> The Vanderbilt University Medical Center itself takes up the southeastern part of the campus.<ref name="campus map" /> Besides the various associated hospitals and clinics and the facilities of the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, the medical center also houses many major research facilities.

West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of the Vanderbilt residence halls are found.<ref name="campus map" /> From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy, shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quadrangle.<ref name="campus map" /> There are 20 residence halls and apartments across both campuses.<ref name="The Vanderbilt Profile*"/>

The design of the campus and buildings can be described as eclectic, with buildings of various styles and eras. The original 75-acre campus included 11 structures situated along ridge lines with sprawling views of downtown Nashville. The original campus gates are still located off 21st Avenue. Currently four of the original 11 campus structures still exist. One of these is Kirkland Hall, one of the more recognizable buildings on campus. Built in 1873, the original building had two [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] towers. A major fire in 1905 severely damaged the building, and it was rebuilt with only one tower. The building was named after Chancellor James Hampton Kirkland, who served as Vanderbilt's chancellor from 1893–1937.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsonline.library.vanderbilt.edu/2018/10/the-history-of-kirkland-hall-topic-of-new-exhibition/|title=The History of Kirkland Hall Topic of New Exhibition|last=Sterkenburg|first=Sara|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> In recent years campus planners have strived to preserve the landscape and buildings like Kirkland Hall to keep the original core and maintain a compact, walkable campus.<ref>[https://www.vanderbilt.edu/futurevu/history.php Campus Land Use / Master Planning History at Vanderbilt.] Downloaded February 9, 2018.</ref>

===Peabody campus===
Directly across 21st Avenue from the Medical Center sits the campus of the [[Peabody College]] of Education and Human Development.<ref name="campus map" /> The design of the Peabody campus was inspired by the classical lines of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s design for the [[University of Virginia]] and the architecture of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The [[National Historic Landmarks]] program designated the central lawn and surrounding buildings as a historic district in 1965.<ref>[http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2014/JAN/HTML/col-vanderbilt.html#.Wn293OjwaCo NY Architects Design Vanderbilt University’s Historic Peabody College for Teachers.] Education Update Online, downloaded February 9, 2018.</ref> The Peabody campus is the location of the Martha Rivers Ingram Commons freshman residences.

===Medical Center===
Until April 2016 [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] (VUMC) was a component of the university, but is now an independent organization. The Medical Center continues to cooperate with the university and many clinical staff serve as faculty members at [[Vanderbilt University School of Medicine]] and [[Vanderbilt University School of Nursing]].<ref>Fletcher, Holly.

===Residential college system===
[[File:Vandy-Kissam Hall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kissam Hall was a men's dormitory from 1901 until it was demolished in 1958. The baths were all in the basement.]]
In the early 2000s Vanderbilt made a decision to convert its residence halls into an academic residential college system.<ref name=WeberNYT>Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/education/edlife/cornellweber3.html The Residential Collage] New York Times, July 29, 2007.</ref><ref name=Dobie/> The intent is to form "a cohesive and growing network of residences that spark creativity, build community, support student success, and extend educational opportunities beyond the classroom."<ref name=collegehalls/> The first phase of this conversion was opening in 2008 of The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons, which brought together all first-year students in 10 adjacent houses, each house guided by a faculty head of house, living among the students in a faculty apartment. It is planned that in their sophomore year, students will enter a Residential College that will be their home for the remainder of their undergraduate years. This residential option expands on the experience provided during students' first year on The Commons.  The first two upperclass colleges are Warren College and Moore College, which opened in 2014.<ref name=collegehalls/> They were constructed on the site of pre-existing dormitories known as the Kissam Quadrangle<ref name="collegehalls">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/collegehalls/about.php|title=About the College Halls|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722063808/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/collegehalls/about.php|archive-date=July 22, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  E.

Vanderbilt also has a large performing arts community spanning every genre of the arts with multiple organizations representing each category. There are dance groups covering contemporary, tap, hip hop, Latin, and Bhangra styles as well as numerous theatre, improvisation, spoken word, music and singing groups including the 2014 Sing-Off champion male a cappella group, The Melodores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/12/melodores-sing-off-champs/|title=Melodores are 'Sing-Off' champs|author=Kara Furlong|work=Vanderbilt University|access-date=August 3, 2015}}</ref> Performing arts organizations comprise over 1,000 students and are represented by the Vanderbilt Performing Arts Community, which supports groups by sponsoring performances and awards.

The student body is governed by Vanderbilt Student Government, which includes Senate, Judicial, and Executive Branches. This organization is responsible for the distribution of nearly $2 million in funds set aside by the university to fund student organizations.

===Mascot===
Vanderbilt's intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, in honor of the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping.<ref>{{cite news |title=Commodore Vanderbilt's Life|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1877/01/05/80358542.pdf |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 5, 1877}}</ref> The term ''[[commodore (rank)|commodore]]'' was used by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] during the mid-to-late 19th century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The rank is still used by the British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth countries, but the equivalent modern-day rank in the U.S. Navy is [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral lower half]]. Since the term was used most during the 19th century, Vanderbilt's mascot, "Mr. C", is usually portrayed as a naval officer from the late 19th century, complete with [[sideburns|mutton chops]], [[cutlass]], and uniform.

In addition to Mr. C, Vanderbilt fans often use the cheer "Anchor down!" accompanied by the "VU" hand sign, created by extending the thumb along with the index and middle fingers (essentially identical to the [[Three-finger salute (Serbian)|Serbian three-finger salute]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.vanderbilt.edu/vandybloggers/2013/09/vu-football-traditions-101/|title=VU Football Traditions 101|access-date=August 3, 2015}}</ref>
