'''Kenneth George "Ken" Binmore''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CBE|FBA}} (born 27 September 1940) is an English mathematician, economist, and [[game theory|game theorist]], a Professor Emeritus of Economics at [[University College London]] (UCL)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/binmore/cv.pdf |title=CV |publisher=[[ELSE]] |access-date=12 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210004926/http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/binmore/cv.pdf |archive-date=10 February 2012}}</ref> and a Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the [[University of Bristol]].<ref>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/economics/staff/binmore.html</ref> As a founder of modern economic theory of [[Nash bargaining solution|bargaining]] (with [[John Forbes Nash|Nash]] and [[Ariel Rubinstein|Rubinstein]]), he made important contributions to the foundations of [[game theory]], [[experimental economics]], [[evolutionary game theory]] and [[analytical philosophy]]. He took up economics after holding the Chair of Mathematics at the [[London School of Economics]]. The switch has put him at the forefront of developments in game theory. His other interests include political and [[moral philosophy]], [[decision theory]], and statistics. He has written over 100 scholarly papers and 14 books.

==Education==
Binmore studied mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], where he was awarded a 1st class-honours BSc with a Governor's Prize, and later a PhD in [[mathematical analysis]].

==Research==
Binmore's major research contributions are to the theory of bargaining and its testing in the laboratory. He is a pioneer of [[experimental economics]]. He began his experimental work in the 1980s when most economists thought that game theory would not work in the laboratory. Binmore and his collaborators established that game theory can often predict the behaviour of experienced players very well in laboratory settings, even in the case of human bargaining behaviour, a particularly challenging case for game theory. This has brought him into conflict with some proponents of [[behavioural economics]] who emphasise the importance of other-regarding or social preferences, and argue that their findings threaten traditional game theory.

Binmore's work in political and moral philosophy began in the 1980s when he first applied bargaining theory to [[John Rawls]]' original position. His search for the philosophical foundations of the [[original position]] took him first to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s works, and then to [[David Hume|Hume]]. Hume inspired Binmore to contribute to a naturalistic science of morals that seeks foundations for Rawlsian ideas about fairness norms in biological and social evolution. The result was his two-volume ''Game Theory and the Social Contract'', an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for a genuine science of morals using the theory of games. In ''Game Theory and the Social Contract'' Binmore proposes a naturalistic reinterpretation of [[John Rawls]]' original position that reconciles his egalitarian theory of justice with [[John Harsanyi]]'s utilitarian theory. His recent ''Natural Justice'' provides a nontechnical synthesis of this work.

==Affiliations==
In 1995 Binmore became one of the founding directors of the Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution (ELSE), an interdisciplinary research centre involving economists, [[psychologists]], [[anthropologists]] and [[mathematicians]] based at [[University College London]]. Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, ELSE pursues basic research on evolutionary and learning approaches to games and society and applies its theoretical findings to practical problems in government and business.

While Director of ELSE, Binmore became widely known as the "poker-playing economic theorist", who netted the British government £22 billion when he led the team that designed the third-generation (3G) telecommunications [[auction]] in 2000. He went on to design and implement 3G [[spectrum auctions]] in Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Israel and Hong Kong.

Binmore is Emeritus Professor of Economics at [[University College London]], Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the [[University of Bristol]] and Visiting Professor in the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]]. He has held similar positions at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Caltech]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. He is a Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] and the [[British Academy]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the New Year's Honours List 2001 for contributions to game theory and to designing the UK 3G telecommunications auctions. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002.<ref name=AAAS>{{Cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> In 2007 he became an Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Bristol]] and an Honorary Fellow of the Centre for Philosophy at the [[London School of Economics]].
