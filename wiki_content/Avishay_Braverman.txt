=== Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ===
In October 1990, he returned to Israel to serve as president of the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], then a small university with approximately 5,700 students. In his first speech, he announced that the university would grow significantly on the basis of three principles: excellence in research, opening its doors to disadvantaged populations, and building an hi-tech park adjacent to the university.

His tenure was characterized by a great building momentum on the University’s three campuses in [[Be'er Sheva|Beer Sheva]], [[Sde Boker]] and later, [[Eilat]], and the initiation and establishment of many curricula and research programs, including: the Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies; the National Institute of Biotechnology in the Negev, sponsored by the de Picciotto Family; the Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology; the reconfiguration of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research (BIDR) in Sde Boker which transformed under the renamed Institutes to incorporate three research institutes, among them, the Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), as well as the Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies; and on the Marcus Family Campus in Beer-Sheva, the Heksherim Research Institute for Jewish & Israeli Literature & Culture; further development and naming of the unique Joyce and Irvine Goldman School of Medicine, founded by the School’s first Dean and first University President, the late Professor Moshe Prywes; establishing the Medical School for International Health (MSIH) in collaboration with Columbia University; the School of Management, later named the Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management; the Department of Computer Science; the Department for Computer Systems Engineering; the Pilots Training Course - a full undergraduate degree program for Israeli Air Force cadets in a combined Flight School and university setting, among others.

With a focus on community outreach and inspiring the city and region’s populations to become an integral part of the University, under Braverman’s tenure, the Robert H. Arnow Center for [[Bedouin]] Studies and Development was established, as was a socially-engaged complex designed to house the Department for Community Action sponsored by the Deichmann Family of [[Germany]], to develop the university’s social outreach with Jewish and Bedouin residents of Beer Sheva and the region, together with the Spitzer Department of Social Work. In addition, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the [[Negev]] was established in Beer Sheva.

Braverman enlisted extensive support from both private and governmental sources, to include in particular a fund to promote excellence in research named after Howard and Lotti Marcus worth approximately $450 million; and a grant from the German government for the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research in Sde Boker; initiating the establishment of an hi-tech park in an area adjacent to the university, as well as attracting the communications giant, [[Deutsche Telekom]], to establish its first research facility outside of Germany at BGU. During his tenure, BGU engaged in various cooperative projects around the world and particularly in the Middle East, with [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], the Palestinian Authority and the [[Gaza Strip]], and [[UNESCO]] endorsed the BGU-initiated International Program for Arid Land Crops - the first such recognition of Israeli expertise by a [[United Nations|UN]] organization. He also raised significant funds for the construction of the Beer-Sheva North/University train station and thé Mexico Bridge, connecting the university and the Advanced Technologies Park with central Israel. At the end of his tenure, there were approximately 18,000 students studying at the university, including 400 students from the Bedouin community in the Negev.

Between 1991-2005, he served as Chair of the Committee of University Heads (CUH) three times, was a member of the Public Committee for Election of Bank Directors (1993), served as Chairman of the Jerusalem Literary Award Committee (2003), Chairman of the Reserve Reform Committee appointed by the Minister of Defence (2005) ) and external director of Mackhteshim-Agan (now "Adama"), Israel Corporation, IDB Development and Dead Sea Works.

The study involved various Israeli entities including the Israel Water Planning Authority, the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]] and leading water experts in Israel and was managed by Nehemiah Hassid.
