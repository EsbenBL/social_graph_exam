Crawford Young]</ref><ref>[https://madison.com/news/local/obituaries/young-merwin-crawford/article_6f2248f6-ff08-5e1f-b912-1ccfc143e9c8.html]</ref>

==Education==
He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Michigan]] and his [[PhD]] from [[Harvard]] in 1964, where his advisor was the famed scholar [[Rupert Emerson]], the only person ever to serve as president of both the African Studies Association and the Asian Studies Association.

==Academic career==
Young became an assistant professor at Wisconsin in 1963, and published his first major work, ''Politics in the Congo: Decolonization and Independence''.  He became prominent as the author in 1976 of the highly influential ''The Politics of Cultural Pluralism'', which was awarded the [[Herskovits Prize]] by the [[African Studies Association]].  His 1994 book, ''The African Colonial State in Comparative Perspective'', won the [[Lubbert Prize]] from the [[American Political Science Association]] as the best book written that year in the field of [[Comparative Politics]].

He held chairmanship of the UW–Madison political science department twice (1969–72; 1984–87), and was between 1973-75 [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Faculty of Social Science at the [[Université Nationale du Zaire]]. Young served as president of the [[African Studies Association]] in 1983. He retired in 2001 as a full professor but remained active in his field, publishing "The End of the Postcolonial State in Africa?" in the [[Academic journal|journal]] ''[[African Affairs]]'' in 2004.

==His work's emphasis==
Young's primary contributions to political science have come from his work on the [[Zaire|Zairian]] (and later, African) state and on the politics of cultural identity in the third world, which was theoretically innovative and presaged the contemporary "instrumentalist" and "constructivist" approaches to political identity.
