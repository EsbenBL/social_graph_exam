'''Environmental politics''' designate both the [[politics]] about the [[Natural environment|environment]]<ref>Andrew Dobson, ''Environmental Politics: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2016 ({{ISBN|978-0-19-966557-0}}).</ref> (see also [[environmental policy]]) and an [[academic field]] of study focused on three core components:<ref name=Carter>Carter, Neil. 2007. ''The Politics of the Environment: Ideas, Activism, Policy'', 2nd ed. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-68745-4}}</ref>

* The study of [[Political science|political]] [[Social theory|theories]] and [[Political philosophy|ideas]] related to the [[natural environment|environment]];
* The examination of the environmental stances of both mainstream [[political party|political parties]] and [[environmental movement|environmental social movements]]; and
* The analysis of [[public policy]]making and [[public administration|implementation]] affecting the environment, at multiple [[geopolitics|geo-political]] [[Level of analysis|levels]].

Neil Carter, in his foundational text ''Politics of the Environment'' (2009), suggests that ''environmental'' politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, "it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world" (page 3); and second, "unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement" (page 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., ''Greening the Millenium?'', 1997).<ref name=Carter/>

Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular [[conservation movement|conservationism]] and [[Wilderness#Preservation|preservationism]]. Contemporary environmental politics "was driven by the idea of a global [[ecological crisis]] that threatened the very existence of humanity." And "modern [[environmentalism]] was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transformation in the values and structures of society."<ref name=Carter/>

Environmental concerns were rooted in the vast social changes that took place in the United States after World War II. Although environmentalism can be identified in earlier years, only after the war did it become widely shared social priority. This began with outdoor recreation in the 1950s, extended into the wider field of the protection of natural environments, and then became infused with attempts to cope with air and [[water pollution]] and still later with toxic chemical pollutants. After World War II, environmental politics became a major public concern.<ref>Hays, Samuel P., and Barbara D. Hays.

== Democratic challenges ==
Climate change is slow relative to political cycles of leadership in [[Electoral system|electoral democracies]], which impedes responses by politicians who are elected and re-elected on much shorter timescales.<ref name=Guerrero>{{Cite journal |title = Against Elections: The Lottocratic Alternative|last = Guerrero|first = Alexander|date = 2014|journal = Philosophy & Public Affairs|volume = 42|issue = 2|pages = 135–178|doi = 10.1111/papa.12029|url=http://www.alexguerrero.org/storage/papa_official_Against_Elections.pdf}}</ref>

In the United States, although "environmentalism" was once considered a White phenomenon, scholars have identified "pro-environment positions among Latino, African-American, and non-Hispanic white respondents," with growing environmental concern especially among Latinos.<ref>Whittaker, Matthew, Segura, and Bowler, Shaun (2005). "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.967.6894&rep=rep1&type=pdf Racial/Ethnic Group Attitudes Toward Environmental Protection in California: Is "Environmentalism" Still a White Phenomenon?]" ''Political Research Quarterly'' (58)3: pp. 435, 435-447.</ref> Other scholars have similarly noted that Asian Americans are strongly pro-environmental, with some variation among ethnic subgroups.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.17953/appc.11.1-2.958537240526x56v| title=Ethnic Variation in Environmental Attitudes and Opinion among Asian American Voters| year=2013| last1=Ong| first1=Paul| last2=Le| first2=Loan| last3=Daniels| first3=Paula| journal=Aapi Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community| volume=11| issue=1–2| pages=91–109}}</ref>

Effectively responding to [[global warming]] necessitates some form of international [[environmental governance]] to achieve shared targets related to energy consumption and environmental usage.<ref name=Edmondson>{{Cite book|title = Climate Change and Order|last = Edmondson and Levy|year = 2013|pages = 50–60}}</ref> Climate change complicates political ideology and practice, affecting conceptions of responsibility for future societies as well as economic systems.<ref name=Edmondson/> Material inequality between nations make technological solutions insufficient for [[climate change mitigation]].<ref name=Edmondson/> Rather, political solutions can navigate the particularities of various facets of environmental crisis. Climate change mitigation strategies can be at odds with democratic priorities of prosperity, progress, and state sovereignty, and instead underscore a collective relationship with the environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Povitkina|first=Marina|date=2018-05-04|title=The limits of democracy in tackling climate change|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2018.1444723|journal=Environmental Politics|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=411–432|doi=10.1080/09644016.2018.1444723|issn=0964-4016}}</ref>

The international political community is presently based on liberal principles that prioritize individual freedoms and capitalist systems that make quick and ambitious climate responses difficult.<ref name=Edmondson/> [[Interest group liberalism|Interest-group liberalism]] is guided by individual human priorities.<ref name=Baber>{{Cite book|title = Deliberative Environmental Politics|last = Baber and Bartlett|year = 2005}}</ref> Groups unable to voice their self-interest, such as minorities without suffrage, or non-humans, are not included in the political compromise. Addressing environmental crises can be impeded when citizens of liberal democracies do not see environmental problems as impacting their lives, or when they lack the education to evaluate the importance of the problem.<ref name=Mathews>{{Cite journal|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/alterlj16&div=48&g_sent=1&collection=journals|title = Democracy and the Ecological Crisis|last = Mathews|first = Freya|date = 1991|journal = Legal Service Bulletin}}</ref> The human benefits from environmental exploitation and protection compete.<ref name=Mathews/> Considering the implications of ecological degradation for future human generations can give environmental concerns a basis in [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] liberal democratic politics.

[[William Ophuls]] posits that liberal democracies are unfit to address environmental problems, and that the prioritization of these challenges would involve a transition to more authoritarian forms of government.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity |last= Ophuls |first= William |author-link= William Ophuls |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company |year=1977 |location= San Francisco}}</ref> Others counter this by pointing to the past successes of environmental reform movements to improve water and air quality in liberal societies.<ref name=Baber/> In practice, environmentalism can improve democracy rather than necessitate its end, by expanding democratic participation and promoting political innovations.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Democracy, Bureaucracy and Environmentalism|last = Paehlke|first = Robert| author-link= Robert C. Paehlke|date = 1988|journal = Journal of Environmental Ethics|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 291–308|doi = 10.5840/enviroethics198810437}}</ref>

The tensions between liberal democracy and environmental goals raise questions about the possible limitations of democracy (or at least democracy as we know it): in its responsiveness to subtle but large-scale problems, its ability to work from a holistic societal perspective, its aptness in coping with environmental crisis relative to other forms of government.<ref name=Mathews/> Democracies do not have the provisions to make environmental reforms that are not mandated by voters, and many voters lack incentives or desire to demand policies that could compromise immediate prosperity. The question arises as to whether the foundation of politics is morality or practicality.<ref name=Mathews/> A scheme that conceives of and values the environment beyond its human utility, an [[environmental ethics]], could be crucial for democracies to respond to climate change.<ref name=Mathews/>

== Alternative forms of democracy for environmental policy ==
In political theory, [[deliberative democracy]] has been discussed as a political model more compatible with environmental goals. Deliberative democracy is a system in which informed political equals weigh values, information, and expertise, and debate priorities to make decisions, as opposed to a democracy based on interest aggregation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = When the People Speak|last = Fishkin|first = James|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780199604432|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNsUDAAAQBAJ&q=%22When+the+People+Speak%22}}</ref> This definition of democracy emphasizes informed discussion among citizens in the decision making process, and encourages decisions to benefit the common good rather than individual interests.<ref name=Baber/> Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson claimed that reason prevails over self-interest in deliberative democracy, making it a more just system.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7869.html|title = Why Deliberative Democracy|date = 2004|website = Princeton University Press|last = Gutmann and Thompson|first = Amy and Dennis}}</ref> The broad perspective that this discursive model encourages could lead to a stronger engagement with environmental concerns.<ref name=Baber/> When compared to non-democracies, democracies are in fact more cooperative in climate change policy creation, but not necessarily on the outcome and effects of these policies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bättig |first1=Michèle B. |last2=Bernauer |first2=Thomas |title=National Institutions and Global Public Goods: Are Democracies More Cooperative in Climate Change Policy? |journal=International Organization |date=15 April 2009 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=281–308 |doi=10.1017/S0020818309090092|hdl=20.500.11850/19435 |s2cid=154618618 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

This can be explained more exhaustively with the concept of [[Grassroots democracy|grass-roots democracy]]. Grass-roots democracy is an approach in which ordinary citizens are in charge of politics, in opposition to ‘larger organizations and wealthy individuals with concentrated vested interests in particular policies’.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grassroots-democracy Meaning {{!}} Best 1 Definitions of Grassroots-democracy|url=https://www.yourdictionary.com/grassroots-democracy|access-date=2021-01-27|website=www.yourdictionary.com}}</ref> [[Green party|Green parties]] were once dedicated to offer a project valuing the ideology of grass-roots democracy. However, according to [[Moisey Ostrogorsky|Ostrogorski]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ostrogorski|first=Moisey|title=Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties|publisher=Macmillan|year=1902|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> and [[Robert Michels|Michels]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Michels|first=Robert|title=Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie; Untersuchungen über die oligarchischen Tendenzen des Gruppenlebens|publisher=Werner Klinkhardt|year=1911|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=}}</ref> all parties follow inevitably a similar path towards concentration of power and oligarchy. Green parties thus follow different principles nowadays.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frankland, E.G., Lucardie, P. and Rihoux, B.|title=Green Parties in Transition: The End of Grass-roots Democracy?|publisher=Ashgate|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7546-7429-0|location=Surrey and Burlington|pages=}}</ref>

In political theory, the lottery system is a democratic design that allows governments to address problems with future, rather than immediate, impacts. Deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected representatives can draft environmental policies that have short-term costs without considering the political consequences for re-election.<ref name=Guerrero/>

== New materialism and environmental justice ==
New materialism is a strain of thought in philosophy and the social sciences that conceives of all material as having life or agency.<ref>{{Cite book|title = New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics|last = Coole and Frost|publisher = Duke University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0822392996|location = United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFhBBKKTkMoC&q=%22New+Materialisms:+Ontology,+Agency,+and+Politics%22&pg=PR7}}</ref> It criticizes frameworks of justice that center on human attributes like consciousness as insufficient for modern ethical problems that concern the natural environment. It is a post-humanist consideration of all matter that rejects arguments of utility that privilege humans. This politically relevant social theory combats inequality beyond the interpersonal plane.<ref name=Newman>{{Cite journal|title = Marxism and Ecocriticism|last = Newman|first = Lance|date = 2002|journal = Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ|volume = 9|issue = 2|pages = 1–25|doi = 10.1093/isle/9.2.1}}</ref> People are ethically responsible for one another, and for the physical spaces they navigate, including animal and plant life, and the inanimate matter that sustains it, like soil. New materialism encourages political action according to this world vision, even if it is incompatible with economic growth.<ref name=Newman/>

[[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett]] uses the term "vital materialism" in her book ''Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things''. She develops the concept of materialism with the aim of providing a stronger basis in political theory for environmental politics.

New materialists have invoked [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and other historical thinkers to trace the emergence of their philosophy and to justify their environmental claims:<ref>{{Cite book|title = New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies|last = Dolphijn and van der Tuin|first = Rick and Iris|publisher = Open Humanities Press|year = 2012|location = Ann Arbor|pages = 67–68}}</ref><blockquote>"No justice ... seems possible or thinkable without the principle of some responsibility, beyond all living present, within that which disjoins the living present, before the ghosts of those who are not yet born or who are already dead [...]. Without this non-contemporaneity with itself of the living present ... without this responsibility and this respect for justice concerning those who are not there, of those who are no longer or who are not yet present and living, what sense would there be to ask the question 'where?' 'where tomorrow?' 'whither?'"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International|last = Derrida|first = Jacques|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|location = New York and London}}</ref> </blockquote>All material, living and dead, is interrelated in "the mesh" as described by [[Timothy Morton]]. As all matter is interdependent, humans have obligations to all parts of the material world, including those that are unfamiliar.

New materialism is related to a shift from the view of the environment as a form of capital to a form of labor (see [[Ecosystem services]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Beyond The Limits to Growth: Ecology and the Neoliberal Counterrevolution|last = Holiday|first = Sara Nelson|date = 2015|journal = Antipode|volume = 47|issue = 2|pages = 461–480|doi = 10.1111/anti.12125}}</ref>

== Emerging nations ==
Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as the "[[BRICS|BRIC]]" nations) are rapidly industrializing, and are increasingly responsible for global carbon emissions and the associated climate change. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Other forms of [[environmental degradation]] have also accompanied the economic growth in these nations.<ref name=Shaw>{{Cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |title=Will Emerging Economies Repeat the Environmental Mistakes of their Rich Cousins? |date=1 March 2012 |website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |last=Shaw |first=William |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208095237/http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/01/choking-on-growth |archive-date=2015-12-08 }}</ref> Environmental degradation tends to motivate action more than the threat of global warming does, since air and water pollution cause immediate health problems, and because pollutants can damage natural resources, hampering economic potential.<ref name=Shaw/>
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|The Kuznets curve is a hypothetical curve representing the trajectory of environmental degradation in developing nations as a function of per capita income.|322x322px]]
With rising incomes, environmental degradation tends to decrease in industrializing nations, as depicted in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (described in a section of the [[Kuznets curve|Kuznets Curve]] article). Citizens demand better air and water quality, and technology becomes more efficient and clean when incomes increase.<ref name=Shaw/> The level of income per capita needed to reverse the trend of environmental degradation in industrializing nations varies with the environmental impact indicator.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://isecoeco.org/pdf/stern.pdf|title = The Environmental Kuznets Curve|date = June 2003|website = The International Society for Ecological Economics|last = Stern|first = David}}</ref> More developed nations can facilitate eco-friendly transitions in emerging economies by investing in the development of clean technologies. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Laws implemented in response to environmental concerns vary by nation (see [[List of environmental laws by country]]).

=== China ===
China's environmental ills include acid rain, severe smog, and a reliance on coal-burning for energy.<ref name=Economy>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-environmental-challenge-political-social-economic-implications/p5573|title = China's Environmental Challenge: Political, Social and Economic Implications|date = 27 January 2003|website = Council on Foreign Relations|last = Economy|first = Elizabeth}}</ref> China has instated environmental policies since the 1970s, and has one of the most extensive environmental conservation programs on paper.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = China's Environment: Problems and Policies|last = MacBean|first = Alasdair|date = 2007|journal = The World Economy|volume = 30|issue = 2|pages = 292–307|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9701.2007.00883.x|s2cid = 154594885}}</ref> However, regulation and enforcement by the central government in Beijing are weak, so solutions are decentralized. Wealthier provinces are far more effective in their preservation and sustainable development efforts than poorer regions.<ref name=Economy/> China therefore provides an example of the consequences of environmental damage falling disproportionately on the poor.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ifad.org/events/past/hunger/envir.html|title = Combating Environmental Degradation|website = Investing in Rural People|publisher = International Fund for Agricultural Development}}</ref> NGOs, the media, and the international community have all contributed to China's response to environmental problems.<ref name=Economy/>

For history, laws, and policies, see [[Environmental policy in China]].

=== India ===
In 1976, the [[Constitution of India]] was amended to reflect environmental priorities, motivated in part by the potential threat of natural [[resource depletion]] to economic growth:<blockquote>"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife." (Art. 48A)</blockquote><blockquote>"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India [...] to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures." (Art. 51A)</blockquote>However, in India, as in China, the implementation of written environmental policies, laws, and amendments has proven challenging. Official legislation by the central government (see a partial list at [[Environmental policy of the Government of India]]) is often more symbolic than practical.<ref name=Dembowski>{{Cite book|title = Taking the State to Court: Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India|last = Dembowski|first = Hans|publisher = Asia House|year = 2001|location = online|pages = 63–84}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] was established in 1985, but corruption within bureaucratic agencies, namely the influence of wealthy industry leaders, limited any attempts at enforcement of the policies put in place.<ref name=Dembowski/>
