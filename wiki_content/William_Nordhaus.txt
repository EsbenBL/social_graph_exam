==Contributions to economics and the study of climate change==
Nordhaus is the author or editor of over 20 books. One of his early works, he partnered with Paul Samuelson as a co-author for an introductory textbook entitled ''Economics''. Nordhaus worked alongside Samuelson from the 12th edition until the 19th, starting in 1985.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Samuelson |first1=Paul A. |last2=McGraw |first2=Harold W. |last3=Nordhaus |first3=William D. |last4=Ashenfelter |first4=Orley |last5=Solow |first5=Robert M. |last6=Fischer |first6=Stanley |title=Samuelson's "Economics" at Fifty: Remarks on the Occasion of the Anniversary of Publication |journal=The Journal of Economic Education <!-- |date=undefined NaN --> |year=1999 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=352–363 |doi=10.2307/1182949|jstor=1182949 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Economics |date=2009 |url=https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/economics-samuelson-nordhaus/M9780073511290.html |language=en}}</ref>  It was first published in 1948 and has appeared in nineteen different editions and seventeen different languages. It was known as a best-selling economics textbook for decades and is still extremely popular today. ''Economics'' was called a “canonical textbook”, and the development of mainstream economic thought has been traced by comparing the nineteen editions over the 1948–2010 period.

He has also written several books on [[global warming]] and [[climate change]], one of his primary areas of research.  Those books include ''Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change'' (1994), which won the 2006 Award for "Publication of Enduring Quality" from the Association of Environmental and Resource Economics. Another book, with Joseph Boyer, is ''Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming'' (2000), ''The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World''.<ref>{{cite book|author=William D. Nordhaus|title=The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRf7AAAAQBAJ|date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300189773}}</ref> His most recent book is ''The Spirit of Green'' (2021).

In 1972 Nordhaus, along with fellow Yale economics professor [[James Tobin]], published  ''Is Growth Obsolete?'',<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7620.pdf |title=Is Growth Obsolete? William Nordhaus and James Tobin, Yale University (Link) }}</ref> an article that introduced the [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare) as the first attempt to develop environmental accounting.

Nordhaus is also known for his critique of current measures of national income. He wrote, "If we are to obtain accurate estimates of the growth of real incomes over the last century, we must somehow construct price indexes that account for the vast changes in the quality and range of goods and services that we consume, that somehow compare the services of horse with automobile, of Pony Express with facsimile machine, of carbon paper with photocopier, of dark and lonely nights with nights spent watching television, and of brain surgery with magnetic resonance imaging" (1997, 30).<ref>Nordhaus, William D. 1997. "Do Real Output and Real Wage Measures Capture Reality? The History of Light Suggests Not." The Economics of New Goods. Edited by Robert J. Gordon and Timothy F. Bresnahan. University of Chicago Press for the National Bureau of Economic Research. 27–70.</ref>

Palda summarizes the importance of Nordhaus's insight as follows: "The practical lesson to be drawn from this fascinating study of lighting is that the way we measure the consumer price index is severely flawed. Instead of putting goods and their prices directly into the index we should reduce all goods to their constituent characteristics. Then we should evaluate how these goods can best be combined to minimize the cost of consuming these characteristics. Such an approach would allow us to include new goods in the consumer price index without worrying about whether the index of today is comparable to that of ten years ago when the good did not exist. Such an approach would also allow governments to more precisely calculate the rate at which welfare and other forms of aid should be increased. At present, such calculations tend to overestimate the cost of living because they do not take into account the manner in which increases in quality reduce the monetary cost of maintaining a certain standard of living."<ref>Palda, Filip (2013).

=== Contributions on economics of climate change ===
Nordhaus has written on the [[Economics of global warming|economics]] of [[global warming|climate change]]. He is the developer of the [[DICE model|DICE and RICE models]], [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment models]] of the interplay between economics, energy use, and climate change.

''A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies'' {{ISBN|978-0300137484}} was published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2008.

In ''Reflections on the Economics of Climate Change'' (1993), he states: "Mankind is playing dice with the natural environment through a multitude of interventions – injecting into the atmosphere trace gases like the greenhouse gases or [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] chemicals, engineering massive land-use changes such as deforestation, depleting multitudes of species in their natural habitats even while creating [[Transgenic organism|transgenic ones]] in the laboratory, and accumulating sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy human civilizations."<ref name=reflections>Nordhaus, W. D. '"Reflections on the economics of climate change", ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' (1993); 7(4) 11–25 at pp. 11, 15</ref>  Under the [[climate change]] models he has developed, in general those sectors of the economy that depend heavily on unmanaged [[ecosystems]] – that is, are heavily dependent upon naturally occurring rainfall, runoff, or temperatures – will be most sensitive to climate change. Agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation, and coastal activities fall in this category."<ref name=reflections /> Nordhaus takes seriously the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Nordhaus WD | title = An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]  |date=November 1992 | volume = 258 | issue = 5086 | pages = 1315–1319 | doi = 10.1126/science.258.5086.1315  | pmid = 17778354 | url = http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p08a/p0829.pdf| bibcode = 1992Sci...258.1315N | s2cid = 23232493 }}</ref>

In 2007, Nordhaus, who has done several studies on the [[economics of global warming]], criticized the [[Stern Review]] for its use of a low [[Social discount rate|discount rate]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/Nordhaus_stern_jel.pdf |title=The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change |last1=Nordhaus |first1= William |publisher=[[Yale University]] |date=May 3, 2007}}</ref>
{{quote|The Review's unambiguous conclusions about the need for extreme immediate action will not survive the substitution of discounting assumptions that are consistent with today's market place. So the central questions about global-warming policy – how much, how fast, and how costly – remain open. The Review informs but does not answer these fundamental questions.}}

In 2013, Nordhaus chaired a committee of the National Research Council that produced a report discounting the impact of [[fossil fuel subsidies]] on greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Tax Code Has Minimal Effect on Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Report Says|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=18299|website=National Academies|access-date=July 7, 2015|ref=June 20, 2013}}</ref>

In a January 2020 interview with ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', Nordhaus claimed that achieving the 2°C goal of the Paris agreement was "impossible", stating that "even if we make the fastest possible turn towards zero emissions, {{CO2}} will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere, because we cannot simply shut down our economy". He asserted that he was not alone in making this assessment, claiming that half of the simulation arrived at the same conclusion. He also remarked that the two-degree target was set without reference to the costs of meeting the target.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-tech/environmental-protection_global-warming-goals-impossible--nobel-laureate-tells-swiss-paper/45518376|title=Global warming goals impossible, Nobel laureate tells Swiss paper|date=January 26, 2020|website=[[Swissinfo]]|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nzzas.nzz.ch/wissen/nobelpreistraeger-nordhaus-wir-erreichen-das-2-grad-ziel-nicht-ld.1536276|title=Nobelpreisträger Nordhaus: Wir erreichen das 2-Grad-Ziel nicht|last1=Voigt|first1=Birgit|date=25 January 2020|work=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|access-date=27 January 2020|last2=Meier|first2=Jürg|url-access=registration}}</ref>

== Honors ==
=== Scientific and engineering academies ===
Among many honors, he is a Member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the American Philosophical Society, and an Elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=Yale-page/> He has been a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]] since 1999. He was awarded the [https://www.aapss.org/the-moynihan-prize/2020-moynihan-prize-recipient/ Daniel Patrick Moynihan Prize] by the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]] in 2020.

=== American Economic Association ===
In 2004, Nordhaus was designated a Distinguished Fellow of the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA), along with [[George P. Shultz]] and [[William A. Brock]].<ref>American Economic Association [http://www.aeaweb.org/honors_awards/disting_fellows.php "Distinguished Fellows".]</ref> The accompanying AEA statement referred to his "knack for asking large questions about the measurement of [[economic growth]] and [[well-being]], and addressing them with simple but creative insights," among them, his pioneering work on the [[Business cycle#Politically based business cycle|political business cycle]],<ref>• William D.

=== Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics ===
Nordhaus was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2018, which he shared with [[Paul Romer]].<ref name="YaleNews"/> In detailing its reasons for giving the prize to Nordhaus, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] specifically recognized his efforts to develop "an ''[[Integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment model]]'', i.e. a quantitative model that describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate. His model integrates theories and empirical results from physics, chemistry and economics. Nordhaus' model is now widely spread and is used to simulate how the economy and the climate co-evolve."<ref name="nobelpressrelease" />

Many of the news outlets that reported on Nordhaus's prize noted that he was in the advance wave of economists who embraced a [[carbon tax]] as a preferred method of [[carbon pricing]].<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Strauss | first1 = Delphine | title = Economics Nobel recognises work on climate change and innovation: William Nordhaus and Paul Romer showed how to achieve sustained and sustainable growth | newspaper = Financial Times | date = October 8, 2018 | url = https://www.ft.com/content/b08807de-cae0-11e8-9fe5-24ad351828ab | quote = Mr Nordhaus was an early advocate of carbon taxes, but the committee noted that the models he developed also allowed policymakers to calculate quantitative paths for the best tax showing how they would depend on [assumptions regarding the values of disparate climate and economic variables].}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last1 = Appelbaum | first1 = Binyamin | title = 2018 Nobel in Economics Awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 8, 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/business/economic-science-nobel-prize.html | quote = The Yale economist William D.

== Evaluations ==

The Nobel Foundation described Nordhaus's work as follows: "William Nordhaus’s findings deal with interactions between society, the economy and climate change. In the mid-1990s, he created a quantitative model that describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate. Nordhaus’s model is used to examine the consequences of climate policy interventions, for example carbon taxes." Additionally, the Nobel Prize announcement commented that Nordhaus had “significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2018|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2018/nordhaus/facts/|access-date=2021-06-17|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> In an evaluation of the work, Lint Barrage summarizes its impact, stating that the "body of work also represents science at its best: integrative across disciplines, visionary in scope yet incremental in progress, transparent, and producing knowledge for the benefit of humankind."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679442|access-date=2021-06-17|website=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9442|language=en}}</ref>

Critics of Nordhaus's DICE model focus on several aspects. One of the most important, incorporating political and moral philosophy, is the use of discounting, with an early study by William Cline.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cline|first=William|title=The economics of global warming|publisher=Institute for International Economics.|year=1992}}</ref> Another branch, represented by [[Robert Pindyck]], holds that integrated assessment models cannot capture the complexity of the climate-economy nexus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pindyck|first=Robert S.|date=May 2012|title=Uncertain outcomes and climate change policy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2011.12.001|journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management|volume=63|issue=3|pages=289–303|doi=10.1016/j.jeem.2011.12.001|issn=0095-0696|hdl=1721.1/66946|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Nicholas Stern  argued that the damage function does not capture many of the most important risks to society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Nicholas|date=2008-04-01|title=The Economics of Climate Change|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.98.2.1|journal=American Economic Review|volume=98|issue=2|pages=1–37|doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.1|issn=0002-8282}}</ref> A particularly important critique, developed by Martin Weitzman, is that the economy-climate system may have "fat tails" and therefore inadequately deal with low probability, high consequence outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weitzman|first=Martin L.|date=2011-07-01|title=Fat-Tailed Uncertainty in the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/reep/rer006|journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy|volume=5|issue=2|pages=275–292|doi=10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856|s2cid=225300874|issn=1750-6816}}</ref>

Steve Keen, the heterodox economist, criticises the economics of climate change:
"economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90% of GDP will be unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keen|first=Steve|date=2020-09-01|title=The appallingly bad neoclassical economics of climate change|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856?scroll=top&needAccess=true|journal=Globalizations|pages=1–29|doi=10.1093/reep/rer006|issn=1750-6816}}</ref>
