'''Samuel Hollander''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC}} (born April 6, 1937) is a [[England|British]]/[[Canadian]]/[[Israel]]i [[economist]].

Born in [[London]], he received a B.Sc. in economics from the [[London School of Economics]] in 1959. In 1961 he received an AM and a Ph.D. in 1963 from [[Princeton University]]. He started with the [[University of Toronto]] becoming an Assistant Professor (1963–1966), Associate Professor (1966–1970), Professor (1970–1984), University Professor (1984–1998), and upon his retirement in 1998, University Professor Emeritus. Since 2000 he is a Professor at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]]. He became a citizen of Canada in 1967 and of Israel in 2000.

Samuel Hollander is one of the most influential and controversial living authors on [[History of Economic Thought]], especially on [[classical economics]]. His monumental studies of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] have provoked some sharp reactions. Especially his "new view" of David Ricardo as a direct predecessor of later [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical]] economists such as [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] has triggered heated debates. Apart from many critics he has also enjoyed the support of a considerable number of prominent fellow economists. His work was highly recommended by the late [[Lionel Robbins|Lord Robbins]], who says "...&nbsp;he really surpasses all previous historians of economic thought, especially on Ricardo" (Robbins, 1998, p.&nbsp;143).
