'''Morton A. "Mort" Klein''' (born 1947) is a German-born American economist, statistician, and pro-Israeli activist. He is the president of the [[Zionist Organization of America]]. In 2004, he was named one of the top five Jewish leaders in the United States by ''[[The Forward]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bechollashon.org/heart/index.php/articles/3313|title=THE FORWARD 50; Lead Players on a Global Stage|website=bechollashon.org|access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>

== Early life and career ==
Klein was born to [[Holocaust survivors]] in a [[Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe|displaced persons camp]] in [[Günzburg]], Germany.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/26/nyregion/public-lives-in-favor-of-the-war-and-enjoying-a-good-fight.html|title=PUBLIC LIVES; In Favor of the War, and Enjoying a Good Fight|last=Wakin|first=Daniel J.|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en}}</ref> At age four, he and his family emigrated from Germany to the United States, where he would grow up in South Philadelphia.<ref name=":1" />

His father was a [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar ''chasid'']], an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Rabbi]] with ''[[semicha]]'' from [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Satmar)|Moshe Teitelbaum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39823|title=Morton Klein: Bibi Sent Wrong Message, Elliot Resnick, Jewish Press Staff Reporter|date=2009-06-24|publisher=Jewishpress.com|access-date=2010-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727103224/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39823|archive-date=2009-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> Klein said in a [[Jewish Press]] interview regarding his father that "In Europe he had a long beard and black hat and was a ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' in his early 20s. But he disagreed with the Satmars on Israel. My father loved Israel, so obviously this was transmitted to me."<ref>June 26, '09, p. 10</ref>

Klein served as an economist under presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], and [[Jimmy Carter]]. He has served as a biostatistician at [[UCLA School of Public Health]] and the [[Linus Pauling Institute]] of Science and Medicine in [[Palo Alto]], Calif. He has been a lecturer in mathematics and statistics at [[Temple University]].<ref name="Morton Klein">{{cite web|url=http://www.zoa.org/content/klein.asp|title=National President Morton A.

He was dismayed by the 1993 signing of the [[Oslo Accords]], choosing to begin pro-Israel work in response: "I only went into the work because I thought Oslo was a disastrous mistake and I wanted a podium to express that. I did not intend to do it for more than a year or two, make my case and then go back to normal life. But things kept getting worse, not better."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/how-morton-klein-went-from-fringe-figure-to-white-house-player-1.5627699|title=Steve Bannon's Best Jewish Friend: Morton Klein's Rise to Prominence in the Trump Era|date=2017-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}</ref>

==Zionist Organization of America==
In 1993, while serving as the Philadelphia chapter president of the [[Zionist Organization of America]], Klein was elected national president.<ref>{{cite web|last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/1227 |title=ZOA Pressed by Former Officials Over Guard's Pay |work=The Forward |date=2006-04-14 |access-date=2010-08-12}}</ref> He is credited for converting it from a moribund group to a high-profile, outspoken organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoa.org/media/user/documents/Publ/ZOAReportFall2008.pdf |title=4819-ZOA Report FL08.p5 |access-date=2010-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605111048/http://www.zoa.org/media/user/documents/Publ/ZOAReportFall2008.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-05 }}</ref> After the Obama administration abstained from using its veto power to block [[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 2334 which stated that [[Israeli Settlement]] in the [[West Bank]] is a 'flagrant' violation of international law, Klein called Obama "a Jew-hating antisemite."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/24/israel-rejects-shameful-un-resolution-amid-criticism-of-netanyahu|title=Israel rejects 'shameful' UN resolution amid criticism of Netanyahu|author-link=Peter Beaumont (journalist)|first=Peter|last=Beaumont|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 December 2016}}</ref>

Klein has stated his belief that the U.S. should engage in religious profiling of Muslims. "In an era in which the vast majority of terrorism is committed by Muslims, in order to protect American citizens, we should adopt the same profiling policies as Israel and be more thorough in vetting Muslims," he told ''[[The Forward]]''. Klein said he would also support profiling of Jews under certain circumstances. "If most terror were committed by Jews I would support profiling Jews."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/343103/zoa-leader-supports-trumps-call-for-profiling-muslims/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-1|title=ZOA Leader Supports Trump's Call for Profiling Muslims|newspaper=The Forward|date=June 20, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2012, the ZOA lost its tax-exempt status from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] after it failed to file tax returns for three years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/162607/zoas-uncertain-status/?p=all|title=ZOA's Uncertain Status|newspaper=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref> The ZOA regained its status in May 2013.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/alleging-corruption-vp-bids-to-oust-klein-in-zoa-vote/|title=Alleging mismanagement, VP bids to oust longtime head of US Zionist group|last=Ghert-Zand|first=Renee|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}</ref> Klein said it was a technical "glitch."<ref name=":0" /> During the years that the ZOA failed to file tax returns, ''[[The Forward]]'' reported that Klein's salary increased 38%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/163407/zoas-mort-klein-gets-38-pay-hike/?p=all|title=ZOA's Mort Klein Gets 38% Pay Hike|newspaper=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref> In 2014, Steven Goldberg, a Los Angeles attorney and national vice-president of the ZOA, launched a challenge to Klein's presidency, alleging that Klein was mismanaging the ZOA and personally profiting.<ref name=":0" /> Klein was later reelected president with 93% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/morton-klein-reelected-zoa-national-president/|title=Morton Klein reelected ZOA national president|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}</ref>

Through his work with the ZOA, Klein was named one of the top dozen "Jewish activists of the century." The NY Jewish Week (largest Federation paper) has named him one of the top ten Jewish leaders who have made a difference. ''[[The Jewish Press]]'' recently stated that "Morton Klein is one of the best minds in this country."<ref name="zoa.org">{{cite web|url=https://zoa.org/about/morton-a-klein/|title=National President Morton A. Klein|website=Zionist Organization of America}}</ref>

Through the ZOA, Klein has taken issue with comments by Democratic Congresswoman [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] which appropriated the phrase "never again". Klein stated: “AOC’s ludicrous statements that the U.S. has a ‘Fascist’ ‘presidency that creates concentration camps’ to hold immigrant communities, and AOC's invocation of the Holocaust-associated slogan ‘never again’ with respect to the housing of immigrant minors – are abhorrent insults to the memory of the 6 million Jews and the millions of gays, gypsies, and others who were intentionally slaughtered, worked to death, starved, gassed and tortured in the real Nazi-Fascist concentration camps.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/264794|title=Jewish groups hit Ocasio-Cortez for appropriating 'Never Again'|website=Israel National News}}</ref> Klein has also called for [[Rashida Tlaib]] to be removed from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for what he views as antisemitic comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/American-Politics/ZOA-calls-to-remove-Rashida-Tlaib-from-Democratic-party-587842|title=ZOA calls to remove Rashida Tlaib from Democratic party - American Politics|last=Jaffe-Hoffman|first=Maayan|date=April 25, 2019|website=Jerusalem Post}}</ref>

===Opposition to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement===
Klein is an active voice against the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement against [[Israel]], once speaking on the issue in an address to the [[Israeli Knesset]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zoa.org/2014/07/10249460-video-of-zoa-president-morton-klein-addressing-knesset-about-the-importance-of-language-in-fighting-bds/|title=ZOA President Klein addresses Knesset about the importance of language in fighting BDS|website=Zionist Organization of America}}</ref>

===Qatar controversy===
On June 19, 2018, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' reported that Qatar had donated $100,000 to the ZOA through lobbyist [[Joey Allaham]]. Allaham first contributed $50,000 to the ZOA on November 2, 2017,<ref name="mojo2">{{cite news |date=June 19, 2018 |title=Mike Huckabee Praised Qatar Without Revealing He Was Paid $50,000 by Qatar |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/06/mike-huckabee-praised-qatar-without-revealing-he-was-paid-50000-by-qatar/ |work=Mother Jones }}</ref> shortly before the group's annual gala on November 17 in which former Qatari diplomat [[Ahmed Al-Rumaihi]] was present, at the invitation of Allaham.<ref name="mojo1">{{cite news |date=June 13, 2018 |title=How the King of New York Kosher Restaurants Helped Qatar Win Over American Jewish Leaders |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/06/joey-allaham-nick-muzin-qatar-jewish-leaders/ |work=Mother Jones }}</ref> The second $50,000 contribution from Allaham to the ZOA came on January 23, 2018, a few weeks after Klein visited Doha.<ref name="mojo2"/> Klein had been under the impression that the money came from Allaham's personal finances and had ZOA return the funds when it was discovered otherwise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/qatar-used-pro-israel-businessman-to-pay-zionist-group-100000-report/|title=Qatar used pro-Israel businessman to pay Zionist group $100,000 — report|first=Ron|last=Kampeas|date=21 June 2018|website=The Times of Israel}}</ref>

===Portman “beautiful” but “not too bright”===
In April 2018, Klein tweeted: “[[Natalie Portman]]’s absurd, uninformed, inaccurate, dangerous views on Israel, while ignoring the anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist views/actions of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority gives credibility and legitimacy to the ludicrous, false, nonsensical belief that beautiful women aren’t too bright.” Portman had refused to accept the [[Genesis Prize]] in Israel, protesting the killing of Palestinian demonstrators on the [[Gaza Strip]] border. Klein was accused of misogyny. He first dismissed the criticism by citing an “attractive and smart” female staffer, but later apologised for his comments.<ref>[https://www.timesofisrael.com/zoa-chief-draws-ire-for-calling-natalie-portman-beautiful-but-not-too-bright/ ZOA chief draws ire for calling Natalie Portman beautiful, but not ‘too bright’] [[Times of Israel]], 27&nbsp;April 2018; [https://www.timesofisrael.com/zoa-chief-klein-sorry-for-inappropriate-comments-on-portman-female-employee/ ZOA chief Klein sorry for inappropriate comments on Portman, female employee] [[Times of Israel]], 28&nbsp;April 2018.</ref>

===Use of anti-Arab slur===
Klein was the target of condemnation in September 2018 for using the term "filthy Arabs" on Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forward.com/news/410836/zoas-mort-klein-tweets-filthy-arab-slur-and-doubles-down/|title=ZOA's Mort Klein Tweets 'Filthy Arab' Slur — And Doubles Down|first1=Josh|last1=Nathan-KazisSeptember 24|last2=2018|website=The Forward}}</ref> He has stood by his comment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/mort-klein-stands-by-filthy-arab-slur-as-condemnation-grows-1.6510820|title=Mort Klein Stands by 'Filthy Arab' Slur as Condemnation Grows|first=The|last=Forward|date=26 September 2018|via=Haaretz}}</ref>

===Opposition to Black Lives Matter===
Klein made a series of tweets in June 2020 condemning [[Black Lives Matter]] as "a Jew hating, White hating, Israel hating, conservative Black hating, violence promoting, dangerous Soros funded extremist group of haters."<ref>{{cite tweet |user=MortonAKlein7 |number=1269321723763200013 |date=6 June 2020 |title=I urge the SPLC to immediately put BlackLivesMatter on their list of hate groups. BLM is a Jew hating, White hating, Israel hating, conservative Black hating, violence promoting, dangerous Soros funded extremist group of haters. }}</ref> In the context of the [[George Floyd protests|widespread protests]] following the police [[murder of George Floyd]], the statements put Klein in conflict with more liberal Jewish groups. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, questioned the continued membership of ZOA in the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations by saying "we are now implicated by his views, his Islamophobia, his racism, full stop."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kampeas |first1=Ron |title=At time of racial strife, US Jewish groups call to expel ZOA from umbrella org. |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-time-of-racial-strife-us-jewish-groups-call-to-expel-zoa-from-umbrella-org/ |access-date=9 June 2020 |work=The Times of Israel |date=9 June 2020}}</ref>

==Conflict with Rutgers==
On September 11, 2018 it was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that [[Kenneth L. Marcus]], the assistant secretary of education for civil rights reopened a seven-year-old case brought by the ZOA against [[Rutgers University]], saying the Obama administration, in closing the case, ignored evidence that suggested the school allowed a hostile environment for Jewish students.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/politics/rutgers-jewish-education-civil-rights.html|title=Education Dept.

But as the State Department definition of anti-Semitism recognizes, these attacks are often a mask for Jew-hatred, plain and simple.”<ref name="nytimes.com"/>
