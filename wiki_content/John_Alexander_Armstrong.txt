{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="My first publications on nationalism contained extended references to religion ... Subsequent familiarity with the impressive sociological work by [[Peter L.

In general, I share this consensus, while stipulating that ''nations'', but no particular nation of the modern type, and certainly not ''nationalism'' existed before the 16th century. Such issues of timing and agency are very important to my theory, for my methodological preference is for intensive employment of historical data over the ''[[longue durée]]'' ... The pre-modern social formations that I treat in ''Nations before Nationalism'' (1982) and elsewhere ... require a national idea. Fundamental themes are myth, symbol, and communication, especially as they relate to boundary mechanisms of a psychological rather than territorial nature."|source=Myth and Symbolism Theory of Nationalism, John A.

'''John Alexander Armstrong Jr.''' (4 May 1922 &ndash; 2010) was [[Professor Emeritus]] of political science at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].

Born in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] on 4 May 1922, he entered [[the University of Chicago]] at age 20 where he received both bachelor's and master's degrees. However, the date of his graduation was delayed by his enlistment in the U.S. Army in Belgium during World War II, from 1944 to 1945. Such experience appears to have certain impacts upon the direction of his academic research on nationalism in Europe afterwards.

He entered [[Columbia University]] for further study in 1950 and received a Ph.D. three years later.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.polisci.wisc.edu/news/default.aspx?id=71 | title=Memorial resolution for Professor Emeritus John Armstrong | publisher=University of Wisconsin System | accessdate=5 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307053930/http://www.polisci.wisc.edu/news/default.aspx?id=71 | archive-date=7 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

His earlier works focus on nationalism and ideologies in Europe, especially [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] during the 1950s and 1960s. The most influential work of his is the path-breaking ''Nations before Nationalism'' (1982) which firstly systematically expressed the ''[[longue durée]]'' of ethnic identity and has inspired theorists of [[ethnosymbolism]] including [[Anthony D. Smith]].
