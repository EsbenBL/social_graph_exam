During [[World War II]], Dodd directed opinion survey work for the Allied Expeditionary Forces in [[Sicily]] and the [[Near East]].<ref>Stuart C. Dodd (1946). "Towards World Surveying". In: ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', volume 10, page 470.</ref>

== Work ==
Dodd was a leading expert on typical statistical polling as head of the Washington State Public Opinion Laboratory at the University of Washington in the 1960s. He was the only pollster to accurately predict, that U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] would defeat Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and was called to testify before Congress as to how that all happened.

=== Bogardus Scale ===
In 1954 Dodd and Nehnevasja became known for their introduction of precise metric distances into the [[Bogardus scale]].<ref>Stuart C. Dodd and Jiri Nehnevajsa (1954). "Physical Dimensions of Social Distance". In: ''Sociology and Social Research'' Vol 38 (May–June 1954): pp. 287-292.</ref> According to Ethington, "revising some of the Bogardus response items and converting each to a power of 10 meters, they captured an almost convincing, common-sense physical distance for each item. Dodd and Nehnevasja had no intention of restoring geometric distance to any kind of constitutive role in the social process. Their sole objective, in fact, was to find an even more objective, trans-spatial metric".<ref>Philip J. Ethington, [http://www.cybergeo.eu/index227.html "The Intellectual Construction of "Social Distance": Toward a Recovery of Georg Simmel’s Social Geometry"]. Retrieved 16 June 2008.</ref>
