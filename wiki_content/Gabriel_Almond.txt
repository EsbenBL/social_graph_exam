'''Gabriel Abraham Almond''' (January 12, 1911 – December 25, 2002) was an American [[political science|political scientist]] best known for his pioneering work on [[comparative politics]], political development, and [[political culture]].

==Biography==
Almond was born on January 12, 1911, in [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]], [[Illinois]], the son of [[Russian-Jewish]] and [[Ukrainian-Jewish]] [[immigration|immigrants]], raised "in a strict [[orthodox Jewish]] home."<ref>"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gabriel-almond-123409.html Obituary: Gabriel Almond Political scientist with chutzpah]", [[The Independent]], Thursday 9 January 2003</ref> He attended the [[University of Chicago]], both as an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and as a [[postgraduate education|graduate student]], and worked with [[Harold Lasswell]]. Almond completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1938, but his doctoral [[thesis|dissertation]], ''Plutocracy and Politics in New York City'', was not published until 1998, because it included unflattering references to [[John D. Rockefeller]], a benefactor of the University of Chicago.

Almond taught at [[Brooklyn College]] (now the [[City University of New York]]) from 1939 to 1942. With US entry into [[World War II]], Almond joined the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]], analyzing enemy [[propaganda]], and becoming head of its Enemy Information Section. After the war, Almond worked for the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey|US Strategic Bombing Survey]] in post-war [[Germany]].

Almond returned to academic life in 1947 and taught at [[Yale University]] where he was part of their [[Yale Institute of International Studies|Institute of International Studies]] until 1951, when he was part of a group that left for [[Princeton University]] and founded its [[Center of International Studies]].<ref name="nyt-1951">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/04/23/80706901.pdf | title=Six of Faculty Leaving Yale For Princeton in Policy Split | first=Stanley | last=Levey | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 23, 1951 | pages=1, 18}}</ref>  He subsequently returned to Yale in 1959, then went to [[Stanford University]] in 1963, where he remained until his retirement in 1993. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1961.<ref name="AAAS">{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref> He was [[chair]] of the political science department at Stanford from 1964 to 1969 and spent time as a visiting professor at the [[University of Tokyo]],  the University of [[Belo Horizonte]], and the [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]. Although Almond retired in 1976 and became an [[professor|emeritus professor]] at Stanford, he continued to write and teach until his death.

Almond chaired the [[Social Science Research Council]]'s Committee on Comparative Politics for many years and was president of the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA) for 1965–1966. In 1981, he received APSA's [[James Madison]] Award, which is given to a [[political science|political scientist]] who has made a "distinguished scholarly contribution" during his or her career. He was also the first recipient of the [[Karl Deutsch Award]]<ref>[http://www.ipsa.org/awards/karl-deutsch Karl Deutsch Award]</ref> of the [[International Political Science Association]] in 1997. Almond died on December 25, 2002, in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]], [[California]], aged 91.

==Work==
Almond broadened the field of political science in the 1950s by integrating approaches from other [[social sciences|social science]] disciplines, such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[anthropology]], into his work. He transformed an interest in [[foreign policy]] into systematic studies of [[comparative politics|comparative political]] [[wikt:development|development]] and [[culture]]. Almond's research eventually covered many topics, including the politics of [[developing countries]], [[communism]], and [[religious fundamentalism]].

Almond was a prolific author, publishing 18 books and numerous journal articles, and co-writing many others. His most famous work was ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963), co-authored with [[Sidney Verba]]. It popularized the idea of a [[political culture]]&nbsp;– a concept that includes national character and how people choose to govern themselves&nbsp;– as a fundamental aspect of society. Almond and Verba distinguished different political cultures according to their level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward [[politics]]. ''The Civic Culture'' was one of the first large-scale cross-national survey studies undertaken in [[political science]] and greatly stimulated [[comparative studies]] of [[democracy]].

Almond also contributed to [[theory|theoretical]] work on political development. In ''Comparative Politics: A Developmental Approach'' (1966), Almond and G. Bingham Powell proposed a variety of [[cultural]] and [[Structural functionalism|functional]] ways to measure the development of societies. For a period in the 1960s and 1970s, Almond's approaches came to define [[comparative politics]].

In a 1991 paper titled, "Capitalism and Democracy", in two paragraphs Almond stated what the basic agendas for the study of governance ought to be in US universities: that capitalism and democracy co-exist as the prevailing systems of governance the world over and they invariably interact with each other and transform each other through time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.library.ku.edu.tr/reserve/resfall12_13/intl534_DMousseau/week5_capitalism_and_democracy.pdf|title=Capitalism and Democracy|last=Almond|first=Gabriel|date=1991}}</ref>

==Almond–Lippmann consensus<!--'Almond–Lippmann consensus' redirects here-->==
The similarities between Almond's view and [[Walter Lippmann]]'s produced what became known as the '''Almond–Lippmann consensus'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, which is based on three assumptions:<ref name="holsti">Holsti, Ole, R., and James M. Rosenau.  1979.  "Vietnam, Consensus, and the Belief Systems of American Leaders."  ''World Politics 32.'' (October):1–56</ref>

#Public opinion is volatile, shifting erratically in response to the most recent developments or manipulation.<ref name = "Peres">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_KtS8y-R8C|title=Between Consent and Dissent: Democracy and Peace in the Israeli Mind|last=Yuchtman-Yaar|first=Ephraim|author2=Peres, Yoḥanan|year=2000|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=10|isbn=9780847697120|access-date=10 November 2013}}</ref> Mass beliefs early in the twentieth century were "too pacifist in peace and too bellicose in war, too neutralist or appeasing in negotiations or too intransigent."<ref name="lippmann">Lippmann, Walter. 1955.  ''Essays in the Public Philosophy.'' Boston: Little, Brown.</ref>
#Public opinion is incoherent, lacking an organized or a consistent structure to such an extent that the views of US citizens could best be described as "nonattitudes".<ref name="converse">Converse, Philip.  1964. "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics." In ''Ideology and Discontent,'' ed. David Apter, 206–261.  New York: Free Press.</ref>
#Public opinion is irrelevant to the policy-making process. Political leaders ignore public opinion because most Americans can neither "understand nor influence the very events upon which their lives and happiness are known to depend."<ref name="almond">Almond, Gabriel. 1950. ''The American People and Foreign Policy''. New York: Harcourt, Brace.</ref><ref name="kris">Kris, Ernst, and Nathan Leites. 1947. "Trends in Twentieth Century Propaganda."

The Almond–Lippmann consensus was highly influential in the 1950s and 1960s but weakened following the [[Vietnam War]]. Current research has refuted much of the Almond–Lippmann consensus, especially the second point that public opinion is incoherent and lacks organization. In fact, research done by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Kentucky]] has suggested that Americans reach opinion on foreign policy by using abstract, but often consistent, ideologies. These ideologies include their attitudes towards [[communism]], [[militarism]], [[isolationism]], and so forth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hurwitz|first=Jon|date=December 1987|title=How are foreign policy attitudes structured? A Hierarchical Model|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=81|issue=4|pages=1099–1120|doi=10.2307/1962580|jstor=1962580|via=apsa}}</ref>

Lippmann recanted his previous view, arguing that the public had taken a more sober approach to the war than the heads of government.<ref name="Peres" />
