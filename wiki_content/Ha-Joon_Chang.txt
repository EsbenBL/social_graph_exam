==Biography==
After graduating from [[Seoul National University]]'s Department of Economics, he studied at the [[University of Cambridge]], earning an [[MPhil]] and a [[PhD]] for his thesis entitled ''The Political Economy of Industrial Policy – Reflections on the Role of State Intervention'' in 1991. Chang's contribution to [[economics]] started while studying under [[Robert Rowthorn]], a leading British [[Marxist economist]],<ref>{{cite journal| author=Bob Rowthorn | title=Neo-Classicism, Neo-Ricardianism and Marxism | url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&view=1322 | journal=New Left Review | date= July–August 1974 | access-date=2007-10-19}}</ref> with whom he worked on the elaboration of the theory of [[industrial policy]], which he described as a middle way between [[central planning]] and unrestrained [[free market]]. His work in this area is part of a broader approach to economics known as [[institutionalist political economy]] which places economic history and socio-political factors at the centre of the evolution of economic practices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/development-policy-and-history-lessons-from-the-green-revolution|title=Development policy and history: lessons from the Green Revolution|last=Harwood|first=Jonathan|date=14 June 2013|website=History & Policy|access-date=27 July 2016}}</ref>

==Writing==
In his book ''Kicking Away the Ladder'' (which won the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy]]'s 2003 [[Gunnar Myrdal Prize]]), Chang argued that all major [[developed countries]] used interventionist economic policies in order to get rich and then tried to forbid other countries from doing the same. The [[World Trade Organization]], [[World Bank]], and [[International Monetary Fund]] come in for strong criticism from Chang for "ladder-kicking" of this type which, he argues, is the fundamental obstacle to poverty alleviation in the [[developing world]]. This and other work led to his being awarded the 2005 [[Wassily Leontief Prize]] for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought from the [[Global Development and Environment Institute]] (previous prize-winners include [[Amartya Sen]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Alice Amsden]] and [[Robert Wade (development scholar)|Robert Wade]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/about_us/leontief.html|title=GDAE Leontief}}</ref><ref>http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/chang/cv.pdf#search=%22rowthorn%20%22ha-joon%20chang%22%22 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516140826/http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/chang/cv.pdf |date=16 May 2006 }}</ref>

The book's methodology was criticized by American Douglas Irwin, Professor of Economics at [[Dartmouth College]] and author of a 2011 study of the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Smoot–Hawley tariff]],<ref>"Blame Game", ''[[The Economist]]'', March 24, 2011. Accessed on March 28, 2011 at: http://www.economist.com/node/18438065?story_id=18438065&CFID=166516108&CFTOKEN=23109871</ref> writing on the website of the [[Economic History Association]]:
<blockquote>
Chang only looks at countries that developed during the nineteenth century and a small number of the policies they pursued. He did not examine countries that failed to develop in the nineteenth century and see if they pursued the same heterodox policies only more intensively. This is a poor scientific and historical method. Suppose a doctor studied people with long lives and found that some smoked tobacco, but did not study people with shorter lives to see if smoking was even more prevalent. Any conclusions drawn only from the observed relationship would be quite misleading.<ref>Irwin, Douglas A., "Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective". April 2004. EH.net. Accessed on 19/08/18 at: https://eh.net/book_reviews/kicking-away-the-ladder-development-strategy-in-historical-perspective/</ref></blockquote>

In contrast, [[Stanley Engerman]], Professor of Economic History at [[Rochester University]] praised Chang's approach:
<blockquote>
Ha-Joon Chang has examined a large body of historical material to reach some very interesting and important conclusions about institutions and economic development. Not only is the historical picture re-examined, but Chang uses this to argue the need for a changing attitude to the institutions desired in today's developing nations. Both as historical reinterpretation and policy advocacy, ''Kicking Away the  Ladder'' deserves a wide audience among economists, historians, and members of the policy establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economia.ucu.edu.uy/attachments/043_Summary_KAL.pdf|title=Economía|website= Universidad Católica del Uruguay}}{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Following up on the ideas of ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', Chang published ''[[Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism]]'' in December 2008.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Ha-Joon Chang | title=Protecting the global poor | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=9653 | journal=Prospect | date= July 2007  | access-date=2008-02-18}}</ref> Chang countered Irwin's criticisms by arguing that countries that had failed to develop had generally followed free market policies.  Chang also argued that while state interventionism sometimes produced economic failures, it had a better record than unregulated [[free market]] economies which, he maintained, very rarely succeeded in producing economic development. He cited evidence that [[GDP]] growth in developing countries had been higher prior to external pressures recommending [[deregulation]] and extended his analysis to the failures of free trade to induce growth through [[privatisation]] and anti-[[inflation]]ary policies. Chang's book won plaudits from [[Nobel Prize–winning economist]] [[Joseph Stiglitz]] for its fresh insight and effective blend of contemporary and historical cases but was criticised by former World Bank economist [[William Easterly]], who said that Chang used selective evidence in his book. Chang responded to Easterly's criticisms, asserting that Easterly misread his argument. Easterly in turn provided a counter-reply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/oct/08/the-anarchy-of-success/|title=The Anarchy of Success|first=William|last=Easterly|date=8 October 2009|access-date=2020-11-18|website=[[The New York Review of Books]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035535if_/https://williameasterly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/nyrb_theanarchyofsuccess_100809.pdf|archive-date=2020-11-09|url-status=live|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/the-anarchy-of-success-2/|title=The Anarchy of Success|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|last2=Rossant|first2=James|last3=Easterly|first3=William|date=19 November 2009|access-date=2020-11-18|website=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}</ref>

Chang's next book, ''[[23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism]]'', was released in 2011. It offers a twenty-three point rebuttal to aspects of neo-liberal capitalism. This includes assertions such as "Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer," "Companies should not be run in the interests of their owners," and "The washing machine has changed the world more than the internet has." This book questions the assumptions behind the dogma of neo-liberal capitalism and offers a vision of how we can shape capitalism to humane ends. This marks a broadening of Chang's focus from his previous books that were mainly critiques of neo-liberal capitalism as it related to developing countries. In this book, Chang begins to discuss the issues of the current neo-liberal system across all countries.

Chang's 2014 book, ''Economics: The User's Guide'', is an introduction to economics, written for the general public.<ref name=varsity>{{cite web | url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/6929 | title=Interview: Ha-Joon Chang | website=Varsity | date=19 February 2014}}</ref>
