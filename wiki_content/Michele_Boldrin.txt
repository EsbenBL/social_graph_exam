== Research ==
Michele Boldrin conducts ongoing research in dynamic general equilibrium [[theory]], focusing specifically on the sources of business fluctuations, growth and development, [[technological innovation]], and [[intellectual property]]. Collaborating with [[David K. Levine]], Boldrin examines the role played by competitive versus monopolistic markets in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for the presence of increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in actual economic growth. This implies that, in theory as in practice, competitive markets favor and promote continued growth and innovation, whereas monopoly power is not necessary and probably harmful to technological change and economic development. Their theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.
