==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}
[[File:Innenhof des Palazzo della Sapienza.jpg|thumb|200px|''Palazzo della Sapienza'', former home of the University until 1935.]]
[[File:Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza -Rome.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Church of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], originally the chapel and seat of the university library (until 1935).]]

Sapienza University of Rome was founded in 1303 with the [[Papal bull]] ''In Supremae praeminentia Dignitatis'', issued on 20 April 1303 by [[Pope Boniface VIII]], as a ''Studium'' for ecclesiastical studies more under his control than the universities of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]] and [[University of Padua|Padua]],<ref>[https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/la-storia History]</ref> making it the first pontifical university.

In 1431 [[Pope Eugene IV]] completely reorganized the studium with the bull ''In supremae'', in which he granted masters and students alike the broadest possible privileges and decreed that the university should include the four schools of Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology. He introduced a new tax on wine to raise funds for the university; the money was used to buy a palace which later housed the [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]] church.

However, the University's days of splendour came to an end during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]] in 1527, when the studium was closed and the professors dispersed, and some were killed. [[Pope Paul III]] restored the university shortly after his ascension to the pontificate in 1534.

In the 1650s the university became known as Sapienza, meaning wisdom, a title it retains. In 1703, [[Pope Clement XI]] purchased some land with his private funds on the [[Janiculum]], where he made a botanical garden, which soon became the most celebrated in Europe through the labours of the Trionfetti brothers. The first complete history of the Sapienza University was written in 1803–1806 by [[Filippo Maria Renazzi]].<ref name="DiSimone">{{cite book |last=Di Simone|first=Maria Rosa|date=1980|title=La sapienza romana nel Settecento |language=it |location=Roma|publisher= Edizioni dell'Ateneo }}</ref>

University students were newly animated during the 19th-century Italian revival. In 1870, ''La Sapienza'' stopped being the papal university and became the university of the capital of Italy. In 1935 the new university campus, planned by [[Marcello Piacentini]], was completed.

On 15 January 2008 the [[Holy See|Vatican]] cancelled a planned visit to La Sapienza University by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who was to speak at the university ceremony launching the 2008 academic year<ref name="bbc">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7188860.stm BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Papal visit scuppered by scholars] 15 January 2008</ref> due to protests by some students and professors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aprileonline.info/5852/la-lettera-di-marcello-cini |title=The letter of the scientists to the rector of the University|language=it|publisher=Aprileonline.info |access-date=5 July 2012}}</ref> The title of the speech would have been 'The Truth Makes Us Good and Goodness is Truth'.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-21526?l=english Benedict XVI's Planned Lecture at La Sapienza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208033657/http://www.zenit.org/article-21526?l=english |date=8 December 2011 }} 18 January 2008</ref> Some students and professors protested in reaction to a 1990 speech that Pope Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) gave in which he, in their opinion, endorsed the actions of the church against [[Galileo]] in 1633.<ref name="bbc"/>

==Campuses==
[[File:RomeUniversity1938.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The new campus of Rome University, built in 1935 by [[Marcello Piacentini]], in a 1938 picture.]]

Sapienza University has many campuses in Rome, but its main campus is the ''Città Universitaria'' (University city), which covers {{convert|44|ha|abbr=on}} near the [[Roma Tiburtina railway station|Roma Tiburtina Station]]. The university has satellite campuses outside Rome, the main one of which is in [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]].

In 2011 a project was launched to build a campus with [[residence halls]] near [[Pietralata station]], in collaboration with the [[Lazio]] region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paesesera.it/Cronaca/Pietralata-i-lavori-del-campus-inizieranno-a-fine-2012 |title=Pietralata, i lavori del campus inizieranno a fine 2012 |date=27 July 2011 |work=paesesera.it |publisher=Nuovo Paese Sera srl |language=it |access-date=28 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101225131/http://www.paesesera.it/Cronaca/Pietralata-i-lavori-del-campus-inizieranno-a-fine-2012 |archive-date=1 November 2013  }}</ref> To cope with the ever-increasing number of applicants, the Rector also approved a new plan to expand the ''Città Universitaria'', reallocate offices and enlarge faculties, as well as create new campuses for hosting local and foreign students.

The Alessandrina University Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alessandrina.librari.beniculturali.it/index.php?en/1/home|title=Home – Biblioteca Universitaria Alessandrina|work=beniculturali.it}}</ref> (''Biblioteca Universitaria Alessandrina''), built in 1667 by [[Pope Alexander VII]], is the main library housing 1.5&nbsp;million volumes; it has some important collections including ''collezione ciceroniana'' and ''Fondo Festa''.

==Admission==
To cope with the large demand for admission to the university courses, some faculties hold a series of entrance examinations. The entrance test often decides which candidates will have access to the undergraduate course. For some faculties, the entrance test is only a mean through which the administration acknowledges the students' level of preparation. Students that do not pass the test can still enroll in their chosen degree courses but have to pass an additional exam during their first year.

== Collaboration ==
The University entered into a collaboration with the Bahraini government and established the King Hamad Chair in Interfaith Dialogue and Peaceful co-existence in November 2018. The chair was established for entailing direct funding from the Bahraini government to La Sapienza.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinghamadglobalcentre.com/the-king-hamad-chair-in-inter-faith-dialogue-and-peaceful-co-existence/|title=THE KING HAMAD CHAIR IN INTER-FAITH DIALOGUE AND PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE|website=King Hamad Global Centre}}</ref>
In July 2021 Italian MP Laura Boldrini and chairwoman of the Standing Committee on Human Rights wrote a letter criticizing the collaboration. In her letter, Boldrini stressed the human rights situation in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The letter was a follow-up to a hearing that took place on 14 June 2021, addressing the systematic violation of human rights, the death penalty, and the condition of detention of the prisoners of conscience in the country. Boldrini drew a contrast between the values of Bahrain and that of a democracy, like Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adhrb.org/2021/07/italian-mp-laura-boldrini-calls-on-la-sapienza-to-suspend-his-collaboration-with-bahraini-government/|title=Italian MP Laura Boldrini calls on La Sapienza to suspend his collaboration with Bahraini government|accessdate=27 July 2021|website=ADHRB|date=27 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://usercontent.one/wp/www.adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lettera-a-Rettrice-Polimeni.pdf|title=Laura Boldrini's Letter|accessdate=9 July 2021|website=ADHRB}}</ref>
