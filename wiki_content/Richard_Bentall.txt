'''Richard Bentall''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 30 September 1956) is a Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Sheffield in the UK.

==Early life==
Richard Bentall was born in [[Sheffield]] in the United Kingdom. After attending [[Uppingham School]] in [[Rutland]] and then [[High Storrs School]] in his home town, he attended the [[University College of North Wales]], [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] as an undergraduate before registering for a PhD in [[Experimental Psychology]] at the same institution.

==Career==
After being awarded his doctorate, he moved to the [[University of Liverpool]] to undertake professional training as a clinical psychologist. He later returned to his alma mater of Liverpool to work as a lecturer, after a brief stint working for the [[National Health Service]] as a [[forensic clinical psychologist]]. Later, he studied for an MA in Philosophy Applied to Healthcare from the [[University of Wales, Swansea]]. He was eventually promoted to Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Liverpool. In 1999, he accepted a position at the University of Manchester, collaborating with researchers based there who were working in understanding the treatment of psychotic experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isps-us.org/newsletters/ISPS-US%20Newsletter%20Winter%202013.pdf|title=Keynote Address: The Psychology of Paranoid Delusions|author=Richard P. Bentall|year=2013|work=ISPS}}</ref> After returning in 2007 to a professorial position at [[Bangor University]], where he retains an honorary professorship, he returned to the [[University of Liverpool]] in 2011, before moving to the University of Sheffield in 2017. His research continues to focus on the psychological mechanisms of severe mental illness and social factors that affect these mechanisms,<ref name="Univ. of Liverpool">{{cite web|title=Richard Bentall, Prof|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/psychology-health-and-society/staff/richard-bentall/|publisher=University of Liverpool. Institute of Psychology Health and Society|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref> which has led to a recent interest in public mental health. In 1989, he received the [[British Psychological Society]]'s Division of Clinical Psychology 'May Davidson Award', an annual award for outstanding contributions to the field of clinical psychology, in the first ten years after qualifying.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bps.org.uk/dcp/awards/may-davidson-award/previous_award_winners/previous_award_winners_home.cfm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110810004605/http://www.bps.org.uk/dcp/awards/may-davidson-award/previous_award_winners/previous_award_winners_home.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 August 2011|title=British Psychologist Society list of May Davidson Award previous winners|access-date=8 January 2009}} </ref> In 2014 he was elected a [[British Academy#Fellowship|Fellow of the British Academy]], the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.<ref name="BA Fellow">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/british-academy-announces-42-new-fellows/2014585.article | title=British Academy announces 42 new fellows|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=18 July 2014|access-date=18 July 2014}}</ref>

==Research==
He has previously published research on differences between human and animal [[operant conditioning]] and on the treatment of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. However, he is best known for his work in [[psychosis]], especially the psychological processes responsible for [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]] and has published extensively in these areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/research/pub_page.php?staff_id=732814%2035545598&psnumber=pss612&person=richard_bentall|title=list of publications from Bangor staff profile|access-date=8 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607123233/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/research/pub_page.php?staff_id=732814%2035545598&psnumber=pss612&person=richard_bentall|archive-date=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His research on persecutory (paranoid) delusions has explored the idea that these arise from dysfunctional attempts to regulate self-esteem, so that the paranoid patient attributes negative experiences to the deliberate actions of other people. His research on hallucinations has identified a failure of source monitoring (the process by which events are attributed to either the self or external sources) as responsible for hallucinating patients' inability to recognise that their inner speech (verbal thought) belongs to themselves. Along with many other British researchers, he has used these discoveries to inform the development of new psychological interventions for psychosis, based on [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT). This work has included randomised controlled trials of CBT for first episode patients and patients experiencing an [[at risk mental state]] for psychosis.

{{anchor|Happiness as a psychiatric disorder}}In a 1992 thought experiment, Bentall proposed that happiness might be classified as a psychiatric disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bentall|first=RP|title=A proposal to classify happiness as a psychiatric disorder.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=18|issue=2|pages=94–8|year=1992|pmid=1619629|pmc=1376114|doi=10.1136/jme.18.2.94}}</ref> The purpose of the paper was to demonstrate the impossibility of defining psychiatric disorder without reference to values. The paper was mentioned on the satirical television program ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and quoted by the novelist [[Philip Roth]] in his novel ''[[Sabbath's Theater]]''.

He has edited and written several books, most notably ''[[Madness Explained]]'', which was winner of the British Psychological Society Book Award in 2004. In this book, he advocates a psychological approach to the [[psychoses]], rejects the concept of [[schizophrenia]] and considers [[symptom]]s worthwhile investigating in contrast to the [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]]ian [[syndrome]]s. (Refuting ''Kraepelin's big idea'' that serious mental illness can be divided into discrete types is the starting chapter of the book.) A review by [[Paul Broks]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' summarised its position as: "Like [[Thomas Szasz|Szasz]], Bentall is firmly opposed to the biomedical model, but he also takes issue with extreme social relativists who would deny the reality of madness." In the book, Bentall also argues that no clear distinction exists between those diagnosed with mental illnesses and the "well". While this notion is more widely accepted in psychiatry when it comes to [[anxiety]] and depression, Bentall insists that [[schizotypal]] experiences are also common.<ref>{{cite news|author=Broaks, Paul|title=Review: Psychiatry: Madness Explained by Richard P Bentall|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article847447.ece|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=27 July 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615191522/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article847447.ece|archive-date=15 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2009 he published ''[[Doctoring the Mind|Doctoring The Mind: Is Our Current Treatment Of Mental Illness Really Any Good?]]'' A review of this book by neuro-scientist [[Roy Sugarman]] argued that it allied itself with the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement in its critiques of [[biological psychiatry]].<ref name=meta>{{cite journal|author1=Sugarma, Roy|title=Review – Doctoring the Mind Is Our Current Treatment of Mental Illness Really Any Good?|journal=Matapsychology: Online Reviews|date=25 August 2009|volume=13|issue=35|url=http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&id=5099&cn=390}}</ref> The review in ''[[PsycCRITIQUES]]'' was more nuanced, pointing out that Bentall did not reject [[psychopharmacology|psycho-pharmacology]], but that he was concerned over its overuse.<ref name=Bohart>{{cite journal|author1=Bohart, Arthur|title=Understanding and Treating Madness: Biology or Relationships?|journal=[[PsycCRITIQUES]]|date=17 February 2010|volume=55|issue=7|url=http://psqtest.typepad.com/blogPostPDFs/201000744_psq_55-7_UnderstandingAndTreatingMadnessBiologyOrRelationships.pdf|access-date=3 July 2012|doi=10.1037/a0018702}}</ref>

In 2010, Bentall and [[John Read (psychologist)|John Read]] co-authored a literature review on "The effectiveness of [[electroconvulsive therapy]]" (ECT). It examined placebo-controlled studies and concluded ECT had minimal benefits for people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Baker, Richard |author2=McKenzie, Nick |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/mental-health-care-inquiry-20110905-1juiy.html#ixzz1pFi1VI38 |title=Mental health care inquiry|date=6 September 2011|work=The Age}}</ref> The authors said "given the strong evidence of persistent and, for some, permanent brain dysfunction, primarily evidenced in the form of retrograde and anterograde amnesia, and the evidence of a slight but significant increased risk of death, the cost-benefit analysis for ECT is so poor that its use cannot be scientifically justified".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Read|first=J|author2=Bentall, R |title=The effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy: a literature review.|journal=Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale|date=Oct–Dec 2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=333–47|pmid=21322506|url=http://www.power2u.org/downloads/1012-ReadBentallECT.pdf|doi=10.1017/S1121189X00000671}}</ref> [[Psychiatrist]]s{{who|date=September 2021}}, however, sharply criticized this paper in passing by calling it an "''evidence-poor paper with an anti-ECT agenda''".<ref name="pmid24755719">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCall WV, Andrade C, Sienaert P | title = Searching for the mechanism(s) of ECT's therapeutic effect | journal = The Journal of ECT | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–9 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24755719 | pmc = 4695970 | doi = 10.1097/YCT.0000000000000121 }}</ref>

In 2012, Bentall and collaborators in Maastricht published a meta-analysis of the research literature on childhood trauma and psychosis, considering epidemiological, case-control, and prospective studies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Varese|first1=F|last2=Smeets|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Lieverse|first4=R|last5= Lataster|first5=T|last6=Viechtbauer|first6=W|last7=Read|first7=J|last8=van Os|first8=J|last9=Bentall|first9=RP|title=Childhood Adversities Increase the Risk of Psychosis: A Meta-analysis of Patient-Control, Prospective- and Cross-sectional Cohort Studies|journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]|volume=38|issue=4|pages=661–671|date=29 March 2012|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbs050|pmid=22461484|pmc=3406538}}</ref> This study found that the evidence that childhood trauma confers a risk of adult psychosis is highly consistent, with children who have experienced trauma (sexual abuse, physical abuse, loss of a parent or bullying) being approximately three times more likely to become psychotic than non-traumatised children; there was a dose-response effect (the most severely traumatised children were even more likely to become psychotic) suggesting that the effect is causal. This finding, and other findings suggesting that there are many social risk factors for severe mental illness, has led to Bentall's current interest in public mental health.
