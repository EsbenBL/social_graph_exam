The school's first class convened on the Manhattan campus of [[Baruch College]].<ref name="gwu.edu"/> In 1991, the school opened a degree program on the urban campus of the [[George Washington University]], in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood, just a few blocks from the [[White House]], [[Capitol Hill]], both major political parties and many of the top consulting, lobbying and public relations firms in the country.
