'''Sir Alan Arthur Walters''' (17 June 1926 – 3 January 2009) was a British economist who was best known as the Chief Economic Adviser to Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] from 1981 to 1983 and (after his return from the United States) again for five months in 1989.

== Early life ==
Walters was born in [[Leicester]], and his father was a [[Communist]] and a grocer who sold goods from a van. He failed his [[Eleven-Plus exam|11-Plus]] and attended [[Alderman Newton's School]] in Leicester, leaving at fifteen to work as a machine operator in a shoe factory.<ref name = Telegraph>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4126227/Sir-Alan-Walters.html | title = Sir Alan Walters | date = 5 January 2009 | access-date = 5 January 2009 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> During World War II, he was called up and joined the British Army as a [[private soldier|private]].

== Academic career ==
Walters studied statistics at [[Leicester University|University College Leicester]] and then went to [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], where he took an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in economics.<ref name = Telegraph/> On leaving Nuffield in 1951, he took up a post to teach statistics at [[Birmingham University]], later becoming professor of [[econometrics]] and statistics there in the early 1960s. He was one of the first British economists to argue that [[monetarism|money]] was "of considerable importance" to economic activity, a view that became more widespread during "the Great Inflation" of the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} He argued forcefully that Britain should maintain strict monetary targets, and that the money supply should not be manipulated for political reasons.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1968–70 he was a member of the Commission on the Third London Airport (the "[[Roskill Commission]]").<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1968/jun/24/third-london-airport-commission Hansard: 24 June 1968]</ref>

After serving as a professor at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1968 to 1976, where he was Sir [[Ernest Cassel]] Professor of Economics, Walters became an economic adviser to the [[World Bank]] and a professor in the Economics Department at The [[Johns Hopkins University]].

One of his most important contributions to economic theory was to demonstrate empirically that, for many industries, the costs at the high-scale end of the [[long-run cost curve]] is essentially constant or even declining. This was established in his article "Production and Cost Functions: An Econometric Survey", published by the journal ''[[Econometrica]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Walters|first= A. A.|year= 1963|title= Production and Cost Functions: An Econometric Survey|jstor= 1910949|journal= Econometrica|publisher= The Econometric Society|volume= 31|issue= 1/2|pages= 1–66|doi= 10.2307/1910949}}</ref>

== Political career ==
In 1981, he was asked to become an economic adviser to Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] (who was elected in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]), and advised on that year's [[budget]], in which taxes were increased during a recession. This policy produced much criticism and was associated with rioting and high unemployment,<ref name=pandora>[[Pandora's Box (British TV series)|Pandora's Box]]: The League of Gentlemen – Adam Curtis</ref> but it has been claimed that it enabled the sustained economic growth of the 1990s.<ref name = Times>{{cite news | work = [[The Times]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5451311.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601050145/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5451311.ece | title = Sir Alan Walters, Thatcher's economic guru, dies aged 82 | date = 5 January 2009 | archive-date = 1 June 2010 | location=London | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}</ref> He left this role in 1983 to join the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and at least some aspects of monetarist policies were publicly repudiated by Thatcher in 1985.<ref name=pandora/> He did, however, return to advise Thatcher in 1989, but his differences with the policies of the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Nigel Lawson]], led to the resignation of both men on 26 October 1989.<ref>{{cite web |title=Obituary - Sir Alan Walters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/06/sir-alan-walters-obituary |work=The Guardian|date=6 January 2009|access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref>

Walters supported the controversial and ill-fated [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (referred to as the "poll tax").  He opposed the similarly ill-fated policy of entry into the [[European Monetary System#1992 crisis|European Monetary System]]. In 1997, he stood as the [[Referendum Party]] candidate for the safe Conservative seat of the [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 1990s|Cities of London and Westminster]] achieving 3% of the vote.

== Personal life ==

In 1975, Walters married Margaret Patricia Wilson, known as Paddie. He had a daughter by a previous marriage.<ref name = Telegraph/> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[1983 Birthday Honours|Queen's 1983 Birthday Honours List]].

He was an accomplished pianist, enjoying playing the works of [[Chopin]] and [[Beethoven]]. He also collected Thai porcelain and was a keen tennis player.<ref name = Telegraph/>

Walters was vice-chairman and Director of [[American International Group|AIG Trading Group, Inc]].<ref name = Telegraph/>

Towards the end of his life, he suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]]. He died aged 82 at his home on 3 January 2009 after a short illness.<ref name = Times/> Upon hearing of his death, Thatcher described him as "radical, fearless" and the "finest of friends".<ref name = BBC>{{cite news | work = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7812036.stm | title = Alan Walters | access-date = 5 January 2009 | date=5 January 2009}}</ref> Coincidentally he died on the same day that the first "Genesis" block of the [[cryptocurrency]] and decentralized payment system [[Bitcoin]] was established.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Joshua|author-link=Joshua Davis (writer)|title=The Crypto-Currency: Bitcoin and its mysterious inventor|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918090443/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis|date=2011-10-11|archive-date=2013-09-18|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>
