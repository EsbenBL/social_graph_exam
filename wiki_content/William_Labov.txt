==Biography==
Born in [[Rutherford, New Jersey]], Labov majored in English and philosophy and studied chemistry at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1948). He worked as an industrial chemist in his family’s business (1949–61) before turning to linguistics. For his MA thesis (1963) he completed a study of change in the dialect of [[Martha's Vineyard]], which was presented before the [[Linguistic Society of America]]. Labov took his PhD (1964) at [[Columbia University]] studying under [[Uriel Weinreich]]. He was an assistant professor of linguistics at Columbia (1964–70) before becoming an associate professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1971, then a full professor, and in 1976 becoming director of the university's Linguistics Laboratory.

The five children of his first marriage to Teresa Gnasso Labov are Susannah Page, Sarah Labov, Simon Labov, Joanna Labov and Jessie Labov. He has been married to fellow sociolinguist [[Gillian Sankoff]] since 1993.<ref>{{cite book| editor1-last=Meyerhoff |editor1-first=Miriam |editor2-last=Nagy |editor2-first=Naomi |title=Social Lives in Language |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-1863-6 |year=2008 |page=21}}</ref> They have two children, Rebecca Labov and sociologist [[Alice Goffman]].

==Work==
{{BLP sources|date=August 2014}}
The methods he used to collect data for his study of the varieties of [[English language|English]] spoken in [[New York City]], published as ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City'' (1966), have been influential in social dialectology. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, his studies of the linguistic features of [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) were also influential: he argued that AAVE should not be stigmatized as substandard, but respected as a variety of English with its own grammatical rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/95sep/ets/labo.htm|title = Academic Ignorance and Black Intelligence|date = June 1972|access-date = March 28, 2015|publisher = The Atlantic|last = Labov|first = William}}</ref> He has also pursued research in [[referential indeterminacy]], and is noted for his seminal studies of the way ordinary people structure narrative stories of their own lives. In addition, several of his classes are service-based, with students going to West Philadelphia to help tutor young children while simultaneously learning linguistics from different dialects such as AAVE.

More recently he has studied ongoing changes in the phonology of English as spoken in the United States, and the origins and patterns of [[chain shift]]s of vowels (one sound replacing a second, replacing a third, in a complete chain). In the ''Atlas of North American English'' (2006), he and his co-authors find three major divergent chain shifts taking place today: a [[Southern American English#Shared features|Southern Shift]] (in [[Appalachia]] and southern coastal regions), a [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] affecting a region from [[Madison, Wisconsin]], east to [[Utica, New York]], and a [[Canadian Shift]] affecting most of Canada, as well as some areas in the Western and Midwestern (Midland) United States, in addition to several minor chain shifts in smaller regions.

Among Labov's well-known students are [[Charles Boberg]], [[Anne H. Charity Hudley]], [[Penelope Eckert]], [[Gregory Guy]], [[Robert A. Leonard]], [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], [[Shana Poplack]], and [[John R. Rickford]]. His methods were adopted in England by [[Peter Trudgill]] for Norwich speech and [[K. M. Petyt]] for West Yorkshire speech.

Labov's works include ''The Study of Nonstandard English'' (1969), ''Language in the Inner City: Studies in Black English Vernacular'' (1972), ''Sociolinguistic Patterns'' (1972), ''Principles of Linguistic Change'' (vol.I Internal Factors, 1994; vol.II Social Factors, 2001, vol.III Cognitive and Cultural factors, 2010), and, with [[Sharon Ash]] and [[Charles Boberg]], [http://www.atlas.mouton-content.com/ ''The Atlas of North American English''] (2006).

Labov was awarded the 2013 [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Computer and Cognitive Science by the [[Franklin Institute]] with the citation "[f]or establishing the cognitive basis of language variation and change through rigorous analysis of linguistic data, and for the study of non-standard dialects with significant social and cultural implications."<ref name="Avril_2012"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fi.edu/laureates/william-labov |title=Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science |date=September 5, 2014 |publisher=[[Franklin Institute]] |access-date=September 9, 2014}}</ref>

===Language in use===

In "Narrative Analysis: Oral Versions of Personal Experience",<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience."</ref> Labov and [[Joshua Waletzky]] take a sociolinguistic approach to examining how language works between people. This is significant because it contextualizes the study of structure and form, connecting purpose to method. His stated purpose is to "isolate the elements of narrative".<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 12.</ref> This work focuses exclusively on oral narratives.

Labov describes narrative as having two functions: referential and evaluative, with its ''referential'' functions orienting and grounding a story in its contextual world by referencing events in sequential order as they originally occurred,<ref name="Labov, W. 1997 p. 32">Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 32.</ref> and its ''evaluative'' functions describing the storyteller's purpose in telling the story.<ref name="Labov, W. 1997 p. 41">Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 41.</ref> Formally analyzing data from orally generated texts obtained via observed group interaction and interview (600 interviews were taken from several studies whose participants included ethnically diverse groups of children and adults from various backgrounds<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 13.</ref>), Labov divides narrative into five or six sections:

* ''Abstract'' – gives an overview of the story.
* ''Orientation'' – Labov describes this as "referential [free clauses that] serve to orient the listener in respect to person, place, time, and behavioral situation".<ref name="Labov, W. 1997 p. 32"/> He specifies that these are contextual clues that precede the main story.
* ''Complication'' – the main story, during which the narrative unfolds. A story may consist of multiple complication sections.
* ''Evaluation'' – author evinces self-awareness, giving explicit or implicit purpose to the retelling of the story. Thus evaluation gives some indication of the significance the author attributes to their story. But evaluation can be done subtly: for instance, "lexical intensifiers [are a type of] semantically defined evaluation".<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 37.</ref>
* ''Resolution'' – occurs sequentially following the evaluation. The resolution may give the story a sense of completion.
* ''Coda'' – returns listener to the present, drawing them back out of the world of the story into the world of the storytelling event. A coda is not essential to a narrative, and some narratives do not have one.

While not every narrative includes all these elements, the purpose of this subdivision is to show that narratives have inherent structural order. Labov argues that narrative units must retell events in the order they were experienced because narrative is ''temporally sequenced''. In other words, events do not occur at random but are connected to one another; thus "the original semantic interpretation" depends on their original order.<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 21.</ref> To demonstrate this sequence, he breaks a story down into its basic parts. He defines ''narrative clause'' as the "basic unit of narrative"<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 22.</ref> around which everything else is built. Clauses can be distinguished from one another by ''temporal junctures'',<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 25.</ref> which indicate a shift in time and separate narrative clauses. Temporal junctures mark temporal sequencing because clauses cannot be rearranged without disrupting their meaning.

Labov and Waletzky's findings are important because they derived them from actual data rather than abstract theorization (a descriptive rather than a prescriptive approach). Labov, Waletzky, &c., set up interviews and documented speech patterns in storytelling, keeping with the ethnographic tradition of tape-recording oral text so it can be referenced exactly. This inductive method creates a new system through which to understand story text.

===Golden Age Principle===
One of Labov's most quoted contributions to theories of [[language change]] is his ''Golden Age Principle'' (or ''Golden Age Theory''). It claims that any changes in the sounds or the grammar that have come to conscious awareness in a [[speech community]] trigger a uniformly negative reaction.

{{quote
|text=Communities differ in the extent to which they stigmatize the newer forms of language, but I have never yet met anyone who greeted them with applause. Some older citizens welcome the new music and dances, the new electronic devices and computers. But no one has ever been heard to say, "It's wonderful the way young people talk today. It's so much better than the way we talked when I was a kid." ... The most general and most deeply held belief about language is the ''Golden Age Principle'': At some time in the past, language was in a state of perfection. It is understood that in such a state, every sound was correct and beautiful, and every word and expression was proper, accurate, and appropriate. Furthermore, the decline from that state has been regular and persistent, so that every change represents a falling away from the golden age, rather than a return to it. Every new sound will be heard as ugly, and every new expression will be heard as improper, inaccurate, and inappropriate. Given this principle it is obvious that language change must be interpreted as nonconformity to established norms, and that people will reject changes in the structure of language when they become aware of them.

===Scholarly influence and criticism===

Labov's seminal work has been referenced and critically examined by a number of scholars, mainly for its structural rigidity. [[Kristin Langellier]] explains that "the purpose of Labovian analysis is to relate the formal properties of the narrative to their functions":<ref>Langellier, Kristin M. "Personal narratives: Perspectives on theory and research." Text and Performance Quarterly 9.4 (1989): 243-276. p. 245.</ref> clause-level analysis of how text affects transmission of message. This model has several flaws, which Langellier points out: it examines textual structure to the exclusion of context and audience, which often act to shape a text in real time; it's relevant to a specific demographic (may be difficult to extrapolate); and, by categorizing the text at a clausal level, it burdens analysis with theoretical distinctions that may not be illuminating in practice.<ref>Langellier, Kristin M. "Personal narratives: Perspectives on theory and research." Text and Performance Quarterly 9.4 (1989): 243-276. p. 246-8.</ref> [[Anna De Fina]] remarks that [within Labov's model] "the defining property of narrative is temporal sequence, since the order in which the events are presented in the narrative is expected to match the original events as they occurred",<ref>De Fina, Anna, and Alexandra Georgakopoulou. Analyzing narrative: Discourse and sociolinguistic perspectives. Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 27.</ref> which differs from more contemporary notions of storytelling, in which a naturally time-conscious flow includes jumping forward and back in time as mandated by, for example, anxieties felt about futures and their interplay with subsequent decisions. De Fina and Langellier both note that, though wonderfully descriptive, Labov's model is nevertheless difficult to code, thus potentially limited in application/practice.<ref>De Fina, Anna, and Alexandra Georgakopoulou. Analyzing narrative: Discourse and sociolinguistic perspectives. Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 32.</ref> De Fina also agrees with Langellier that Labov's model ignores the complex and often quite relevant subject of intertextuality in narrative.<ref>De Fina, Anna, and Alexandra Georgakopoulou. Analyzing narrative: Discourse and sociolinguistic perspectives. Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 35.</ref> To an extent, Labov evinces awareness of these concerns, saying "it is clear that these conclusions are restricted to the speech communities that we have examined",<ref name="Labov, W. 1997 p. 41"/> and "the overall structure of the narratives we've examined is not uniform".<ref>Labov, W., & Waletzky, J. (1997). "Narrative, analysis: Oral versions of personal experience." p. 40.</ref> In "Rethinking Ventriloquism," [[Diane Goldstein]] uses Labovian notions of [[tellability]]—internal coherence in narrative—to inform her concept of ''untellability''.<ref>Goldstein, Diane E. "Rethinking Ventriloquism: Untellability, Chaotic Narratives, Social Justice, and the Choice to Speak For, About, and Without." Journal of Folklore Research 49.2 (2012): 179-198.</ref>
