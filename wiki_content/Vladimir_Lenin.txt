<!--Basic introduction; name, dates, why he was notable-->
'''Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov'''{{efn|{{lang-rus|Владимир Ильич Ульянов|Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov|vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr ɨˈlʲjitɕ ʊˈlʲjanəf}}.}} ({{OldStyleDateNY|22 April|10 April}} 1870 – 21 January 1924), better known by his alias '''Lenin''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|l|ɛ|n|ɪ|n}};{{sfn|''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary''}} {{lang-rus|Ленин||ˈlʲenʲɪn}}.}} was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as the first and founding [[Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union|head of government]] of [[Soviet Russia]] from 1917 to 1924 and of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a [[one-party]] [[socialist state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. A [[Marxist]], he developed a variant of [[Communism|communist]] ideology known as [[Leninism]].

<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->
Born to a [[Petite bourgeoisie|moderately prosperous middle-class]] family in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother]]'s 1887 execution. Expelled from [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist government]], he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to [[Shushenskoye]] for three years, where he married [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik faction]] against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Following Russia's failed [[Revolution of 1905]], he campaigned for the [[First World War]] to be transformed into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and its replacement with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] ousted the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the [[October Revolution]] in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.

<!--October Revolution and Lenin's government-->
[[Council of People's Commissars|Lenin's Bolshevik government]] initially shared power with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], elected [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|soviets]], and a multi-party [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] conceding territory to the [[Central Powers]], and promoted [[world revolution]] through the [[Communist International]]. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], a violent campaign administered by the [[Cheka|state security services]]; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] anti-Bolshevik armies in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–1921. Responding to wartime devastation, [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]], and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the [[New Economic Policy]]. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from the Russian Empire after 1917, but three were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|re-united]] into the new [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|Soviet Union]] in 1922. His health failing, Lenin died in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]], with [[Joseph Stalin]] succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.

<!--Reception and legacy-->
Widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive [[personality cult]] within the Soviet Union until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind [[Marxism–Leninism]] and a prominent influence over the international [[communist movement]]. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the [[working class]], while critics have accused him of establishing a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[dictatorship]] and ordering [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political repression and mass killings]].

===Childhood: 1870–1887===
[[File:Dom ulyanovyh.jpg|thumb|Lenin's childhood home in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]]]]

Lenin's father [[Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov]] was from a family of former [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]]; Ilya's father's ethnic origins remain unclear, with suggestions being made that he was of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordvins|Mordvin]], or [[Kalmyks|Kalmyk]] ancestry.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1–2|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12–13|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=7|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=21–23|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=13–15|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=6|7a1=Schmermund|7a2=Edwards|7y=2016|7p=9}} Ilya's mother, Anna Alexeyevna Smirnova, was half-Kalmyk and half-Russian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Владимир Ильич Ленин (1870–1924)|url=http://www.uniros.ru/articles/lenin.php|publisher=Uniros.ru|access-date=3 August 2015|language=Russian|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120918123515/http://www.uniros.ru/articles/lenin.php|archive-date=18 September 2012}}</ref> Despite this lower-class background, Ilya had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] before teaching at the [[Institute for Nobles|Penza Institute for the Nobility]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1–2|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12–13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=21–23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=13–15|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=6}} Ilya married [[Maria Alexandrovna Blank]] in mid-1863.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=5|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=23}} Well educated, she was the daughter of a wealthy [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German]]–[[Swedish diaspora|Swedish]] [[Lutheran]] mother, and a [[Russian Jewish]] father who had [[Apostasy in Judaism|converted to Christianity]] and worked as a physician.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=2–3|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=16–19, 23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=15–18|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=5|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=20}} According to historian [[Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern|Petrovsky-Shtern]], it is likely that Lenin was unaware of his mother's half-Jewish ancestry, which was only discovered by his sister Anna after his death.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=66–67}} Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]] district six years later. Five years after that, he was promoted to Director of Public Schools for the province, overseeing the foundation of over 450 schools as a part of the government's plans for modernisation. His dedication to education earned him the [[Order of St. Vladimir]], which bestowed on him the status of [[Russian nobility|hereditary nobleman]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=13–14, 18|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=25, 27|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=18–19|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=4, 8|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=21}}

[[File:Vladimir Lenin 3 years old.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An image of Lenin (left) at the age of three]]

Lenin was born in Streletskaya Ulitsa, Simbirsk, now [[Ulyanovsk]], on 22 April 1870, and [[Infant baptism|baptised]] six days later;{{sfn|Sebestyen|2017|p=33}} as a child, he was known as ''Volodya'', a diminutive of Vladimir.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=13}} He was the third of eight children, having two older siblings, [[Anna Ulyanova|Anna]] (born 1864) and [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|Alexander]] (born 1866). They were followed by three more children, Olga (born 1871), [[Dmitri Ilyich Ulyanov|Dmitry]] (born 1874), and [[Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Maria]] (born 1878). Two later siblings died in infancy.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=6|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12, 14|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=25|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=19–20|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=4|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6pp=21, 22}} Ilya was a devout member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and baptised his children into it, although Maria, a Lutheran by upbringing, was largely indifferent to [[Christianity]], a view that influenced her children.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=3, 8|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=14–15|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=29}}

Both of his parents were [[monarchists]] and [[liberal conservatives]], being committed to the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] introduced by the reformist [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]; they avoided political radicals and there is no evidence that the police ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=8|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=27|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=19}} Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in [[Lenino-Kokushkino|Kokushkino]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=18|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=26|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=20|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=7|5a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|5y=2010|5p=64}} Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=7|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=16|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=32–36}} A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gymnasium.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=7|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=17|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=36–46|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=20|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=9}}

In January 1886, when Lenin was 15, his father died of a [[brain haemorrhage]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=6, 9|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=19|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=48–49|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=10}} Subsequently, his behaviour became erratic and confrontational and he renounced his belief in God.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=9|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=50–51, 64|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=16|4a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|4y=2010|4p=69}} At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander, whom he affectionately knew as Sasha, was studying at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]]. Involved in political agitation against the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[reactionary]] Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], Alexander studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack could take place, the conspirators were arrested and tried, and Alexander was executed by hanging in May.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=10–17|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=20, 22–24|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=52–58|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=21–28|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=10|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6pp=23–25}} Despite the emotional trauma of his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated from school at the top of his class with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at [[Kazan Federal University|Kazan University]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=25|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=61|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=29|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=16|6a1=Theen|6y=2004|6p=33}}

===University and political radicalisation: 1887–1893===

Upon entering [[Kazan Federal University|Kazan University]] in August 1887, Lenin moved into a nearby flat.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=26|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=61–63}} There, he joined a ''[[zemlyachestvo]]'', a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=26–27|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=64–68, 70|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=29}} This group elected him as its representative to the university's ''zemlyachestvo'' council, and he took part in a December demonstration against government restrictions that banned student societies. The police arrested Lenin and accused him of being a ringleader in the demonstration; he was expelled from the university, and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] exiled him to his family's Kokushkino estate.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=27|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=68–69|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=29|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=15|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=32}} There, he read voraciously, becoming enamoured with [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]'s 1863 pro-revolutionary novel ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=28|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=30|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=12|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5pp=32–33}}

Lenin's mother was concerned by her son's radicalisation, and was instrumental in convincing the Interior Ministry to allow him to return to the city of [[Kazan]], but not the university.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=18|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=310|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=71}} On his return, he joined [[Nikolai Fedoseev]]'s revolutionary circle, through which he discovered [[Karl Marx]]'s 1867 book ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]''. This sparked his interest in [[Marxism]], a socio-political theory that argued that society developed in stages, that this development resulted from [[class struggle]], and that [[capitalism|capitalist society]] would ultimately give way to [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]] and then [[communist society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=19|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=32–33|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=72|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=30–31|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=18|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=33}} Wary of his political views, Lenin's mother bought a country estate in Alakaevka village, [[Samara Oblast]], in the hope that her son would turn his attention to agriculture. He had little interest in farm management, and his mother soon sold the land, keeping the house as a summer home.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=33|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=74–76|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=17}}

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Lenin came under the influence of [[Karl Marx]].]]

In September 1889, the Ulyanov family moved to the city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], where Lenin joined [[Alexei Sklyarenko]]'s socialist discussion circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=34|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=78|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31}} There, Lenin fully embraced Marxism and produced a Russian language translation of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s 1848 political pamphlet, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=34|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=77|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=18}} He began to read the works of the Russian Marxist [[Georgi Plekhanov]], agreeing with Plekhanov's argument that Russia was moving from [[feudalism]] to capitalism and so socialism would be implemented by the [[proletariat]], or urban working class, rather than the [[peasant]]ry.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1pp=34, 36–37|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=55–55, 80, 88–89|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=31|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4pp=37–38|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5pp=34–35}} This Marxist perspective contrasted with the view of the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian-socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement, which held that the peasantry could establish socialism in Russia by forming peasant communes, thereby bypassing capitalism. This Narodnik view developed in the 1860s with the [[Narodnaya Volya|People's Freedom Party]] and was then dominant within the Russian revolutionary movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=23–25, 26|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=55|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=11, 24}} Lenin rejected the premise of the agrarian-socialist argument, but was influenced by agrarian-socialists like [[Pyotr Tkachev]] and [[Sergei Nechaev]], and befriended several Narodniks.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=79, 98}}

[[File:Union-de-Lucha.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin (seated centre) with other members of the [[League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]] in 1897]]

Refused legal representation or bail, Lenin denied all charges against him but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=48–51|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=107–108|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=31|5a1=Lih|5y=2011|5p=61}} He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work he noted that the rise of [[industrial capitalism]] in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop [[class consciousness]], which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow [[tsarism]], the [[aristocracy]], and the [[bourgeoisie]] and to establish a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|proletariat state]] that would move toward socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=31|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=48–51|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=107–108}}

In February 1897, Lenin was sentenced without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia.

In May 1898, Nadya joined him in exile, having been arrested in August 1896 for organising a strike.

In August 1910, Lenin attended the [[International Socialist Congress, Copenhagen 1910|Eighth Congress]] of the [[Second International]], an international meeting of socialists, in [[Copenhagen]] as the RSDLP's representative, following this with a holiday in Stockholm with his mother.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=70|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=114–116}} With his wife and sisters he then moved to France, settling first in [[Bombon, Seine-et-Marne|Bombon]] and then Paris.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=68–69|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=112|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=195–196}} Here, he became a close friend to the French Bolshevik [[Inessa Armand]]; some biographers suggest that they had an extra-marital affair from 1910 to 1912.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=75–80|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=112|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=384|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=197–199|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=103}} Meanwhile, at a Paris meeting in June 1911, the RSDLP Central Committee decided to move their focus of operations back to Russia, ordering the closure of the Bolshevik Centre and its newspaper, ''Proletari''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=115|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=196|3a1=White|3y=2001|3pp=93–94}} Seeking to rebuild his influence in the party, Lenin arranged for [[Prague Party Conference|a party conference]] to be held in [[Prague]] in January 1912, and although 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, he was heavily criticised for his factionalist tendencies and failed to boost his status within the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=71–72|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=116–117|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=204–206|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=96–97|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=95}}

In September 1917, Lenin published ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'', which argued that [[imperialism]] was a product of [[monopoly capitalism]], as capitalists sought to increase their profits by extending into new territories where wages were lower and raw materials cheaper.

===February Revolution and the July Days: 1917===

In February 1917, the [[February Revolution]] broke out in St. Petersburg, renamed [[Petrograd]] at the beginning of the First World War, as industrial workers went on strike over food shortages and deteriorating factory conditions. The unrest spread to other parts of Russia, and fearing that he would be violently overthrown, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated.

===Organising the Soviet government: 1917–1918===

The Provisional Government had planned for a Constituent Assembly to be elected in November 1917; against Lenin's objections, Sovnarkom agreed for the vote to take place as scheduled.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=314|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=317}} In the [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|constitutional election]], the Bolsheviks gained approximately a quarter of the vote, being defeated by the agrarian-focused Socialist-Revolutionaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=315|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=540–541|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=164|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=173|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=331|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=192}} Lenin argued that the election was not a fair reflection of the people's will, that the electorate had not had time to learn the Bolsheviks' political programme, and that the candidacy lists had been drawn up before the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries split from the Socialist-Revolutionaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=176|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=331–332|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=156|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=192}} Nevertheless, the newly elected [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] convened in Petrograd in January 1918.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=164}} Sovnarkom argued that it was counter-revolutionary because it sought to remove power from the soviets, but the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks denied this.{{sfn|Pipes|1990|pp=546–547}} The Bolsheviks presented the Assembly with a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers; when the Assembly rejected the motion, Sovnarkom declared this as evidence of its counter-revolutionary nature and forcibly disbanded it.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=552–553|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=165|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=176–177|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=332, 336–337|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=192}}

Upon taking power, Lenin's regime issued a series of decrees. The first was a [[Decree on Land]], which declared that the [[landed estate]]s of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments.

In January and again in February, Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to accept Germany's proposals.

After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had abandoned the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution.{{sfn|Pipes|1990|p=635}} In July 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionary [[Yakov Blumkin]] assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, [[Wilhelm von Mirbach]], hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident would lead to a relaunched revolutionary war against Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=244|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=355|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3pp=636–640|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=360–361|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=159|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=199}} The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries then [[Left SR uprising|launched a coup in Moscow]], shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=242|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2pp=642–644|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=250}} The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=244|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=644|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=172}}

After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin believed that the breakout of the European revolution was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=387|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=173}} Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|soviet government in Hungary]] in March 1919, followed by the [[Bavarian Council Republic|soviet government in Bavaria]] and [[Revolutions of 1917–23|various revolutionary socialist uprisings]] in other parts of Germany, including [[Spartacist uprising|that of the Spartacus League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=333|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=388|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=173|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=395}} During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=385–386}} In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in [[Commune of the Working People of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvia]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–19)|Lithuania]], [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia|Belarus]], and [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic|Ukraine]], all of which were officially independent of Russia,{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=385–386}} while further east it led to the creation of communist governments in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Outer Mongolia]].{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=531, 536}} Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the ''de facto'' authority of Sovnarkom.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=386}}

In late 1918, the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] called for the establishment of an international conference of socialist parties, the [[Labour and Socialist International]].{{sfn|Shub|1966|pp=389–390}} Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=390}} Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, [[Nikolai Bukharin]], Trotsky, [[Christian Rakovsky]], and [[Angelica Balabanoff]],{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=390}} the [[1st Congress of the Comintern|First Congress]] of this [[Communist International]] (Comintern) opened in Moscow in March 1919.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=390|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=390|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=386|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=160|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=225}} It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=390–391|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=386|5a1=White|5y=2001|5p=160}} Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=387|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=160}} with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=525|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=398|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=225–226}} During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=387}} While Zinoviev became Comintern's president, Lenin retained significant influence over it.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=395|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=391}}

The [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|Second Congress of the Communist International]] opened in Petrograd's [[Smolny Institute]] in July 1920, representing the last time that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=397|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=409}} There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead, encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to transform their pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=409–410}} For this conference, he authored ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'', a short book articulating his criticism of elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=415–420|2a1=White|2y=2001|2pp=161, 180–181}} The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=410}} and was relocated to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=397}} Lenin's predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian communist government was overthrown and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=341|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=396|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=174}}

===Famine and the New Economic Policy: 1920–1922===

Within the Communist Party, there was dissent from two factions, the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] and the [[Workers' Opposition]], both of which accused the Russian state of being too centralised and bureaucratic.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=437–438|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=406|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=183|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=419|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=167–168}} The Workers' Opposition, which had connections to the official state trade unions, also expressed the concern that the government had lost the trust of the Russian working class.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=406|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=419|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=167}} They were angered by Trotsky's suggestion that the trade unions be eliminated.

In February 1921, Lenin introduced a [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) to the Politburo; he convinced most senior Bolsheviks of its necessity and it passed into law in April.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=411|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=185|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=421, 424–427, 429|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=264}} Lenin explained the policy in a booklet, ''On the Food Tax'', in which he stated that the NEP represented a return to the original Bolshevik economic plans; he claimed that these had been derailed by the civil war, in which Sovnarkom had been forced to resort to the economic policies of [[war communism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=479–480|2a1=Sandle|2y=1999|2p=155|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=430|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=170, 171}} The NEP allowed some private enterprise within Russia, permitting the reintroduction of the wage system and allowing peasants to sell produce on the open market while being taxed on their earnings.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=411|2a1=Sandle|2y=1999|2pp=153, 158|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=430|4a1=White|4y=2001|4p=169|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5pp=264–265}} The policy also allowed for a return to privately owned small industry; basic industry, transport and foreign trade remained under state control.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=412|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=430|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=266|4a1=Ryan|4y=2012|4p=159}} Lenin termed this "[[state capitalism]]",{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=479|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=412|3a1=Sandle|3y=1999|3p=155|4a1=Ryan|4y=2012|4p=159}} and many Bolsheviks thought it to be a betrayal of socialist principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=151|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=422|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=171}} Lenin biographers have often characterised the introduction of the NEP as one of his most significant achievements and some believe that had it not been implemented then Sovnarkom would have been quickly overthrown by popular uprisings.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=421, 434}}

To Lenin's embarrassment and horror, in April 1920 the Bolsheviks held a party to celebrate his fiftieth birthday, which was also marked by widespread celebrations across Russia and the publication of poems and biographies dedicated to him.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=414|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=177–178|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=405|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4pp=260–261}} Between 1920 and 1926, twenty volumes of Lenin's ''Collected Works'' were published; some material was omitted.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=283}} During 1920, several prominent Western figures visited Lenin in Russia; these included the author [[H.

Despite his illness, Lenin remained keenly interested in political developments.

In March 1923, Lenin suffered a third stroke and lost his ability to speak;{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=671|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=436|3a1=Lewin|3y=1969|3p=103|4a1=Leggett|4y=1981|4p=355|5a1=Rice|5y=1990|5p=193|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=176|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=281}} that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting [[sensory aphasia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=671|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=436|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=425|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=474|5a1=Lerner|5a2=Finkelstein|5a3=Witztum|5y=2004|5p=372}} By May, he appeared to be making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=672|2a1=Rigby|2y=1979|2p=192|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=193–194|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4pp=429–430}} In October, he made a final visit to the Kremlin.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=672|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=437|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=431|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=476|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=281}} In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin; the latter visited him at his Gorki mansion on the day of his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Rice|1y=1990|1p=194|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=299|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=477–478}} On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=673–674|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=438|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3p=194|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=435|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5pp=478–479|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=176|7a1=Read|7y=2005|7p=269}} His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=435|2a1=Lerner|2a2=Finkelstein|2a3=Witztum|2y=2004|2p=372}}

The Soviet government publicly announced Lenin's death the following day.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=7}} On 23 January, mourners from the Communist Party, trade unions, and Soviets visited his Gorki home to inspect the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Rice|1990|pp=7–8}} Transported by train to Moscow, the coffin was taken to the [[House of Trade Unions]], where the body [[Lying in state|lay in state]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=674|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=439|3a1=Rice|3y=1990|3pp=7–8|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=479}}
Over the next three days, around a million mourners came to see the body, many queuing for hours in the freezing conditions.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=9}} On 26 January, the eleventh All-Union Congress of Soviets met to pay respects, with speeches by Kalinin, Zinoviev, and Stalin.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=9}} Notably, Trotsky was absent; he had been convalescing in the Caucasus, and he later claimed that Stalin sent him a telegram with the incorrect date of the planned funeral, making it impossible for him to arrive in time.{{sfn|''History'', April 2009}} Lenin's funeral took place the following day, when his body was carried to [[Red Square]], accompanied by martial music, where assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches before the corpse was placed into the vault of a specially erected mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=439|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=9|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=479–480}} Despite the freezing temperatures, tens of thousands attended.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=440}}

Against Krupskaya's protestations, Lenin's body was embalmed to preserve it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=674|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=438|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3pp=437–438|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=481}} During this process, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe [[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=625–626|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=446}} In July 1929, the Politburo agreed to replace the temporary mausoleum with a permanent one in granite, which was finished in 1933.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=444, 445}} His sarcophagus was replaced in 1940 and again in 1970.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=445}} For safety amid the [[Second World War]], from 1941 to 1945 the body was temporarily moved to [[Tyumen]].{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=444}} As of 2021, his body remains on public display in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] on Red Square.{{sfn|Moscow.info}}

==Political ideology==

===Marxism and Leninism===
{{Main|Leninism|Marxism–Leninism}}
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We do not pretend that Marx or Marxists know the road to socialism in all its concreteness. That is nonsense. We know the direction of the road, we know what class forces will lead it, but concretely, practically, this will be shown by ''the experience of the millions'' when they undertake the act.|source=—Lenin, 11 September 1917{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=150}} }}

Lenin was a devout Marxist,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and believed that his interpretation of Marxism, first termed "Leninism" by Martov in 1904,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=409}} was the sole authentic and orthodox one.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=35|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=237}} According to his Marxist perspective, humanity would eventually reach pure communism, becoming a stateless, classless, egalitarian society of workers who were free from [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], controlled their own destiny, and abided by the rule "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]."{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} According to Volkogonov, Lenin "deeply and sincerely" believed that the path he was setting Russia on would ultimately lead to the establishment of this communist society.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=206}}

Lenin's Marxist beliefs led him to the view that society could not transform directly from its present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so his main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, he believed that a "dictatorship of the proletariat" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as "an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned",{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with "all citizens" becoming "hired employees of the state" in his words.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42–43}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and statist, with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for "workers' control" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a "workers' state."{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43–44, 63}} This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}

[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]

Before 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}} As Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}}

In his theoretical writings, particularly ''Imperialism'', Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached the new stage of [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150–151}} Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}}

===Democracy and the national question===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Lenin] accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster that truth. He did not question old Marxist scripture, he merely commented, and the comments have become a new scripture.|source=—Biographer [[Louis Fischer]], 1964{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=213}} }}

Lenin believed that the [[representative democracy]] of capitalist countries gave the illusion of democracy while maintaining the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"; describing the representative democratic system of the United States, he referred to the "spectacular and meaningless duels between two bourgeois parties", both of whom were led by "astute multimillionaires" that exploited the American proletariat.{{sfn|Rice|1990|p=121}} He opposed liberalism, exhibiting a general antipathy toward [[liberty]] as a value,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=471}} and believing that liberalism's freedoms were fraudulent because it did not free labourers from capitalist exploitation.{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=443}}

Lenin declared that "Soviet government is many millions of times more democratic than the most democratic-bourgeois republic", the latter of which was simply "a democracy for the rich."{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=310|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=442}} He regarded his "dictatorship of the proletariat" as democratic because, he claimed, it involved the election of representatives to the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], workers electing their own officials, and the regular rotation and involvement of all workers in the administration of the state.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=36–37}} Lenin's belief as to what a proletariat state should look like nevertheless deviated from that adopted by the Marxist mainstream; European Marxists like Kautsky envisioned a democratically elected parliamentary government in which the proletariat had a majority, whereas Lenin called for a strong, centralised state apparatus that excluded any input from the bourgeois.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}}

Lenin was an [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and a keen supporter of [[world revolution]], deeming national borders to be an outdated concept and nationalism a distraction from class struggle.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=54|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=423|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=352}} He believed that in a socialist society, the world's nations would inevitably merge and result in a single [[world government]].{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=88–89}} He believed that this socialist state would need to be a centralised, [[unitary state|unitary one]], and regarded [[federalism]] as a bourgeois concept.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=87|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=266}} In his writings, Lenin espoused [[anti-imperialist]] ideas and stated that all nations deserved "the right of self-determination."{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=87}} He supported [[war of national liberation|wars of national liberation]], accepting that such conflicts might be necessary for a minority group to break away from a [[socialist state]], because socialist states are not "holy or insured against mistakes or weaknesses."{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=91, 93}}

Prior to taking power in 1917, he was concerned that ethnic and national minorities would make the Soviet state ungovernable with their calls for independence; according to the historian [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], Lenin thus encouraged Stalin to develop "a theory that offered the ideal of autonomy and the right of secession without necessarily having to grant either."{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=266}} On taking power, Lenin called for the dismantling of the bonds that had forced minority ethnic groups to remain in the Russian Empire and espoused their right to secede but also expected them to reunite immediately in the spirit of proletariat internationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Page|1y=1948|1p=17|2a1=Page|2y=1950|2p=354}} He was willing to use military force to ensure this unity, resulting in armed incursions into the independent states that formed in Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states.{{sfn|Page|1950|p=355}} Only when its conflicts with Finland, the Baltic states, and Poland proved unsuccessful did Lenin's government officially recognise their independence.{{sfn|Page|1950|p=342}}

==Personal life and characteristics==

Lenin saw himself as a man of destiny and firmly believed in the righteousness of his cause and his own ability as a revolutionary leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1pp=159, 202|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=207}} Biographer [[Louis Fischer]] described him as "a lover of radical change and maximum upheaval", a man for whom "there was never a middle-ground. He was an either-or, black-or-red exaggerator."{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=47, 148}} Highlighting Lenin's "extraordinary capacity for disciplined work" and "devotion to the revolutionary cause", Pipes noted that he exhibited much [[charisma]].{{sfn|Pipes|1990|pp=348, 351}} Similarly, Volkogonov believed that "by the very force of his personality, [Lenin] had an influence over people."{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=246}} Conversely, Lenin's friend Gorky commented that in his physical appearance as a "baldheaded, stocky, sturdy person", the communist revolutionary was "too ordinary" and did not give "the impression of being a leader."{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=57}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=|quote=[Lenin's collected writings] reveal in detail a man with iron will, self-enslaving self-discipline, scorn for opponents and obstacles, the cold determination of a zealot, the drive of a fanatic, and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by his singleness of purpose, imposing intensity, impersonal approach, personal sacrifice, political astuteness, and complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth. His life became the history of the Bolshevik movement.
|source=—Biographer Louis Fischer, 1964{{sfn|Fischer|1964|pp=21–22}}}}

Historian and biographer [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] asserted that Lenin had been an intensely emotional young man,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=73}} who exhibited strong hatred for the Tsarist authorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=44|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=81}} According to Service, Lenin developed an "emotional attachment" to his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels and [[Chernyshevsky]]; he owned portraits of them,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=118}} and privately described himself as being "in love" with Marx and Engels.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=232|2a1=Lih|2y=2011|2p=13}} According to Lenin biographer James D. White, Lenin treated their writings as "holy writ", a "religious dogma", which should "not be questioned but believed in."{{sfn|White|2001|p=88}} In Volkogonov's view, Lenin accepted Marxism as "absolute truth", and accordingly acted like "a religious fanatic."{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=362}} Similarly, Bertrand Russell felt that Lenin exhibited "unwavering faith—religious faith in the Marxian gospel."{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=409}} Biographer Christopher Read suggested that Lenin was "a secular equivalent of theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [perceived] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandates."{{sfn|Read|2005|p=262}} Lenin was nevertheless an [[atheist]] and a [[Criticism of religion|critic of religion]], believing that socialism was inherently atheistic; he thus considered [[Christian socialism]] a contradiction in terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=40–41|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1994|2p=373|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=149}}

Service stated that Lenin could be "moody and volatile",{{sfn|Service|2000|p=116}} and Pipes deemed him to be "a thoroughgoing misanthrope",{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1996|1p=11|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=287}} a view rejected by Read, who highlighted many instances in which Lenin displayed kindness, particularly toward children.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=259}} According to several biographers, Lenin was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from his own.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=67|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=353|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=207, 212}} He could be "venomous in his critique of others", exhibiting a propensity for mockery, ridicule, and ''ad hominem'' attacks on those who disagreed with him.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|p=93}} He ignored facts that did not suit his argument,{{sfn|Pipes|1990|p=353}} abhorred compromise,{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=69}} and very rarely admitted his own errors.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=244|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=153}} He refused to change his opinions, until he rejected them completely, after which he would treat the new view as if it was just as unchangeable.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=59}} Lenin showed no sign of [[sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] or of personally desiring to commit violent acts, but he endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for the revolutionary cause.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=45|2a1=Pipes|2y=1990|2p=350|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=182|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=177|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=208|6a1=Ryan|6y=2012|6p=6}} Adopting an [[amorality|amoral]] stance, in Lenin's view the end always justified the means;{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=415|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=422|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3p=247}} according to Service, Lenin's "criterion of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution?"{{sfn|Service|2000|p=293}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=|quote=The Lenin who seemed externally so gentle and good-natured, who enjoyed a laugh, who loved animals and was prone to sentimental reminiscences, was transformed when class or political questions arose.

Aside from Russian, Lenin spoke and read French, German, and English.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=242}} Concerned with physical fitness, he exercised regularly,{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=56|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=106|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=160}} enjoyed cycling, swimming, and hunting,{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=56|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=188}} and also developed a passion for mountain walking in the Swiss peaks.{{sfn|Read|2005|pp=20, 64, 132–37}} He was also fond of pets,{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=423}} in particular cats.{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=367}} Tending to eschew luxury, he lived a spartan lifestyle,{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=368}} and Pipes noted that Lenin was "exceedingly modest in his personal wants", leading "an austere, almost ascetic, style of life."{{sfn|Pipes|1990|p=812}} Lenin despised untidiness, always keeping his work desk tidy and his pencils sharpened, and insisted on total silence while he was working.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=99–100, 160}} According to Fischer, Lenin's "vanity was minimal",{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=245}} and for this reason he disliked the [[cult of personality]] that the Soviet administration began to build around him; he nevertheless accepted that it might have some benefits in unifying the communist movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1pp=349–350|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2pp=284, 259–260}}

Despite his revolutionary politics, Lenin disliked revolutionary experimentation in literature and the arts, expressing his dislike of [[expressionism]], [[futurism]], and [[cubism]], and conversely favouring [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and Russian [[Classic book|classic literature]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=489, 491|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2pp=420–421|3a1=Sandle|3y=1999|3p=125|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=237}} Lenin also had a conservative attitude towards sex and marriage.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=79|2a1=Read|2y=2005|2p=237}} Throughout his adult life, he was in a relationship with Krupskaya, a fellow Marxist whom he married.

The historian [[Albert Resis]] suggested that if the October Revolution is considered the most significant event of the 20th century, then Lenin "must for good or ill be considered the century's most significant political leader."{{sfn|''Encyclopedia Britannica''}} White described Lenin as "one of the undeniably outstanding figures of modern history",{{sfn|White|2001|p=iix}} while Service noted that the Russian leader was widely understood to be one of the 20th century's "principal actors."{{sfn|Service|2000|p=488}} Read considered him "one of the most widespread, universally recognizable icons of the twentieth century",{{sfn|Read|2005|p=283}} while Ryan called him "one of the most significant and influential figures of modern history."{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=5}} ''Time'' magazine named Lenin one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most important people of the 20th century]],{{sfn|''Time'', 13 April 1998}} and one of their top 25 political icons of all time.{{sfn|''Time'', 4 February 2011}}

In the Western world, biographers began writing about Lenin soon after his death; some such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] were sympathetic to him, and others such as Richard Pipes and [[Robert Gellately]] expressly hostile. Some later biographers such as Read and Lars Lih sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes.{{sfnm|1a1=Lee|1y=2003|1p=14|2a1=Ryan|2y=2012|2p=3}} Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=14}} The Soviet view characterised him as a man who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=123}} Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=123}} More recently, [[Historical revisionism|revisionists]] in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=124}}

Various historians and biographers have characterised Lenin's administration as [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]],{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=516|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=415|3a1=Leggett|3y=1981|3p=364|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4pp=307, 312}} and as a [[police state]],{{sfn|Leggett|1981|p=364}} and many have described it as a one-party dictatorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewin|1y=1969|1p=12|2a1=Rigby|2y=1979|2pp=x, 161|3a1=Sandle|3y=1999|3p=164|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4p=506|5a1=Lee|5y=2003|5p=97|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=190|7a1=Ryan|7y=2012|7p=9}} Several such scholars have described Lenin as a dictator;{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=417|2a1=Shub|2y=1966|2p=416|3a1=Pipes|3y=1990|3p=511|4a1=Pipes|4y=1996|4p=3|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=247}} Ryan stated that he was "not a dictator in the sense that all his recommendations were accepted and implemented", for many of his colleagues disagreed with him on various issues.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=1}} Fischer noted that while "Lenin was a dictator, [he was] not the kind of dictator Stalin later became."{{sfn|Fischer|1964|p=524}} Volkogonov believed that whereas Lenin established a "dictatorship of the Party", it would only be under Stalin that the Soviet Union became the "dictatorship of one man."{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=313}}

Conversely, various Marxist observers, including Western historians Hill and [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]], argued against the view that Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=120}} Ryan contends that the leftist historian [[Paul Le Blanc (historian)|Paul Le Blanc]] "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than in some of the major Western leaders of the twentieth century."{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=191}} Ryan also posits that for Lenin revolutionary violence was merely a means to an end, namely the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world—a world without violence.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=184}} Historian [[J. Arch Getty]] remarked, "Lenin deserves a lot of credit for the notion that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality."{{sfn|''Biography''}} Some left-wing intellectuals, among them [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[Alain Badiou]], Lars T. Lih, and [[Fredric Jameson]], advocate reviving Lenin's uncompromising revolutionary spirit to address contemporary global problems.{{sfnm|1a1=Ryan|1y=2012|1p=3|2a1=Budgen|2a2=Kouvelakis|2a3=Žižek|2y=2007|2pp=1–4}}

===Within the Soviet Union===
[[File:Russia-2007-Moscow-Kremlin Senate at night.jpg|thumb|Lenin's Mausoleum in front of the Kremlin, 2007]]

In the Soviet Union, a cult of personality devoted to Lenin began to develop during his lifetime, but was only fully established after his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=327|2a1=Tumarkin|2y=1997|2p=2|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=185|4a1=Read|4y=2005|4p=260}} According to historian Nina Tumarkin, it represented the world's "most elaborate cult of a revolutionary leader" since that of [[George Washington]] in the United States,{{sfn|Tumarkin|1997|p=2}} and has been repeatedly described as "quasi-religious" in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1990|1p=814|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=485|3a1=White|3y=2001|3p=185|4a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|4y=2010|4p=114|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=284}} Busts or statues of Lenin were erected in almost every village,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=328}} and his face adorned postage stamps, crockery, posters, and the front pages of Soviet newspapers ''Pravda'' and ''[[Izvestia]]''.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} The places where he had lived or stayed were converted into museums devoted to him.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=328}} Libraries, streets, farms, museums, towns, and whole regions were named after him,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=328}} with the city of Petrograd being renamed "Leningrad" in 1924,{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1p=437|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=482}} and his birthplace of Simbirsk becoming Ulyanovsk.{{sfn|Lih|2011|p=22}} The [[Order of Lenin]] was established as one of the country's highest decorations.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} All of this was contrary to Lenin's own desires, and was publicly criticised by his widow.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=440}}

Various biographers have stated that Lenin's writings were treated in a manner akin to [[holy scripture]] within the Soviet Union,{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=439|2a1=Pipes|2y=1996|2p=1|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=482}} while Pipes added that "his every opinion was cited to justify one policy or another and treated as gospel."{{sfn|Pipes|1996|p=1}} Stalin systematised Leninism through a series of lectures at the [[Sverdlov University]], which were then published as ''Questions of Leninism''.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2000|1p=484|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=185|3a1=Read|3y=2005|3pp=260, 284}} Stalin also had much of the deceased leader's writings collated and stored in a secret archive in the [[Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute]].{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|pp=274–275}} Material, such as Lenin's collection of books in Kraków, were also collected from abroad for storage in the institute, often at great expense.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=262}} During the Soviet era, these writings were strictly controlled and very few had access.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=261}} All of Lenin's writings that proved useful to Stalin were published, but the others remained hidden,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1994|p=263}} and knowledge of both Lenin's non-Russian ancestry and his noble status was suppressed.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=486}} In particular, his Jewish ancestry was suppressed until the 1980s,{{sfnm|1a1=Petrovsky-Shtern|1y=2010|1p=99|2a1=Lih|2y=2011|2p=20}} perhaps out of Soviet antisemitism,{{sfn|Read|2005|p=6}} and so as not to undermine Stalin's Russification efforts,{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|p=108}} and perhaps so as not to provide fuel for anti-Soviet sentiment among international antisemites.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=6}} After the discovery of Lenin's Jewish ancestry, this aspect was repeatedly emphasised by the Russian far-right, who claimed that his inherited Jewish genetics explained his desire to uproot traditional Russian society.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=134, 159–161}} Under Stalin's regime, Lenin was actively portrayed as a close friend of Stalin's who had supported Stalin's bid to be the next Soviet leader.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=485}} During the Soviet era, five separate editions of Lenin's published works were published in Russian, the first beginning in 1920 and the last from 1958 to 1965; the fifth edition was described as "complete", but in reality had much omitted for political expediency.{{sfnm|1a1=Pipes|1y=1996|1pp=1–2|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=183}}

[[File:URSS 1 rublo centenario nascita Lenin.JPG|thumb|left|Commemorative [[Soviet rouble|one rouble]] coin minted in 1970 in honour of Lenin's centenary]]

After Stalin's death, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and began a process of [[de-Stalinization|de-Stalinisation]], citing Lenin's writings, including those on Stalin, to legitimise this process.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1994|1pp=452–453|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2pp=491–492|3a1=Lee|3y=2003|3p=131}} When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of ''[[glastnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'', he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles.{{sfn|Service|2000|pp=491–492}} In late 1991, amid the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the [[Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History]], at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study.{{sfn|Pipes|1996|pp=2–3}} Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=492}}

In Russia in 2012, a proposal from a deputy belonging to the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], with the support of some members of the governing [[United Russia]] party, proposed the removal of all Lenin monuments. The proposal was strongly opposed by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].{{sfn|''The Moscow Times'', 24 October 2013}} In 2012, the last statue of Lenin still standing in the Mongolian capital, [[Ulaanbaatar]], was removed, with city mayor [[Bat-Uul Erdene]] calling him a "murderer."{{sfn|BBC, 14 October 2012}} In Ukraine, during and after the 2013–14 [[Euromaidan]] protests, thousands of Lenin statues were [[Demolition of monuments to Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine|damaged or destroyed]] by protesters,{{sfn|BBC, 22 February 2014}} and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others be dismantled to comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunisation laws]].{{sfn|BBC, 14 April 2015}}

===In the international communist movement===
[[File:Detalle de Lenin.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[Man, Controller of the Universe]]'', fresco at [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in [[Mexico City]] showing Vladimir Lenin]]
According to Lenin biographer [[David Shub]], writing in 1965, it was Lenin's ideas and example that "constitutes the basis of the Communist movement today."{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=10}} Socialist states following Lenin's ideas appeared in various parts of the world during the 20th century.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=5}} Writing in 1972, the historian [[Marcel Liebman]] stated that "there is hardly any insurrectionary movement today, from Latin America to Angola, that does not lay claim to the heritage of Leninism."{{sfn|Liebman|1975|p=22}}

After Lenin's death, Stalin's administration established an ideology known as [[Marxism–Leninism]], a movement that came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the communist movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Shub|1y=1966|1p=9|2a1=Service|2y=2000|2p=482}} After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's own personal dictatorship.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=132}} Marxism–Leninism was adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], [[Juche]], [[Ho Chi Minh Thought]], and [[Politics of Fidel Castro|Castroism]].{{sfn|Read|2005|p=283}} Conversely, many later Western communists, such as [[Manuel Azcárate]] and Jean Ellenstein, who were involved in the [[Eurocommunist]] movement, expressed the view that Lenin and his ideas were irrelevant to their own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist–Leninist perspective.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=132–133}}
