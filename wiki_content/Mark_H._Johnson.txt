==Education==
Johnson was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (BSc){{when|date=April 2019}} and the [[University of Cambridge]] where his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] was supervised by [[Patrick Bateson]].<ref name=markphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/21829713?style=html|title=An analysis of the neural systems underlying filial preference behaviour in the domestic chick|first=Mark Henry|last=Johnson|date=1985|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.356655}}|website=Jisc.ac.uk|oclc=59349905|hdl=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://neurotree.org/neurotree/peopleinfo.php?pid=7532|title=Neurotree - Patrick Bateson|website=Neurotree.org|accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> He was a postgraduate student at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref name=whoswho/>

==Career and research==
In 1996, Johnson co-authored, (with [[Jeffrey Elman]], [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]], [[Elizabeth Bates]], Domenico Parisi, and Kim Plunkett), the book ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]'',<ref>{{cite book|author=Elman, Jeffrey|title=Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development|url=https://archive.org/details/rethinkinginnate00elma|url-access=registration|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1996|isbn=0-262-55030-X}}</ref> which examines [[neural network]] approaches to development.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/lista.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=5 June 2008|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624025146/http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/lista.html |archivedate=24 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the book, Elman et al. propose that genetic information might provide "constraints" on how a dynamic network responds to the environment during learning. For example, they suggest that a learning system can be seen as being subject to architectural constraints during development, an idea that gave birth to the neural network field of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] modelling. Rethinking Innateness has received more than 1,500 citations,<ref name=gs/> and was nominated as one of the "One hundred most influential works in cognitive science from the 20th Century" (Minnesota Millennium Project).<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Johnson has gone on to develop<ref>{{cite journal|author=Johnson, M.H.|title=Functional brain development in infants: Elements of an interactive specialization framework|year=2000|journal=Child Development|issue=1
|pages=75–81|volume=71|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00120|pmid=10836560}}</ref> an [[Interactive Specialization]] approach to development, that views cognitive brain development as a series of back-propagated interactions between genetics, brain, body and environment. This model of cognitive development emphasises that development is a [[stochastic]], [[Network theory|network-based]], [[interactive]] process. As such, it echoes contemporary work in other areas of development, such as [[Epigenetics|probabilistic epigenesis]] and [[gene regulatory networks]].

In 2007, Johnson co-authored (with Denis Mareschal, Sylvain Sirois, Michael Spratling, Michael Thomas and Gert Westermann) ''Neuroconstructivism'',<ref>{{cite book|author=Mareschal, Denis|title=Neuroconstructivism: Volumes I & II (Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience)|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|year=2007|isbn=0-19-921482-4}}</ref> which discusses the relationship between cognition, the brain and the environment. Specifically, they argue that "the brain acquires and develops multiple, fragmentary [[Representation (psychology)|representations]] that are just sufficient for on-the-fly processing" and that these representations "serve to cause behaviours rather than to mirror the environment." Volume 2 contains a variety of neural network models that investigate how these representations change during learning (including models from Randy O’Reilly, Matthew Schlesinger and Yuko Munakata).

Johnson specialises in the development of the brain networks subserving social cognition. He is the author of more than 200 papers,<ref name=gs/> and has written or edited seven books, most notably his textbook ''Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience''<ref>{{cite book|author=Johnson, Mark|title=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 2nd Ed.|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2005|isbn=1-4051-2629-9}}</ref> He serves, with Denis Mareschal, as co-editor of the journal ''Developmental Science''.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}
