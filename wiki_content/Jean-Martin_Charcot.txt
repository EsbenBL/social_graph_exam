== Personal life ==
Born in Paris, Charcot worked and taught at the famous [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital]] for 33 years. His reputation as an instructor drew students from all over Europe.<ref name=Odyssey/> In 1882, he established a neurology clinic at Salpêtrière, which was the first of its kind in Europe.<ref name=WhoNamedCharcot/> Charcot was a part of the French neurological tradition and studied under, and greatly revered, [[Duchenne de Boulogne]].<ref name=CharcotDuchenne>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1353/pbm.2000.0055 |author= Siegel IM |title= Charcot and Duchenne: Of mentors, pupils, and colleagues |journal= Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |volume= 43 |issue= 4 |date=Summer 2000 |pages= 541–7 |pmid=11058990|s2cid= 28580400 }}</ref><ref name= CharcotCharcot>{{cite journal |author=Haas LF |title=Jean Martin Charcot (1825–93) and Jean Baptiste Charcot (1867–1936) |journal=J.

Charcot's primary focus was neurology. He named and was the first to describe [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=WhoNamedCharcot/><ref name=Charcot1>{{cite journal |author= Charcot JM |title= Histologie de la sclérose en plaques |journal= Gazette des Hopitaux, Paris |year= 1868 |volume= 41 |pages= 554–55|language=fr}}</ref> Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease ''sclérose en plaques''. The three signs of multiple sclerosis now known as [[Charcot's triad 1]] are [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[intention tremor]], and [[telegraphic speech]], though these are not unique to MS. Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a "marked enfeeblement of the memory" and "conceptions that formed slowly". He was also the first to describe a disorder known as [[Charcot joint]] or Charcot arthropathy, a degeneration of joint surfaces resulting from loss of [[proprioception]]. He researched the functions of different parts of the brain and the role of arteries in [[cerebral hemorrhage]].<ref name=WhoNamedCharcot/>

Charcot was among the first to describe [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]] (CMT). The announcement was made simultaneously with [[Pierre Marie]] of France (his resident) and [[Howard Henry Tooth]] of England. The disease is also sometimes called peroneal muscular atrophy.<ref>{{cite web |author=Enersen, Ole Daniel |title=Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/30.html |publisher=Whonamedit.com |access-date=16 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514004442/http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/30.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 }}</ref>

Charcot's studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="pmid18175393"/> Among other advances he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and [[bradykinesia]].<ref name="pmid18175393"/> He also led the disease formerly named ''paralysis agitans'' (shaking palsy) to be renamed after [[James Parkinson]].<ref name="pmid18175393">{{cite journal |author=Lees AJ |date=September 2007 |title=Unresolved issues relating to the shaking palsy on the celebration of James Parkinson's 250th birthday |journal=Mov.

=== Studies on hypnosis and hysteria ===
Charcot is best known today for his work on [[hypnosis]] and [[hysteria]]. In particular, he is best remembered for his work with his hysteria patient [[Louise Augustine Gleizes]], who somewhat increased his fame during his lifetime; however, [[Marie "Blanche" Wittmann]], known as the Queen of Hysterics, was his most famous hysteria patient at the time.<ref name="io9">{{cite web|author=Esther Inglis-Arkell |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/meet-the-queen-of-hysterics-who-was-freuds-early-muse-1604567867 |title=Meet the "Queen of Hysterics" Who Was Freud's Early Muse |publisher= io9 |date=14 August 2014 |access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="blanche">{{cite web|url= http://www.ateljegalerija.si/en/artists/image/iva-tratnik/exhibitions/blanche-imaginarna-dzungla-marec/|title= BLANCHE – IMAGINARNA DŽUNGLA|publisher= Atelje Galerija|access-date= 26 August 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170827085110/http://www.ateljegalerija.si/en/artists/image/iva-tratnik/exhibitions/blanche-imaginarna-dzungla-marec/|archive-date= 27 August 2017|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name="Louise"/> He initially believed that hysteria was a neurological disorder for which patients were pre-disposed by hereditary features of their nervous system,<ref name=Odyssey/><ref name=Charcot85>Charcot (1889), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DwQJAAAAIAAJ&dq=Charcot+hypnotism p. 85]</ref> but near the end of his life he concluded that hysteria was a psychological disease.<ref name=FollowingCharcotp108>Bogousslavsky (2010), p. 108</ref>

Charcot first began studying hysteria after creating a special ward for non-insane females with "hystero-epilepsy". He discovered two distinct forms of hysteria among these women: minor hysteria and major hysteria.<ref>Shorter (1997), p. 134</ref> His interest in hysteria and hypnotism "developed at a time when the general public was fascinated in 'animal magnetism' and 'mesmerization{{Single double}},<ref name=CrimeHysteria/> which was later revealed to be a method of inducing hypnosis.<ref name=Plotnik2012p170>Plotnik (2012) p. 170.</ref> His study of hysteria "attract[ed] both scientific and social notoriety".<ref name=Goetz211>Goetz (1995), p. 211</ref> Bogousslavsky, Walusinski, and Veyrunes write:<blockquote>Charcot and his school considered the ability to be hypnotized as a clinical feature of hysteria&nbsp;...&nbsp;For the members of the Salpêtrière School, susceptibility to hypnotism was synonymous with disease, i.e. hysteria, although they later recognized&nbsp;...&nbsp;that ''grand hypnotisme'' (in hysterics) should be differentiated ''from petit hypnotisme'', which corresponded to the hypnosis of ordinary people.<ref name="CrimeHysteria">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bogousslavsky J, Walusinski O, Veyrunes D |title=Crime, hysteria and belle époque hypnotism: the path traced by Jean-Martin Charcot and Georges Gilles de la Tourette |journal=Eur.

Charcot's analysis, in particular his view of hysteria as an organic condition which could be caused by trauma, paved the way for understanding neurological symptoms arising from industrial-accident or war-related traumas.<ref>Goetz (1987), p. 117</ref>

[[The Salpêtrière School of Hypnosis|The Salpêtrière School's position on hypnosis]] was sharply criticized by [[Hippolyte Bernheim]], another leading neurologist of the time.<ref name=CrimeHysteria/> Bernheim argued that the hypnosis and hysteria phenomena that Charcot had famously demonstrated were in fact due to suggestion. However, Charcot himself had had longstanding concerns about the use of hypnosis in treatment and about its effect on patients. He also was concerned that the sensationalism hypnosis attracted had robbed it of its scientific interest,<ref name=Goetz211/> and that the quarrel with Bernheim, amplified by Charcot's pupil [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]], had "damaged" hypnotism.<ref name=CrimeHysteria/>

=== Arts ===

This painting shows Charcot demonstrating [[hypnosis]] on a "[[hysteria|hysterical]]" ''[[Salpêtrière]]'' patient, "Blanche" ([[Marie "Blanche" Wittmann]]), who is supported by Dr. [[Joseph Babiński]] ''(rear)''.

Charcot thought of art as a crucial tool of the clinicoanatomic method. He used photos and drawings, many made by himself or his students, in his classes and conferences. He also drew outside the neurology domain, as a personal hobby. Like Duchenne, he is considered a key figure in the incorporation of photography to the study of neurological cases.<ref name="pmid2012518">{{cite journal |author=Goetz CG |title=Visual art in the neurologic career of Jean-Martin Charcot |journal=Arch.

===Distorted views of Charcot===
Distorted views of Charcot as harsh and tyrannical have arisen from some sources that rely on a fanciful autobiographical novel by [[Axel Munthe]], ''[[The Story of San Michele]]'' (1929). Munthe claimed to have been Charcot's assistant, but in fact, Munthe was just a medical student among hundreds of others. Munthe's most direct contact with Charcot was when Munthe helped a young female patient "escape" from a ward of the hospital and took her into his home. Charcot threatened to report this to the police, and ordered that Munthe not be allowed on the wards of the hospital again.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hierons R |title=Charcot and his visits to Britain |journal=BMJ |volume=307 |issue=6919 |pages=1589–91 |year=1993 |pmid=8292949 |pmc=1697759 |doi=10.1136/bmj.307.6919.1589}}</ref>

In a 1931 letter to ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Charcot's son [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]], who had, himself, been a formal student of his father at the Salpêtrière, emphatically stated:

<blockquote>I can certify that Dr Munthe never was trained by my father"; and, further, that "[although Munthe] may have [incidentally] followed, like hundreds of others, some courses of Charcot, ...he was not trained by him and certainly never had the intimacy of which he boasts [in his recently reviewed work, ''Memories and Vagaries'']. ...I was, myself, a student at the Salpetriere then, and can certify that he was not one of his students and that my father never knew him. Everything he says about professor Charcot is false....<ref>{{Cite news |last=Charcot |first=J.-B. |department=Letters to the Editor |title=Objection & Reproof |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=18 January 1931 |at=p. 23, col. A}}</ref></blockquote>

Bengt Jangfeldt, in his 2008 biography, ''Axel Munthe: The Road to San Michele'', states that "Charcot is not mentioned in a single letter of Axel's out of the hundreds that have been preserved from his Paris years" (p.&nbsp;96).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jangfeldt |first=Bengt |year=2008 |title=Axel Munthe: The Road to San Michele |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beoBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 |location=London; New York |publisher=I. B. Taurus |isbn=9780857710680 |page=96}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
One of Charcot's greatest legacies as a clinician is his contribution to the development of systematic neurological examination, correlating a set of clinical signs with specific lesions. This was made possible by his pioneering long-term studies of patients, coupled with microscopic and anatomic analysis derived from eventual autopsies.<ref>Goetz (1995), p. 103</ref> This led to the first clear delineation of various neurological diseases and classic description of them, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<ref>See:
*  Charcot, J. M. (1874) "De la sclérose latérale amyotrophique," ''Le Progrès médical'', series 1, '''2''' :  325-327, 341-342, 453-455.
*  Jean Martin Charcot with Désiré Magloire Bourneville, ed., ''Oeuvres complètes de J.M. Charcot'' (Complete works of J.M. Charcot), (Paris, France:  Fèlix Alcan, 1894), volume 2, "Douzième Leçon:  Amyotrophies spinales deutéropathiques, — Sclérose latérale amyotrophique." (Twelfth lesson:  Deuteropathic spinal amyotrophies — amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vjEdtU5ZiDIC&pg=PA234#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 234-248]; "Treizième Leçon:  De la sclérose latérale amyotrophique.  Symptomatologie." (Thirteenth lesson:  On amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Symptomology), pp. 249-266.</ref>

Charcot is just as famous for his influence on those who had studied with him: [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref name=Odyssey/> [[Joseph Babinski]],<ref name=WhoNamedCharcot/> [[Pierre Janet]],<ref name=Odyssey/> [[William James]], [[Pierre Marie]], [[Albert Londe]], [[Charles-Joseph Bouchard]],<ref name=WhoNamedCharcot/> [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]],<ref name=WhoNamedCharcot/> [[Alfred Binet]],<ref name=Odyssey/> and [[Albert Pitres]]. Among the doctors trained by Charcot at the beginning of the 20th century account the Spanish neuropathologists [[Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora|Nicolás Achúcarro]] and [[Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora]], two distinguished disciples of [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and members of the Spanish Neurological School.

Charcot bestowed the [[eponym]] for [[Tourette syndrome]] in honor of his student, Georges Gilles de la Tourette.<ref name="Kushner11">Kushner (2000), p. 11</ref><ref>Black, KJ (22 March 2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic664.htm Tourette Syndrome and Other Tic Disorders.]  eMedicine. Retrieved on 27 June 2006.<br />* Enerson, Ole Daniel.

Although, by the 1870s, Charcot was France's best known physician, his ideas about hysteria were later refuted, and French psychiatry did not recover for decades. An example of the dismissal of Charcot's views can be found in Edward Shorter's ''History of Psychiatry'': Shorter states that Charcot understood "almost nothing" about major psychiatric illness, and that he was "quite lacking in common sense and grandiosely sure of his own judgement". This perspective overlooks the fact that Charcot never claimed to be a psychiatrist or to be practising psychiatry, a field that was separately organized from neurology within France's educational and public health systems.<ref>Goetz (1995), p. 208</ref> After Charcot's death, the phenomenon of "[[hysteria]]" that he had described was no longer recognized as a real neurological condition, but was considered to be an "artifact of suggestion".<ref>Shorter (1997), pp. 84–86</ref> However, Charcot continued to have a "prominent" position in French psychiatry and psychology.<ref name=Gardner145>Gardner (1999), p. 145</ref>

The negative evaluation of Charcot's work on hysteria was influenced by a significant shift in diagnostic criteria and understanding of hysteria which occurred in the decades following his death.<ref>Goetz (1987), p. 115</ref> The historical perspective on Charcot's work on hysteria has also been distorted by viewing him as a precursor of Freud.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} After Charcot's death, Freud and Janet wrote articles on his importance.<ref name=FollowingCharcotp120>Bogousslavsky (2010), p. 120</ref> However, Charcot's work on hysteria and hypnotism was at odds with the perspective Freud made famous, since Charcot believed in neurological determinism.

The Charcot-Janet school, which formed from the work of Charcot and his student Janet, contributed greatly to knowledge of [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorders]].<ref name=GardnerM389>Gardner (1999), p. 389</ref><ref>The Charcot-Janet school was later extended by [[Morton Prince]] in his book on ''Dissociation of a Personality'' (1905),</ref>

===Influence on the development of anti-Semitism===

Charcot claimed to have observed a higher prevalence of diseases with a hereditary component (notably [[arthritis]] and neurological disorders) in Jewish communities, where limited numbers combined with longterm [[endogamy]]. He also used Jewish patients as examples in some of his public lectures.<ref>Charcot, Jean-Martin. Lecons du mardi. Paris: Bureaux du Progrès médical, 1888-89, vol. 2. p. 11.</ref>

When these claims were developed by neurologist [[Henry Meige]], and others, in conjunction with the myth of the [[Wandering Jew]], this was used as support by the apostles of French [[anti-Semitism]], notably the journalist [[Edouard Drumont]].<ref>Jan Goldstein "The Wandering Jew and the Problem of Psychiatric Anti-Semitism in Fin-de-Siecle France" 20 Journal of Contemporary History (Oct. 1985), p. 521</ref> However, historian of science [[Ian Hacking]] cautions that Charcot's interest in Jews and his claims about them must be seen in their nuanced, ambiguous context: "notice how Charcot shared most of the presuppositions of the genetic approach to mental illness that are current today [1998].

He could not fall back on a genome project to support his scientific speculations, but he did have a closed gene pool to study, not just in that Jews were endogenous but because many Jews in his clinic were descended from relatives, even cousins, who married each other. Scientific reasoning could motivate his constant attention to Jewish family lines .... Thus a reputable scientific quest merged with a great willingness to see Jews as aberrant, troublesome, ill."<ref>Hacking, Ian. Mad Travelers: Reflections on the Reality of Transient Mental Illnesses. Charlottesville, Va.: University Press of Virginia, 1998. p. 119</ref>

However, by the very end of the 19th century, anti-Semitism in France had rapidly accentuated, due to the [[Dreyfus affair]]. "Because of this transition, it has become all too easy to read gross and manifest anti-Semitism" retrospectively into the hospital wards of one or two decades previous.<ref>Hacking, Ian. Mad Travelers: Reflections on the Reality of Transient Mental Illnesses. Charlottesville, Va.: University Press of Virginia, 1998. p. 123</ref>
