'''Susan Leigh Star''' (1954–2010) was an [[United States|American]] [[sociology|sociologist]]. She specialized in the study of [[information]] in modern society; information worlds; [[information infrastructure]]; [[:wikt:classification|classification]] and [[standardization]]; [[sociology of science]]; [[sociology of work]] and the [[history of science]], [[history of medicine|medicine]], [[history of technology|technology]], and  communication/information systems. She commonly used the [[qualitative methods]] methodology and [[feminist theory]] approach. She was also known for developing the concept of [[boundary object]]s and for contributions to [[computer-supported cooperative work]].<ref name="Zachry" />

==Biography==

===Life and education===
Star grew up in a rural working class area of [[Rhode Island]].<ref name="Balka">{{cite journal |last=Balka |first=Ellen |title=Susan Leigh Star (1954-2010) |journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=40 | issue = 4 |date=July 2010 |page=647 |doi=10.1177/0306312710376010|s2cid=145294632 }}</ref> Her family was of Jewish, English, and Scottish descent and she describes herself as "half-Jewish".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gbowker/classification/ |title=SORTING THINGS OUT: CLASSIFICATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES |publisher=[[University of California, San Diego]] |accessdate=2019-10-23}}</ref> Starved for [[philosophy]] she befriended an ex-nun during high school and eventually obtained a scholarship to [[Radcliffe College]] where she began taking philosophy classes.<ref name="Balka" /> Not fitting in and deterred from taking a [[Religion]] degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to [[Venezuela]] where she co-founded an organic [[commune]].<ref name="Balka" /> It was here that Star asked many of the questions that formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and [[feminism]], and it was during this time that the [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|women's movement]] and [[Kate Millett|Kate Millett's]] ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' inspired her to ask questions about technology and the effects that both good and bad technology have on oneself and on the world.<ref name="Balka" />

Star later returned to school and graduated [[magna cum laude]] from Radcliffe in 1976 with a degree in Psychology and Social Relations.<ref name="Balka" /> She then moved to [[California]] and began graduate school in the philosophy of education at [[Stanford University]]. The program was not the right fit and she pursued her graduate education in sociology at the [[University of California]].<ref name="Balka" /> She completed her dissertation, under [[Anselm Strauss]], in 1983.<ref name="Balka b">{{cite journal |last=Balka |first=Ellen |title=Susan Leigh Star (1954-2010) |journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=40 | issue = 4 |date=July 2010 |page=648 |doi=10.1177/0306312710376010|s2cid=145294632 }}</ref> She became interested in computer science while studying the decision-making process of the scientific community as a metaphor for [[artificial intelligence]] with [[Carl Hewitt]].<ref name="Zachry" />

From 2004 to 2009 she held a position as a professor at the Center for Science, Technology, and Society at [[Santa Clara University]].<ref name="Clarke">{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=Adele E. |title=In Memoriam: Susan Leigh Star (1954-2010) |journal=Science, Technology, & Human Values |date=10 August 2010 |volume=35 |issue=5 |page=584 |doi=10.1177/0162243910378096|s2cid=144471766 }}</ref><ref name="Zachry" />

In 2010, she [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306312710376010?journalCode=sssb died] in her sleep of unknown causes. At the time, she held the Doreen Boyce Chair at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] School of Information Sciences and was authoring the book [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162243910377624 "This is Not a Boundary Object"] with her husband, [[Geoffrey Bowker]].

===Academic work===
From 1987 to 1990, Star was an assistant professor at UC Irvine's Department of Information and Computer Science.<ref name="Balka b" /> She taught a variety of subjects including: social analysis of technology and organizations, computers and society, research methods and gender and technology.  In 1987-1988 Star held a fellowship at Centre de Sociologie de l’Innovation in Paris and worked with [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Michel Callon]].<ref name="Balka b" /> They worked on French/American approaches to technology and science.

After Irvine, Star held a Senior Lectureship and the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology at the University of Keele. In 1992, Star and partner [[Geoff Bowker]] went to the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Illinois until 1999.<ref name="Balka b" /> After leaving the University of Illinois, they moved back to California and into the Department of Communication at the University of California San Diego where they remained until 2004. Star and Bowker moved north in 2004 and worked at Santa Clara University's Center for Science, Technology and Society. In 2009 they moved to the University of Pittsburgh's School of Information Sciences, where Star was awarded the Doreen Boyce Chair.<ref name="Balka b" />

In addition, she has been an invited speaker at many universities and industrial firms, such as: Harvard, MIT and Xerox PARC.<ref name="Zachry">{{cite journal |last=Zachry |first=Mark |title=An Interview with Susan Leigh Star |journal=Technical Communication Quarterly |volume=17 | issue = 4 |date=October 2008 |page=437 |doi=10.1080/10572250802329563|s2cid=144431192 }}</ref> She was also co-Editor-in-Chief of Science, Technology, and Human Values and was president of the Society for the Social Studies of Science from 2005-2007.<ref name="Zachry" />

Star has been particularly influential in the area of [[information infrastructure]], frequently noting that although the study of infrastructure often entails examining things that seem commonplace, those everyday items have widespread consequences for humans and human interaction.<ref name="Zachry" /> Star has worked to develop ways of understanding how people communicate about infrastructure, and has helped develop research methods aimed to examine the role infrastructure plays in mediated human activities.<ref name="Zachry" /> But her work extends far beyond the realm of [[information infrastructure]]. Star's interest in the connection between technology and lived experience led her to work in a wide array of disciplines, including library sciences, computer sciences, neuroscience, philosophy and women's studies.<ref name="Balka b" />

====Boundary objects====
In the article “Institutional Ecology, 'Translations' and Boundary Objects: Amateurs and Professionals in Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, 1907-39”, Star and her co-author Griesemer introduce the concept of [[boundary object]]s. In this article, Star and Griesemer analyze the formative years of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology by expanding the model of [[interessement]] developed by Latour and Callon, to form their concept of boundary objects.<ref name="Star; Griesemer">{{cite journal|last=Star|first=Susan|author2=Griesemer, James |title=Institutional Ecology, 'Translations' and Boundary Objects: Amateurs and Professionals in Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, 1907-39|journal=Social Studies of Science|year=1989|volume=19|issue=3|pages=387|doi=10.1177/030631289019003001|s2cid=112710658|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/df624e5156924ebfe9cc7724583425664032d8c8}}</ref>
Star and Griesmer initially defined boundary objects as “objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites...The objects may by abstract or concrete.”<ref name="Star; Griesemer"/>
For the purpose of this article, Star and Griesmer defined four kinds of boundary objects: “repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms,”<ref name="Star; Griesemer" /> however Star later commented that she never intended this to be a comprehensive list; rather she imagined the article as starting “a kind of catalog of some of the characteristics of boundary objects”.<ref name="Zachry b">{{cite journal |last=Zachry |first=Mark |title=An Interview with Susan Leigh Star |journal=Technical Communication Quarterly |volume=17 | issue = 4 |date=October 2008 |page=440 |doi=10.1080/10572250802329563|s2cid=144431192 }}</ref>
