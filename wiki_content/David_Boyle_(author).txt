His solutions are also published in ''The Human Element''. This [http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/1603157/the_human_element_ten_new_rules_to_kickstart_our_failing_organisations.html argues] that organisations have abandoned human skills in favour of numerical targets or IT systems, which frustrate the business of building relationships and making things happen.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} He helped to launch the popular campaign against the failures of the [[Southern (Govia Thameslink Railway)|Southern Rail]] franchise with his book ''Cancelled!'', and his experimental 'passenger strike' in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guardian|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/12/southern-rail-passengers-strike-self-respect|accessdate = 2017-04-24}}</ref>

His 2010 book, ''Eminent Corporations'' (with [[Andrew Simms]]) has introduced a new genre, the mini-corporate biography, launching the idea of corporate history as tragedy.
