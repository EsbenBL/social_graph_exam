Du Bois Center @duboisumass|date=2018-11-12|publisher=Twitter.com|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> February 23, 1868 – August 27, 1963) was an American [[sociology|sociologist]], [[socialist]], [[historian]], [[civil rights activist]], [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]], author, writer and editor. Born in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and [[racial integration|integrated]] community, and after completing graduate work at the [[University of Berlin]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], where he was the first [[African American]] to earn a [[doctorate]], he became a professor of history, sociology and economics at [[Atlanta University]]. Du Bois was one of the founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909.

Earlier, Du Bois had risen to national prominence as a leader of the [[Niagara Movement]], a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the [[Atlanta compromise]], an agreement crafted by [[Booker T. Washington]] which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the [[Talented Tenth]], a concept under the umbrella of [[racial uplift]], and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.

[[Racism]] was the main target of Du Bois's polemics, and he strongly protested against [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]], [[Jim Crow laws]], and [[Racism in the United States|discrimination]] in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of [[Pan-Africanism]] and helped organize several [[Pan-African Congress]]es to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers. Du Bois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American [[Military history of African Americans#Experience of Soldiers in France|black soldiers in France]] and documented widespread prejudice and racism in the United States military.

Du Bois was a prolific author. His collection of essays, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', is a seminal work in [[African-American literature]]; and his 1935 magnum opus, ''[[Black Reconstruction|Black Reconstruction in America]]'', challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. Borrowing a phrase from [[Frederick Douglass]], he popularized the use of the term [[color line (racism)|color line]] to represent the injustice of the [[separate but equal]] doctrine prevalent in American social and political life. He opens ''The Souls of Black Folk'' with the central thesis of much of his life's work: "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line."

His 1940 autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'' is regarded in part as one of the first scientific treatises in the field of American sociology, and he published two other life stories, all three containing essays on sociology, politics and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal ''[[The Crisis]]'', he published many influential pieces. Du Bois believed that [[capitalism]] was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to [[socialism|socialist]] causes throughout his life. He was an ardent peace activist and advocated [[nuclear disarmament]]. The United States [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], embodying many of the reforms for which Du Bois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.

==Early life==
[[File:Congregational Church, Great Barrington, MA.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=An old brick church surrounded by trees|As a child, Du Bois attended the [[Society of the Congregational Church of Great Barrington|Congregational Church]] in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]]. Church members collected donations to pay Du Bois's college tuition.<ref name="Horne, p. 7">Horne, p. 7.</ref>]]
William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on February 23, 1868, in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], to Alfred and Mary Silvina ({{née}} Burghardt) Du Bois.<ref>Lewis, p. 11.</ref> Mary Silvina Burghardt's family was part of the very small [[free black]] population of Great Barrington and had long owned land in the state. She was descended from [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]], [[African diaspora|African]] and [[English Americans|English]] ancestors.<ref>Lewis, pp. 14–15.</ref> William Du Bois's maternal great-great-grandfather was Tom Burghardt, a [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slave]] (born in [[West Africa]] around 1730) who was held by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Tom briefly served in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], which may have been how he gained his freedom during the late 18th century. His son Jack Burghardt was the father of Othello Burghardt, who in turn was the father of Mary Silvina Burghardt.<ref>Lewis, p. 13</ref>

William Du Bois claimed [[Elizabeth Freeman]] as his relative; he wrote that she had married his great-grandfather Jack Burghardt.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dusk of Dawn|first=W. E. B.|last=Du Bois|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=Piscataway NJ|orig-year=1940|year=1984|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=W. E. B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race 1868–1919|first=David Levering|last=Lewis|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.|year=1993|page=14|location=New York City}}</ref> But Freeman was 20 years older than Burghardt, and no record of such a marriage has been found. It may have been Freeman's daughter, Betsy Humphrey, who married Burghardt after her first husband, Jonah Humphrey, left the area "around 1811", and after Burghardt's first wife died ({{circa}} 1810). If so, Freeman would have been William Du Bois's step-great-great-grandmother. Anecdotal evidence supports Humphrey's marrying Burghardt; a close relationship of some form is likely.<ref>{{cite book|title=One Minute a Free Woman: Elizabeth Freeman and the Struggle for Freedom|first1=Emilie|last1=Piper|first2=David|last2=Levinson|publisher=Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage Area|location=Salisbury CT|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9845492-0-7}}</ref>

William Du Bois's paternal great-grandfather was James Du Bois of [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], an ethnic [[French-American]] of [[Huguenot]] origin who fathered several children with slave women.<ref>Lewis, p. 17.</ref> One of James' [[mixed-race]] sons was Alexander, who was born on [[Long Cay]] in [[the Bahamas]] in 1803; in 1810, he immigrated to the United States with his father.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nahum Dimitri|last=Chandler|title=X: The Problem of the Negro as a Problem for Thought|year=2014|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8232-5407-1|pages=100–103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0pGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT118}}</ref> Alexander Du Bois traveled and worked in [[Haiti]], where he fathered a son, Alfred, with a mistress. Alexander returned to Connecticut, leaving Alfred in Haiti with his mother.<ref name="Lewis, p. 18">Lewis, p. 18.</ref>

Sometime before 1860, Alfred Du Bois immigrated to the United States, settling in Massachusetts. He married Mary Silvina Burghardt on February 5, 1867, in [[Housatonic, Massachusetts|Housatonic]], a village in Great Barrington.<ref name="Lewis, p. 18"/> Alfred left Mary in 1870, two years after their son William was born.<ref>Lewis, p. 21. Du Bois suggested that Mary's family drove Alfred away.</ref> Mary Du Bois moved with her son back to her parents' house in Great Barrington, and they lived there until he was five. She worked to support her family (receiving some assistance from her brother and neighbors), until she suffered a [[stroke]] in the early 1880s. She died in 1885.<ref>Rabaka, Reiland (2007), ''W. E. B. Du Bois and the Problems of the Twenty-first Century: An Essay on Africana Critical Theory'', Lexington Books, p. 165.</ref><ref>Lewis, pp. 29–30.</ref>

Great Barrington had a majority [[European American]] community, who generally treated Du Bois well. He attended the local integrated public school and played with white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism that he felt as a fatherless child and being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans.<ref>Lewis, pp. 27–44.</ref> He graduated from the town's [[Searles High School (Great Barrington, Massachusetts)|Searles High School]]. When he decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the [[First Congregational Church of Great Barrington]], raised the money for his tuition.<ref>Cebula, Tim, "Great Barrington", in Young, p. 91.</ref><ref name="Horne, p. 7"/><ref>Lewis, pp. 39–40.</ref>

===University education===

Relying on this money donated by neighbors, Du Bois attended [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], from 1885 to 1888.<ref>Lewis, Catharine, "Fisk University", in Young, p. 81.</ref> Like other Fisk students who relied on summer and intermittent teaching to support their university studies, Du Bois taught school during the summer of 1886 after his sophomore year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fultz |first1=Michael |title=Determination and Persistence: Building the African American Teacher Corps through Summer and Intermittent Teaching, 1860s-1890s |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=February 2021 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=4–34 |doi=10.1017/heq.2020.65|doi-access=free }}</ref> His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois's first experience with Southern racism, which at the time encompassed [[Jim Crow]] laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]]; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade.<ref>Lewis, pp. 56–57.</ref>

After receiving a [[bachelor's degree]] from Fisk, he attended [[Harvard College]] (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by professor [[William James]], prominent in American philosophy.<ref>Lewis, pp. 72–78.</ref> Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'', in history.<ref>Lewis, pp. 69–80 (degree); p. 69 (funding); p. 82 (inheritance). Du Bois was the sixth African American to be admitted to Harvard.</ref> In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.<ref>Lewis, p. 82.</ref>

In 1892, Du Bois received a fellowship from the [[Slater Fund|John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen]] to attend the [[University of Berlin]] for graduate work.<ref>Lewis, p. 90.</ref> While a student in [[Berlin]], he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He came of age intellectually in the German capital while studying with some of that nation's most prominent [[social scientist]]s, including [[Gustav von Schmoller]], [[Adolph Wagner]], and [[Heinrich von Treitschke]].<ref>Lewis, pp. 98–103.</ref> He also met [[Max Weber]] who was highly impressed with Du Bois and would later cite Du Bois as a counter-example to racists alleging the inferiority of Blacks. Weber would again meet Du Bois in 1904 on a visit to the US just ahead of the publication of the seminal ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

He wrote about his time in Germany: "I found myself on the outside of the American world, looking in. With me were white folk{{snd}}students, acquaintances, teachers{{snd}}who viewed the scene with me. They did not always pause to regard me as a curiosity, or something sub-human; I was just a man of the somewhat privileged student rank, with whom they were glad to meet and talk over the world; particularly, the part of the world whence I came."<ref>{{cite book|first=Aldon|last=Morris|author-link=Aldon Morris|title=The Scholar Denied: W.

One ever feels his two-ness,{{snd}}an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder ... He would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world.

In the summer of 1894, Du Bois received several job offers, including from the prestigious [[Tuskegee Institute]]; he accepted a teaching job at [[Wilberforce University]] in Ohio.<ref>Gibson, Todd, "University of Pennsylvania", in Young, p. 210.</ref><ref>Lewis, p. 111.</ref> At Wilberforce, Du Bois was strongly influenced by [[Alexander Crummell]], who believed that ideas and morals are necessary tools to effect social change.<ref>Lewis, pp. 118, 120.</ref> While at Wilberforce, Du Bois married Nina Gomer, one of his students, on May 12, 1896.<ref>Lewis, p. 126. Nina Gomer Du Bois did not play a significant role in Du Bois's activism or career (see Lewis, pp. 135, 152–154, 232, 287–290, 296–301, 404–406, 522–525, 628–630).</ref>

After two years at Wilberforce, Du Bois accepted a one-year research job from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as an "assistant in sociology" in the summer of 1896.<ref>Lewis, pp. 128–129. Du Bois resented never receiving an offer for a teaching position at Penn.</ref> He performed sociological field research in Philadelphia's African-American neighborhoods, which formed the foundation for his landmark study, ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'', published in 1899 while he was teaching at [[Atlanta University]]. It was the first case study of a black community in the United States.<ref>Horne, pp. 23–24.</ref>

By the 1890s, Philadelphia's black neighborhoods had a negative reputation in terms of crime, poverty, and mortality. Du Bois's book undermined the stereotypes with empirical evidence and shaped his approach to segregation and its negative impact on black lives and reputations. The results led him to realize that racial integration was the key to democratic equality in American cities.<ref>Bulmer, Martin, "W. E. B. Du Bois as a Social Investigator: The Philadelphia Negro, 1899", in Martin Bulmer, Kevin Bales, and Kathryn Kish Sklar, eds. ''The Social Survey in Historical Perspective, 1880–1940'' (1991), pp. 170–188.</ref> The methodology employed in ''The Philadelphia Negro'', namely the description and the mapping of social characteristics onto neighborhood areas was a forerunner to the studies under the Chicago School of Sociology.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|pages=199–200}}</ref>

While taking part in the [[American Negro Academy]] (ANA) in 1897, Du Bois presented a paper in which he rejected [[Frederick Douglass]]'s plea for black Americans to integrate into white society. He wrote: "we are Negroes, members of a vast historic race that from the very dawn of creation has slept, but half awakening in the dark forests of its African fatherland".<ref>Lewis, p. 123. His paper was titled ''The Conservation of Races''.</ref> In the August 1897 issue of ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'', Du Bois published "Strivings of the Negro People", his first work aimed at the general public, in which he enlarged upon his thesis that African Americans should embrace their African heritage while contributing to American society.<ref>Lewis, pp. 143–144.</ref>

==Atlanta University==
In July 1897, Du Bois left Philadelphia and took a professorship in history and economics at the historically black [[Atlanta University]] in Georgia.<ref>Horne, p. 26.</ref><ref>Lewis, pp. 143, 155.</ref> His first major academic work was his book ''The Philadelphia Negro'' (1899), a detailed and comprehensive sociological study of the African-American people of Philadelphia, based on his fieldwork in 1896–1897. This breakthrough in scholarship was the first scientific study of African Americans and a major contribution to early scientific sociology in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lange|first1=Werner J.|title=W.

"''The Philadelphia Negro'' stands as a classic in both (urban) sociology and African American studies because it was the first scientific study of the Negro and the first scientific sociological study in the United States".</ref>

Du Bois coined the phrase "the submerged tenth" to describe the black underclass in the study. Later in 1903, he popularized the term, the "[[The Talented Tenth|Talented Tenth]]", applied to society's elite class. His terminology reflected his opinion that the elite of a nation, both black and white, were critical to achievements in culture and progress.<ref>Lewis, p. 148.</ref> During this period he wrote dismissively of the underclass, describing them as "lazy" or "unreliable", but – in contrast to other scholars – he attributed many of their societal problems to the ravages of slavery.<ref>Lewis, pp. 140, 148 (underclass), 141 (slavery).</ref>

Du Bois's output at Atlanta University was prodigious, in spite of a limited budget: he produced numerous social science papers and annually hosted the [[Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems]].<ref>Lewis, pp. 158–160.</ref> He also received grants from the U.S. government to prepare reports about African-American workforce and culture.<ref>Lewis, pp. 161, 235 (Department of Labor); p. 141 (Bureau of Labor Statistics).</ref> His students considered him to be a brilliant, but aloof and strict, teacher.<ref name="auto">Lewis, p. 157.</ref>

===First Pan-African Conference===
Du Bois attended the [[First Pan-African Conference]], held in [[London]] on 23−25 July 1900, shortly ahead of the [[Paris Exhibition of 1900]] ("to allow tourists of African descent to attend both events".)<ref>Ramla Bandele, [http://diaspora.northwestern.edu/mbin/WebObjects/DiasporaX.woa/wa/displayArticle?atomid=461 "Pan-African Conference in 1900"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922122851/http://diaspora.northwestern.edu/mbin/WebObjects/DiasporaX.woa/wa/displayArticle?atomid=461|date=22 September 2013}}, Article #461, Origins of the movement for global black unity, Global Mappings.</ref> The Conference had been organized by people from the Caribbean: Haitians [[Anténor Firmin]] and [[Bénito Sylvain]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] barrister [[Henry Sylvester Williams]].<ref>[http://www.newint.org/features/2000/08/05/simply/ "A history of Pan-Africanism"], ''New Internationalist'', 326, August 2000.</ref> Du Bois played a leading role in drafting a letter ("Address to the Nations of the World"), asking European leaders to struggle against racism, to grant colonies in Africa and the West Indies the right to [[self-government]] and to demand political and other rights for African Americans.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=1900-w-e-b-du-bois-nations-world "(1900) W.

At the conclusion of the conference, delegates unanimously adopted the "Address to the Nations of the World", and sent it to various heads of state where people of African descent were living and suffering oppression.<ref>Sivagurunathan, Shivani, "Pan-Africanism", in David Dabydeen.

In the first decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a spokesperson for his race, second only to [[Booker T. Washington]].<ref>Lewis, p. 161.</ref> Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities.<ref>Lewis, pp. 179–180, 189.</ref> Washington was the architect of the [[Atlanta Compromise]], an unwritten deal that he had struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.<ref>Harlan, Louis R.

Despite initially sending congratulations to Washington for his [[Atlanta Exposition Speech]],<ref>{{citation|last=Harlan|first=Louis R.|title=Booker T.

Grimke]], [[Kelly Miller (scientist)|Kelly Miller]], [[James Weldon Johnson]] and [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] – representatives of the class of educated blacks that Du Bois would later call the "[[The Talented Tenth|talented tenth]]".<ref>Harlan, Louis R.

Du Bois popularized the term "talented tenth" in a 1903 essay, but he was not the first to use it.</ref> Du Bois felt that African Americans should fight for equal rights and higher opportunities, rather than passively submit to the segregation and discrimination of Washington's Atlanta Compromise.<ref>Croce, Paul, "Accommodation versus Struggle", in Young, pp. 1–3.</ref>

Du Bois was inspired to greater activism by the lynching of [[Sam Hose]], which occurred near Atlanta in 1899.<ref name="Lewis162">Lewis, p. 162.</ref> Hose was tortured, burned and hung by a mob of two thousand whites. When walking through Atlanta to discuss the lynching with newspaper editor [[Joel Chandler Harris]], Du Bois encountered Hose's burned knuckles in a storefront display. The episode stunned Du Bois, and he resolved that "one could not be a calm, cool, and detached scientist while Negroes were lynched, murdered, and starved". Du Bois realized that "the cure wasn't simply telling people the truth, it was inducing them to act on the truth".<ref>Lewis, pp. 162-3, Du Bois quoted by Lewis.</ref>

In 1901, Du Bois wrote a review critical of Washington's autobiography ''[[Up from Slavery]]'',<ref>Lewis, p. 184.</ref> which he later expanded and published to a wider audience as the essay "Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others" in ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]''.<ref>Lewis, pp. 199–200.</ref> Later in life, Du Bois regretted having been critical of Washington in those essays.<ref>Lewis, p. 711.</ref> One of the contrasts between the two leaders was their approach to education: Washington felt that African-American schools should focus primarily on [[Vocational education|industrial education topics]] such as agricultural and mechanical skills, to prepare southern blacks for the opportunities in the rural areas where most lived.<ref>Lomotey, pp. 354–355.</ref> Du Bois felt that black schools should focus more on [[liberal arts]] and academic curriculum (including the classics, arts, and humanities), because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite.<ref>Lomotey, pp. 355–356.</ref>

However, as sociologist [[E. Franklin Frazier]] and economists [[Gunnar Myrdal]] and [[Thomas Sowell]] have argued, such disagreement over education was a minor point of difference between Washington and Du Bois; both men acknowledged the importance of the form of education that the other emphasized.<ref>{{citation|last=Frazier|first=Edward Franklin|year=1957|title=The Negro in the United States|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Company]]|location=New York|page=459}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Myrdal|first1=Gunnar|last2=Rose|first2=Arnold M.|year=1964|title=An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and American Democracy|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]]|location=New York|page=889|volume=2|title-link=An American Dilemma}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Black Rednecks and White Liberals|chapter=Black Education: Achievements, Myths and Tragedies|publisher=Encounter Books|place=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackredneckswhi00thom/page/231 231–235]|isbn=978-1-59403-086-4|title-link=Black Rednecks and White Liberals|date=1 January 2005}}</ref> Sowell has also argued that, despite genuine disagreements between the two leaders, the supposed animosity between Washington and Du Bois actually formed among their followers, not between Washington and Du Bois themselves.<ref>{{citation|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Ethnic America: A History|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|place=New York|page=208|year=1981}}</ref> Du Bois also made this observation in an interview published in ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in November 1965.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Du Bois|first=W.

===Niagara Movement===

In 1905, Du Bois and several other African-American civil rights activists&nbsp;– including [[Fredrick L. McGhee]], [[Jesse Max Barber]] and [[William Monroe Trotter]] – met in Canada, near [[Niagara Falls]],<ref>Lewis, pp. 215–216.</ref> where they wrote a declaration of principles opposing the Atlanta Compromise, and which were incorporated as the [[Niagara Movement]] in 1906.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Niagara Movement |first=W.E.B. |last=DuBois |authorlink=W.E.B.

[[Freeman H. M. Murray]] and [[Lafayette M. Hershaw]] served as ''The Horizon'''s co-editors.<ref>Lewis, pp. 227–228. ''The Horizon'' lasted until 1910 when he developed ''The Crisis'' for publication as an instrument of the NAACP.</ref>

The Niagarites held a second conference in August 1906, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s birth, at the West Virginia site of Brown's [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harper's Ferry]].<ref name="Lewis220"/> [[Reverdy C. Ransom]] spoke, explaining that Washington's primary goal was to prepare blacks for employment in their current society: "Today, two classes of Negroes, ...are standing at the parting of the ways. The one counsels patient submission to our present humiliations and degradations; ...The other class believe that it should not submit to being humiliated, degraded, and remanded to an inferior place. ...[I]t does not believe in bartering its manhood for the sake of gain."<ref>Ransom, quoted by Lewis, p. 222.</ref>

===''The Souls of Black Folk''===
{{main|The Souls of Black Folk}}

In an effort to portray the genius and humanity of the black race, Du Bois published ''The Souls of Black Folk'' (1903), a collection of 14 essays.<ref name="Gibson, Todd p. 198">Gibson, Todd, "The Souls of Black Folk", in Young, p. 198.</ref><ref name="Lewis, p. 191">Lewis, p. 191.</ref> James Weldon Johnson said the book's effect on African Americans was comparable to that of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.<ref name="Lewis, p. 191"/> The introduction famously proclaimed that "the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line".<ref>Lewis, p. 192. Du Bois quoted by Lewis.</ref> Each chapter begins with two epigraphs – one from a white poet, and one from a black spiritual – to demonstrate intellectual and cultural parity between black and white cultures.<ref name="Gibson, Todd p. 198"/>

A major theme of the work was the [[double consciousness]] faced by African Americans: being both American and black. This was a unique identity which, according to Du Bois, had been a handicap in the past, but could be a strength in the future: "Henceforth, the destiny of the race could be conceived as leading neither to assimilation nor separatism but to proud, enduring hyphenation."<ref>Lewis, pp. 194–195.</ref>

Jonathon S. Kahn in ''Divine Discontent: The Religious Imagination of Du Bois'' shows how Du Bois, in his ''The Souls of Black Folk'', represents an exemplary text of pragmatic [[religious naturalism]]. On page 12, Kahn writes: "Du Bois needs to be understood as an African American pragmatic religious naturalist. By this I mean that, like Du Bois the American traditional pragmatic religious naturalism, which runs through [[William James]], [[George Santayana]] and [[John Dewey]], seeks religion without [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundations." Kahn's interpretation of religious naturalism is very broad but he relates it to specific thinkers. Du Bois's anti-metaphysical viewpoint places him in the sphere of religious naturalism as typified by William James and others.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Jonathon S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTv6iq5fpqcC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=W.+E.+B.+Du+Bois,religious+naturalism&source=bl&ots=dy4sKpq2F2&sig=M7XaTC356AlXO0xu2GYW0y6FBis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eQcyU6HYJOmIyAHsvYHICg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois%2Creligious%20naturalism&f=false ''Divine Discontent: The Religious Imagination of W. E. B. Du Bois''], Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-530789-4}}.</ref>

===Racial violence===
Two calamities in the autumn of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to strengthening support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's [[Atlanta Compromise|accommodationism]]. First, President [[Teddy Roosevelt]] dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes as a result of the [[Brownsville Affair]]. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement.<ref>Lewis, p. 223.</ref> Second, in September, [[Atlanta Race Riot|riots broke out in Atlanta]], precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers.<ref>Lewis, p. 224.</ref> Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths.<ref>Lewis, pp. 224–225.</ref> In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], because Republicans Roosevelt and [[William Howard Taft]] did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Lewis, p. 229.</ref>

Du Bois wrote the essay, "A Litany at Atlanta", which asserted that the riot demonstrated that the Atlanta Compromise was a failure. Despite upholding their end of the bargain, blacks had failed to receive legal justice in the South. Historian David Levering Lewis has written that the Compromise no longer held because white patrician planters, who took a paternalistic role, had been replaced by aggressive businessmen who were willing to pit blacks against whites.<ref>Lewis, p. 2226.</ref> These two calamities were watershed events for the African-American community, marking the ascendancy of Du Bois's vision of equal rights.<ref>Lewis, pp. 223–224, 230.</ref>

===Academic work===

In addition to writing editorials, Du Bois continued to produce scholarly work at Atlanta University. In 1909, after five years of effort, he published a biography of abolitionist John Brown. It contained many insights, but also contained some factual errors.<ref>Lewis, p. 238.</ref><ref>VendeCreek, Drew, "John Brown", in Young, pp. 32–33.</ref> The work was strongly criticized by ''[[The Nation]]'', which was owned by [[Oswald Villard]], who was writing his own, competing biography of John Brown. Possibly as a result, Du Bois's work was largely ignored by white scholars.<ref>Lewis, p. 240.</ref> After publishing a piece in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine warning of the end of "[[white supremacy]]", Du Bois had difficulty getting pieces accepted by major periodicals, although he did continue to publish columns regularly in ''The Horizon'' magazine.<ref>Lewis, p. 244 (Colliers); p. 249 (Horizon).</ref>

Du Bois was the first African American invited by the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) to present a paper at their annual conference. He read his paper, ''Reconstruction and Its Benefits,'' to an astounded audience at the AHA's December 1909 conference.<ref name=Lewis250>Lewis, p. 250.</ref> The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the [[Dunning School]] of scholars at [[Columbia University]], that [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation.<ref name=Lewis251>Lewis, p. 251.</ref>

Du Bois asserted that it was the federal government's failure to manage the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South.<ref name=Lewis251>Lewis, p. 251.</ref> When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'', he asked that the word Negro be capitalized. The editor, [[J. Franklin Jameson]], refused, and published the paper without the capitalization.<ref>Lewis, p. 252.</ref> The paper was mostly ignored by white historians.<ref name="Lewis251"/> Du Bois later developed his paper as his ground-breaking 1935 book, ''[[Black Reconstruction]],'' which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions.<ref name=Lewis250/> The AHA did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.<ref>Lewis, David Levering, "Beyond Exclusivity: Writing Race, Class, Gender into U.S. History", date unknown, New York University, Silver Dialogues series.</ref>

==NAACP era==
In May 1909, Du Bois attended the [[National Negro Conference]] in New York.<ref>Lewis, pp. 256–258.</ref> The meeting led to the creation of the [[National Negro Committee]], chaired by Oswald Villard, and dedicated to campaigning for civil rights, equal voting rights, and equal educational opportunities.<ref>Lewis, p. 258.</ref> The following spring, in 1910, at the second National Negro Conference, the attendees created the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).<ref>Lewis, pp. 263–264.</ref> At Du Bois's suggestion, the word "colored", rather than "black", was used to include "dark skinned people everywhere".<ref>Lewis, p. 264.</ref> Dozens of civil rights supporters, black and white, participated in the founding, but most executive officers were white, including [[Mary Ovington]], [[Charles Edward Russell]], [[William English Walling]], and its first president, [[Moorfield Storey]].<ref>Lewis, p. 253 (whites), 264 (president).</ref>

Feeling inspired by this, Indian social reformer and civil rights activist Dr. [[B.R. Ambedkar]] contacted Du Bois in the 1940s. In a letter to Du Bois in 1946, he introduced himself as a member of the "Untouchables of India" and "a student of the Negro problem" and expressed his interest in the NAACP's petition to the U.N. He noted that his group was "thinking of following suit"; and requested copies of the proposed statement from Du Bois. In a letter dated July 31, 1946, Du Bois responded by telling Ambedkar he was familiar with his name, and that he had "every sympathy with the Untouchables of India."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saada.org/tides/article/ambedkar-du-bois|publisher=South Asian American Digital Archive|title=What BR Ambedker wrote to WEB Du Bois|access-date=14 September 2020|date=22 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b109-i132|publisher=UMass Amherst|title=Letter from BR Ambedker to WEB Du Bois|access-date=14 September 2020|date=July 1946}}</ref>

===''The Crisis''===
[[File:Motto web dubois original.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An African American man, sitting for a posed portrait|Du Bois, {{circa|1911}}]]
NAACP leaders offered Du Bois the position of Director of Publicity and Research.<ref>Lewis, pp. 252, 265.</ref> He accepted the job in the summer of 1910, and moved to New York after resigning from Atlanta University. His primary duty was editing the NAACP's monthly magazine, which he named ''[[The Crisis]]''.<ref>Bowles, Amy, "NAACP", in Young, pp. 141–144.</ref> The first issue appeared in November 1910, and Du Bois wrote that its aim was to set out "those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested today toward colored people".<ref>Lewis, pp. 268–269.</ref> The journal was phenomenally successful, and its circulation would reach 100,000 in 1920.<ref>Lewis, pp. 270 (success), 384 (circulation).</ref> Typical articles in the early editions polemics against the dishonesty and parochialism of black churches, and disussions on the Afrocentric origins of Egyptian civilization.<ref>Lewis, p. 271.</ref>

A 1911 Du Bois editorial helped initiate a nationwide push to induce the Federal government to outlaw lynching. Du Bois, employing the sarcasm he frequently used, commented on a lynching in Pennsylvania: "The point is he was black. Blackness must be punished. Blackness is the crime of crimes ... It is therefore necessary, as every white scoundrel in the nation knows, to let slip no opportunity of punishing this crime of crimes. Of course if possible, the pretext should be great and overwhelming – some awful stunning crime, made even more horrible by the reporters' imagination. Failing this, mere murder, arson, barn burning or impudence may do."<ref>Lewis, pp. 279–280.</ref><ref>Quote from "Triumph", ''The Crisis'', 2 (September 1911), p. 195.</ref>

''The Crisis'' carried Du Bois editorials supporting the ideals of unionized labor but denouncing its leaders' racism; blacks were barred from membership.<ref>Lewis, p. 274.</ref> Du Bois also supported the principles of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] (he held party membership from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.<ref>Hancock, Ange-Marie, "Socialism/Communism", in Young, p. 196 (member).<br />Lewis, p. 275 (denounced).</ref> Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.<ref>Lewis, p. 278. Wilson promised "to see justice done in every matter".</ref>

Throughout his writings, Du Bois supported women's rights<ref>Lewis pp. 43, 259, 522, 608.</ref><ref>Donaldson, Shawn, "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221.</ref> and women's suffrage,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duong|first=Kevin|date=2021|title=Universal Suffrage as Decolonization|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/universal-suffrage-as-decolonization/E48823752B50F7B013172B9D02B6CE16|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=115|issue=2|pages=412–428|doi=10.1017/S0003055420000994|s2cid=232422414|issn=0003-0554}}</ref> but he found it difficult to publicly endorse the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's right-to-vote movement]] because leaders of the [[suffragism]] movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice.<ref>Lewis, pp. 272–273.</ref> A 1913 ''Crisis'' editorial broached the taboo subject of [[interracial marriage]]: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote "[[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|[anti-miscegenation] laws]] leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women in the eyes of the law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her ... We must kill [anti-miscegenation laws] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, but because we are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone."<ref>Lewis, p. 275.</ref><ref>Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), ''Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954'', University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.</ref>

During 1915 − 1916, some leaders of the NAACP – disturbed by financial losses at ''The Crisis'', and worried about the inflammatory rhetoric of some of its essays – attempted to oust Du Bois from his editorial position. Du Bois and his supporters prevailed, and he continued in his role as editor.<ref>Lewis, pp. 312–324.</ref> In a 1919 column titled "The True Brownies", he announced the creation of ''[[The Brownies' Book]]'', the first magazine published for African-American children and youth, which he founded with [[Augustus Granville Dill]] and [[Jessie Redmon Fauset]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Children's Literature|series=Twayne's United States authors series|title=Once upon a time in Aframerica: The "peculiar" significance of fairies in the Brownies' Book|last=Kory|first=Fern|editor-last1=Lennox Keyser|editor-first1=Elizabeth|editor-last2=Pfeiffer|editor-first2=Julie|volume=29|pages=91–112|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-300-08891-5|issn=0092-8208}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance|title=Brownies' Book, The|last=Kommers Czarniecki|first=Kristin|editor-last1=Wintz|editor-first1=Cary D.|editor-last2=Finkelman|editor-first2=Paul|volume=1 (A–J)|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-1-57958-389-7|page=196|lccn=2004016353}}</ref>

===Historian and author===
The 1910s were a productive time for Du Bois. In 1911, he attended the [[First Universal Races Congress]] in London<ref>Lewis, pp. 290–291.</ref> and he published his first novel, ''The Quest of the Silver Fleece.''<ref>Lewis, pp. 293–296.</ref> Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, ''[[The Star of Ethiopia]]''.<ref name="Lewis301">Lewis, p. 301.</ref> In 1915, Du Bois published ''[[The Negro]]'', a general history of black Africans, and the first of its kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. ''The Negro'' predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.<ref>Lewis, p. 303.</ref>

In 1915, ''The Atlantic Monthly'' carried a Du Bois essay, "The African Roots of the War", which consolidated his ideas on capitalism and race.<ref>Brown, Nikki, "World War I", in Young, pp. 224–226.</ref> He argued that the [[scramble for Africa]] was at the root of World War I. He also anticipated later Communist doctrine, by suggesting that wealthy capitalists had pacified white workers by giving them just enough wealth to prevent them from revolting, and by threatening them with competition by the lower-cost labor of colored workers.<ref>Lewis, pp. 327–328.</ref>

===Combating racism===
[[File:Jesse Washington hanging.jpg|thumb|Du Bois included photographs of the [[lynching of Jesse Washington]] in the June 1916 issue of ''The Crisis''.<ref name="Lewis335">Lewis, p. 335.</ref>]]
Du Bois used his influential NAACP position to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led the fight to ban the movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful.<ref>Watts, Trent, "The Birth of a Nation", in Young, p. 28.</ref> The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film's fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.<ref>Lewis, p. 331.</ref>

The private sector was not the only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in government jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry.<ref>Lewis, p. 332.</ref> Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about the President's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.<ref>Lewis, p. 335 (editorial), p. 334 (Trotter).</ref>

''The Crisis'' continued to wage a campaign against lynching. In 1915, it published an article with a year-by-year tabulation of 2,732 lynchings from 1884 to 1914.<ref>Lewis, p. 335 ("The Lynching Industry" was in the Feb 1915 issue).<br />See also the July 1916 article: "The Waco Horror" [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf at Brown University library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227153035/http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf|date=27 December 2013|format=PDF}} or [https://books.google.com/books?id=KloEAAAAMBAJ&pg at Google Books]</ref> The April 1916 edition covered the group lynching of six African Americans in [[Lee County, Georgia]].<ref name="Lewis335"/> Later in 1916, the "Waco Horror" article covered the [[lynching of Jesse Washington]], a mentally impaired 17-year-old African American.<ref name="Lewis335"/> The article broke new ground by utilizing undercover reporting to expose the conduct of local whites in [[Waco, Texas]].<ref>Lewis, p. 336.</ref>

The early 20th century was the era of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West. Du Bois wrote an editorial supporting the Great Migration, because he felt it would help blacks escape Southern racism, find economic opportunities, and assimilate into American society.<ref>Lewis, pp. 357–358. See, for example, Du Bois's editorial in the October 1916 edition of ''The Crisis''.</ref>

Also in the 1910s the [[Eugenics in the United States|American eugenics movement]] was in its infancy, and many leading eugenicists were openly racist, defining Blacks as "a lower race". Du Bois opposed this view as an unscientific aberration, but still maintained the basic principle of eugenics: that different persons have different inborn characteristics that make them more or less suited for specific kinds of employment, and that by encouraging the most talented members of all races to procreate would better the "stocks" of humanity.<ref>Lombardo, Paul A.

===World War I===
As the United States prepared to enter [[World War I]] in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, [[Joel Elias Spingarn|Joel Spingarn]], established a camp to train African Americans to serve as officers in the United States military.<ref>Lewis, p. 346.</ref> The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war.<ref>Lewis, pp. 346–347.</ref> Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, [[Charles Young (United States Army)|Charles Young]], on a pretense of ill health.<ref>Lewis, p. 348.</ref> The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks who came from the camp.<ref>Lewis, p. 349.</ref> Over 700,000 blacks enlisted on the first day of the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.<ref>Lewis, p. 348 (draft), 349 (racism).</ref>
[[File:1917 Silent Parade men H.tiff|alt=Hundreds of African Americans peacefully parading down 5th avenue in New York, holding signs of protest|thumb|Du Bois organized the 1917 [[Silent Parade]] in New York, to protest the [[East St. Louis riots]].]]
After the [[East St. Louis riots]] occurred in the summer of 1917, Du Bois traveled to St. Louis to report on the riots. Between 40 and 250 African Americans were massacred by whites, primarily due to resentment caused by St. Louis industry hiring blacks to replace striking white workers.<ref>Lewis, p. 350.</ref> Du Bois's reporting resulted in an article "The Massacre of East St. Louis", published in the September issue of ''The Crisis,'' which contained photographs and interviews detailing the violence.<ref>Lewis, p. 352.</ref> Historian [[David Levering Lewis]] concluded that Du Bois distorted some of the facts in order to increase the propaganda value of the article.<ref>Lewis, p. 353.</ref> To publicly demonstrate the black community's outrage over the riots, Du Bois organized the [[Silent Parade]], a march of around 9,000 African Americans down New York City's [[Fifth Avenue]], the first parade of its kind in New York, and the second instance of blacks publicly demonstrating for civil rights.<ref>King, William, "Silent Protest Against Lynching", in Young, p. 191.<br />Lewis, p. 352.<br />The first was picketing against ''The Birth of a Nation''.</ref>

The [[Houston riot of 1917]] disturbed Du Bois and was a major setback to efforts to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers took to the streets of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned.<ref>Lewis, p. 354.</ref> In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.<ref>Lewis, p. 355; p. 384: about 1,000 black officers served during World War I.</ref>

Federal officials, concerned about subversive viewpoints expressed by NAACP leaders, attempted to frighten the NAACP by threatening it with investigations. Du Bois was not intimidated, and in 1918 he predicted that World War I would lead to an overthrow of the European colonial system and to the "liberation" of colored people worldwide – in China, in India, and especially in America.<ref>Lewis, p. 359.</ref> NAACP chairman Joel Spingarn was enthusiastic about the war, and he persuaded Du Bois to consider an officer's commission in the Army, contingent on Du Bois writing an editorial repudiating his anti-war stance.<ref>Lewis, p. 362.</ref> Du Bois accepted this bargain and wrote the pro-war "Close Ranks" editorial in June 1918<ref>The column was published in July, but written in June.</ref> and soon thereafter he received a commission in the Army.<ref>Lewis, p. 363. The offer was for a role in Military Intelligence.</ref> Many black leaders, who wanted to leverage the war to gain civil rights for African Americans, criticized Du Bois for his sudden reversal.<ref>Lewis, pp. 363–364.</ref> Southern officers in Du Bois's unit objected to his presence, and his commission was withdrawn.<ref>Lewis, p. 366. The commission was withdrawn before Du Bois could begin actual military service.</ref>

===After the war===
[[File:ChicagoRaceRiot 1919 wagon.png|thumb|alt=An African-American family moves out of a house with broken windows.|Du Bois documented the 1919 [[Red Summer]] race riots. This family is evacuating their house after it was vandalized in the [[Chicago race riot of 1919|Chicago race riot]].]]

When the war ended, Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1919 to attend the first [[Pan-African Congress]] and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I.<ref>Lewis, pp. 367–368. The book, ''The Black Man and the Wounded World'', was never published. Other authors covered the topic, such as Emmett Scott's ''Official History of the American Negro in the World War'' (1920).</ref> He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities.<ref>Lewis, pp. 371, 373.</ref> Du Bois discovered that the vast majority of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as [[stevedore]]s and laborers.<ref>Lewis, p. 368.</ref> Some units were armed, and one in particular, the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Division]] (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat.<ref>Lewis, p. 369.</ref> Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.<ref>Lewis, p. 376.</ref>

Du Bois returned from Europe more determined than ever to gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers returning from overseas felt a new sense of power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the [[New Negro]].<ref>Lewis, p. 381.</ref> In the editorial "Returning Soldiers" he wrote: "But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land."<ref>Du Bois quoted in Williams, Chad (2010), ''Torchbearers of Democracy: African American Soldiers in the World War I Era'', UNC Press Books, p. 207.</ref>

[[Great Migration (African American)|Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work]], and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the [[Red Summer of 1919]], a horrific series of [[race riots]] across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities.<ref name="Lewis, p. 383">Lewis, p. 383.</ref> Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of ''The Crisis'', culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a [[Omaha race riot of 1919|lynching that occurred during a race riot in Omaha, Nebraska]].<ref name="Lewis, p. 383"/>

The most egregious episode during the Red Summer was a [[Elaine Race Riot|vicious attack on blacks]] in [[Elaine, Arkansas]], in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered.<ref>Lewis, p. 389.</ref> Reports coming out of the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois published a letter in the ''[[New York World]]'', claiming that the only crime the black [[sharecropper]]s had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.<ref>Lewis, p. 389. The sharecroppers were working with the [[Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America]].</ref>

Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as ''[[Moore v. Dempsey]]''.<ref>Lewis, pp. 389–390.</ref> Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]].<ref name="Lewis301"/> Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] guarantee of [[due process]] to prevent states from shielding mob violence.<ref>Lewis, p. 391.</ref>

[[File:Darkwater.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|''[[Darkwater: Voices from Within the Veil]]'', first edition cover, 1920]]

In 1920, Du Bois published ''[[Darkwater: Voices From Within the Veil]]'', the first of his three autobiographies.<ref>Lewis, p. 391. The other two would be ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'' and ''The Autobiography of W. E. Burghardt Du Bois''.</ref> The "veil" was that which covered colored people around the world. In the book, he hoped to lift the veil and show white readers what life was like behind the veil, and how it distorted the viewpoints of those looking through it – in both directions.<ref>Lewis, p. 394.</ref> The book contained Du Bois's feminist essay, "The Damnation of Women", which was a tribute to the dignity and worth of women, particularly black women.<ref>Lewis, p. 392 (characterizes as "feminist").</ref>

Concerned that textbooks used by African-American children ignored black history and culture, Du Bois created a monthly children's magazine, ''The Brownies' Book''. Initially published in 1920, it was aimed at black children, who Du Bois called "the children of the sun".<ref>Lewis, pp. 405–406.<br />The publication lasted two years, from January 1920 to December 1921.<br />[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbc3&fileName=rbc0001_2004ser01351page.db Online at Library of Congress] (retrieved November 20, 2011).</ref>

===Pan-Africanism and Marcus Garvey===
Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1921 to attend the second Pan-African Congress.<ref>Lewis, p. 409.</ref> The assembled black leaders from around the world issued the ''London Resolutions'' and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled ''by'' Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the ''consent'' of Africans).<ref>Lewis, p. 414.</ref> Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his ''Manifesto To the League of Nations'', which implored the newly formed [[League of Nations]] to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.<ref>Lewis, p. 415.</ref>

Another important African-American leader of the 1920s was [[Marcus Garvey]], promoter of the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] and founder of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA).<ref>Lewis, pp. 416–424.</ref> Garvey denounced Du Bois's efforts to achieve equality through integration, and instead endorsed racial separatism.<ref>Lewis, pp. 426–427.</ref> Du Bois initially supported the concept of Garvey's [[Black Star Line]], a shipping company that was intended to facilitate commerce within the African diaspora.<ref>Du Bois, [http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5121 "The Black Star Line"], ''Crisis'', September 1922, pp. 210–214. Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref> But Du Bois later became concerned that Garvey was threatening the NAACP's efforts, leading Du Bois to describe him as fraudulent and reckless.<ref>Lewis, p. 428.</ref> Responding to Garvey's slogan "Africa for the Africans", Du Bois said that he supported that concept, but denounced Garvey's intention that Africa be ruled by African Americans.<ref>Lewis, p. 429.</ref>

Du Bois wrote a series of articles in ''The Crisis'' between 1922 and 1924 attacking Garvey's movement, calling him the "most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and the world."<ref>Lewis, p. 465.</ref> Du Bois and Garvey never made a serious attempt to collaborate, and their dispute was partly rooted in the desire of their respective organizations (NAACP and UNIA) to capture a larger portion of the available philanthropic funding.<ref>Lewis, pp. 467–468.</ref>

Du Bois decried Harvard's decision to ban blacks from its dormitories in 1921 as an instance of a broad effort in the U.S. to renew "the Anglo-Saxon cult; the worship of the Nordic totem, the disfranchisement of Negro, Jew, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiatic and South Sea Islander – the world rule of Nordic white through brute force."<ref>Lewis, pp. 435–437. Quoted (from ''The Crisis'', August 1911) by Lewis.</ref> When Du Bois sailed for Europe in 1923 for the third Pan-African Congress, the circulation of ''The Crisis'' had declined to 60,000 from its World War I high of 100,000, but it remained the preeminent periodical of the civil rights movement.<ref>Lewis, p. 442.</ref> [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]] designated Du Bois an "Envoy Extraordinary" to Liberia<ref>Lewis, pp. 448–449.</ref> and – after the third congress concluded – Du Bois rode a German freighter from the Canary Islands to Africa, visiting [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Senegal]].<ref>Lewis, pp. 450–463.</ref>

===Harlem Renaissance===
[[File:W. E. B. Du Bois - The Gift of Black Folk.pdf|thumb|Du Bois's 1924 work ''The Gift of Black Folk'' celebrated the unique contributions of African-Americans in building the United States.]]
Du Bois frequently promoted African-American artistic creativity in his writings, and when the [[Harlem Renaissance]] emerged in the mid-1920s, his article "A Negro Art Renaissance" celebrated the end of the long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors.<ref>Lewis, p. 471 (frequent).<br />Horne, Malika, "Art and Artists", in Young, pp. 13–15.<br />Lewis, p. 475 (article).</ref> His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to believe that many whites visited Harlem for voyeurism, not for genuine appreciation of black art.<ref>Hamilton, Neil (2002), ''American Social Leaders and Activists'', Infobase Publishing, p. 121. {{ISBN| 9780816045358}}.<br />Lewis, p. 480.</ref> Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that "a black artist is first of all a ''black'' artist."<ref>Du Bois, January 1946, quoted by Horne, Malika, "Art and Artists", in Young, pp. 13–15. Emphasis is in Du Bois's original.</ref> He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying "I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda."<ref>Lewis, p. 481.</ref> By the end of 1926, he stopped employing ''The Crisis'' to support the arts.<ref>Lewis, pp. 485, 487.</ref>

===Debate with Lothrop Stoddard===
In 1929, a debate organised by the Chicago Forum Council billed as "One of the greatest debates ever held" was held between Du Bois and [[Lothrop Stoddard]], a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], proponent of eugenics and so−called scientific racism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b160-i451|title=One of the greatest debates ever held, 1929|website=credo.library.umass.edu|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref><ref name="Frazier">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/26/when-w-e-b-du-bois-made-a-laughingstock-of-a-white-supremacist|title=When W.

Du Bois knew that the racists would be unintentionally funny onstage; as he wrote to Moore, Senator Heflin "would be a scream" in a debate. Du Bois let the overconfident and bombastic Stoddard walk into a comic moment, which Stoddard then made even funnier by not getting the joke. This moment was captured in headlines "DuBois Shatters Stoddard’s Cultural Theories in Debate; Thousands Jam Hall . . . Cheered As He Proves Race Equality," the ''Defender’s'' front-page headline ran. "5,000 Cheer W.E.B. DuBois, Laugh at Lothrop Stoddard."<ref name="Frazier"/> Ian Frazier of the ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' writes that the comic potential of Stoddard's bankrupt ideas was left untapped until [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.<ref name="Frazier"/>

===Socialism===
{{American socialism|Theorists}}
When Du Bois became editor of ''The Crisis'' magazine in 1911, he joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] on the advice of NAACP founders [[Mary Ovington]], [[William English Walling]] and [[Charles Edward Russell]]. However, he supported the Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the 1912 presidential campaign, a breach of the rules, and was forced to resign from the Socialist Party. In 1913, his support for Wilson was shaken when racial segregation in government hiring was reported.<ref name="DuBois1973">{{Cite journal|last1=Du Bois|first1=W. E.

Nine years after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Du Bois extended a trip to Europe to include a visit to the [[Soviet Union]], where he was struck by the poverty and disorganization he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers.<ref>Lewis, p. 486.</ref> Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of [[Karl Marx]] or [[Vladimir Lenin]], he concluded that [[socialism]] might be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.<ref>Lewis, p. 487.</ref>

Although Du Bois generally endorsed socialist principles, his politics were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, he endorsed Democrat [[Jimmy Walker]] for mayor of New York, rather than the socialist [[Norman Thomas]], believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas's platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views.<ref>Lewis, pp. 498–499.</ref> Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support back and forth between the Republican Party and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.<ref>Lewis, pp. 498–507.</ref>

A rivalry emerged in 1931 between the NAACP and the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], when the Communists responded quickly and effectively to support the [[Scottsboro Boys]], nine African-American youth arrested in 1931 in Alabama for rape.<ref>Balaji, Murali (2007), ''The Professor and the Pupil: The Politics and Friendship of W. E. B. Du Bois and Paul Robeson'', Nation Books, pp. 70–71.</ref> Du Bois and the NAACP felt that the case would not be beneficial to their cause, so they chose to let the Communist Party [[Scottsboro Boys#Help from Communist Party and NAACP|organize the defense efforts]].<ref>Lewis, p. 513.</ref> Du Bois was impressed with the vast amount of publicity and funds which the Communists devoted to the partially successful defense effort, and he came to suspect that the Communists were attempting to present their party to African Americans as a better solution than the NAACP.<ref>Lewis, p. 514.</ref>

Responding to criticisms of the NAACP from the Communist Party, Du Bois wrote articles condemning the party, claiming that it unfairly attacked the NAACP, and that it failed to fully appreciate racism in the United States. In their turn, the Communist leaders accused him of being a "class enemy", and claimed that the NAACP leadership was an isolated elite, disconnected from the working-class blacks they ostensibly fought for.<ref>Lewis, p. 517.</ref>

==Return to Atlanta==
Du Bois did not have a good working relationship with [[Walter Francis White]], president of the NAACP since 1931.<ref>Horne, pp. 143–144.</ref><ref>Lewis, pp. 535, 547.</ref> That conflict, combined with the financial stresses of the [[Great Depression]], precipitated a power struggle over ''The Crisis''.<ref>Lewis, p. 544.</ref> Du Bois, concerned that his position as editor would be eliminated, resigned his job at ''The Crisis'' and accepted an academic position at Atlanta University in early 1933.<ref>Lewis, p. 545.</ref> The rift with the NAACP grew larger in 1934 when Du Bois reversed his stance on segregation, stating that "[[separate but equal]]" was an acceptable goal for African Americans.<ref>Lewis, pp. 569–570.</ref> The NAACP leadership was stunned, and asked Du Bois to retract his statement, but he refused, and the dispute led to Du Bois's resignation from the NAACP.<ref>Lewis, p. 573.</ref>

After arriving at his new professorship in Atlanta, Du Bois wrote a series of articles generally supportive of [[Marxism]]. He was not a strong proponent of [[labor union]]s or the Communist Party, but he felt that Marx's scientific explanation of society and the economy were useful for explaining the situation of African Americans in the United States.<ref>Lewis, p. 549.</ref> [[Marxism and religion|Marx's atheism]] also struck a chord with Du Bois, who routinely criticized black churches for dulling blacks' sensitivity to racism.<ref>Lewis, pp. 549–550. Lewis states that Du Bois sometimes praised African-American ''spirituality'', but not clergy or churches.</ref> In his 1933 writings, Du Bois embraced socialism, but asserted that "[c]olored labor has no common ground with white labor", a controversial position that was rooted in Du Bois's dislike of American labor unions, which had systematically excluded blacks for decades.<ref>King, Richard H. (2004), ''Race, Culture, and the Intellectuals, 1940–1970'', Woodrow Wilson Center Press, pp. 43–44.</ref><ref>Lewis, p. 551.</ref> Du Bois did not support the Communist Party in the U.S. and did not vote for their candidate in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]], in spite of an African American on their [[Ticket (election)|ticket]].<ref>Lewis, p. 553. The person on the ticket was [[James W. Ford]], running for vice president.</ref>

===''Black Reconstruction in America''===
{{main| Black Reconstruction in America}}
[[File:BlackReconstruction.JPG|thumb|150px|''[[Black Reconstruction in America]]'', first edition cover, 1935]]

Back in the world of academia, Du Bois was able to resume his study of Reconstruction, the topic of the 1910 paper that he presented to the American Historical Association.<ref>Lemert, Charles C. (2002), ''Dark thoughts: race and the eclipse of society'', Psychology Press, pp. 227–229.</ref> In 1935, he published his magnum opus, ''Black Reconstruction in America''.<ref>Lewis, pp. 576–583.</ref><ref>Aptheker, Herbert (1989), ''The literary legacy of W. E. B. Du Bois'', Kraus International Publications, p. 211 (Du Bois called the work his "magnum opus").</ref> The book presented the thesis, in the words of the historian David Levering Lewis, that "black people, suddenly admitted to citizenship in an environment of feral hostility, displayed admirable volition and intelligence as well as the indolence and ignorance inherent in three centuries of bondage."<ref>Lewis, p. 586.</ref>

Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians. He provided evidence that the coalition governments established public education in the South, and many needed social service programs. The book also demonstrated the ways in which [[Emancipation Proclamation|black emancipation]] – the crux of Reconstruction – promoted a radical restructuring of United States society, as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for [[civil rights]] for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction.<ref>Lewis, pp. 583–586.</ref>

The book's thesis ran counter to the [[Dunning School|orthodox interpretation of Reconstruction]] maintained by white historians, and the book was virtually ignored by mainstream historians until the 1960s.<ref>Lewis, pp. 585–590 (thorough), pp. 583, 593 (ignored).</ref> Thereafter, however, it ignited a "revisionist" trend in the historiography of Reconstruction, which emphasized black people's search for freedom and the era's radical policy changes.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2701820|issn=0048-7511|volume=10|issue=4|pages=82–100 [83]|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction Revisited|journal=Reviews in American History|date=1 December 1982|jstor=2701820}}</ref><ref>"During the civil rights era, however, it became apparent that Du Bois's scholarship, despite some limitations, had been ahead of its time." {{cite book|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-59884-021-6|last=Campbell|first=James M.|author2=Rebecca J.

In the final chapter of the book, "XIV. The Propaganda of History", Du Bois evokes his efforts at writing an article for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' on the "history of the American Negro". After the editors had cut all reference to Reconstruction, he insisted that the following note appear in the entry: "White historians have ascribed the faults and failures of Reconstruction to Negro ignorance and corruption. But the Negro insists that it was Negro loyalty and the Negro vote alone that restored the South to the Union; established the new democracy, both for white and black, and instituted the public schools." The editors refused and, so, Du Bois withdrew his article.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Du Bois|first1=W. E.

===Projected encyclopedia===
In 1932, Du Bois was selected by several philanthropies, including the [[Phelps-Stokes Fund]], the [[Carnegie Corporation]], and the [[General Education Board]], to be the managing editor for a proposed ''Encyclopedia of the Negro'', a work which Du Bois had been contemplating for 30 years.<ref>Lewis, pp. 611, 618.</ref> After several years of planning and organizing, the philanthropies canceled the project in 1938 because some board members believed that Du Bois was too biased to produce an objective encyclopedia.<ref>Braley, Mark, "Encyclopedia Projects", in Young, pp. 73–78. Braley summarizes Du Bois's lifelong quest to create an encyclopedia.</ref>

===Trip around the world===
Du Bois took a trip around the world in 1936, which included visits to [[Nazi Germany]], [[China]] and [[Japan]].<ref name="Lewis, p. 600">Lewis, p. 600.</ref> While in Germany, Du Bois remarked that he was treated with warmth and respect.<ref name="Lewis, p. 600"/><ref>Zacharasiewicz, Waldemar (2007), ''Images of Germany in American literature'', University of Iowa Press, p. 120.</ref> After his return to the United States, he expressed his ambivalence about the Nazi regime.<ref>Fikes, Robert, "Germany", in Young, pp. 87–89.</ref><ref>Broderick, Francis (1959), ''W. E. B. Du Bois: Negro Leader in a Time of Crisis'', Stanford University Press, p. 192.</ref> He admired how the Nazis had improved the [[The Great Depression in Germany|German economy]], but he was horrified by their [[Nuremberg Laws|treatment]] of the [[Jewish people]], which he described as "an attack on civilization, comparable only to such horrors as the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and the African slave trade."<ref>Jefferson, Alphine, "Antisemitism", in Young, p. 10.</ref><ref>Du Bois quoted by Lewis, David (1995), ''W. E. B. Du Bois: A Reader'', p. 81.</ref><ref>Original Du Bois source: ''Pittsburgh Courier'', December 19, 1936.</ref>

Following the 1905 Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Du Bois became impressed by the growing strength of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]. He came to view the ascendant Japanese Empire as an antidote to Western imperialism, arguing over for over three decades after the war that its rise represented a chance to break the monopoly that white nations had on international affairs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kearney|first1=Reginald|title=The Pro-Japanese Utterances of W.E.B.

In 1936, the Japanese ambassador arranged a trip to Japan for Du Bois and a small group of [[Academy|academics]], visiting China, Japan, and [[Manchukuo]] (Manchuria).<ref>

===World War II===
[[File:DuskOfDawn.jpg|thumb|120px|''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', first edition cover, 1940]]
Du Bois opposed the US intervention in [[World War II]], particularly in the Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia.<ref>Lewis, pp. 631–632.</ref> He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and there were to be no African-American combat units – virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.<ref>Lewis, p. 633. The military later changed its policy, and units such as the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] saw combat.</ref> With blacks threatening to shift their support to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Republican opponent in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.<ref>Lewis, p. 634.</ref>

''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois's second autobiography, was published in 1940.<ref>Horne, p. 144.</ref> The title refers to his hope that African Americans were passing out of the darkness of racism into an era of greater equality.<ref>Lewis, p. 637.</ref> The work is part autobiography, part history, and part sociological treatise.<ref>Mostern, Kenneth, "Dusk of Dawn", in Young, pp. 65–66.</ref> Du Bois described the book as "the autobiography of a concept of race ... elucidated and magnified and doubtless distorted in the thoughts and deeds which were mine ... Thus for all time my life is significant for all lives of men."<ref>Du Bois quoted by Lewis, p. 637.</ref>

In 1943, at age 75, Du Bois was abruptly fired from his position at Atlanta University by college president [[Rufus Clement]].<ref>Lewis, pp. 643–644.</ref> Many scholars expressed outrage, prompting Atlanta University to provide Du Bois with a lifelong pension and the title of professor [[emeritus]].<ref>Lewis, p. 644.</ref> [[Arthur B. Spingarn|Arthur Spingarn]] remarked that Du Bois spent his time in Atlanta "battering his life out against ignorance, bigotry, intolerance and slothfulness, projecting ideas nobody but he understands, and raising hopes for change which may be comprehended in a hundred years."<ref>Spingarn, quoted by Lewis, p. 645.</ref>

Turning down job offers from [[Fisk University|Fisk]] and [[Howard University|Howard]], Du Bois re-joined the NAACP as director of the Department of Special Research. Surprising many NAACP leaders, Du Bois jumped into the job with vigor and determination.<ref>Lewis, p. 648.</ref> During his 10−years hiatus, the NAACP's income had increased fourfold, and its membership had soared to 325,000 members.<ref>Lewis, p. 647.</ref>

==Later life==
[[File:WEB Du Bois 1946.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A portrait of an elderly African American man|right|Du Bois in 1946, photo by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]

===United Nations===
Du Bois was a member of the three-person delegation from the NAACP that attended the 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|conference in San Francisco]] at which the [[United Nations]] was established.<ref>Lewis, p. 654.</ref> The NAACP delegation wanted the United Nations to endorse racial equality and to bring an end to the colonial era. To push the United Nations in that direction, Du Bois drafted a proposal that pronounced "[t]he colonial system of government ... is undemocratic, socially dangerous and a main cause of wars".<ref>Lewis, p. 656.</ref> The NAACP proposal received support from China, India, and the Soviet Union, but it was virtually ignored by the other major powers, and the NAACP proposals were not included in the final United Nations charter.<ref>Lewis, pp. 655, 657.</ref>

After the United Nations conference, Du Bois published ''Color and Democracy: Colonies and Peace'', a book that attacked colonial empires and, in the words of one reviewer, "contains enough dynamite to blow up the whole vicious system whereby we have comforted our white souls and lined the pockets of generations of free-booting capitalists."<ref>Overstreet, H. A., ''Saturday Review'', quoted in Lewis, p. 657.</ref>

In late 1945, Du Bois attended the fifth, and final, Pan-African Congress, in [[Manchester, England]]. The congress was the most productive of the five congresses, and there Du Bois met [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the future first president of [[Ghana]], who would later invite him to Africa.<ref>Lewis, p. 661.</ref>

Du Bois helped to submit petitions to the UN concerning discrimination against African Americans, the most noteworthy of which was the NAACP's "An Appeal to the World: A Statement on the Denial of Human Rights to Minorities in the Case of Citizens of Negro Descent in the United States of America and an Appeal to the United Nations for Redress".<ref>[[iarchive:Appeal-To-World-NAACP-1947|"A Statement on the Denial of Human Rights to Minorities in the Case of citizens of Negro Descent in the United States of America and an Appeal to the United Nations for Redress"]], National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), 1947; [http://www.blackpast.org/1947-w-e-b-dubois-appeal-world-statement-denial-human-rights-minorities-case-citizens-n "(1947) W.E.B.

Edited by W. E. B.

===Cold War===
When the [[Cold War]] commenced in the mid-1940s, the NAACP distanced itself from Communists, lest its funding or reputation suffer.<ref>Lewis, p. 663.</ref> The NAACP redoubled its efforts in 1947 after ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a piece by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] claiming that the NAACP was heavily influenced by Communists.<ref name="Lewis669"/> Ignoring the NAACP's desires, Du Bois continued to fraternize with communist sympathizers such as [[Paul Robeson]], [[Howard Fast]] and [[Shirley Graham]] (his future second wife).<ref name=Lewis670>Lewis, p. 670.</ref> Du Bois wrote "I am not a communist ... On the other hand, I ... believe ... that Karl Marx ... put his finger squarely upon our difficulties ...".<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', quoted by Hancock, "Socialism/Communism", in Young, p. 196. Quote is from 1940.</ref>

In 1946, Du Bois wrote articles giving his assessment of the Soviet Union; he did not embrace communism and he criticized its dictatorship.<ref name="Lewis669">Lewis, p. 669.</ref> However, he felt that capitalism was responsible for poverty and racism, and felt that socialism was an alternative that might ameliorate those problems.<ref name="Lewis669"/> The Soviets explicitly rejected racial distinctions and class distinctions, leading Du Bois to conclude that the USSR was the "most hopeful country on earth".<ref>Lewis, p. 669. Du Bois quoted by Lewis.</ref>

Du Bois's association with prominent communists made him a liability for the NAACP, especially since the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was starting to aggressively investigate communist sympathizers; so – by mutual agreement – he resigned from the NAACP for the second time in late 1948.<ref>Lewis, pp. 681–682.</ref> After departing the NAACP, Du Bois started writing regularly for the leftist weekly newspaper the ''[[National Guardian]]'', a relationship that would endure until 1961.<ref>Lewis, p. 683.</ref>

===Peace activism===
Du Bois was a lifelong [[anti-war activist]], but his efforts became more pronounced after World War II.<ref name="Schneider163">Schneider, Paul, "Peace Movement", in Young, p. 163. In his college days, Du Bois vowed to never take up arms.</ref> In 1949, Du Bois spoke at the [[Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace]] in New York: "I tell you, people of America, the dark world is on the move! It wants and will have Freedom, Autonomy and Equality. It will not be diverted in these fundamental rights by dialectical splitting of political hairs ... Whites may, if they will, arm themselves for suicide. But the vast majority of the world's peoples will march on over them to freedom!"<ref>Lewis, p. 685.</ref>

In the spring of 1949, he spoke at the [[World Congress of the Partisans of Peace#Paris and Prague 1949|World Congress of the Partisans of Peace]] in Paris, saying to the large crowd: "Leading this new colonial imperialism comes my own native land built by my father's toil and blood, the United States. The United States is a great nation; rich by grace of God and prosperous by the hard work of its humblest citizens ... Drunk with power we are leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery which once ruined us; and to a third World War which will ruin the world."<ref>Lewis, pp. 685–687.</ref>
Du Bois affiliated himself with a leftist organization, the [[National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions]], and he traveled to Moscow as its representative to speak at the [[All-Soviet Peace Conference]] in late 1949.<ref>Lewis, p. 687.</ref>

===The FBI, McCarthyism, and trial===
[[File:WEB Du Bois PIC hearing reduced Resolution.jpg|thumb|alt=Five persons stand in heavy overcoats in front of an imposing federal building|Du Bois (''center'') and other defendants from the [[Peace Information Center]] prepare for their trial in 1951.<ref>Lewis, p. 691.</ref>]]
During the 1950s, the U.S. government's anti-communist [[McCarthyism]] campaign targeted Du Bois because of his socialist leanings.<ref>Marable, p. xx.</ref> Historian [[Manning Marable]] characterizes the government's treatment of Du Bois as "ruthless repression" and a "political assassination".<ref>Marable, p xx . ("ruthless repression").<br />Marable, Manning (1991), ''Race, Reform, and Rebellion: The Second Reconstruction in Black America, 1945–1990'', University Press of Mississippi, p. 104 ("political assassination").

In 1950 he became chair of the newly created [[Peace Information Center]] (PIC), which worked to publicize the [[Stockholm Peace Appeal]] in the United States.<ref>Lewis, p. 688.</ref> The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.<ref>Lewis, p. 689.</ref>

Even though Du Bois was not convicted, the government confiscated Du Bois's passport and withheld it for eight years.<ref>Lewis, pp. 696, 707. Du Bois refused to sign a non-Communist affidavit that would enable him to regain his passport.</ref>

===Communism===
Du Bois was bitterly disappointed that many of his colleagues{{spaced ndash}}particularly the NAACP{{spaced ndash}}did not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically.<ref>Hancock, Ange-Marie, "Socialism/Communism", in Young, p. 197. The NAACP had a [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]] for cases like Du Bois's, but they chose not to support Du Bois.</ref> After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances.<ref>Lewis, p. 696.</ref> His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions such as the [[Korean War]], which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.<ref>Lewis, p. 697.</ref>

[[File:Du Bois with Mao Tse Tung 1959B.jpg|alt=Du Bois standing outdoors, talking with Mao Tse Tung|thumb|upright|Du Bois meets with [[Mao Zedong]] in China in 1959]]

In 1950, at the age of 82, Du Bois [[1950 New York state election|ran for U.S. Senator]] from New York on the [[American Labor Party]] ticket and received about 200,000 votes, or 4% of the statewide total.<ref>Lewis, pp. 690, 694, 695.</ref> He continued to believe that capitalism was the primary culprit responsible for the subjugation of colored people around the world, and although he recognized the faults of the Soviet Union, he continued to uphold Communism as a possible solution to racial problems. In the words of biographer David Lewis, Du Bois did not endorse Communism for its own sake, but did so because "the enemies of his enemies were his friends".<ref>Lewis, p. 698.</ref> The same ambiguity characterized his opinions of [[Joseph Stalin]]: in 1940 he wrote disdainfully of the "Tyrant Stalin",<ref>Porter, Eric (2012), ''The Problem of the Future World: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Race Concept at Midcentury''. Duke University Press, pp. 10, 71.</ref> but when Stalin died in 1953, Du Bois wrote a eulogy characterizing Stalin as "simple, calm, and courageous", and lauding him for being the "first [to] set Russia on the road to conquer race prejudice and make one nation out of its 140 groups without destroying their individuality".<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. "On Stalin", ''National Guardian'', March 16, 1953.</ref>

The U.S. government prevented Du Bois from attending the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]] in Indonesia. The conference was the culmination of 40 years of Du Bois's dreams – a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world's colored peoples. The conference celebrated those nations' independence as they began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War.<ref>Mostern, Kenneth (2001), "Bandung Conference", in Young, pp. 23–24.</ref>

Du Bois regained his passport in 1958, and with his second wife, [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]], he traveled around the world, visiting Russia and China. In both countries he was celebrated. Du Bois later wrote approvingly of the conditions in both countries.<ref>Lewis, pp. 701-06</ref>

Du Bois became incensed in 1961 when the [[Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board|U.S. Supreme Court upheld]] the 1950 [[McCarran Act]], a key piece of McCarthyism legislation which required Communists to register with the government. To demonstrate his outrage, he joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] in October 1961, at the age of 93.<ref>Lewis, p. 709.</ref> Around that time, he wrote: "I believe in Communism. I mean by Communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part."<ref>Du Bois (1968), ''Autobiography'', p. 57; quoted by Hancock, Ange-Marie, "Socialism/Communism", in Young, p. 197.</ref> He asked [[Herbert Aptheker]], a Communist and historian of African-American history, to be his literary executor.

===Death in Africa===
[[File:Du Bois 95th birthday in Ghana 1963.jpg|thumb|alt=An elderly, smiling Du Bois sits in a chair, flanked by a man and woman also seated and smiling.|Du Bois (''center'') at his 95th birthday party in 1963 in [[Ghana]], with President [[Kwame Nkrumah]] (''right'') and First Lady [[Fathia Nkrumah]]]]
Nkrumah invited Du Bois to Ghana to participate in their independence celebration in 1957, but he was unable to attend because the U.S. government had confiscated his passport in 1951. By 1960{{spaced ndash}}the "[[Year of Africa]]"{{spaced ndash}}Du Bois had recovered his passport, and was able to cross the Atlantic and celebrate the creation of the Republic of Ghana. Du Bois returned to Africa in late 1960 to attend the inauguration of [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] as the first African governor of [[Nigeria]].<ref name=Lewis707>Lewis, pp. 696, 707, 708.</ref>

While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois spoke with its president about the creation of a new encyclopedia of the [[African diaspora]], the ''[[Encyclopedia Africana]]''.<ref name=Lewis707/> In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited him to travel to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia.<ref>Lewis, pp. 709–711.</ref> In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana.<ref name="Lewis, p. 712">Lewis, p. 712.</ref>

==Personal life==
Du Bois was organized and disciplined: his lifelong regimen was to rise at 7:15, work until 5:00, eat dinner and read a newspaper until 7:00, then read or socialize until he was in bed, invariably before 10:00.<ref>Horne, p. 11.</ref><ref>Lewis, pp. 74, 231–232, 613.</ref> He was a meticulous planner, and frequently mapped out his schedules and goals on large pieces of graph paper.<ref>Lewis, p. 231.</ref> Many acquaintances found him to be distant and aloof, and he insisted on being addressed as "Dr. Du Bois".<ref>Lewis, pp. 54, 156 (aloof), p. 3 (address).</ref> Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as [[Charles Young (United States Army)|Charles Young]], [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]] and [[Mary White Ovington]].<ref>Lewis, p. 54 (gregarious), p. 124 (Young and Dunbar), p. 177 (Hope), pp. 213, 234 (Ovington).</ref>

His closest friend was [[Joel Elias Spingarn|Joel Spingarn]] – a white man – but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first-name basis.<ref>Lewis, pp. 316–324, 360–368 (Spingarn), p. 316 (best friend), p. 557 (first name basis).</ref> Du Bois was something of a [[dandy]] – he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity.<ref>Lewis, pp. 54, 156, 638.</ref> He was relatively short, standing at {{convert|5|ft|5.5|in|cm|0}}, and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee.<ref>Lewis, p. 54 (height).</ref> He enjoyed singing<ref>{{cite book|first=W.

Du Bois married Nina Gomer (b. about 1870, m. 1896, d. 1950), with whom he had two children. Their son Burghardt died as an infant before their second child, daughter [[Yolande Du Bois|Yolande]], was born.

She married again and had a daughter, Du Bois's only grandchild. That marriage also ended in divorce.

As a widower, Du Bois married [[Shirley Graham Du Bois|Shirley Graham]] (m. 1951, d. 1977), an author, playwright, composer, and activist. She brought her son David Graham to the marriage. David grew close to Du Bois and took his stepfather's name; he also worked for African-American causes.<ref>De Luca, Laura, "David Graham Du Bois", in Young, pp. 55–56.</ref> The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that Du Bois engaged in several extramarital relationships.<ref>Lingeman, Richard, [https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/05/reviews/001105.05lingemt.html "Soul on Fire"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 5, 2000. Retrieved December 2, 2011. A review of ''The Fight for Equality and the American Century, 1919–1963''.</ref>

===Religion===
Although Du Bois attended a New England [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational church]] as a child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College.<ref>Lewis, p. 55.</ref> As an adult, Du Bois described himself as [[agnostic]] or a [[freethought|freethinker]], but at least one biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an [[atheist]].<ref>Rabaka, p. 127 (freethinker); Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist); Johnson, passim (agnostic).</ref> However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era. Du Bois was credited with inaugurating a 20th-century spirituality to which [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], and [[James Baldwin]] also belong.<ref name=Kahn/>

When asked to lead public prayers, Du Bois would refuse.<ref>Lewis, p. 157; Johnson, p. 55.</ref> In his autobiography, Du Bois wrote:

{{blockquote|When I became head of a department at Atlanta, the engagement was held up because again I balked at leading in prayer ... I flatly refused again to join any church or sign any church creed. ... I think the greatest gift of the Soviet Union to modern civilization was the dethronement of the clergy and the refusal to let religion be taught in the public schools.<ref>''Autobiography'', p. 181. Quoted in Rabaka, p. 127.</ref>}}

Du Bois accused American churches of being the most discriminatory of all institutions.<ref>Horne, Malika, "Religion", in Young, p. 181.</ref> He also provocatively linked African-American Christianity to indigenous African religions.<ref>Chidester, David, "Religious Animals, Refuge of the Gods and the Spirit of Revolt: W. E. B. Du Bois's representations of Indigenous African Religions", in Mary Keller & Chester J. Fontenot Jr. (eds), ''Re-cognizing W. E. B. Du Bois in the Twenty-first century: Essays on W. E. B. Du Bois'' (Mercer University Press, 2007), p. 35. {{ISBN|978-0-88146-059-9}}</ref> He did occasionally acknowledge the beneficial role that religion played in African-American life – as the "basic rock" which served as an anchor for African-American communities – but in general disparaged African-American churches and clergy because he felt they did not support the goals of racial equality and hindered activists' efforts.<ref>Malika Horne, "Religion", in Young, pp. 181–182 ("basic rock"); Lewis, p. 550.</ref>

Although Du Bois was not personally religious, he infused his writings with religious symbology. Many contemporaries viewed him as a prophet.<ref>Blum, Edward J. (2009), ''The Souls of W. E. B. Du Bois: New Essays and Reflections'', Mercer University Press, pp. iii–xxi.</ref><ref>For additional analysis of Du Bois and religion, see Blum, Edward J. (2007), ''W. E. B. Du Bois, American Prophet'', University of Pennsylvania Press; and Kahn, Jonathon S. (2011), ''Divine Discontent: The Religious Imagination of W. E. B. Du Bois'', Oxford University Press.</ref> His 1904 [[prose poem]], "Credo", was written in the style of a religious [[creed]] and widely read by the African-American community.<ref>Lewis, pp. 212–213. "Credo" was reprinted in Du Bois's first autobiography ''[[Darkwater]]'' (1920) [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15210 (text available here)].</ref> Moreover, Du Bois, both in his own fiction and in stories published in ''The Crisis'', often drew analogies between the lynchings of African Americans and the [[crucifixion of Christ]].<ref>Kuhl, Michelle, "Resurrecting Black Manhood: W. E. B. Du Bois' Martyr Tales", in Blum & Young (eds), ''The Souls of W. E. B. Du Bois: New Essays and Reflections'' (Mercer University Press, 2009), p. 161. {{ISBN|978-0-88146-136-7}}</ref> Between 1920 and 1940, Du Bois shifted from overt black messiah symbolism to more subtle messianic language.<ref>Brunner, Marta, "The Most Hopeless of Deaths ... Is the Death of Faith: Messianic Faith in the Racial Politics of W. E. B. Du Bois", in Keller & Fontenot (2007), p. 189.</ref>

===Voting===
In 1889, Du Bois became eligible to vote at the age of 21. During his life he followed the philosophy of voting for third parties if the Democratic and Republican parties were unsatisfactory; or voting for the [[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser of two evils]] if a third option was not available.<ref name="voting">{{Cite news|date=February 7, 2002|title=I Won't Vote|work=The Nation|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/i-wont-vote/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200721034921/https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/i-wont-vote/|archive-date=July 21, 2020}}</ref>

During the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]], Du Bois supported Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic nominee, as he believed Wilson was a "liberal Southerner" although he had wanted to support [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]], but the Progressives ignored issues facing black people. He later regretted his decision, as he came to the conclusion that Wilson was opposed to racial equality.<ref name="DuBois1973"/><ref name="voting"/> During the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 presidential election]] he supported [[Charles Evans Hughes]], the Republican nominee, as he believed that Wilson was the greater evil. During the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]] he supported [[Warren G. Harding]], the Republican nominee, as Harding promised to end the [[United States occupation of Haiti]]. During the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]] he supported [[Robert M. La Follette]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|Progressive]] nominee, although he believed that La Follette couldn't win. During the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]] he believed that both [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Al Smith]] insulted black voters, and instead Du Bois supported Norman Thomas, the Socialist nominee.<ref name="voting"/>

From [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] to [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], Du Bois supported Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic nominee, as Roosevelt's attitude towards workers was more realistic. During the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]] he supported [[Henry A. Wallace]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] nominee, and supported the Progressives’ nominee, [[Vincent Hallinan]], again in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]].<ref name="voting"/>

During the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] Du Bois stated that he would not vote. He criticized the foreign, taxation, and crime policies of the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] and [[Adlai Stevenson II]] for promising to maintain those policies. However, he could not vote third party due to the lack of ballot access for the Socialist Party.<ref name="voting" />
