In a ceremony on 8 August 2012—held in the evening due to the daytime fast of [[Ramadan]]—the NTC formally transferred power to the [[General National Congress]].

==Aims and objectives==
{{further|Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration}}
The "Declaration of the founding of the National Transitional Council" stated that the main aims of the council were as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ntclibya.org/arabic/first-announcement/ |script-title=ar:إعلان تاسيس المجلس الوطني الانتقالي المؤقت &#124; الجمهورية الليبية - المجلس الوطني الانتقالي |language=ar |publisher=National Transitional Council |date=19 March 2011 |access-date=25 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314192350/http://ntclibya.org/arabic/first-announcement/ |archive-date=14 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

*Supervision of the Military Council to ensure the achievement of the new doctrine of the Libyan People's Army in the defense of the people and to protect the borders of Libya.

*Form a transitional government to pave the holding of free elections
*Guide the conduct of foreign policy, and the regulation of relations with other countries and international and regional organizations, and the representation of the Libyan people

In another statement clarifying the goals for a post-Gaddafi Libya, the council committed itself an eight-point plan to hold free and fair elections, draft a national constitution, form political and civil institutions, uphold intellectual and political pluralism, and guarantee citizens' inalienable human rights and the ability of free expression of their aspirations. The council also emphasized its rejection of racism, intolerance, discrimination, and terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/29/vision-democratic-libya-interim-national-council |title=A vision of a democratic Libya |date=29 March 2011 |work=The Guardian |access-date=8 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921211659/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/29/vision-democratic-libya-interim-national-council |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Documents/2011/3/29/2011329113923943811The%20Interim%20Transitional%20National%20Council%20Statement.pdf|title=A Vision of a Democratic Libya |date=29 March 2011 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |access-date=8 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106021050/http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Documents/2011/3/29/2011329113923943811The%20Interim%20Transitional%20National%20Council%20Statement.pdf |archive-date=6 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Article 1 further declares [[Tripoli]] the state capital and [[Standard Arabic|Arabic]] the official language while reserving the linguistic and cultural rights of ethnic minorities as well as the [[freedom of religion]] for religious minorities.

The GNC would then elect a prime minister, appoint a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution subject to its approval by the Public National Conference (PNC) and by referendum, and then oversee free elections for a representative government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/libya-constitution-idUSL5E7JV2CF20110831|work=Reuters|title=Libya's new rulers set out steps to elections|first=Robert|last=Birsel|date=31 August 2011|access-date=24 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122015132/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/31/libya-constitution-idUSL5E7JV2CF20110831|archive-date=22 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Armed forces==
{{main|National Liberation Army (Libya)|Free Libyan Air Force|Libyan National Army}}
The [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] were Libyan armed forces which were constituted during the 2011 war by defected military members and armed citizens in order to engage in battle against remaining members of the [[Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Jamahiriya's armed forces]], hired mercenaries and paramilitary loyal to the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. The [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|National Liberation Army]], formerly known as the Free Libyan Army, was the NTC's military arm, with the small [[Free Libyan Air Force]] operating assets including captured and defected fighter jets and helicopters.

[[Omar El-Hariri]] was the first military affairs minister the NTC named, holding that position from 23 March 2011 forward. By 19 May 2011, however, [[Jalal al-Digheily]] had replaced El-Hariri.<ref name="economist">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18713650?story_id=18713650&fsrc=rss|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 May 2011|access-date=6 August 2011|title=Libya: The Colonel Feels the Squeeze|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203203339/http://www.economist.com/node/18713650?story_id=18713650&fsrc=rss|archive-date=3 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Then on 8 August 2011, Digheily along with 14 other members of the executive board were fired and the position left vacant, but was reappointed in early October 2011 after continuing in the role of interim defense minister for almost two months.<ref name="newcab">{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011103124138235256.html|work=Al Jazeera|title=Jibril vows to quit after Libya 'liberation'|date=3 October 2011|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101163706/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011103124138235256.html|archive-date=1 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Then on 22 November 2011, the executive board was dissolved for the formation of the Interim Government and [[Osama al-Juwali]] became the new Defense Minister.

===Military intervention===<!-- Is this subsection currently needed or necessary? -->
{{Main|2011 military intervention in Libya}}
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] authorised a multi-national effort to establish a no-fly zone. On 19 March, British, French and US air forces began attacking targets in Gaddafi-controlled Libya, thereby initiating the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|UN military intervention]]. Operations were led by [[NATO]] under [[Operation Unified Protector]], after initially being led by a joint UK, US and French command. Non-NATO states such as [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] also contributed to the military mission.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
