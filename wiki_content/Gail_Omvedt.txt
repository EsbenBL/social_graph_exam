Omvedt's dissertation was titled ''Cultural Revolt in a Colonial Society: The Non-Brahman Movement in Western India, 1873-1930''.

Omvedt's academic writing includes numerous books and articles on class, caste and gender issues.

Omvedt was critical of the religious scriptures of Hinduism (or what she specifically regarded as "brahminism") for what she argued is their promotion of a caste-based society.

In addition to her criticism of their purported advocacy for the caste-system, Omvedt also dismissed the Hindu tradition of venerating the Vedas as holy. In a 2000 open letter published in ''[[The Hindu]]'' addressed to then-[[BJP]] President [[Bangaru Laxman]], she gave her perspective on the [[Rigveda]]:
<blockquote>
As for the Vedas, they are impressive books, especially the Rg Veda. I can only say this only from translations, but I am glad that the ban on women and shudras reading them has been broken, and that good translations by women and shudras themselves are available. But to take them as something holy? Read them for yourself! Most of the hymns are for success in war, cattle- stealing, love-making and the like. They celebrate conquest; the hymns about Indra and Vrtra sound suspiciously as if the Aryans were responsible for smashing dams built by the Indus valley people; though archeologists tell us there is no evidence for direct destruction by "Aryan invasion", the Rg Veda gives evidence of enmity between the Aryans and those they called dasyus, panis and the like.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Omvedt|first=Gail|date=2000-10-11|title=An open letter to Bangaru Laxman - II|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/an-open-letter-to-bangaru-laxman-ii/article28048040.ece|access-date=2021-08-28|issn=0971-751X|archive-date=28 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210828124423/https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/an-open-letter-to-bangaru-laxman-ii/article28048040.ece|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

Omvedt posits that [[Hindutva]] groups foster an [[ethnic]] definition of [[Hinduism]] based on geography, ancestry and heritage in order to create a solidarity amongst various castes, despite the prevalence of caste-based discrimination.<ref name="Omvedt-Hindu">Gail Omvedt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030402101911/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/02/25/stories/2003022500251000.htm Hindutva and ethnicity], ''The Hindu'', 25 February 2003  </ref>

Omvedt endorsed the stand taken by Dalit activists at the 2001 [[World Conference Against Racism]] that caste discrimination is similar to racism in regarding discriminated groups as "biologically inferior and socially dangerous".<ref name="Omvedt-Hindu" />

She called the United States a "racist country" and has advocated for [[affirmative action]]; however, she compared American positive-discrimination policies favorably to those of India, stating:
<blockquote>
It is a sad comment on the state of Indian industrialists' social consciousness that such discussions have begun in an organised way in the U.S. before they have been thought of in India itself.
<ref>Gail Omvedt, [https://archive.today/20120906110749/http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20030829&fname=Gail&sid=1 Mythologies of Merit], ''Outlook'', Aug 29, 2003 (requires registration)([http://www.countercurrents.org/dalit-omvedt290803.htm Convenience link])  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vF8ZE9oZ?url=http://www.countercurrents.org/dalit-omvedt290803.htm |date=25 December 2010 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
and, with respect to perceptions of "group performance", in the United States and India, Omvedt wrote:
<blockquote>
Whereas the U.S. debate assumes an overall equal distribution of capacity among social groups, in India the assumption seems to be that the unequal showing of different caste groups on examinations, in education, etc. is a result of actual different capacities.
</blockquote>

She on occasion supported big-dam projects<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.narmada.org/debates/gail/gail.open.letter.html |title=Gail Omvedt, Open Letter To Arundhathi Roy |access-date=27 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026041539/http://www.narmada.org/debates/gail/gail.open.letter.html |archive-date=26 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and GMO crops.<ref>Gail Omvedt, Burning Farmer's Fields (Part 1), The Hindu, 9 November 2010, [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108155602/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2001/11/09/stories/05092524.htm]</ref><ref>Gail Omvedt, Burning Farmer's Fields (Part 2), The Hindu, 10 November 2010, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030907225908/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2001/11/10/stories/05102524.htm]</ref>

==Controversy and criticism==

===Andre Beteille's criticism===
Omvedt's portrayal of caste-discrimination and violence as forms of "[[racism]]" was opposed by the Indian government<ref name="npr">[https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/racism/010828.caste.html An Untouchable Subject?], NPR, 29 August 2001  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vF8Wkyz4?url=http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/racism/010828.caste.html |date=25 December 2010 }}</ref> and sociologists in India, including [[Andre Beteille]], who while acknowledging that discrimination exists, deeply opposed treating caste as a form of racism "simply to protect against prejudice and discrimination", describing such attempts as "politically mischievous" and "worse, scientifically nonsense".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020220051728/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/06/03/stories/13030611.htm Discrimination that must be cast away],''The Hindu'', 3 June 2001  </ref><ref>Andre Béteille, [http://wcar.alrc.net/mainfile2.php/For+the+negative/14/ Race and caste], ''The Hindu'', 10 March 2001  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vF8YOsRE?url=http://wcar.alrc.net/mainfile2.php/For+the+negative/14/ |date=25 December 2010 }}</ref>
Beteille argues (that):
<blockquote>
In the past, some groups claimed superior rights on the ground that they belonged to the Aryan race or the Teutonic race. The anthropologists rejected such claims on two grounds: first, on the ground that within the same human species no race is superior to any other; but also on the ground that there is no such thing as an Aryan race or a Teutonic race. We cannot throw out the concept of race by the front door when it is misused for asserting social superiority and bring it in again through the back door to misuse it in the cause of the oppressed. The metaphor of race is a dangerous weapon whether it is used for asserting white supremacy or for making demands on behalf of disadvantaged groups.<ref>{{Cite book|last=AndreBeteille|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OnWCgAAQBAJ&newbks=0&hl=en|title=Ideology & Social Science|date=2006-05-13|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-93-5214-157-9|language=en|access-date=28 August 2021|archive-date=28 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210828124423/https://books.google.com/books?id=5OnWCgAAQBAJ&newbks=0&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===Marxist critique===
Omvedt was criticized for a perceived "anti-statist" bias in her writing as well as "neo-liberal" economic sympathies. Scholars have also questioned the sincerity of her claims regarding the "authenticity" of her work, writing:<ref name="Ghadar">[http://www.proxsa.org/resources/ghadar/v2n1/omvedt.html SAPs, Dust, and Hot Air: Gail Omvedt and Liberalization], Ghadar, 1 November 1998 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011010414/http://www.proxsa.org/resources/ghadar/v2n1/omvedt.html |date=11 October 2014}}</ref>
<blockquote>
In this paragraph, Omvedt is transformed from dangerous American outsider to revolutionary insider, player of a song proclaiming: 'We will cut the throats of the rich!' The chapter strategically ends with these words, which, written and sung though they are by anonymous labourers, can be heard only through Omvedt's (technological) agency. The rest, as they say, is history. The remainder of the book unsubtly suggests what Omvedt does not say explicitly--that she has accepted the leadership role thrust upon her by the initially skeptical masses.
</blockquote>
