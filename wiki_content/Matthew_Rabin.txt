'''Matthew Joel Rabin''' (born December 27, 1963) is the Pershing Square Professor of [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral Economics]] in the Harvard Economics Department and [[Harvard Business School]]. Rabin's research focuses primarily on incorporating psychologically more realistic assumptions into empirically applicable formal economic theory. His topics of interest include errors in statistical reasoning and the evolution of beliefs, effects of choice context on exhibited preferences, reference-dependent preferences, and errors people make in inference in market and learning settings.<ref name=harvard>{{cite web|title=Matthew Rabin - Pershing Square Professor of Behavioral Economics|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/rabin/home|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Pershing Square Foundation awards $17M to Harvard|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/04/the-pershing-square-foundation-awards-17m-to-harvard/|publisher=Harvard Gazette|date=April 14, 2014|access-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>
