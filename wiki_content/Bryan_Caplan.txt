===''The Myth of the Rational Voter''===
''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies'', published in 2007, further develops the "rational irrationality" concept from Caplan's earlier academic writing. It draws heavily from the ''Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy'' in making the argument that voters have systematically biased beliefs about many important economic topics. Caplan writes that [[rational irrationality]] is an explanation for the failure of democracy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Block|first1=Walter|title=Review of "The Myth of the Rational Voter"|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/defending-the-undefendable/201112/review-the-myth-the-rational-voter|access-date=September 29, 2016|work=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex|date=Dec 25, 2011|ref=PsychToday}}</ref> The book was reviewed in the popular press, including ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118401997995161399|title = Casting a Ballot With A Certain Cast of Mind|last = Casse|first = Daniel|date = July 10, 2007|access-date = 2013-09-29|work = The Wall Street Journal|archive-date = July 30, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180730234940/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118401997995161399|url-status = live}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/magazine/27wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=0|title = Clueless|last = Bass|first = Gary J.|date = May 27, 2007|work = The New York Times|access-date = 2013-09-29|archive-date = September 26, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180926063848/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/magazine/27wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=0|url-status = live}}</ref> and ''[[The New Yorker]]'',<ref name = franchise/> as well as in academic publications such as the ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url = https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_35.pdf|title = ''The Myth of the Rational Voter'' (book review)|last = Block|first = Walter|publisher = [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]], Vol. 22 (2011), Page 689-718|access-date = 2013-09-29|archive-date = August 20, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160820105705/https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_35.pdf|url-status = live}}</ref> ''[[Public Choice]]'',<ref name=LomaskyReview>{{cite journal|title = Swing and a myth: a review of Caplan's ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Lomasky|first = Loren|date = June 2008|doi=10.1007/s11127-007-9273-7 |volume=135|issue= 3–4 |journal=Public Choice|pages=469–484|s2cid = 153330363}}</ref> ''Libertarian Papers'',<ref>{{cite web|url = http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-28.pdf|title = Critique of Caplan's ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Farrand|first = Stuart|year = 2010|publisher = [[Libertarian Papers]], Vol. 2, Article No. 28|access-date = 2013-09-29|archive-date = July 31, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031249/http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-28.pdf|url-status = live}}</ref> and ''[[The Independent Review]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=723|title = The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (book review)|last = Callahan|first = Gene|date = Winter 2009|access-date = 2013-09-29|journal = [[The Independent Review]]|archive-date = July 31, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031907/http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=723|url-status = live}}</ref> It received a disparaging critique by Rupert Read in the ''[[European Review]]''.<ref name=Read2010>{{cite journal|last1= Read|first1=Rupert|title=Economist-kings?

These reviews appear to have failed to note that Caplan's book celebrates the market and denigrates democracy at the very time when markets worldwide have failed and democracies have ridden to the rescue. It thus appears to have been undermined fatally by events that occurred as it was published (and which Caplan artfully omits to mention in the more recent paperback edition). Caplan's book in fact stands in the long tradition of anti-democratic writings that argue that an elite must rule. An elite of free-market economists. An elite no longer in good odour, since the financial crisis (and the climate crisis) occurred and became starkly evident to all. This Critical Notice also points out that numerous of Caplan's key claims, such as that individual voters have zero effect on election results, are empirically false.}}</ref>

===''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids''===
In 2011, Caplan published his second book, titled ''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids'', arguing that people often work too hard in child-rearing, and as a result, they are scared of the idea of having children. Caplan's book urged parents to relax with respect to child-rearing. The book argues that as the perceived costs (in terms of child-rearing expense and effort) of having children fell, it made sense to have more children based on the basic theory of supply and demand.<ref name="parenting.harder">{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Tanika|title=Are parents making parenting harder than it has to

==="The Ideological Turing Test"===
{{See also|Rapoport's rules}}
In a June 2011 blog post titled "The Ideological Turing Test" contesting [[Paul Krugman]]'s claim that political liberals can accurately state conservatives' views but not vice versa, Caplan proposed a test analogous to a kind of [[Turing test]]: instead of judging whether a [[chatbot]] had accurately imitated a person, the test would judge whether a person had accurately stated the views of ideological opponents to the opponents' satisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hannon |first=Michael |date=November 2020 |title=Empathetic understanding and deliberative democracy |journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=591–611 (600) |doi=10.1111/phpr.12624 |quote=A useful heuristic is what Bryan Caplan (2011) calls the 'political turing test'.

===''The Case Against Education''===
''[[The Case Against Education|The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money]]'', was published in 2018 by [[Princeton University Press]]. Drawing on the economic concept of [[Signalling (economics)|job market signaling]] and research in [[educational psychology]], the book argues that much of higher education is very inefficient and has only a small effect in improving human capital, contrary to much of the conventional consensus in [[labor economics]] that Caplan claims takes the human capital theory for granted.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

===''Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration''===
Caplan and ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' cartoonist [[Zach Weinersmith]] created the [[non-fiction comics|graphic non-fiction book]] ''Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration'', which was released on October 29, 2019.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Foxe|first=Steve|date=March 21, 2019|title=Cover Reveal: Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/03/cover-reveal-open-borders-the-science-and-ethics-o.html|magazine=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|access-date=March 21, 2019|archive-date=March 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330065847/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/03/cover-reveal-open-borders-the-science-and-ethics-o.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Tyler Cowen]] called it "a landmark in economic education, how to present economic ideas, and the integration of economic analysis and graphic visuals." ''[[The Economist]]'' praised it as "a model of respectful, persuasive argument".<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|title= The case for migration—in pictures|url= https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/12/14/the-case-for-migration-in-pictures|work= [[The Economist]]|date= 14 December 2019|access-date= December 13, 2019|archive-date= December 13, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191213005606/https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/12/14/the-case-for-migration-in-pictures|url-status= live}}</ref>

[[Kevin D.
