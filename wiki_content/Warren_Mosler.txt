He was awarded an [[Doctor Honoris Causa|honorary doctorate]] by the [[Franklin University Switzerland]], and in 2014 was appointed Visiting Professor at the [[University of Bergamo]], Italy.

Mosler has run as an independent for multiple offices including: [[2012 United States presidential election|United States president]],<ref name=president>{{cite web|url=http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00459248|title=Warren Mosler|work=Federal Elections Commission|access-date=28 May 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232735/http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00459248|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> a [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|delegate to Congress]] three times,<ref name=viconsortium>{{cite web|title=WARREN MOSLER ANNOUNCES 2018 BID FOR GOVERNOR OF USVI|work=The Virgin Islands Consortium| date=January 27, 2018| url=https://viconsortium.com/politics/warren-mosler-announces-2018-bid-governor-usvi/}}</ref> and lieutenant governor.<ref name=thesource>{{cite web|title=Gubernatorial Candidate Soraya Diase Coffelt Launches Search for New Running Mate|work=The Source US Virgin Islands| date=May 19, 2014|url=https://visourcearchives.com/content/2014/05/19/gubernatorial-candidate-soraya-diase-coffelt-launches-search/}}</ref><ref name=thesource2>{{cite web|title=Diase Coffelt Taps Mosler As Running Mate|work=The St. Croix Source US Virgin Islands| date=September 2, 2018| url=https://stcroixsource.com/2014/04/30/diase-coffelt-taps-mosler-running-mate/}}</ref> In 2018, he ran unsuccessfully for governor of the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] as an independent.<ref name=virginislandsdailynews>{{cite web| title=Millionaire Warren Mosler announces bid for governor| work=Virgin Islands Daily News| date=January 18, 2018|url=http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/millionaire-warren-mosler-announces-bid-for-governor/article_1d7b6d85-0e1a-523f-b56d-6f61996a590d.html}}</ref>

==Early life==
Mosler attended the [[University of Connecticut]] where he switched from a major in Engineering to Economics due to failing grades.<ref name="Vice" /> <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W97s3zbFKvc&t=993s</ref>

After graduating from college with a 2.5 GPA, he initially went on to work at the Savings Bank of Manchester in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1973. Next he went on to work in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] for Bache and Co. before moving to [[New York City]]. From there he would go on to work on [[Wall Street]], specifically, [[Bankers Trust]] NYC, and then [[William Blair & Company|William Blair]] in Chicago.<ref name=about>{{cite web| title =About| work =Center of the Universe| url =http://moslereconomics.com/about/}}</ref>

==Hedge fund career==
In 1982 he founded a [[hedge fund]], Illinois Income Investors, where he was responsible for several strategies utilizing government securities, mortgage backed securities, [[LIBOR]] swaps and LIBOR caps, and financial futures markets. By the late 1990s, most of the firm had been largely turned over to his partners, as he had disagreements on the direction of some of its investments.<ref name=about/><ref name=cd/> 

Warren's hedge fund was informed by his developing theories. After his departure at the end of 1997, Warren's former business lost money when several dealers refused to make payments on credit default swaps on Russian debt. Separately, Warren attributed the crisis to the fixed exchange rate Russia had at the time.<ref name="nytimes" />

==Transition to academia==

Excited to share his various economic theories, Warren met economist [[Arthur Laffer]] through a referral from [[Donald Rumsfeld]].  At a meeting of Social Policy in NYC, William Vickrey suggested Warren to seek out postkeynesian economists [[L. Randall Wray]], [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]], and [[Stephanie Kelton]] to discuss his ideas. These [[post-Keynesian]] economists had been familiar with [[chartalism]], and recognized the validity of Mosler's analysis. Laffer also his staff economist Mark McNary, who provided editorial and research assistance in Warren's self-published [[monograph]], "Soft-Currency Economics".<ref name="thenation" />

==Academic work==
Academically, he is known for his writings on [[Modern Monetary Theory]], an economic theory that describes the way [[fiat money]] is created and used in modern economies. His unorthodox views have gained a substantial following among participants in Internet discussion groups and academics.<ref name="nytimes" />

In 2010 he published ''Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy'' outlining errors that can be made in the development of policy and explains what he deems "true" as proper alternatives.<ref name=about/>

In recognition that his ''"leadership in the field of economics is notable"'' Mosler was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Franklin University Switzerland]] in 2014,<ref>http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/graphs/2014/01/credentials.pdf. Retrieved 28 January 2014.</ref><ref>http://www.ticinonews.ch/ticino/201328/primi-laureati-alla-franklin-university Retrieved 6 March 2015.</ref> after the Mosler Economic Policy Center (a center founded by him and aimed at encouraging education and research in new concepts and methods of economic policy analysis)<ref>http://www.mecpoc.org/about-mecpoc/</ref> had promoted a lecture about [[functional finance]] at Franklin the year before.<ref>http://www.mecpoc.org/2013/10/2013-mecpoc-lecture/</ref>

In 2014 he became [[visiting professor]] at the [[University of Bergamo]].<ref>[http://www.unibg.it/dati/corsi/910003/64338-Warren%20Mosler%20Bergamo%20paper%20March%2010.pdf Warren Mosler, visiting professor at University of Bergamo, DAEMQ Department, Lectures of International Monetary Economics], ME/MMT: The Currency as a Public Monopoly</ref>

===Mosler's law===
He is attributed with creating Mosler's law dealing with fiscal policy of a nation during a recession. Specifically, Mosler's law states that "[...] no financial crisis [is] so deep that a sufficiently large fiscal adjustment cannot deal with it."<ref>{{cite web| title =Mosler's Law| work =Kenne Turner| date =Feb 20, 2009| url =http://kenneturner.com/tag/moslers-law/}}</ref>  He stated that the recent recession could have been alleviated much quicker from a full payroll tax holiday that suspended FICA taxes (or massive government spending increases, depending on one's politics) until unemployment fell.<ref name=nytimes/>  He opposes overly high taxes since they discourage consumption within an economy but does agree a certain tax level is needed to guarantee citizens use the dollar as a currency.<ref name=cd>{{cite web| title =Warren Mosler| work =Car & Driver Report | url =http://www.caranddriver.com/features/warren-mosler-what-id-do-differently}}</ref><ref name=nytimes/>  He is confident that inflation is a non-factor in his analysis given current procurement policy as long as there is sufficient excess capacity.  In his theory the government has the complete ability to constantly expand net spending and guarantee consumption and growth.<ref name=nytimes/>  He supports unlimited FDIC deposit insurance for all bank deposits for US banks.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Sada| title =Alternative Bank Liquidity Proposal| work =Center of the Universe| date =May 20, 2008| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2008/05/20/alternative-bank-liquidity-proposal/}}</ref>

He stresses that federal spending is in no way constrained by tax revenues, therefore the government will always be able to make payments in its own currency, stating "Federal Government checks don't bounce".<ref name=seven>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =The Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds| work =Center of the Universe| url =http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf}}</ref>  He goes on to state that any and all debt passed on to future generations will never be burdensome, since they will undoubtedly consume whatever is produced.<ref name=seven/>

He developed much of his belief from his time as a hedge fund manager when many investors predicted the Italian government defaulting on bonds, whereas he predicted, correctly, that Italian government would not default and thus made considerable returns.<ref name=nytimes/>

===Economic views===

; Healthcare
Mosler supports government funding for full-time employment with full health care coverage for employees and dependents, thus triggering all firms providing health care to remain competitive.  He states health cannot be viewed as a production cost, therefore the government should fund for at least 90% of the cost paid by the firms.  Finally, he supports issuing medical debit cards to all citizens, for a fixed amount.  This covers any medical costs and any amount above this will be covered by "catastrophe insurance".  At the end of every year, citizens would receive a portion of their unused medical debit card.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Mosler Healthcare Proposal | work =The Center of the Universe| date =Mar 2, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2009/03/02/mosler-health-care-proposal/}}</ref>

; Energy
In a brief proposal, Mosler stated the energy crisis could be solved by lowering the speed limit nationally to 30&nbsp;mph.  According to Mosler, this would cut gasoline consumption and pollution since automobiles run more efficiently at slower speeds, while also greatly increase the demand for public transportation.<ref name=energy>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Energy Crisis Solution| work =Center of the Universe| date =May 22, 2008| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2008/05/22/energy-crisis-solution/}}</ref>  He states that such an initiative would eventually lead to a supply shock forcing prices down, and improve real terms of trade.<ref name=energy/>

; Housing
Mosler supports government purchases of houses in the foreclosure process from the bank at the lower of the fair market value or remaining mortgage balance.  The government then would rent the house back to the original owner and after two years the house is put on the market with the original owner having the first rights of purchase.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Mosler housing proposal| work =Center of the Universe| date =Feb 18, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2009/02/18/mosler-housing-proposal/}}</ref>

; Taxes
Mosler supports eliminating the income tax and replacing it with a real estate tax to "anchor the currency".<ref name=taxes>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Current Proposals| work =Center of the Universe| date =Apr 26, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2008/04/26/current-proposals/}}</ref>  He also supports eliminating tax advantages for any savings accounts, since he states savings do not increase investments necessarily.<ref name=taxes/>  He supports luxury taxes being used to limit the consumption of undesirable goods.<ref name=taxes/>

==Political campaigns==

In February 2009, Mosler declared his candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission to run for the office of President of the United States as an independent.<ref name="president" /> In April 2010, he withdrew to run for a [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2010|U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut]],<ref name="mosler"/> briefly as a Democrat, but ultimately as an independent. In the final tally he received 0.98% of the vote.

Mosler has run unsuccessfully three times for U.S. Virgin Islands delegate to the United States Congress; his last congressional race was in 2012.<ref name="viconsortium" />

In 2014, Mosler ran for lieutenant governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands as an independent,<ref name="thesource2" /> but quit the race early due to a difference of opinion with his running mate [[Soraya Diase Coffelt]].<ref name="thesource" /> In 2018, he ran unsuccessfully for [[United States Virgin Islands gubernatorial election, 2018|governor of the US Virgin Islands]] as an independent candidate, coming in fourth with 4.7% of the vote.<ref name="virginislandsdailynews" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vivote.gov/sites/default/files/officialresults/Official%20Results20181117.HTM |title=Unofficial Results as of 11/17/18 |date=November 17, 2018 |website=2018 General Election |publisher=Election System of the Virgin Islands |access-date=November 20, 2018 }}</ref>

==Automotive and maritime interests==
{{main|Mosler Automotive}}
Mosler developed several luxury sports cars and [[supercars]], including the [[Consulier GTP]] and the [[Mosler MT900]]. Starting in 1985, his cars were marketed by startup company Consulier, later renamed [[Mosler Automotive]].<ref name=cd/>

His models were marked by excellent performance and high speeds.<ref name=jpnik>{{cite web| last =Petrany| first =Mate| title =Mosler Made The First Production Car With No Structural Metal In 1985| work =Jalopnik| date =Jun 17, 2013| url =http://jalopnik.com/mosler-made-the-first-production-car-with-no-structural-513809846}}</ref> Mosler was so confident about one of his models, the Consulier GTP, that he offered a bounty of $25,000 to anyone who could beat it in a race. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' took up the gauntlet and defeated his car. Mosler noted that the model used in the race was a worn-out Consulier and even so offered to pay if he was allowed to use his own driver and replace the brake pads. ''Car and Driver'' refused.  Mosler subsequently offered the challenge once more for a higher bounty of $100,000 and held an event at Sebring where the Consulier again proved to be far quicker than any other road car.<ref name=cd/>

In the 1990s he developed environmentally friendly vehicles including both electric cars and composite-bodied automobiles.<ref name=cd/> The company was sold in June 2013.<ref name=jpnik/>

Mosler also designed his own [[catamaran]] that he prides on being much lighter, faster, and more fuel-efficient than other models.<ref name=cd/> He is operating a unique 'tandem' four-hulled ferry that doesn't promote sea sickness to take passengers from St. Croix to St. Thomas.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pike|first=Dag|date=16 May 2016|title=Rough Sea Quad-Hulled Cat|url=https://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/vessel-build-and-maintenance/ship-and-boatbuilding/rough-sea-quad-hulled-cat|access-date=4 Nov 2020|website=[[Maritime Journal]]}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Around 2010, Mosler relocated to the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] in order to participate in a government-sponsored economic growth initiative.<ref name="mosler">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2010/02/another-hat-in-the-ring-financ.html|title=Another hat in the ring?
