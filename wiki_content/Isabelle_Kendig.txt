'''Isabelle Kendig''' was a prominent [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] in the [[Mid-20th century baby boom|mid-20th century]] United States. She was best known as Head Psychologist at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC.]]<ref name="obit">Dr. Isabelle Kendig, 84, Dies, Active in ACLU. Washington Post. September 25, 1974, p.

Schneider (Eds.), Psychology and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]]: A historical analysis of science, practice, and policy. (pp. 181–207).

Less well known than Kendig's clinical career are the two other careers that preceded her doctoral studies and PhD. She began as a eugenic field worker in 1912, investigating alleged hereditary defects in the Pratt family of [[Shutesbury, Massachusetts|Shutesbury Massachusetts]].<ref>Savo, W. (2002, December).

(1924). Women in the progressive movement. The Nation, Nov. 29, p. 544.</ref><ref name="obit" />

In all these careers and her personal life, Kendig was an outspoken feminist who exemplified the struggle for a career and personal life free of patriarchal constraints.<ref>Josefek, K. A. (1970, August 26). Suffragette says women have long way to go. New Bedford Standard-Times.</ref><ref>Goodman, Ellen. (1970, July 19). Women with a goal: end name-dropping. ''Boston Globe'', p. A-8.</ref>

== Education ==
Isabelle Kendig was educated at St. Xavier’s Academy in Chicago, a Catholic school. After high school, she attended Cook County Normal School, a teachers college known for its progressive philosophy and connections to Chicago’s poor and immigrant populations. Next, she became an elementary school teacher in the Chicago public schools. She then attended Oberlin College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.<ref name="obit" /> Later, she obtained a M.A. and PhD at Radcliffe College. She studied and conducted research at the Harvard Psychological Clinic under its director [[Henry Murray]], who became a lifelong friend. As Murray's biographer described, she was a prominent member of a group of researchers that included future leaders of the field of clinical and personality psychology, including [[Saul Rosenzweig]], [[Robert W. White (psychologist)|Robert W. White]], and [[Erik Erikson]].<ref>Robinson, F. G. (1992). Love's story told: A life of Henry Murray. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>

== Work ==
Kendig began as a eugenic field worker, trained at the [[Eugenics Record Office]] in Long Island. Field work in eugenics was a popular job for young people, particularly women, who wanted to improve society by investigating the connection between heredity and social problems.<ref>Rafter, N. (1988). White trash: The eugenic family studies, 1877–1919. Northeastern University Press.</ref> <ref>Bix, A. S. (1997). Experiences and voices of eugenics field workers: ‘Women's work' in biology. Social Studies of Science, 27(4), 625–668. https://doi.org/10.1177/030631297027004003</ref> Skeptical of the assumptions of hard-line eugenicists, Kendig produced data that contradicted their basic beliefs. When she presented her research to [[Charles Davenport]] and other social scientists concerned with social defect, Kendig was shunned by Davenport, who, in turn, falsified her findings to fit his beliefs.<ref> Harris, B. (2021). Eugenics, Social Reform, and Psychology: The Careers of Isabelle Kendig. ''History of Psychology, 24'', 350-376.</ref>  She gave up her role as researcher and became an executive secretary for a state-wide social service agency in Massachusetts, advocating for a new institution for people with intellectually disabilities (then known as the ''feebleminded'').<ref> Zenderland, L. (1998). Measuring minds : Henry Herbert Goddard and the origins of American intelligence testing . Cambridge University Press.</ref>

She was then an activist in socialist, feminist, and anti-militarist organizations in Washington DC.<ref name="Kendig1924b_p544" /><ref name="obit" /><ref>Berger, M. S. & Swanson, K. (2001). A Milwaukee woman's life on the left: The autobiography of [[Meta Berger]]. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin.</ref> In the [[National Woman's Party|National Women’s Party]], Kendig was a field organizer and its Legislative and Organizational Secretary.<ref> Paul, Alice (1975). Interview by Amelia R. Fry. University of California, Suffragists Oral History Project. </ref> She lobbied and helped organize local groups in the South and created equal rights publicity material for a national audience <ref>Swain, M. H. (1984). Organized women in Mississippi: The clash over legal disabilities in the 1920s. Southern Studies: Interdisciplinary Journal of the South, 23(1), 91–102. </ref>.She also created the NWP’s Councils for various professions and its Homemakers’ Council—a forum in which policies on marriage and family could be created.<ref> Haskin, F. J. (1922, December 26). Adjusting family finances. Grand Forks Herald.</ref> 

After leaving the Women's Party, Kendig gained national recognition as a founder and Executive Secretary of the Women’s Committee for Political Action. This national organization of socialists, feminists, and anti-militarists was founded to make sure women’s interests were represented in preparations for the election of 1924.  A goal of the WCPA was to create a strong female presence within a larger group: the Conference on Progressive Political Action (CPPA), which launched the Presidential campaign for [[Robert M. La Follette|Robert (“Fighting Bob”) La Follette.]] <ref> Cott, N. (1988). ''The grounding of modern feminism''. Yale University Press. </ref>

Kendig also worked for the anti-militarist National Council for the Prevention of War as a researcher and author. Among her projects was a survey and critique of the portrayal of war in history textbooks, which activists could use to argue for less militaristic schools <ref> Kendig-Gill, I. (1924). War and peace in United States history textbooks. National Council for Prevention of War. </ref> Kendig also served as the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]'s Washington Representative and organized a campaign to oppose a bill for the registration and deportation of aliens, testifying before the relevant Congressional committee.

Her final career was as a clinical psychologist, and she rose to the rank of Head of Psychology at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in Washington DC. She made history there by giving projective tests to the hospital's most famous patient, the poet [[Ezra Pound]].<ref>Gillman, R. D. (1994). Ezra Pound's Rorschach diagnosis. Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, 58, 307-322.</ref> She also taught at [[George Washington University Medical School]] and [[Catholic University]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kendig, Isabelle V. - Social Networks and Archival Context|url=https://snaccooperative.org/view/5160419|access-date=2021-10-31|website=snaccooperative.org}}</ref> More importantly, she helped lead the field of clinical psychology, locally and nationally.<ref>Taylor, J.

== Family ==
In 1915, Kendig married [[Howard Gill]], who became a prominent criminologist.<ref>Johnsen, T. C. (September/October 1999). Howard Belding Gill (pp. 54–55). Harvard Magazine.</ref> A year before they married, Kendig and Gill began planning how they could each have a career, a home life, and children.<ref name="Harris2021" /> Later, Kendig offered advice on how women could maintain some financial independence in their marriage.<ref>Haskin, F. J. (December 26 1922). Adjusting family finances. Grand Forks Herald.</ref> They had four children.<ref name="obit">Dr. Isabelle Kendig, 84, Dies, Active in ACLU. Washington Post.
