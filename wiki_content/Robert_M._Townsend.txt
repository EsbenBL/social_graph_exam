'''Robert Morris Townsend''' (born April 23, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and [[professor]], the Elizabeth & James Killian Professor of Economics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref>[http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/ MIT Faculty page] Retrieved: 20 July 2010</ref> Prior to joining MIT, he was the Charles E. Merriam Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Economics at the [[University of Chicago]] where he remained a [[research associate]] ([[professor]]) until 2018.

==Biography==
Robert Townsend was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1948. He is the brother of John S. Townsend, a professor of physics at [[Harvey Mudd College]].

Townsend received his B.A. from [[Duke University]] in 1970 and Ph.D. from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1975. He began teaching at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1975, and became a Professor at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1985 where he stayed full-time until moving to MIT in 2008. From 1987 to 1989 Townsend was also editor of the [[Journal of Political Economy]].

In addition to his professorships, Townsend is the Principal Investigator and Project Director of the [http://enterpriseinitiative.org Enterprise Initiative], funded by the [[John Templeton Foundation]], and the Principal Investigator of the [[Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty]], funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. Additionally, he is a consultant for numerous institutions, including the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]], the [[World Bank]], and [[Banco de Espa√±a]].

Townsend is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of [[Econometric Society|The Econometric Society]], as well as an Elected Member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].  He was the recipient of the [[Jean-Jacques Laffont]] Prize in 2011, and a [[Frisch Medal]] in 1998 for his work on village India and in 2012 for the structural evaluation of a large-scale microfinance program in Thailand; Townsend is the award's only two-time winner.

==Research==
Townsend began his work as a theorist in [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium models]] and contract theory/mechanism design, but is known primarily for his work on [[revelation principle]], [[costly state verification]], optimal multi-period contracts, decentralization of economies with private information, models of money with spatially separated agents, and forecasting the forecasts of others. His contributions in econometrics include the study of risk and insurance in developing countries.

Since 1997, Townsend's [http://cier.uchicago.edu/ Thai Project] has undertaken large scale village surveys in Thailand to analyze the interaction between household decisions and community behavior at the level of families, villages, regions, and the nation. The Townsend Thai study was the first of its kind and has been the stepping stone for many other applied and theoretical projects in economic development and contract theory. Townsend's work has demonstrated innovation in the combination of theory and data, as well as the ability to work across various sub-fields. A documentary film about his research and field work in Thailand, titled ''Emerging Thailand: The Spirit of Small Enterprise,'' was created in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Robert M.|title=Emerging Thailand: The Spirit of Small Enterprise|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rEmiu71Pk|website=Emerging Thailand|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>

==Films==
In 2012, a series of documentary films was created about the people and research behind the Townsend Thai Project. The series consists of one main film and a set of smaller, shorter films that highlight the work of entrepreneurs in rural Thailand.
