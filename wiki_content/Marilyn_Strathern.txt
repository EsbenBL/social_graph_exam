'''Dame Ann Marilyn Strathern''', [[Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (née Evans; born 6 March 1941)<ref>{{Citation|title=Birthdays|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|page=35|year=2014}}</ref> is a [[Great Britain|British]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]], who has worked largely with the [[Mount Hagen]] people of [[Papua New Guinea]] and dealt with issues in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] of reproductive technologies.<ref name ="Macfarlane, Alan. 2009">[http://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1130673 Video Recording of Marilyn Strathern by Alan Macfarlane], 6 May 2009.</ref> She was [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1993 to 2008, and [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]] from 1998 to 2009.

==Early life==
Marilyn Strathern was born to Eric Evans and Joyce Evans in North Wales on 6 March 1941.<ref name="Macfarlane, Alan. 2009"/><ref name="University of Cambridge. 2008">[http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~srw38/walks/tour/atoz/scientistdatabase.php?ppleid=113 University of Cambridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315153355/http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~srw38/walks/tour/atoz/scientistdatabase.php?ppleid=113 |date=15 March 2013 }}, Marilyn Strathern.</ref> Her first formal education experience was at Crofton Lane Primary School, followed by her attendance at Bromley High School.  Strathern excelled academically, in part thanks to support and guidance from her mother, a teacher by trade.<ref name="Macfarlane, Alan. 2009"/>  Following school, she enrolled in Girton College to study Archaeology and Anthropology.  She then became a research student there<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/discover-girton/girton-past/past-mistresses|title=Past Mistresses - Girton College|website=Girton College|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref> and went on to obtain her PhD in 1968.<ref name="University of Cambridge. 2008"/> She married fellow anthropologist Andrew Strathern in 1964 and they had three children together before ending their marriage.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

==Career==
	Strathern has held numerous positions over her career,  all of which involved her work with the people of Papua New Guinea and her expertise in feminist anthropology.  Her career began in 1970, when she was a Researcher for the [[New Guinea Research Unit]] of the [[Australian National University]], followed by a stint from 1976 to 1983 where she was a lecturer at Girton College and then Trinity College from 1984-1985, occasionally making guest lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States,<ref name="University of Cambridge. 2008"/> Europe and Australia.<ref name="American Anthropological Association. 2011">[http://blog.aaanet.org/2011/03/31/inside-the-presidents-studio-marilyn-strathern/ American Anthropological Association], 2011. Inside the Presidents Studio - Marilyn Strathern.</ref>

She left Cambridge to become Professor of Social Anthropology at [[Manchester University]] in 1985. She then returned to Cambridge for the final time in 1993 to take the position of [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology]] until her retirement in 2008.  During this time, she also held the position of Mistress of Girton College from 1998 to October 2009.<ref name="Girton College. 2010">[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/fellows-and-staff/mistress/past-mistresses/ Girton College], 2010 Past Mistresses: Marilyn Strathern</ref><ref name="Maosko, Mark and Margret Jolly. 2004">[http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/strathern.htm Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518031340/http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/strathern.htm |date=18 May 2013 }} by Mark Maosko and Margaret Jolly, April.</ref> Strathern was also co-opted member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics while also chairing the Working Party on "Human bodies: donation for medicine and research" from 2000 to 2006 and 2010 until 2011.<ref name="Nuffield Council on Bioethics">[http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/content/past-council-members Nuffield Council on Bioethics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617135835/http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/content/past-council-members |date=17 June 2012 }}, 2012.

==Fieldwork in Papua New Guinea==
From her doctoral thesis published in 1972 titled "Women in Between"<ref name="Maosko, Mark and Margret Jolly. 2004"/> to her more recent publications, Strathern is constantly challenging the definitions and social constructs of gender "norms".  In her piece "Self-Interest and the Social Good: Some Implications of Hagen Gender Imagery" (1981), Strathern notes that "[g]ender imagery is… a symbolic mechanism whereby "collective" and "personal" interests are made to seem to be of different orders".<ref name="Strathern 1981">Marilyn Strathern. 1981 "Self-Interest and the Social Good: Some Implications of Hagen Gender Imagery." Pp. 370-391 in ''Readings for a History of Anthropological Theory,''edited by Paul A. Erickson and Liam Murphy.  Toronto: University of Toronto Press.</ref>   As editor of a collection of articles in "Dealing with Inequality: Analysing gender relations in Melanesia and beyond", she also brings to the surface the issue of gender "equality" and what it really means, asking if the definitions of the Western world are in fact correct, or if there is still a sense of patriarchal dominance.<ref name="Strathern 1987">Marilyn Strathern. 1987 "Dealing with inequality: analyzing gender relations in Melanesia and beyond." Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

Taking this approach when studying in such fields as societies in Papua New Guinea has allowed Strathern to push the boundaries of thought on such topics as reproductive technology, intellectual property, and gender in both Melanesia and the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Strathern has spent much time among the Hagen of Papua New Guinea.<ref name="Strathern 1981"/>  From here she has developed one of the main themes occurring across her work, that the world is ontologically multiple.<ref name="Strathern 1981"/><ref name="Strathern 1987"/><ref name="Hansbol 2008">[http://mikalasklumme.wordpress.com/2008/02/08/marily-strathern-and-partial-connections/ Mikala Hansbol], "Marilyn Strathern, ontological multiplicity and partial connections." ''Mikalas Klumme: A Researchers Blog''.</ref><ref name="Strathern 2005">Marilyn Strathern 2005. ''Kinship, Law and the Unexpected: relatives are always a surprise.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref> {{clarify|date=December 2012}} The world is made up of identifiable parts; however, these parts are not separate from one another.  She does not address society specifically, but rather looks at socially-constructed multiple realities which exist interdependently with one another.<ref name="Strathern 2005"/>

==Reproductive technologies==
Strathern's work in the 1990s became the basis for a new subdiscipline in anthropology concerned with new reproductive technologies such as [[in vitro fertilization]]. In her two 1992 publications, ''After Nature: English Kinship in the Late 20th Century'' and ''Reproducing the Future: Essays on Anthropology, Kinship and the New Reproductive Technologies'', Strathern argued that existing models of nature and culture were transformed by the explicit use of technology to achieve reproduction. In the co-authored study ''Technologies of Procreation: Kinship in the Age of Assisted Conception'' she and her colleagues proposed that new definitions of kinship and descent would emerge as a result of the expansion of new reproductive technologies.  These studies paved the way for what has since come to be known as the new kinship studies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carsten|first1=Janet|title=After Kinship|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521661986}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Sarah|last2=McKinnon|first2=Susan|title=Relative Values: Reconfiguring Kinship Studies|date=2001|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822327967}}</ref>

==Selected publications==
	Strathern is the author of numerous publications, including 44 single-authored journal articles, 57 book chapters, and over 15 books written alone or with another author.<ref name="Maosko, Mark and Margret Jolly. 2004"/>  Her topics vary from Melanesian culture to the culture of the United Kingdom.  Strathern's publications on the Melanesian culture focus on gender relations, legal anthropology and feminist scholarship, while her publications on the culture of the United Kingdom lean towards kinship, audit culture, reproductive and genetic technologies.<ref name="Girton College. 2010"/>  The book she enjoyed writing the most, according to an interview with the American Anthropological Association in 2011, was ''Partial Connections'', written in 1991.<ref name="American Anthropological Association. 2011"/>  Her most famous book, however, is ''The Gender of Gift'' published in 1988.<ref name="University of Cambridge. 2008"/>

In ''The Gender of Gift'', she uses a feminist approach in a new way to argue that Papuan women are not being exploited, but rather the definition is different.{{clarify|date=December 2012}}  Gender, she notes, is defined differently there than it is in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Douglas 1989">[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v11/n09/mary-douglas/a-gentle-deconstruction Mary Douglas 1989], "A Gentle Deconstruction." ''The London Review of Books.'' London: London Review of Books 11(9): 17-18.</ref>  Strathern also brings to the surface the fact that theories are dominating themselves and while she knows as an anthropologist, she cannot separate herself from them, she does state that she offers a "narrative" over an analysis of the situation.<ref name="Douglas 1989"/>
