'''Jacquelyne Mary Johnson Jackson''' (February 24, 1932 – January 28, 2004) was an American sociologist, educator, and researcher on issues that affect elderly minority populations. She was involved in public policy debates on programs for this group for over 30 years. From 1978 onward she started a dialogue on social security accessibility for elderly minorities in consideration of sociological influence.

==Early life and education==

Jacquelyne Mary Johnson and her fraternal twin sister, Jeanne Naomi Johnson were born on February 24, 1932 in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. Her parents were James and Beulah Johnson. Jacquelyne was raised in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]]. She married to Murphy Jackson, and with him they had one child, Viola Elizabeth.<ref name=Krapp>{{cite book|last1=Editor|first1=Kristine Krapp|title=Notable Black American Scientists|date=1990|publisher=Gale|location=NY|isbn=0-7876-2789-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/notableblackamer0000unse}}</ref>

Jacquelyne Jackson started her career when she witnessed an elderly couple that was forced to sell their home in order to have money for medical care, since there was no [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] at the time. The couple was forced into public housing as a result. The result of the couple losing their home and life savings drove Jackson to pursue a career addressing the issues of elderly minorities as well as public service law and civil rights issues. Jackson attended Hampton Institute in 1950 for two years and pledged [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority there and then transferred to Wisconsin. Initially intending on being a lawyer she was influenced by two key professors at Wisconsin and later at Ohio State. She was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in [[Sociology]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1953.<ref name=Krapp /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wayne|first1=Tiffany K.|title=American Women of Science Since 1900|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1-59884-158-9|pages=543–544|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPGZJ_YuMwgC&pg=PA543 |chapter=Jackson, Jacquelyne Mary (Johnson)}}</ref>

==Career and research==

She received her Master's of Science in Sociology from the same university in 1955. At [[Ohio State University]] she received her Doctorate in Sociology in 1960. She started her post-doctoral work in 1961 at the [[University of Colorado-Boulder]]. As a part of her academic career, she did post-doctoral work at Duke University becoming the second Black professor and first Black female, after the first Black professor Dr. Samuel Dubois Cook, from 1966–68 and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in the years 1977–78.<ref name=Krapp />

From 1959 to 1962, Jackson served as an Assistant Professor and Associate at Southern [[Louisiana State University-Baton Rouge|University-Baton Rouge]]. In 1962 she left to work as a Professor at the primarily black [[Jackson State College]] until 1964. At that time, she moved to work at [[Howard University]], one of the nation's leading [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities]] in the United States. She joined the [[Duke University]] staff in 1966, where she worked as an Instructor and Associate Professor of Medical Sociology. 1969 onward she worked as a Visiting Professor at [[St. Augustine's College (Virginia)|St. Augustine's College]]. She also worked as a Professor at Howard University from 1978–1985.<ref name=Krapp />

In an interview on April 14, 1998, Jackson said her most important work is in the field of [[ethno-gerontology]]. She stresses that this field should not confused with social work. She also stated the main task of her work is to "...keep pace with changes and identify characteristics and causes and address public policy to modify programs." Jackson's research and writings cover the older black population in the United States. Her analyses measured the intra-variations within this population itself instead of comparing it to other populations. Jackson has researched the variations in gender, age, and ethnicity within the black community. Unlike other similar types of research, Jackson accounted for discrimination against blacks. During the 1960s, some of her work compared populations based on [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].<ref name=Krapp />

Jackson contributed to more than 80 scholarly journals, and has also published two books: ''These Rights They Seek'' in 1962 (her PhD dissertation which focused on her participant observer work in the civil rights activities of the Tuskegee Civic Association, Montgomery Improvement Association and the Birmingham Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and early 1960s)and ''Minorities and Aging'' in 1980. In her scholarship, Jackson has addressed race-based [[affirmative action]], the [[bell curve]], and the [[Anita Hill]]/[[Clarence Thomas]] controversy of 1991.<ref name=Krapp /> she co-authored or published as executive editor many other scholarly works. Jackson also ran political campaigns for Durham Mayor Bill Bell when he ran for City Council  and worked with the Federation on American Immigration Reform -"FAIR" - in the early 1980s.

==Achievements and recognition==

Jackson earned multiple fellowships, including being named the John Hay Whitney Fellow of 1957–59, a [[National Science Foundation]] Fellow beginning in 1959, and National Institutes of Health Fellow 1966–1968 and 1977–1978. She also served as the President of the Association of Social and Behavioral Scientists and Chair of the [[Caucus of Black Sociologists]].
