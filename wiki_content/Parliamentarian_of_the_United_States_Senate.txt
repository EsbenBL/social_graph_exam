{{United States Senate}}
The '''Parliamentarian of the United States Senate''' is the official advisor to the [[United States Senate]] on the interpretation of [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate]] and [[parliamentary procedure]].  Incumbent parliamentarian [[Elizabeth MacDonough]] has held the office since 2012, appointed by then-Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]].<ref name="Bolton" />

As the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|Presiding Officer of the Senate]] may not be, and usually is not, aware of the parliamentary situation currently facing the Senate, a parliamentary staff sits second from the left on the Senate [[dais]] to advise the Presiding Officer on how to respond to inquiries and motions from Senators (including "the Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the gallery"). The role of the parliamentary staff is advisory, and the Presiding Officer may overrule the advice of the [[Parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian]]. In practice, this is rare; the most recent example of a Vice President (as President of the Senate) overruling the parliamentarian was [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/81273-healthcare-reform-and-reconciliation-a-bad-mix-ex-parliamentarian-says|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|title=Healthcare reform and reconciliation a bad mix, ex-parliamentarian says|first=Jeffrey|last=Young|date=February 16, 2010|access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> That ruling was extremely controversial,<ref>{{cite report |author=Walter J.

== Overview ==
An important role of the parliamentarian is to decide what can and cannot be done under the Senate's [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|Reconciliation]] process under the provisions of the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)#Byrd Rule|Byrd Rule]].<ref name="Bolton">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/207635-senate-parliamentarian-alan-frumin-to-retire-setting-up-big-question-for-next-congress|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|title=After nearly 20 years, Senate parliamentarian Alan Frumin to retire|first=Alexander|last=Bolton|date=January 31, 2012|access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> These rulings are important because they allow certain bills to be approved by a simple majority, instead of the sixty votes needed to end debate and block a [[filibuster]].  

The office also refers bills to the appropriate committees on behalf of the Senate's Presiding Officer, and referees efforts by the ruling party to change the [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|Senate rules]] by rulings from the chair. The parliamentarian is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]]. Traditionally, the parliamentarian is chosen from senior staff in the parliamentarian office, which helps ensure consistency in the application of the Senate's complex rules. The current and the previous two parliamentarians have all served under both Republican and Democratic Senate rule.

The Parliamentarian's salary is $172,500 per year, as of 2018.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ida A. |last=Brudnick |title=Congressional Salaries and Allowances: In Brief |url=https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/9c14ec69-c4e4-4bd8-8953-f73daa1640e4.pdf |work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=April 11, 2018 |access-date=February 26, 2021}}</ref>
