'''Masahiko Aoki''' (April 1, 1938 â€“ July 15, 2015) was a [[Japan]]ese [[economist]], Tomoye and Henri Takahashi [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Japanese Studies]] in the [[Economics]] Department, and Senior Fellow of the [[Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research]] and [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] at [[Stanford University]]. Aoki was known for his work in comparative institutional analysis, [[corporate governance]], the [[theory of the firm]], and comparative East Asian development.<ref>A summary of Aoki's work is provided in an obituary in the [http://www.res.org.uk/view/art4Oct15Obituaries.html''Newsletter'' of the Royal Economic Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223083730/http://www.res.org.uk/view/art4Oct15Obituaries.html |date=2015-12-23 }} prepared by Takeo Hoshi, Issue no. 171, October 2015.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Aoki was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] in 1938. He received his B.A. and M.A. in economics from [[Tokyo University]] in 1962 and 1964. As a university student, Aoki was a communist activist, and one of the leaders of a radical Marxist student activist organization, the [[Communist League (Japan)|Communist League]], better known by its German-derived nickname, "[[Communist League (Japan)|The Bund]]."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kapur|first=Nick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re5hDwAAQBAJ|title=Japan at the Crossroads: Conflict and Compromise after Anpo|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|ISBN=978-0674984424|pages=146}}</ref> Writing a number of theoretical tracts under his pen name, Himeoka Reiji, Aoki was also the Bund's primary ideologue and theoretician, and helped drive the Bund's radical behavior during the massive [[Anpo protests|1960 Anpo protests]] against the [[U.S.-Japan Security Treaty]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kapur|first=Nick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re5hDwAAQBAJ|title=Japan at the Crossroads: Conflict and Compromise after Anpo|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|ISBN=978-0674984424|pages=149, 294n16}}</ref>

After the protests, however, Aoki disavowed his previous stances and moved to the United States to pursue a [[Ph.D.]] degree in economics. In 1967, Aoki received his Ph.D from the [[University of Minnesota]], where he studied under [[John Chipman (economist)|John Chipman]] and Nobel Laureate [[Leonid Hurwicz]].

==Academic career==
Aoki became assistant professor at Stanford University in 1967, [[Harvard University]] in 1968, and [[Kyoto University]] in 1969, where he remained until his promotion to full professor in 1977. In 1984, he returned to Stanford University as a professor of economics, and became Professor Emeritus of Kyoto University in 2001. In order to focus on research and take a greater role in international activities,<ref>The Japan Times, "Doshisha, Stanford Agree to Stronger Ties," July 1, 2006</ref> he became Professor Emeritus of Stanford University in 2004.  Since 2011 he served as the Senior Visiting Fellow at the [[Asian Development Bank Institute]] in Tokyo. Aoki also held [[visiting professor|visiting]] positions at Tokyo University, [[Keio University]], [[Hitotsubashi University]], [[Harvard University]], the [[London School of Economics]], and the [[Max Planck Institute]] in Cologne.<ref>http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/Masahiko_Aoki/|title=FSI - Masahiko Aoki|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

==Research career==
Aoki's research has been also published in the leading journals in economics, including the ''American Economic Review'', ''Econometrica'', the ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', ''Review of Economic Studies'', the ''Journal of Economic Literature'', ''Industrial and Corporate Change'', and the ''Journal of Economic Behavior and Organizations''.

Aoki was the founding editor of the ''Journal of the Japanese and International Economies''.<ref>https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-the-japanese-and-international-economies/</ref>

Besides authoring five books, Aoki was active in organizing international research projects on various institutional topics and has edited more than ten books for institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Economic Association]], to which more than 200 scholars from more than 20 countries contributed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-congress-2011.org/Homepage.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805233218/http://www.iea-congress-2011.org/homepage.html |archive-date=2012-08-05 }}</ref>

Aoki was President of the Japanese Economic Association from 1995 to 1996, and President of the International Economic Association from 2008 to 2011.<ref>The Nikkei Weekly, "Masahiko Aoki to lead world economics association," October 31, 2005.</ref> He was also a Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econometricsociety.org/fellows.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210090215/http://www.econometricsociety.org/fellows.asp |archive-date=2008-12-10 }}</ref>

Aoki served as President of the Japanese Government's Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~aoki/|title=Masahiko Aoki: Personal Website|access-date=17 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904034107/http://www.stanford.edu/~aoki/|archive-date=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref>The Nikkei Weekly, "Professor in U.S. Tapped to Head MITI Institute: Economics Specialist Brings Global View, Activist Attitude," September 1, 1997</ref> where he stressed the necessity of a trans-disciplinary approach to public policy research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rieti.go.jp/en/rieti_report/025.html|title=RIETI - The Future of Japan <RIETI Featured Fellow> AOKI Masahiko - Special Interview|access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/35/b3593052.htm|title=08/31/98 WILL TECHNOLOGY LEAVE JAPAN BEHIND?|access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref>

==Academic Contributions==
Aoki's major academic contributions to economics and the [[social sciences]] in general were in the fields of the [[New Institutional Economics|comparative institutional analysis]], the theory of the firm, and corporate governance.

===Comparative institutional analysis===
Aoki's research made him a pioneer and leader in comparative institutional analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~aoki/publications/01_comments.html|title=Masahiko Aoki > Publications > Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis > Reviews & Comments|access-date=17 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915063037/http://www.stanford.edu/~aoki/publications/01_comments.html|archive-date=15 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/35/b3593055.htm|title=08/31/98 Q&A WITH MASAHIKO AOKI|access-date=17 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722003625/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/35/b3593055.htm|archive-date=22 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Together with [[Paul Milgrom]], [[Avner Greif]], Yingyi Qian, and Marcel Fafchamp, he created a comparative institutional field in the economics department at Stanford in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economics.stanford.edu/graduate/graduate-degree-program|title=Graduate Degree Program|access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref>  They conceptualized institutions as equilibrium phenomena in societal games rather than something given exogenously by factors such as law, policy, and culture. From this perspective he laid analytical foundations for basic concepts in institutional analysis such as institutional complementarities, social embedeness (linked games), and public representations mediating the salient features of the state of play and individual beliefs, and applied them to comparative analysis across countries and regions. Aoki was the first to directly apply institutional analysis to Japan,<ref>Vogel, Steven and Nazneen Barma, ''The Political Economy Reader: Markets as Institutions'' (Routledge, 2007)</ref> arguing in the late 1980s that institutions such as lifetime employment, the main bank system, long-term supplier relations, and government as an interest group mediator were in mutually complementary, game-theoretic equilibria in the context of Japan's institutional evolution.<ref>Aoki, Masahiko, ''Information, Incentives, and Bargaining in the Japanese Economy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988)</ref><ref>The Nikkei Weekly, "Interview: Aoki sees 90s as paradigm shift," January 10, 2006.</ref>

In his 2001 work, ''Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis'', Aoki developed a conceptual and analytical [[game theory|game theoretic]] approach to comparative studies of institutions.<ref>Aoki, Masahiko. ''Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001)</ref><ref>http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/gr3.pdf</ref>  He used this framework to analyze how institutions evolve, why institutional structures are diverse across economies, and what factors lead to institutional change or rigidity.<ref>The Washington Times, "Japan's management evolving; Gradual process seen over decade" November 26, 2002.</ref>

===Theory of the firm===
''The Cooperative Game Theory of the Firm'' (1984) was a first attempt to synthesize and unify various theories of the firm, such as [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]], worker controlled, and [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholder]] society views, as special cases of corporate governance with varied weights of bargaining power attributed to the members of the firm.<ref>Aoki, Masahiko. ''The Cooperative Game Theory of the Firm'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984)</ref><ref>The Daily Yomiuri, "When will a Japanese economist win a Nobel?" December 8, 1994.</ref> Aoki's interests then moved into comparisons of various internal information structures of the firm ([[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]], [[flat organization|horizontal]] and modular), and its applications to international varieties of corporate firms across Anglo-American, Japanese, [[Germany|German]], [[Silicon Valley]], and [[China|Chinese]] systems, as well as to a comparative assessment of [[Nuclear Disasters|nuclear power disasters]] ([[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]], [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]).<ref>http://siepr.stanford.edu/?q=/system/files/shared/pubs/papers/pdf/11-001_Paper_Aoki.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621073936/http://siepr.stanford.edu/?q=%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Fshared%2Fpubs%2Fpapers%2Fpdf%2F11-001_Paper_Aoki.pdf |date=2015-06-21 }}</ref>  These two viewpoints on corporate firms: a game-theoretic approach to corporate governance and information systemic approach to the internal structure of corporate firms are synthesized in Aoki's 2008 Clarendon Lectures, ''Corporations in Evolving Diversity''.<ref>Aoki, Masahiko. ''Corporations in Evolving Diversity: Cognition, Governance, and Institutions'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010)</ref>  Relying on a recent development of potential game theory, he also showed that sufficient and necessary conditions for corporate stakeholders with different payoff functions to behave as if they have a common objective is that they share a common distributive value (technically represented as [[Shapley value]]). This insight places the economic theory of the firm in a broader frame of institutional analysis.
==Death==
Aoki died on July 15, 2015, at the age of 77.  A Memorial Conference celebrating his life and work was held at Stanford University on December 4, 2015 and included addresses by [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Koichi Hamada]], and [[Dale W. Jorgenson|Dale Jorgenson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aparc.fsi.stanford.edu/japan/events/masahiko-aoki-memorial-conference|title=Masahiko Aoki Memorial Conference}}</ref>
