'''Michel Louis Balinski''' (born '''Michał Ludwik Baliński'''; October 6, 1933 – February 4, 2019) was an [[applied mathematician]], [[economist]], [[operations research analyst]] and [[political scientist]]. As a [[Polish Americans|Polish-American]], educated in the United States, he lived and worked primarily in the United States and France. He was known for his work in optimisation (combinatorial, linear, nonlinear), convex polyhedra, stable matching, and the theory and practice of electoral systems, jury decision, and social choice. He was Directeur de Recherche de classe exceptionnelle (emeritus) of the [[École Polytechnique|C.N.R.S. at the École Polytechnique]] (Paris). He was awarded the [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] by INFORMS in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Conference on Mathematical Optimization for Fair Social Decisions : A tribute to Michel Balinski |url=https://www.sciencesconf.org/browse/conference/?confid=8853 |publisher=Science Conf |access-date=12 January 2021}}</ref>

Michel Louis Balinski died in [[Bayonne]], [[France]]. He maintained an active involvement in research and public appearances, his last public engagement took place in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Balinski-Michel|title=Balinski, Michel|last=INFORMS|website=INFORMS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>

==Early life==

Michel Balinski was born in  [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the grandson of the Polish [[bacteriologist]] and founder of [[UNICEF]],  [[Ludwik Rajchman]].<ref name="aug"/> Brought up by his mother Irena (Rajchman) Balinska and his grandparents, they were living in France when the Nazis invaded in 1940. They fled via Spain and Portugal to the United States. He graduated from the Edgewood School in Greenwich CT in 1950, earned a B.A. degree cum laude in mathematics at  [[Williams College]] in 1954 and a M.Sc. in economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1956. He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics at [[Princeton University]] in 1959 under the supervision of [[Albert W. Tucker]].<ref name="aug"/><ref name="mg">{{mathgenealogy|id=29519|name=Michel Louis Balinski}}</ref>

==Career==

After completing his Ph.D. Balinski remained at [[Princeton University]] as a research associate then lecturer in mathematics. From 1963 to 1965 he was associate professor of economics at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. He was then appointed to the Graduate School of the [[City University of New York]], first as associate professor then (as of 1969) professor of mathematics. One of his doctoral students at the City University was another noted mathematician, Louis Billera, through whom he has many academic descendants. In 1978 he was appointed professor of organization and management and of administrative sciences at [[Yale]].

In parallel with his academic work, Balinski engaged in consulting as of the time he was a graduate student at Princeton. A participant in the beginnings of what became the consulting firm Mathematica, he was a senior consultant with the firm from 1962 to 1974. He also acted as a consultant elsewhere, including the [[Rand Corporation]], Mobil Oil Research, the [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française|ORTF]] (Office de Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française), the Mayor's office of the City of New York (as member of the Operations Research Council), and Econ, Inc. From 1975 to 1977 he was chairman of System and Decision Sciences at IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analyses) at Laxenburg, Austria.

In 1980 Balinski settled in France, becoming Directeur de Recherche de classe exceptionnelle of the CNRS ([[Centre National de Recherche Scientifique]]) at the Laboratoire d’Econométrie of the [[Ecole Polytechnique]] in 1983. Concurrently he was Leading Professor of Applied Mathematics and Statistics and of Economics at [[Stony Brook University]] (1983–1990), where he founded and was the first Director of the Institute for Decision Sciences (that has since become the Center for Game Theory in Economics).

Upon becoming director of the Laboratoire d’Econométrie (1989 to 1999), he co-founded and co-directed the joint Ecole Polytechnique/Université de Paris 1 masters program "Modélisation et méthodes mathématiques en économie: optimisation et analyse stratégiques," and its successor the joint Ecole Polytechnique/Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6) masters program "Optimisation, jeux et modélisation en économie."<ref name="ptvn"/>

He was a visiting professor at other institutions, including the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (1972–1973), the Université Scientifique et Médicale de Grenoble (1974–1975), the [[University of Chile|Universidad de Chile]] in [[Santiago]] (1994), and [[INSEAD]] in Fontainebleau (1997–1998).<ref name="aug"/><ref name="ptvn">[https://www.polytechnique.edu/home/current-events/awards-and-honors/michel-balinski-receives-the-2013-john-von-neumann-theory-prize-299249.kjsp Michel Balinski receives the 2013 John von Neumann Theory Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002136/https://www.polytechnique.edu/home/current-events/awards-and-honors/michel-balinski-receives-the-2013-john-von-neumann-theory-prize-299249.kjsp |date=2013-12-03 }}, [[École Polytechnique]], retrieved 2013-11-27.</ref>

Balinski was the founding editor-in-chief of the journal ''[[Mathematical Programming]]'' in 1971, one of the founders of the [[Mathematical Optimization Society]]  in 1970, and president of that society from 1986 to 1989.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.mathopt.org/pdfs/wolfe_memoir.pdf|title=The Mathematical Programming Society|first=Philip|last=Wolfe|publisher=[[Mathematical Optimization Society]]|access-date=2013-11-27}}.</ref>

==Research contributions==

Balinski's Ph.D. thesis concerned the [[vertex enumeration problem]], the [[algorithm]]ic problem of listing all vertices of a  [[convex polytope]]  or finding all optimal solutions of a  [[linear program]], and some of his subsequent work continued to concern [[polyhedral combinatorics]].  The thesis includes the fundamental theorem, published in 1961, that the skeletons of polytopes in "n"-space viewed as graphs are "n"-connected, meaning that at least "n" edges must be removed to disconnect the graph of the remaining vertices and edges;<ref>{{citation|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|authorlink=Günter Ziegler|title=Lectures on Polytopes|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1995|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=152|contribution=Section 3.5: Balinski's Theorem: The Graph is ''d''-Connected}}.</ref> it is known as [[Balinski's theorem]]. He also proved the [[Hirsch conjecture]] for several different classes of polytopes associated with the transportation problem, showed that the diameter of the skeleton of the assignment polytope viewed as a graph is 2, and found the polytope whose vertices are the stable matchings of the university admissions problem.

His contributions to linear and nonlinear optimization include a primal/dual simplex method that incorporates a natural proof of termination and leads to a self-contained, elementary but rigorous, constructive account of the theory and the basic computational tool of linear programming; the use and economic interpretation of dual prices; and a proof that prices in von Neumann's model of an expanding economy are marginal values. His work in integer programming includes the formulation and analysis of the fixed cost transportation problem; one of the first computationally successful practical uses of Gomory's cutting plane algorithm (1968, truck deliveries with cost functions in part concave, in part convex); and an extensive survey paper on integer programming which was awarded INFORM's [[Frederick W. Lanchester Prize|Lanchester Prize]] in 1965.

Together with Mourad Baïou,<ref>http://fc.isima.fr/~baiou/pmwiki-2.2.61/pmwiki.php</ref> he developed a new formulation of stable matchings and generalizations in terms of graphs, providing a unified notation and tool leading to new proofs of known results and new results; notably, a characterization of the university admissions polytope, and a generalization of matching opposites (e.g., men and women, students and universities) to matching opposites in real numbers (e.g., time spent together).

In 1970, he published one of the earliest papers on the [[closure problem]] and its applications to transportation planning.<ref>{{citation

=== Electoral systems ===

Balinski has made important contributions to the theory of electoral systems, namely, representation and apportionment on the one hand, and voting on the other. His 1982 book<ref>Apportionment: Balinski and Young's contribution--- http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-apportionii3</ref><ref>Donald L. Vestal, Fair Representation: Meeting the Ideal of One Man, One Vote --- http://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/fair-representation-meeting-the-ideal-of-one-man-one-vote</ref> with H. Peyton Young<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Academic/h-peyton-young |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620191720/http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Academic/h-peyton-young |archive-date=2016-06-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> has had direct practical application in apportioning the seats of assemblies to regions in several countries (including the UK). He conceived and developed with others "[[biproportional apportionment]]" that has been adopted (as of 2014) in five of Switzerland's cantonal elections. His 2010 book with Rida Laraki<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ridalaraki/|title = Rida Laraki homepage}}</ref> proposes a new theory and method of voting called "[[majority judgment]]" where voters evaluate the merit of each candidate in a well-defined ordinal scale (instead of voting for one or several candidates, or rank-ordering them) and majorities determine society's evaluation of each candidate and thereby its rank-ordering of them all. This, they prove, overcomes the most important drawbacks of the traditional theory of voting (including [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]).<ref name="informs-awards"/>
