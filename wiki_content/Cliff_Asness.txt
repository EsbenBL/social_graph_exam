==Education==
His undergraduate studies at [[University of Pennsylvania]] included a double major in which he studied computer science and finance at [[Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology]] (M&T).<ref name="Wharton_20060901"/> In 1988, he graduated summa cum laude.<ref name="Wharton_20060901"/> Asness's interest in finance and portfolio management began, while he worked a research assistant in the Finance Department at Wharton,<ref name="Wharton_20060901"/> and learned to use "coding computer programs" to analyze markets" and "test economic and financial theories".<ref name="canadianbusiness_Castaldo_20111006"/>

In 1994, Asness completed his PhD in finance at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="UChicago_2004">{{Citation| title = Clifford S.

Asness' doctoral dissertation was on "the performance of momentum trading, buying stocks with rising prices". Asness asserted that profits consistently beating market averages were attainable by exploiting both [[value investing|value]] and [[momentum investing|momentum]]. Asness concept of ''value'' was referred to in the context of [[fundamental analysis]] as a way of assessing the true worth of a security. His use of the concept of ''momentum'' referred to betting that the value will continue to go up or down as it did in the recent past. While he did not originate these concepts, Asness was credited with being the first to compile enough empirical evidence across a wide variety of markets to bring the ideas into the academic financial mainstream.<ref name="Forbes_Vardi_20170320"/>

Asness started his career in 1990, when he was 24 and still a PhD student.<ref name="Forbes_Asness_YouTube_2014"/> In the early 1990s, he had left academia, to the regret of his mentor, to become manager of Goldman Sachs Asset Management's (GSAM) "new quantitative research desk". He invited two friends from his cohort at the University of Chicago to join him at GSAM. Together, they began "developing models to evaluate risk in currencies, bonds and entire economies."<ref name="canadianbusiness_Castaldo_20111006"/> While the "idea of factors" came from Fama and French, it was first "put into practice" in the late 1990s by Asness, according to ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref name="economist_20191005"/>

==AQR Capital==

In 1998 in New York, when he was 31-years old, Asness,  [[David Kabiller]], [[John Liew]], and [[Robert Krail]], co-founded [[AQR Capital|AQR Capital Management]]—a "quantitative hedge fund firm".<ref name="Forbes_Vardi_20170320"/>
