==Life and work==
Wilhelm was born in February 1786 in [[Hanau]], in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]].  In 1803, he started studying [[law]] at the [[University of Marburg]], one year after his brother Jacob started there. The two brothers spent their entire lives close together. In their school days, they had one bed and one table in common; as students, they had two beds and two tables in the same room. They always lived under one roof and had their books and property in common.<ref name="eb1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Grimm, Wilhelm Carl|volume=12|page=602|first=Henry|last=Sweet|author-link=Henry Sweet}}</ref>

In 1825, 39-year-old Wilhelm married pharmacist's daughter [[Henriette Dorothea Wild]], also known as Dortchen.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wilhelm's marriage did not change the harmony of the brothers.<ref name="eb1911"/> [[Richard Cleasby]] visited the brothers and observed, "they both live in the same house, and in such harmony and community that one might almost imagine the children were common property."<ref name="eb1911"/><ref>"Life of Cleasby," prefixed to his ''Icelandic Dictionary'', p. lxix.</ref>

Wilhelm's character was a complete contrast to that of his brother. As a boy, he was strong and healthy, but while growing up he suffered a long and severe illness which left him weak the rest of his life. He had a less comprehensive and energetic mind than his brother, and he had less of the spirit of investigation, preferring to confine himself to some limited and definitely bounded field of work. He utilized everything that bore directly on his own studies and ignored the rest. These studies were almost always of a literary nature.<ref name="eb1911"/>

Wilhelm took great delight in music, for which his brother had but a moderate liking, and he had a remarkable gift of story-telling. Cleasby relates that "Wilhelm read a sort of farce written in the Frankfort dialect, depicting the 'malheurs' of a rich Frankfort tradesman on a holiday jaunt on Sunday. It was very droll, and he read it admirably." Cleasby describes him as "an uncommonly animated, jovial fellow." He was, accordingly, much sought in society, which he frequented much more than his brother.<ref name="eb1911"/>

A collection of [[fairy tale]]s was first published in 1812 by the Grimm brothers, known in English as [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].

From 1837 to 1841, the Grimm brothers joined five of their colleague professors at the [[University of Göttingen]] to form a group known as the ''[[Göttinger Sieben]]'' (''The Göttingen Seven''). They protested against [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], whom they accused of violating the [[constitution]]. All seven were fired by the [[monarch|king]].

Wilhelm Grimm died in Berlin of an infection at the age of 73 on December 16, 1859.
