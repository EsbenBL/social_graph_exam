'''Spomenka Hribar''' (born 25 January 1941) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[author]], [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[politician]], [[columnist]], and [[public intellectual]]. She was one of the most influential Slovenian intellectuals in the 1980s, and was frequently called "the First Lady of [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|Slovenian Democratic Opposition]]", and "the Voice of [[Slovenian Spring]]"<ref>[[Jože Pirjevec]], ''Jugoslavija: 1918-1992. Nastanek, razvoj ter razpad Karađorđevićeve in Titove Jugoslavije'' (Koper: Založba Lipa, 1995), 382-383.</ref> She is married to the Slovenian [[Heidegger]]ian philosopher [[Tine Hribar]].

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2015}}
She was born '''Spomenka Diklić''' in [[Belgrade]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/107884/dr-spomenka-hribar|title=Dr. Spomenka Hribar profile|publisher=Mladina.Si|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> then the capital of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], to a [[Serbs|Serb]] father (Radenko Diklić) and a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] mother (Marija Jelica Mravlje). Her father died at the Glavnjača prison, where the opponents of the collaborationist state of [[Milan Nedić]] were imprisoned. After World War II, she moved with her mother to [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. She spent her childhood in the village of [[Žiri]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} After finishing high school in [[Škofja Loka]], she enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where she studied philosophy and sociology. She graduated in 1965 with a thesis on [[Marx]]'s concept of freedom. Between 1965-66, she was co-editor of the student magazine ''[[Tribuna (Slovenian magazine)|Tribuna]]''. Under her solicitation, the magazine became one of the first [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] student journals which also published pieces by students of theology. Among the young theologians sponsored by Hribar was also [[Anton Stres]], later [[archbishop of Ljubljana]] who shared the same scholarly interest as Hribar in the [[Marxist]] and [[Hegel]]ian conceptions of freedom.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1969, she got a job at the Institute for Sociology of the [[University of Ljubljana]]. Although a member of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]], she grew alienated from [[Marxism]] in the 1970s. Under the influence of the literary historian [[Dušan Pirjevec]] and the philosopher [[Tine Hribar]], whom she later married, she developed an interest in the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]]. In 1975, after the poet and thinker [[Edvard Kocbek]] publicly denounced the mass killings of [[Slovene Home Guard]] members by the [[Communist regime]] after [[World War II]], she dedicated most of her intellectual endeavours to the understanding and explaining what she called the tragedy of Slovenian resistance and revolution during and after World War II.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==The public intellectual==
In the 1980s, Spomenka and her husband Tine Hribar became important members of a newly formed circle of critical Slovene intellectuals, gathered around the journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. In 1983, she started writing the essay "Guilt and Sin" (''Krivda in greh''), which became one of the most influential texts in [[post-war]] Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200934/ustavimo_spomenko_ |title=Mladina.Si |publisher=Mladina.Si|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> In the essay, meant for publishing in a collective volume on [[Edvard Kocbek]], she denounced the mass killings in Slovenia after World War II.{{Clarify|date=August 2015}}{{Clarify|date=August 2015}}

In early 1984, the essay leaked to the officials of the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]]. In September of the same year, shortly before the planned issue of the volume, the official Slovenian press launched a campaign against Spomenka Hribar, accusing her of [[counter-revolutionary]] attitudes and [[slander]] against the [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan resistance]]. In 1985, she was expelled from the Communist Party. Despite the denigration campaign, many important public figures rose to her defence, including the sociologist [[Pavle Gantar]]. In this period, she was first called "the Slovene [[Antigone]]", an [[epitome]] that has stuck to her since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revijasrp.si/knrevsrp/revsrp21/rajsh21/odmev21.htm|title=odmev21|publisher=Revijasrp.si|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> In 1987, she was a co-author of the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program]], a collective text in which several Slovene public intellectuals and scholars demanded a sovereign and democratic Slovenian state.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Political activism==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2015}}
In 1989, she was one of the co-founders of the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]], one of the first [[anti-Communist]] parties in Slovenia. Together with her husband [[Tine Hribar]] and the jurists [[France Bučar]] and [[Peter Jambrek]] She became one of the party's foremost theoreticians. In the first free elections in Slovenia in April 1990, won by the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], she was elected to the Slovenian Parliament. Between 1990 and 1991, she was very active in the endeavours for the secession of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. Together with [[Jože Pučnik]], she emerged as the leader of the [[DEMOS coalition]] majority in the Lower Chamber of the Slovenian Parliament.

At the same time, she grew increasingly critical to the right wing of the DEMOS coalition, embodied by the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]], whom she accused of backing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and favouring their own sectarian vision of [[neo-conservative]] revisionism against the common endeavours for Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia. After the [[Ten-Day War]], Hribar turned against the conservative wing of her own party, the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The clash resulted in the split of the party between the social liberal [[Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Democratic Party]] and the liberal conservative [[National Democratic Party (Slovenia)|National Democratic Party]], which occurred in late 1991. In 1992, Hribar was among those who pushed for the dissolution of the DEMOS coalition, and backed the formation of a centre left government under the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democrat]] [[Janez Drnovšek]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Public figure after 1992==
Before the elections of 1992, Spomenka Hribar caused a famous controversy with the article "Stopping the Right Wing" (''Zaustaviti desnico'', sometimes erroneously rendered as an imperative, ''Zaustavite desnico'', that is "Stop the Right Wing!"). In the article, she warned against the rise of right wing discourse in post-independence Slovenia.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After the failure of the Democratic Party in 1992, Hribar withdrew from party politics, but remained in public life as a commentator and columnist. In her articles, she has stood up for various [[left liberal]] values in various contexts, from [[bioethics]] to immigration and integration policies.<ref name="Mladina.Si">{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200852/dr__spomenka_hribar__borka_za_clovekove_pravice|title=Mladina.Si|publisher=Mladina.Si|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Her criticism towards the Slovenian right wing gradually brought Hribar closer to the Slovenian left wing, including then- [[President of Slovenia]] [[Milan Kučan]] and the [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] reformist circles within the [[United List of Social Democrats]]. She frequently, however, took a more nationalist stand regarding foreign policy, especially the border disputes with neighbouring [[Croatia]].<ref name="Mladina.Si"/>

==Polemics with Janez Janša==
In the 1990s, Spomenka Hribar emerged as one of the strongest critics of the politician [[Janez Janša]], one of the leaders of the Slovenian right wing. The two had been close allies until 1992. In 1992, Spomenka Hribar and her husband [[Tine Hribar]] even offered Janša to take the leadership of the liberal wing of the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]]<ref>Tine Hribar, ''Slovenci kot nacija: soočanja s sodobniki'' (Ljubljana: Enotnost, 1995).</ref> However, both later accused Janša of [[populism]] and condemned his conciliatory attitude towards the conservative sections of [[Roman Catholicism in Slovenia|Slovenian Catholicism]].

Spomenka Hribar turned against Janša in 1996, denouncing his "right wing turn" and accusing him of a sectarian and paranoiac conception of politics. She later intensified her criticism, accusing him of [[authoritarianism]] and [[demagoguery]]. Differently from her husband Tine Hribar, who became more conciliatory towards Janša after 2004, seeing him as an essentially positive figure in Slovenian conservativism and implicitly supporting him in the 2004 elections,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=sl&q=tine+hribar+janez+jan%C5%A1a&start=10|title=tine hribar janez janนa - Iskanje Google|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref>

She maintained her position against the conservative politician. In 2007, she accused him of corruption and anti-democratic attitudes. Janša has accused Hribar of fostering personal animosity against his person, and stimulating a climate of [[culture war]]s in Slovenia. In Janša's view, Hribar has always had a deep disinterest in economic policies; she has failed to analyse the true power and economic relations in Slovenian society by obscuring them with both ideological mystifications and personal obsessions, thus helping the liberal economic and political establishment that has hegemonized the Slovenian public sphere since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://razgledi.net/2009/06/14/janez-jansa-o-privilegirani-upokojenki-spomenki-hribar|title=Janez Janša o privilegirani upokojenki Spomenki Hribar|publisher=Razgledi.net|date=14 June 2009|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> Spomenka's husband, [[Tine Hribar|Tine]], who shared her political views throughout the 1990s, has maintained a substantially positive opinion of Janša since 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/clanek/100827|title="Omreženi" sta tako levica kot desnica|publisher=Delo.si|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[youth wing]] of the [[New Slovenia]] party claimed Spomenka had collaborated with the [[State Security Administration|Yugoslav Secret Police]] (UDBA) based on a number with her name in leaked files. However, the file number is among the range associated with people that were monitored by the secret police, rather than those that collaborated with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/48123/ustavimo_spomenko_/|title=Ustavimo Spomenko!|publisher=Mladina.Si|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref>
