'''Ludwig Gumplowicz''' (March 9, 1838 – August 19, 1909), was a [[Poland|Polish]] sociologist, [[jurist]], [[historian]], and [[Political science|political scientist]], who taught [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]] at the [[University of Graz]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Torrance|first=John|date=1976|title=The Emergence of Sociology in Austria: 1885-1935|journal=European Journal of Sociology / Archives Européennes de Sociologie / Europäisches Archiv für Soziologie|volume=17|issue=2|pages=185–219|issn=0003-9756|jstor=23998748|doi=10.1017/S0003975600007359}}</ref> His contributions to establishing [[sociology]] as a [[social science]] are critical to his success. Gumplowicz was the first great scholar to perceive the circumstances that seem to constitute the essence of the state's origin and development as arising with the utmost precision and systemic exactness. Gumplowicz saw a [[discipline]] that could be dedicated solely to the study of the collective ties between [[social group]]s and classes as the pinnacle of [[social science]] theory, or even pure history. Beginning with this premise, he dedicated himself to studying and investigating social progress with the high intellectual impartiality of a truth seeker.

Gumplowicz was the son of a Jewish carpet and porcelain manufacturer, Abraham Gumplowicz. Gumplowicz is considered to be one of the founding fathers of sociology across German-speaking countries. While living under the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, he witnessed many violent anti-Semitic conflicts between ethnic groups, which influenced his sociological theories of social conflict and explaining social phenomenas later on in life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LENHARD|first=PHILIPP|date=2012|title=Assimilation als Untergang: Ludwig Gumplowicz' Judentum und die Frage des Antisemitismus|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23898745|journal=Zeitschrift für Religions- und Geistesgeschichte|volume=64|issue=2|pages=105–116|issn=0044-3441}}</ref> His contributions to the fields of [[social science]], [[political science]], and [[jurisprudence]] allowed these fields to expand under the lens of Gumplowicz's applications of sociological generalizations. In all three areas, he was a straightforward and vivacious writer who excelled in controversy. He was well-known for his skepticism of the permanence of [[social progress]] and his belief that the state emerges from inevitable confrontation rather than unity or divine inspiration.

==Personal life==

=== Early life and heritage ===
As a child of a Polish family of Jewish origin, Gumplowicz grew up in a family that was part of a progressive Jewish group that advocated for a comprehensive social assimilation program for all Jews. Before the outbreak of the January Insurrection of 1863, the Gumplowicz family's home was one of the outposts of conspiracy. During the Insurrection, it had become a lodging place for vulnerable youth and a refuge for the wounded. Ludwik's father, Abraham, assisted in the insurgency's planning, and his two older brothers fought alongside him.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Adamek|first1=Wojciech|last2=Radwan-Pragłowski|first2=Janusz|date=November 2006|title=Ludwik Gumplowicz: A Forgotten Classic of European Sociology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1468795X06069685|journal=Journal of Classical Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=381–398|doi=10.1177/1468795X06069685|s2cid=144007868|issn=1468-795X}}</ref> Ludwik Gumplowicz and his wife both converted to [[Calvinism]] to escape prevailing antisemitism.

Judaism was always present for Gumplowicz and his family while growing up. Therefore, the well-being of the Jewish people was essential to him. Even though his father, Abraham Gumplowicz, tried to assimilate into the community of Krakow, Jews were often seen as second-class citizens. This brought Gumplowicz many obstacles that he had to face as a Jew. He wrote several articles in which he attempted to bring attention to the issues of antisemitism and the emancipation of the Jews.

=== Educational life ===
He then went on to study at the universities of [[Kraków]] and [[Vienna]] and became a professor of [[public law]] at the [[University of Graz]] in 1875. He and his wife, Franciska, had two sons. In 1875, Gumplowicz began studying law at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. He then went to study in [[Vienna]] for a year returning to Kraków to receive a doctoral law degree.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Adamek|first1=Wojciech|last2=Radwan-Pragłowski|first2=Janusz|date=2016-07-24|title=Ludwik Gumplowicz: A Forgotten Classic of European Sociology|journal=Journal of Classical Sociology|language=en|doi=10.1177/1468795X06069685|s2cid=144007868}}</ref> He culminated in the foundation of the first Sociological Society in Graz. In 1860, he began his journalistic career. From 1869-1874 he edited his own magazine the ''Kraj'' (the ''Country''). Then in 1875, at the age of thirty-seven, he entered the [[University of Graz]] as a lecturer in the science of administration and Austrian administrative law.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kochanowski|first=I.|date=1909|title=Ludwig Gumplowicz|journal=American Journal of Sociology|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=405–409|doi=10.1086/211789|s2cid=222429153|issn=0002-9602|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2460151}}</ref> In 1882, he became an [[associate professor]], and in 1893 a full professor.<ref>[[Will Johnston|William M. Johnston]], ''The Austrian Mind: An Intellectual and Social History, 1848–1938'' (University of California Press, 1983), p. 175</ref> Gumplowicz then retired from academia in 1908.<ref name=":0" />

As a Polish intellectual, he felt a sense of imminent doom in their homeland, the strangeness of a foreign world, and then nostalgia for their homeland, and gradually became appreciated in their adopted country, though largely going unnoticed by their own compatriots.<ref name=":4" /> By rejecting orthodox jurisprudence in favor of establishing sociology that had yet to be widely accepted in Austria and Germany, he remained an outsider and at odds with university circles after years of studying and teaching his beliefs.<ref name=":2" /> He would frequently stress his [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] roots, further isolating him from university circles.

== Career ==

=== Contributions ===
Ludwig Gumplowicz's first sociological work was ''Race and State(1875)'' which was later changed to ''The Sociological Idea of the State(1881),'' then changed to ''General State Law ("Allgemeines Staats- recht") (1907).''<ref name=":0" /> His other works include the ''Outlines of Sociology, Austrian State Law, The Race Struggle, Sociological Essays, Sociology and Politics'', and others, and have been translated into other foreign languages. Gumplowicz left a huge literary legacy, with 190 works to his name, not to mention the scores of papers and reviews he wrote in Polish. His works, in general, demonstrate a certain grasp of perspective as well as a self-awareness of his own work.

==Thought==

=== Sociology of conflict ===
Gumplowicz became interested in the problem of suppressed ethnic groups very early, being from a [[Jew]]ish family and coming from Kraków, a city of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which was first [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] and later as the [[Free City of Kraków]] [[annexed]] by [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|date=2019-09-21|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Galicia_and_Lodomeria&oldid=917036347|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> He was a lifelong advocate of [[minority group|minorities]] in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], in particular, the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] speakers.<ref name=":3" />

After the republic of Cracow dissolved, the National Polish Independence movement was created, which the young Gumplowicz became a part of. This movement fought for the right to national self-determination of Poland. Gumplowicz was a young successful lawyer and committed to the movement. He took part in the uprising against Russia in 1863 and was an active member. During that time, he published the democratic magazine ''Kraj''(the country) from 1869 until 1874. 

Gumplowicz soon became interested in the later form of [[Conflict theory|sociology of conflict]], starting out from the idea of the ''[[Group (sociology)|group]]'' (then known as ''[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]''). He understood race as a social and cultural, rather than a biological phenomenon. He stressed in every way the immeasurably small role of biological heredity and the decisive role of the social environment in the determination of human behavior. While attaching a positive significance to the mixing of races, he noted that pure races had already ceased to exist.<ref name=Kon>A History of Classical Sociology. Ed. by [[Igor Kon]]. Moscow, 1989. {{ISBN|5-01-001102-6}}</ref>{{rp|85}}

==== State ====
He saw the [[Sovereign state|state]] as an institution which served various controlling [[elite]]s at different times. In analysis, he leaned towards [[macrosociology]], predicting that if the minorities of a state became socially integrated, they would break out in war. In his 1909 publication, ''Der Rassenkampf'' (Struggle of the Races), he foresaw world war. According to Gumplowicz, a state that overlapped in scope with a country and was associated with the nation in people's imagination started to take on the role of a social agent.<ref name=":4" />

'''Division of labor'''

In Gumplowicz’s view, every state imposes a system of labor division by force; as a consequence, social classes emerge, and conflict rises among the classes. Rather than creating laws based upon fairness, laws are decided by victories in class battles. In the same way that culture is a result of affluence, and leisure is made possible by conquering, higher civilization owes its existence to battles with those of lower classes. Gumplowicz rejected the idea that taking welfare measures or even social planning could preserve civilizations from eventual destruction, taking into account history to be a cyclical process.

==== Social Darwinist ====
During his life, he was considered a [[Social Darwinist]], mainly because of his approach to society as an aggregate of groups struggling ruthlessly among themselves for domination.<ref name="Kon" />{{rp|83}} Nevertheless, he did not deduce his conceptions directly from evolutionary theory and criticized those sociologists ([[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], [[Paul von Lilienfeld|Lilienfeld]]) who employed biological analogies as an explanatory principle. At the same time, he shared the naturalistic conception of history and considered humanity a particle of the universe and nature, a particle governed by the same eternal laws as the whole.<ref name=":3" />

==== Syngenism ====
Gumplowicz was most known for the idea of syngenism.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Syngenism {{!}} sociology|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/syngenism|access-date=2021-10-21|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> It is a combination of moral, physical, economic, and cultural elements that have been blended in varying amounts across time and among various social groupings. Consanguinity was the primary link in the groupings, but as the world evolves, economic and mental pressures became increasingly significant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Harry E.|date=1919|title=The Struggle of Races and Social Groups as a Factor in the Development of Political and Social Institutions: An Exposition and Critique of the Sociological System of Ludwig Gumplowicz|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/29738318|journal=The Journal of Race Development|volume=9|issue=4|pages=394–419|doi=10.2307/29738318|issn=1068-3380}}</ref> Gumplowicz defines syngenism as "That phenomenon which consists in the fact that invariably in associated modes of life, definite groups of men, feeling themselves closely bound together by common interests, endeavor to function as a single element in the struggle for domination.” Human beings, according to Gumplowicz, have an inherent propensity to form communities and create a sense of unity. He called this [https://www.britannica.com/topic/syngenism syngenism] (syngenetic). Syngenism is a term used to describe a society with a distinct culture that develops a sense of belonging as a whole, as well as a sense of brotherhood in the sense that they are of the same species.<ref name=":4" />

== Influences ==
His political beliefs and his polemic character attracted many Polish and [[Italian people|Italian]] students, making his theories important in Poland, Italy, and other crown states (today [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]]). But the fact that he published his works in [[German language|German]] meant that he was also an important figure in German-speaking countries. [[Gustav Ratzenhofer]] was the most prominent of those influenced by him. Gustav Ratzenhofer was the sociologist which Gumplowicz thought most highly of.<ref name=":0" /> Philosophers [[Carlo Cattaneo]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and Gustav Ratenhofer were all men that Ludwig Gumplowicz had shared similar ideas. Although they were all different from one another, they shared the same goals and point of views. Their shared goal was of reevaluating social moral values. These social moral values were seen by society to be permanent and unchangeable. This was what brought these men to their shared aim of studying social norms and groups to help redefine the principles that people live by.

Prada lived in Peru and found Grumplowicz’s theories on ethnic conflict useful for understanding not only the Spanish conquest of [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples during the sixteenth century but also how the descendants of the Spanish (and other European immigrants) continued to subordinate the indigenous peoples. Most striking in this regard is [[Manuel González Prada|González Prada]]’s essay ''"Our Indians"'' included in his ''Horas de lucha'' after 1924.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://evergreen.loyola.edu/tward/www/gp/english/Indians.htm|title=Manuel Gonzalez Prada, "Our Indians"|website=evergreen.loyola.edu|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> Brazilian essayist [[Euclides da Cunha]] also acknowledges Gumplowicz's influence in the preliminary note to his influential study [[Os Sertões]] (1902), an in-depth analysis of the 1895-1989 [[War of Canudos]] between Brazil's Republican government and the residents of [[Canudos]] in the backlands of [[Bahia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=Tt7OAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&dq=os+sert%C3%B5es&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj59Oyf0aLrAhXNHLkGHan3CjYQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false Os Sertões, Euclides da Cunha (2010).] Retrieved 2020-08-17.</ref>

=== Referenced work ===
In his publication, ''The Outlines on Sociology'' (1899), Gumplowicz reviews the works of Comte, Spencer, Bastian, and Lippert. He also reviews the relations of economics, politics, the comparative study of law, the philosophy of history, and the history of civilization to the science of society. Many of Gumplowicz's major works are written in German.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Outlines of Sociology|last1=Moore|first1=Frederick|last2=Gumplowicz|first2=Ludwig|publisher=Arno Press|year=1975}}</ref>

Sociologists influenced by him were [[Gustav Ratzenhofer]], [[Albion Woodbury Small|Albion W. Small]], [[Franz Oppenheimer]]. The social scientists [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Léon Duguit|León Duguit]], [[Harold Laski|Harold J.

== Criticism ==
A criticism of Gumplowicz's work is that he presents a rather narrow interpretation of the nature of social phenomena. He placed a large emphasis on social groups as well as the sociological investigation of their conflict as a unit. In doing so, Gumplowicz minimized the importance of the individual and magnified the coercion and determination that is excepted by the group to the individual. This was further than other sociologists, such as Durkheim, Sighele, LeBon, or Trotter went.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Harry E.|date=1919|title=The Struggle of Races and Social Groups as a Factor in the Development of Political and Social Institutions: An Exposition and Critique of the Sociological System of Ludwig Gumplowicz|journal=The Journal of Race Development|volume=9|issue=4|pages=394–419|doi=10.2307/29738318|issn=1068-3380|jstor=29738318}}</ref>

Critical authors like [[Jerzy Szacki]] have stated that Gumplowicz's influence was undoubtedly aided by the fact that his scholarly work took place outside of the time's major intellectual centers, as well as the fact that his more intriguing theories about his sociological method were more thoroughly developed by other theorists, such as sociologism by [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and conflict theory by [[Karl Marx|Marx]].<ref name=":4" />

== Legacy ==
Gumplowicz defined sociology as the science of society and social laws. He devoted his life to the study of relations common to social classes and groups. He was a seeker of truth and went through many obstacles in his journey of studying social events. He goes on to write the popular quote: “No chemist would ask whether oxygen did well in uniting with hydrogen, or whether it is right in mixing with quicksilver. No astronomer would ask, whether the moon, in appearing between sun and earth is worthy of praise or blame-but no historian could be found who would consider it unjustified to judge about the "right" or "wrong" action of King X or Minister Y; who would refrain from praise or blame in the conception of any action whatever.”

== Death ==

On August 19 of 1909, Ludwig Gumplowicz and his wife, Franciska, both committed suicide by poison.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Lester F.|date=1909|title=Ludwig Gumplowicz|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2098356|journal=American Journal of Sociology|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=410–413|doi=10.1086/211790|s2cid=222430255|issn=0002-9602}}</ref> Gumplowicz was diagnosed with cancer at the end of 1907, and his health was failing, as was Franciska's health. In a letter, he wrote ''"we are both thinking more of the other side (<small>an's Jenseits denizen</small>), and life is a burden to us."'' As such, they both ended their life together, ending the pain of Gumplowicz' cancer.<ref name=":0" /> Gumplowicz’s death was deeply shocking to the world. His influence as a great thinker, writer, philosopher, jurist, historian, and sociologist has changed the course of sociological history. The students of Gumplowicz often referred to him as an angel with a great soul and a magnificent thinker. In his honor, a sociological society was created in the city of [[Graz]] after his passing. Gumplowicz was highly looked up to by many philosophers and sociologists and they emphasize their appreciation for his journey of seeking the truth and ideas.
