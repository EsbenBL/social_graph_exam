==Career==
He served as John A. McCone Professor of International Relations at [[University of Southern California|USC]] from 1995 until his death in 2007. Previously, he was a senior professor of political science at MIT, and before that was a full Professor at Yale by age 29.<ref name="usc.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/14186.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526153255/http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/14186.html |archivedate=2011-05-26 }} </ref> From 1992-1993, he was the President of the [[International Studies Association]] (ISA). Professor Alker received appointments as a visiting professor at a number of institutions, including [[Brown University]], [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]], and the [[University of Michigan]]. He was the first [[Olof Palme]] Professor at the [[University of Uppsala]] and [[University of Stockholm]] in [[Sweden]]. He was awarded a 1996 fellowship to study [[chaos theory]] at the [[Santa Fe Institute]].

==Research and influence==
His 1996 book ''Rediscoveries and reformulations: humanistic methodologies for international studies'' (Cambridge U, {{ISBN|978-0-521-46130-6}}) collected his essays that offer [[humanistic]] alternatives to the conventional [[scientific]] approaches within international studies. Professor Alker was one of the 12 key contemporary thinkers covered in the 1997 book "The Future of International Relations," edited by [[Iver Neumann]]. His writings have influenced numerous scholars. 

His former students recall his generosity with time and his intellectual creativity. Rather than rewarding only the PhD students who followed his own [[Imre_Lakatos#Research_programmes|research program]], as some professors do, he stimulated and inspired a wide variety of budding intellects. Prof. [[Joshua Goldstein]] wrote: "He was consciously, purposefully multi-methodological and multi-theoretical. He always pushed his students to find other theoretical perspectives and to use multiple methodologies. That had a huge effect on my career."<ref name="usc.edu"/> Prof. [[Thomas J. Biersteker]] wrote: "When I think of the intellectual legacy of Hayward Alker, a number of phrases come immediately to mind – enormous intellect, insatiable curiosity, exuberant enthusiasm for ideas, intellectual breadth, extraordinary generosity, and most of all, immense vitality... Hayward had an influence on the profession and scholarship of international relations that went far beyond the small number of us who were fortunate enough to have been his students... I have received testimonies from prominent scholars at Oxford, Brown, and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva – from individuals who were never formally students of Hayward's – about his impact on their work." Prof. [[Patrick Thadeus Jackson|Patrick Jackson]] wrote: "He was a thoughtful reader even of the work of a young scholar who had not been one of his students, or even one of his grandstudents. I find that attitude somewhat rare in academia these days... And his enthusiasm -- for methodological pluralism, for humanistic-but-rigorous IR scholarship, for ideas -- was contagious!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://duckofminerva.blogspot.com/2007/08/hayward-alker.html|title=The Duck of Minerva: Hayward Alker|website=Duckofminerva.blogspot.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref>

A memorial conference in his honor was held at the [[Watson Institute for International Studies]], [[Brown University]], 6–7 June 2008. A ''[[festschrift]]'' in his honor resulted in a book, ''Alker and IR: Global Studies in an Interconnected World'' (Routledge 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-415-61597-6}}), edited by [[Renée Marlin-Bennett]]. Another book, edited by [[Tahir Amin]], is entitled ''Word Orders in Central Asia: Essays in honor of Hayward R. Alker'' (Brown University, forthcoming). The Department of International Relations at [[Quaid-i-Azam University]] in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]], inaugurated the Dr Hayward R. Alker Library in his honor in 2009, containing hundreds of books and papers from Alker's collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online//Regional/10-Apr-2009/Dr-Hayward-Alker-IR-library-set-up-at-QAU |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165930/http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online//Regional/10-Apr-2009/Dr-Hayward-Alker-IR-library-set-up-at-QAU |archivedate=2011-09-27 }} </ref>
