'''Bulgaria''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bulgaria.ogg|b|ʌ|l|ˈ|ɡ|ɛər|i|ə|,_|b|ʊ|l|-}}; {{lang-bg|България|Bǎlgariya}}), officially the '''Republic of Bulgaria''',{{efn|{{lang-bg|Република България|links=no|Republika Bǎlgariya}}, {{IPA-bg|rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ|IPA}})}} is a country in [[Southeast Europe]]. It lies on the eastern flank of the [[Balkans]], and is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. Bulgaria covers a territory of {{convert|110994|km2}}, and is the [[List of European countries by area|sixteenth-largest country]] in Europe. [[Sofia]] is the nation's capital and [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|largest city]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]] and [[Burgas]].

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. After the Roman state splintered, tribal invasions in the region resumed. Around the 6th century, these territories were settled by the [[early Slavs]]. [[Bulgars]], a semi-nomadic people, invaded the Balkans in the late 7th century and founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681. It dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. The First Bulgarian Empire lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|successful Bulgarian revolt]] in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated in 1396 and fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries.

The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] resulted in the formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the new nation's borders, which stoked [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria came under the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]] and became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|socialist state]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[Multi-party system|multiparty]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] composed of 28 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation.

Bulgaria is a [[developing country]], with an [[Economy of Bulgaria|upper-middle-income economy]], ranking 56th in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and is largely based on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. [[Corruption in Bulgaria|Widespread corruption]] is a major socioeconomic issue; Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.transparency.org/files/content/pages/2018_CPI_Executive_Summary.pdf |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 Executive Summary |page=12 |publisher=[[Transparency International]] |access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> The country also faces a demographic crisis, with its population shrinking annually since around 1990; it currently numbers roughly seven million, down from a peak of nearly nine million in 1988. Bulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is also a founding member of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and has taken a seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]] three times.

==Etymology==
The name ''Bulgaria'' is derived from the ''[[Bulgars]]'', a tribe of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin that founded the First Bulgarian Empire. Their name is not completely understood and is difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD,{{sfn|Golden|1992|pages=103–104}} but it is possibly derived from the [[Proto-Turkic]] word ''bulģha'' ("to mix", "shake", "stir") and its derivative ''bulgak'' ("revolt", "disorder").<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowersock|first=Glen W.|title=Late Antiquity: a Guide to the Postclassical World|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=354|year=1999|isbn=978-0674511736|url={{Google books|c788wWR_bLwC|page=354|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> The meaning may be further extended to "rebel", "incite" or "produce a state of disorder", and so, in the derivative, the "disturbers".{{sfn|Chen|2012|page=97}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Petersen|first=Leif Inge Ree|title=Siege Warfare and Military Organization in the Successor States (400–800 AD): Byzantium, the West and Islam|publisher=Brill |year=2013|page=369 |isbn=978-9004254466|url={{Google books|BRGaAAAAQBAJ|page=369|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref>{{sfn|Golden|1992|page=104}} Tribal groups in [[Inner Asia]] with phonologically close names were frequently described in similar terms, as the [[Jie people|Buluoji]], a component of the "[[Five Barbarians|Five Barbarian]]" groups, which during the 4th century were portrayed as both: a "mixed race" and "troublemakers".{{sfn|Chen|2012|pages=92–95, 97}}

Bulgaria is a small country situated in Southeastern Europe, in the east of the Balkans. Its territory covers an area of {{convert|110994|km2|0}}, while its land borders with its five neighbouring countries have a total length of {{convert|1808|km|0}}, and its coastline has a length of {{convert|354|km|0}}.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}} Bulgaria's geographic coordinates are [[43rd parallel north|43° N]] [[25th meridian east|25° E]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/bulgaria/|title=Bulgaria|website=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=4 December 2011}}</ref> The most notable [[topographical]] features of the country are the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the [[Balkan Mountains]], the [[Thracian Plain]], and the [[Rila]]-[[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] [[massif]].{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}} The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the [[Danube]] defines the border with Romania. The [[Thracia]]n Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of [[Sofia]] and broadening as it reaches the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea coast]].{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}}

The Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country from west to east. The mountainous southwest has two distinct [[Glacial landform|alpine type]] ranges—[[Rila]] and [[Pirin]], which border the lower but more extensive [[Rhodope Mountains]] to the east, and various medium altitude mountains to west, northwest and south, like [[Vitosha]], [[Osogovo]] and [[Belasitsa]].{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}} [[Musala]], at {{convert|2925|m|ft|0}}, is the highest point in both Bulgaria and the Balkans. The Black Sea coast is the country's lowest point.<ref name="CIA World Factbook"/> Plains occupy about one third of the territory, while plateaux and hills occupy 41%.{{Sfn|Topography}} Most rivers are short and with low water levels. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]], has a length of {{convert|368|km|0}}. The [[Struma River|Struma]] and the [[Maritsa]] are two major rivers in the south.{{Sfn|NSI Brochure|2018|pages=2–3}}{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}}

Bulgaria has a varied and changeable climate, which results from being positioned at the meeting point of the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] and [[Continental climate|Continental]] air masses combined with the barrier effect of its mountains.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=4}} Northern Bulgaria averages {{convert|1|C-change|1}} cooler, and registers {{convert|200|mm|1}} more precipitation, than the regions south of the Balkan mountains. Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas. The lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-38.3|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}}, while the highest is {{convert|45.2|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/bulnc2.pdf|title=Bulgaria Second National Communication|publisher=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]|access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] averages about {{convert|630|mm|in|1}} per year, and varies from {{convert|500|mm|1}} in [[Dobrudja]] to more than {{convert|2500|mm|1}} in the mountains.

Bulgaria is a [[parliamentary democracy]] where the [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]] and the most powerful executive position.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}} The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with [[universal suffrage]] for [[citizen]]s at least 18 years old. The [[Constitution of Bulgaria|Constitution]] also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national [[referendum|referenda]].<ref name="DD-Navi">{{cite web|url=http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/countries/bulgaria/legal_designs|title=Overview of direct democratic instruments in Bulgaria|publisher=Navigator to Direct Democracy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183501/http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/countries/bulgaria/legal_designs|archive-date=16 January 2014|access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref> Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=17}} Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}}

Unlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected [[President of Bulgaria|president]] serves as [[head of state]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the [[presidential veto]] by a simple majority vote.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}} Political parties gather in the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|National Assembly]], a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|pages=16–17}}
