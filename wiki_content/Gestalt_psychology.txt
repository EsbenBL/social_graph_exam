==Origin and history==
{{further|History of psychology#Gestalt psychology}}

[[Max Wertheimer]] (1880–1943), [[Kurt Koffka]] (1886–1941), and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] (1887–1967) founded Gestalt psychology in the early 20th century.<ref name = Sternberg6e>{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|last2=Sternberg|first2=Karin|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-31391-5|edition=6th|location=Belmont, Calif. |pages=113–116}}</ref> The dominant view in psychology at the time was [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]], exemplified by the work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821–1894), [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832–1920), and [[Edward B. Titchener]] (1867–1927).<ref name=Wagemans2012II/><ref name=Kolers1972p3>{{Cite book| publisher = Pergamon| isbn = 978-1-4831-7113-5| last = Kolers| first = Paul A.| title = Aspects of Motion Perception: International Series of Monographs in Experimental Psychology| location = New York| date = 1972| pages = 3}}</ref> Structuralism was rooted firmly in British [[empiricism]]<ref name=Wagemans2012II/><ref name=Kolers1972p3/> and was based on three closely interrelated theories: (1) "atomism," also known as "elementalism,"<ref name=Kolers1972p3/> the view that all knowledge, even complex abstract ideas, is built from simple, elementary constituents, (2) "sensationalism," the view that the simplest constituents—the atoms of thought—are elementary [[Sense data|sense impressions]], and (3) "associationism," the view that more complex ideas arise from the association of simpler ideas.<ref name=Kolers1972p3/><ref>{{Cite book| edition = eBook| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-315-47329-1| last = Hamlyn| first = D.

Wertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (1859–1932), a member of the [[School of Brentano]]. Von Ehrenfels introduced the concept of ''Gestalt'' to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such.<ref name = Smith1988>{{Cite book| publisher = Philosophia Verlag| editor-last = Smith| editor-first = Barry| last = Smith| first = Barry|title = Foundations of Gestalt Theory| chapter = Gestalt Theory: An Essay in Philosophy| location = Vienna| access-date = 2019-10-12| date = 1988| url = http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/book/FoGT/Contents.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222044129/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/book/FoGT/Contents.htm| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2012-02-22| chapter-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222044129/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/gestalt.pdf| pages = 11–81}}</ref><ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory components.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> He claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something extra. Although in some sense derived from the organization of the component sensory elements, this further quality is an element in its own right. He called it ''Gestalt-qualität'' or "form-quality." For instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them that binds them together into a tune&nbsp;– the ''Gestalt-qualität''. It is this ''Gestalt-qualität'' that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identity. The idea of a ''Gestalt-qualität'' has roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively.<ref name="Smith1988" />

By 1914, the first published references to Gestalt theory could be found in a footnote of [[Gabriele von Wartensleben]]'s application of Gestalt theory to personality. She was a student at Frankfurt Academy for Social Sciences, who interacted deeply with Wertheimer and Köhler.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=King|first1=D.

Through a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the other. He noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving object. That is, it was pure phenomenal motion. He dubbed it [[phi phenomenon|phi ("phenomenal") motion]].<ref name = Smith1988/><ref name=Wagemans2012I>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/a0029333| issn = 1939-1455| volume = 138| issue = 6| pages = 1172–1217| last1 = Wagemans| first1 = Johan| last2 = Elder| first2 = James H.| last3 = Kubovy| first3 = Michael| last4 = Palmer| first4 = Stephen E.| last5 = Peterson| first5 = Mary A.| last6 = Singh| first6 = Manish| last7 = von der Heydt| first7 = Rüdiger| title = A century of Gestalt psychology in visual perception: I.

The gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>  Wertheimer took the more radical position that "what is given me by the melody does not arise ... as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as such. Instead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is", (1925/1938). In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first—it is given "im-mediately" (i.e., its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation). Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.

The two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiments were Köhler and Koffka. Köhler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist [[Max Planck]] (1858–1947), but had taken his degree in psychology under [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848–1936). Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917, Köhler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. Köhler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by "sudden insight" into the "structure" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that [[Ivan Pavlov]] (1849–1936) and [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] (1874–1949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.

The terms "structure" and "organization" were focal for the Gestalt psychologists. Stimuli were said to have a certain structure, to be organized in a certain way, and that it is to this structural organization, rather than to individual sensory elements, that the organism responds. When an animal is conditioned, it does not simply respond to the absolute properties of a stimulus, but to its properties relative to its surroundings. To use a favorite example of Köhler's, if conditioned to respond in a certain way to the lighter of two gray cards, the animal generalizes the relation between the two stimuli rather than the absolute properties of the conditioned stimulus: it will respond to the lighter of two cards in subsequent trials even if the darker card in the test trial is of the same intensity as the lighter one in the original training trials.

In 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, ''Growth of the Mind''. With the help of American psychologist [[Robert Morris Ogden|Robert Ogden]], Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at [[Smith College]] in 1927. In 1935, Koffka published his ''Principles of Gestalt Psychology''. This textbook laid out the ''Gestalt'' vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the ''Gestaltists'' was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other "scientific categories": questions of order and questions of ''Sinn'', a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.

===Gestalt therapy===
Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the [[Gestalt therapy]], which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology. The founders of Gestalt therapy, [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.<ref>Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893–1933. Expressionism – Psychonalysis – Judaism'', 2010, p. 190, EHP Verlag Andreas Kohlhage, Bergisch Gladbach.</ref> The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case, it is not identical to Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term "Gestalt" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it;<ref>Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.</ref>, on the other hand, Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.<ref>Allen R. Barlow,  [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm "Gestalt-Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident"], ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, (Fall, 1981)</ref> Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most Gestalt psychologists emphasize that Gestalt therapy is not a form of Gestalt psychology.

[[Mary Henle]] noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is ''not'' Gestalt psychology"<ref>Mary Henle 1975: [http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'']; Presidential Address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Chicago, September 1975. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 14, pp 23-32.</ref> With her analysis, however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.<ref>See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt – Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.</ref>

There have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe. For example, a strictly Gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German Gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-Jürgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.

== Contributions ==
Gestalt psychology made many contributions to the body of psychology. The Gestaltists were the first to demonstrate empirically and document many facts about perception—including facts about the [[Motion perception|perception of movement]], the [[Form perception|perception of contour]], [[Subjective constancy|perceptual constancy]], and [[Illusion|perceptual illusions]].<ref name="Smith1988" /> Wertheimer's discovery of the phi phenomenon is one example of such a contribution.<ref name="Gobet2017">{{Citation

The following subsections discuss these contributions in turn.

===Theoretical framework and methodology===
The Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.

The theoretical principles are the following:
* '''Principle of Totality'''—Conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships. Wertheimer described [[Holism in science|holism]] as fundamental to Gestalt psychology,<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> writing "There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole."<ref>{{Cite book

* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' – Köhler hypothesized that there is a [[correlation]] between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>

Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:
* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''—In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.
* '''Biotic experiment'''—The Gestalt psychologists established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [[fidelity]], what would be habitual for a subject.<ref>William Ray Woodward, Robert Sonné Cohen – World views and scientific discipline formation: science studies in the German Democratic Republic: papers from a German-American summer institute, 1988</ref>

===Properties===
The key principles of gestalt systems are [[emergence]], reification, [[multistability]] and [[wikt:invariance|invariance]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World in your Head: A Gestalt View of the Mechanism of Conscious Experience|last=Steven.|first=Lehar|date=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|isbn=0805841768|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=52051454|url=http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book/WIYH.html}}</ref>

====Reification====<!-- This section is linked from [[Reification]] -->
{{See also|Reification (fallacy)}}

[[Image:Reification.svg|left|thumb|260px|Reification]]

Reification is the ''constructive'' or ''generative'' aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.

For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture '''A''', though no triangle is there. In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as "belonging" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.

Reification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as "real" contours.

{{clear left}}

====Multistability====
[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|The [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]

[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, Gestalt psychology does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.

{{clear left}}

====Invariance====
[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]

Invariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which is immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.

Emergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |access-date=2012-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archive-date=2012-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Figure-Ground Organization===

The perceptual field (what an organism perceives) is organized. Figure-ground organization is one form of perceptual organization.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/> Figure-ground organization is the interpretation of perceptual elements in terms of their shapes and relative locations in the layout of surfaces in the 3-D world.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/> Figure-ground organization structures the perceptual field into a figure (standing out at the front of the perceptual field) and a background (receding behind the figure).<ref name="Brennan">{{Cite book|title=History and Systems of Psychology|last1=Brennan|first1=James F.|last2=Houde|first2=Keith A.|date=2017-10-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107178670|doi=10.1017/9781316827178}}</ref> Pioneering work on figure-ground organization was carried out by the Danish psychologist [[Edgar Rubin]]. The Gestalt psychologists demonstrated that we tend to perceive as figures those parts of our perceptual fields that are convex, symmetric, small, and enclosed.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>

===''Prägnanz''===
{{Main|Principles of grouping}}

Like figure-ground organization, perceptual grouping (sometimes called perceptual segregation<ref name=Eysenck2008>{{Cite book| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-1-84169-374-3| last = Eysenck| first = Michael W.| title = Fundamentals of Cognition| location = Hove, UK| date = 2006| pages = 62–64}}</ref>) is a form of perceptual organization.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/> Organisms perceive some parts of their perceptual fields as "hanging together" more tightly than others.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/> They use this information for [[object detection]].<ref name=Eysenck2008/> Perceptual grouping is the process that determines what these "pieces" of the perceptual field are.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>

The Gestaltists were the first psychologists to systematically study perceptual grouping.<ref name=Eysenck2008/> According to Gestalt psychologists, the fundamental principle of perceptual grouping is the law of Prägnanz.<ref name=Eysenck2008/> (The law of Prägnanz is also known as the law of good Gestalt.) ''Prägnanz'' is a German word that directly translates to "pithiness" and implies salience, conciseness, and orderliness.<ref name="todorvic" /> The law of Prägnanz says that we tend to experience things as regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple. As Koffka put it, "Of several geometrically possible organizations that one will actually occur which possesses the best, simplest and most stable shape."<ref name = Koffka1935>{{Cite book| publisher = Harcourt, Brace| last = Koffka| first = K.| title = Principles Of Gestalt Psychology| location = New York| access-date = 2019-10-13| date = 1935| url = http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888}}</ref>

The law of Prägnanz implies that, as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good Gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of Gestalt theory is based on.<ref name="stevenson" />

A major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as wholes rather than as the sums of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.

Gestalt [[psychologist]]s attempted to discover refinements of the law of ''Prägnanz'', and this involved writing down [[law (principle)|laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what is often called "gestalt laws".<ref name="gestaltpsych">Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]© 2003.</ref> Wertheimer defined a few principles that explain the ways humans perceive objects. Those principles were based on similarity, proximity, continuity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7vd7JQ4zlcC&q=gestalt|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|last1=Craighead|first1=W. Edward|last2=Nemeroff|first2=Charles B.|date=2004-04-19|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780471220367|pages=401–404|language=en|chapter=Gestalt psychology}}</ref> The Gestalt concept is based on perceiving reality in its simplest form.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgAQAQAAIAAJ&q=%22gestalt|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology|last=Reber|first=Arthur S.|date=1985|publisher=Viking|isbn=9780670801367|language=en|chapter=Gestalt psychology}}</ref>  The various laws are called ''laws'' or ''principles'', depending on the paper where they appear—but for simplicity's sake, this article uses the term ''laws''. These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory (Bregman – GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].

====Law of Proximity====
[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]
The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups. Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.<ref name=stevenson>{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|access-date=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Soegaard>{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|access-date=8 April 2012}}</ref>

====Law of Similarity====
[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]
The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.<ref name="Soegaard"/>

====Law of Closure====
[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]
Gestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Perception|last=Hamlyn|first=D. W.|date=2017-03-27|isbn=9781315473291|doi=10.4324/9781315473291}}</ref> For example, a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completeness. However, we will also perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circle.<ref name="Brennan" /> That tendency to complete shapes and figures is called closure.<ref name="Brennan" /> The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.<ref name="stevenson"/><ref name="Soegaard"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>

====Law of Symmetry====
[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb|Law of symmetry]]
The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.<ref name="stevenson"/><ref name="Soegaard"/>

====Law of Common Fate====
The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that the movement of elements of an object produces paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.<ref name=todorvic>{{cite journal|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles|volume=3|issue=12|pages=5345|journal=[[Scholarpedia]] |access-date=5 April 2012 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.5345|year=2008|bibcode=2008SchpJ...3.5345T|doi-access=free}}</ref>

====Law of Continuity====
[[File:CrossKeys.png|alt=|thumb|Law of continuity]]
The law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.<ref name="stevenson"/>

====Law of Past Experience====
The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters "L" and "I" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.<ref name="todorvic" />

====Music====
An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.<ref>{{cite book|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}</ref>

===Problem solving and insight===
Gestalt psychology contributed to the scientific study of problem solving.<ref name=Gobet2017 /> In fact, the early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany<ref name=Duncker>For example, {{cite book |author-last = Duncker| author-first = Karl| year = 1935 | title = Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens| language = de | trans-title = The psychology of productive thinking| location = Berlin| publisher = Julius Springer}}</ref> marks the beginning of the scientific study of problem solving. Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple (but novel for participants) laboratory tasks of problem solving.<ref>For example Duncker's "X-ray" problem; Ewert & Lambert's "disk" problem in 1932, later known as [[Tower of Hanoi]].</ref><ref>{{Wikicite | id= Mayer| reference= Mayer, R. E. (1992). ''Thinking, problem solving, cognition''. Second edition. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.}}</ref>

Given Gestalt psychology's focus on the whole, it was natural for Gestalt psychologists to study problem-solving from the perspective of [[insight]], seeking to understand the process by which organisms sometimes suddenly transition from having no idea how to solve a problem to instantly understanding the whole problem and its solution.<ref name = Sternberg6ep13/> In a famous set of experiments, Köhler gave chimpanzees some boxes and placed food high off the ground; after some time, the chimpanzees appeared to suddenly realize that they could stack the boxes on top of each other to reach the food.<ref name=Kellogg2003p362>{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = SAGE Publications| isbn = 0-7619-2130-3| last = Kellogg| first = Ronald T.| title = Cognitive Psychology| location = Thousand Oaks, CA| date = 2003| pages = 362}}</ref>

Max Wertheimer distinguished two kinds of thinking: productive thinking and reproductive thinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|last2=Sternberg|first2=Karin|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-31391-5|edition=6th|location=Belmont, Calif|pages=456}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Harper| last = Wertheimer| first = Max| title = Productive thinking| location = New York| date = 1945}}</ref><ref name=Kellogg2003p361>{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = SAGE Publications| isbn = 0-7619-2130-3| last = Kellogg| first = Ronald T.| title = Cognitive Psychology| location = Thousand Oaks, CA| date = 2003| pages = 361}}</ref> ''Productive thinking'' is solving a problem based on insight—a quick, creative, unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction. ''Reproductive thinking'' is solving a problem deliberately based on previous experience and knowledge. Reproductive thinking proceeds [[algorithm]]ically—a problem solver reproduces a series of steps from memory, knowing that they will lead to a solution—or by [[trial and error]].<ref name=Kellogg2003p361 />

[[Karl Duncker]], another Gestalt psychologist who studied problem solving,<ref name=Kellogg2003p370>{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = SAGE Publications| isbn = 0-7619-2130-3| last = Kellogg| first = Ronald T.| title = Cognitive Psychology| location = Thousand Oaks, CA| date = 2003| pages = 370}}</ref>  coined the term [[functional fixedness]] for describing the difficulties in both visual perception and problem solving that arise from the fact that one element of a whole situation already has a (fixed) function that has to be changed in order to perceive something or find the solution to a problem.<ref>''Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens'', Springer, Berlin 1935</ref>

[[Abraham S. Luchins|Abraham Luchins]] also studied problem solving from the perspective of Gestalt psychology. He is well known for his research on the role of ''mental set'' ([[Einstellung effect]]), which he demonstrated using a series of problems having to do with refilling water jars.<ref name=Kellogg2003p383>{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = SAGE Publications| isbn = 0-7619-2130-3| last = Kellogg| first = Ronald T.| title = Cognitive Psychology| location = Thousand Oaks, CA| date = 2003| pages = 383}}</ref>

Another Gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:

# Unconscious leap in thinking.<ref name="gestaltpsych" />
# The increased amount of speed in mental processing.
# The amount of short-circuiting that occurs in normal reasoning.<ref name="gpsych">Langley& associates, 1987; Perkins, 1981; Weisberg, 1986,1995"</ref>

Views going against the Gestalt psychology are:

#[[Insight phenomenology|Nothing-special view]]
# Neo-gestalt view
#[[The Three-Process View]]

===Fuzzy-trace theory of memory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], a dual process model of memory and reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|year=2012|title=A new institutionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332–359|pmc=4268540|pmid=25530822}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=Lauren|year=2014|title=Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions|journal=Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems|series=Communications in Computer and Information Science|volume=443|pages=163–173|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08855-6_17|isbn=978-3-319-08854-9}}</ref>

=== Support from cybernetics and neurology ===
In the 1940s and 1950s, [[laboratory]] research in [[neurology]] and what became known as [[cybernetics]] on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that [[perception]] of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts ''in motion'') is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:

:A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.<ref>Lettvin, J.Y., Maturana, H.R., Pitts, W.H., and McCulloch, W.S. (1961). Two Remarks on the Visual System of the Frog. In Sensory Communication edited by Walter Rosenblith, MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons: New York</ref>

:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, "fixes" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result, the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image "marks time" in the vicinity of this point.<ref>Valentin Fedorovich Turchin – The phenomenon of science – a cybernetic approach to human evolution – Columbia University Press, 1977</ref>

In the 1990s, [[Andranik Tangian]] developed a model of [[machine perception|artificial perception]] that implemented a so-called [[principle of correlativity of perception |principle of correlativity]], which operationalized the Gestalt psychology laws in their interaction. The model finds structures in data without knowing the structures, similarly to segregating elements in abstract painting—like curves, contours and spots—without identifying them with known objects. The approach is based on the least complex data representations in the sense of [[Kolmogorov]], i.e. requiring the least memory storage, which is regarded as saving the brain energy. The least complexity criterion leads to multi-level data representations in terms of generative patterns and their transformations, using proximities, similarities, symmetries, common fate grouping, continuities, etc. The idea that perception is data representation rather than "physical" recognition is illustrated by the effect of several voices produced by a single physical body—a loudspeaker membrane, whereas the effect of a single tone is produced by several physical bodies—organ pipes tuned as a chord and activated by a single key. It is shown that the physical causality in certain observations can be revealed through optimal data representations, and this nature–information duality is explained by the fact that both nature and information are subordinated to the same principle of efficiency. In some situations, the least complex data representations use the patterns already stored in the memory, demonstrating the dependence of perception on previous knowledge—in line with the Gestalt psychology law of past experience. Such an ''intelligent'' perception as opposed to the ''naïve'' perception that is based exclusively on direct percepts and is therefore context-dependent. The model is applied to automatic notation of music—recognition of interval structures in chords and polyphonic voices (with no reference to pitch, thereby relying on interval hearing instead of absolute hearing) as well as rhythms under variable tempo, approaching the capabilities of trained musicians. The model is also relevant to visual scene analysis and explains some modes of abstract thinking.<ref name="Tanguiane1993">{{Cite book

===Quantum cognition modeling===
{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}

Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that "similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.<ref>Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment.

===Contemporary cognitive and perceptual psychology===

Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception.<ref name="Jakel2016">{{citation|author=Jäkel, F., Singh, M., Wichmann, F. A., & Herzog, M. H.|title=An overview of quantitative approaches in Gestalt perception.|journal=Vision Research|volume=126|pages=3–8|year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2016.06.004|pmid=27353224|doi-access=free}}</ref> Researchers continue to test hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying Gestalt principles such as the principle of similarity.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2018.08.006| pmid = 30212653| issn = 0010-0277| volume = 182| pages = 8–13| last1 = Yu| first1 = Dian| last2 = Tam| first2 = Derek| last3 = Franconeri| first3 = Steven L.| title = Gestalt similarity groupings are not constructed in parallel| journal = Cognition| date = 2019| s2cid = 52269830}}</ref>

Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many [[Physiology|physiological]] assumptions made by gestaltists<ref name="Schultz2013">{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Psychology|last=Schultz|first=Duane|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2013|isbn=978-1483270081|location=Burlington|page=291}}</ref> and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.<ref name=Jakel2016/>

In some scholarly communities, such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[computational neuroscience]], gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being ''descriptive'' rather than ''explanatory'' in nature.  For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, a textbook on visual perception states that, "The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their 'laws' of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a 'good' or 'simple' shape, for example?"<ref name="BruceEtAl" />

One historian of psychology has argued that Gestalt psychologists first discovered many principles later championed by cognitive psychology, including [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] and [[Prototype theory|prototypes]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gestalt Psychology and the Cognitive Revolution|last=Murray|first=David J.|date=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-320714-9|location=New York}}</ref> Another psychologist has argued that the Gestalt psychologists made a lasting contribution by showing how the study of [[illusions]] can help scientists understand essential aspects of how the visual system ''normally'' functions, not merely how it breaks down.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Pergamon| isbn = 978-1-4831-7113-5| last = Kolers| first = Paul A.| title = Aspects of Motion Perception| location = New York| series = International Series of Monographs in Experimental Psychology| date = 1972| pages = 16}}</ref>

===Use in design===
The gestalt laws are used in several visual design fields, such as [[user interface design]] and [[cartography]]. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing [[radio button]]s. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns.<ref name="Soegaard"/>

[[File:Mississippiriver-new-01.png|thumb|right|Several grouping principles are employed in this map: similarity allows the reader to selectively isolate cities, rivers, or state boundaries; closure allows the dashed boundary lines to be perceived as continuous borders; proximity makes the collection of river segments appear as a single watershed; and continuity helps the reader "see" whole states even when boundaries are obscured under rivers.]] In map design, principles of Prägnanz or grouping are crucial for implying a conceptual order to the portrayed geographic features, thus facilitating the intended use of the map.<ref>Tait, A. (2018). [https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/visual-hierarchy-and-layout Visual Hierarchy and Layout]. ''The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (2nd Quarter 2018 Edition)'', John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.4</ref> The Law of Similarity is employed by selecting similar [[map symbol]]s for similar kinds of features or features with similar properties; the Law of Proximity is crucial to identifying geographic patterns and regions; and the Laws of Closure and Continuity allow users to recognize features that may be obscured by other features (such as when a road goes over a river).
