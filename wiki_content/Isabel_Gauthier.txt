In 2012, Gauthier was elected Fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists. In 2015, she was named "SEC professor of the year" by the [[Southeastern Conference]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=2015 SEC faculty achievement award recipients announced|url=https://www.secsports.com/article/12642963/2015-sec-faculty-achievement-award-recipients-announced|access-date=2021-09-23|website=www.secsports.com}}</ref> In 2021 Gauthier received the [[Psychonomic Society]] Mid-Career award.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychonomic Society Mid-Career Award|url=https://www.psychonomic.org/general/custom.asp?page=midcareeraward|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Beginning in 2011, Gauthier serves as chief editor of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: General]]'', where she introduced a brief report format and made report of effect sizes and consideration of power an editorial priority. Since 2016, she serves as chief editor of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]]''.

== Biography ==
Gauthier was born in Montreal, Québec, Canada, in 1971. She acquired her PhD at [[Yale University]] (1993-1998). Her dissertation ''Dissecting face recognition: The role of expertise and level of categorization in object recognition'' was conducted under the supervision of  [[Michael J. Tarr|Michael J, Tarr]].  She held post-doctoral positions at Yale and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] before joining the faculty of Vanderbilt University in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychonomic Society profile: Isabel Gauthier|url=https://www.psychonomic.org/page/gauthier|url-status=live}}</ref> 

== Research ==
Gauthier has researched many topics involved in perception, with a focus on the role of perceptual expertise in category-specific effects in domains such as faces, letters or musical notation. She incorporates different techniques to study these topics, including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[event-related potentials]] (ERP), and behavioral training studies using novel objects (e.g., [[Greeble (psychology)|Greeble]]s, YUFOs, Ziggerins<ref>Leonard, Futurity-Jenny [http://www.futurity.org/health-medicine/putting-name-to-face-helps-you-remember/#more-2333], Futurity.org, June 18, 2009, accessed June 30, 2011.</ref>).

One brain area frequently investigated by Gauthier and colleagues using fMRI is the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA). The FFA is believed to play an important role in face recognition, but Gauthier’s research has examined the role that FFA may play in the expert perception of non-face objects,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gauthier | first1 = I. | last2 = Tarr | first2 = M.J. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = A.W. | last4 = Skudlarski | first4 = P. | last5 = Gore | first5 = J.
