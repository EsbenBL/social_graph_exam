'''National security''' or '''national defence''' is the [[security]] and [[Defence (military)|defence]] of a [[sovereign state|nation state]], including its [[Citizenship|citizens]], [[economy]], and [[institutions]], which is regarded as a duty of [[government]].

Originally conceived as protection against [[Offensive (military)|military attack]], national security is now widely understood to include also non-military dimensions, including the security from [[terrorism]], minimization of [[crime]], [[economic security]], [[energy security]], [[environmental security]], [[food security]], [[Computer security|cyber-security]] etc. Similarly, national security risks include, in addition to the actions of other [[sovereign state|nation state]]s, action by [[violent non-state actor]]s, by [[narcotic cartel]]s, and by [[multinational corporation]]s, and also the effects of [[natural disaster]]s.

Governments rely on a range of measures, including [[political power|political]], [[Economic power|economic]], and [[military]] power, as well as [[diplomacy]], to safeguard the security of a [[sovereign state|nation-state]]. They may also act to build the conditions of security regionally and internationally by reducing [[transnationality|transnational]] causes of insecurity, such as [[global warming|climate change]], [[economic inequality]], [[Social exclusion|political exclusion]], and [[nuclear proliferation]].

== Definitions ==
The concept of national security remains ambiguous, having evolved from simpler definitions which emphasised freedom from military threat and from political coercion.<ref name="Romm 1993">{{Cite book|title=Defining national security: the nonmilitary aspects |last=Romm |first=Joseph J.|author-link=Joseph J.

* "A nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate ínterests to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by war." ([[Walter Lippmann]], 1943).<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|5}}
* "The distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation." ([[Harold Lasswell]], 1950)<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|79}}

* "National security then is the ability to preserve the nation's physical integrity and territory; to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms; to preserve its nature, institution, and governance from disruption from outside; and to control its borders."

== Dimensions of national security ==
Potential causes of national insecurity include actions by other states (e.g. [[Military aggression|military]] or [[Cyberattack|cyber attack]]), [[violent non-state actor]]s (e.g. [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]]), [[Organized crime|organised criminal groups]] such as [[narcotic cartel]]s, and also the effects of [[natural disaster]]s (e.g. flooding, earthquakes).{{nowrap|<ref name="Romm 1993"/>{{rp|v, 1–8}}}}<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Losing control : global security in the twenty-first century|last=Rogers|first=P|date=2010|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9780745329376|edition=3rd|location=London|oclc=658007519}}</ref> Systemic drivers of insecurity, which may be [[transnationality|transnational]], include [[global warming|climate change]], [[economic inequality]] and [[marginalisation]], [[Social exclusion|political exclusion]], and [[Militarization|militarisation]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" />

In view of the wide range of risks, the security of a nation state has several dimensions, including [[economic security]], [[energy security]], [[Military security|physical security]], [[environmental security]], [[food security]], [[border guard|border security]], and [[Computer security|cyber security]]. These dimensions correlate closely with [[elements of national power]].

Increasingly, governments organise their [[security policies]] into a national security strategy (NSS);<ref>{{cite web |title=National Security Strategy |url=https://history.defense.gov/Historical-Sources/National-Security-Strategy/ |website=Office of the Security of Defense}}</ref> as of 2017, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are among the states to have done so.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/documents/estrategiaseguridad_baja_julio.pdf|title=The National Security Strategy: Sharing a common project|last=Spanish Government|date=2013|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-strategy-and-strategic-defence-and-security-review-2015|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|last=UK, Cabinet Office|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://nssarchive.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015.pdf|title=National Security Strategy|last=US, White House|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref> Some states also appoint a National Security Council and/or a National Security Advisor which is an executive government agency, it feeds the head of the state on topics concerning national security and strategic interest. The national security council/advisor strategies long term, short term, contingency national security plans. [[India]] holds one such system in current, which was established on 19 November 1998.

Although states differ in their approach, with some beginning to prioritise non-military action to tackle systemic drivers of insecurity, various forms of coercive power predominate, particularly [[Military Capabilities]].<ref name=":2" /> The scope of these capabilities has developed. Traditionally, military capabilities were mainly land- or sea-based, and in smaller countries, they still are. Elsewhere, the domains of potential warfare now include the [[Air force|air]], [[Space warfare|space]], [[Cyberwarfare|cyberspace]], and [[Psychological warfare|psychological operations]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478792|title=War in the fifth domain|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref> Military capabilities designed for these domains may be used for national security, or equally for offensive purposes, for example to conquer and annex territory and resources.

=== Physical security ===
{{main|Military security}}In practice, national security is associated primarily with managing physical threats and with the [[military]] capabilities used for doing so.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> That is, national security is often understood as the capacity of a nation to mobilise military forces to guarantee its borders and to deter or successfully defend against physical threats including [[Offensive (military)|military aggression]] and attacks by [[Violent non-state actor|non-state actors]], such as [[terrorism]]. Most states, such as South Africa and Sweden,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil.za/documents/defencereview/defence%20review%202015.pdf|title=South African Defence Review, 2015|last=South Africa, Department of Defence|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.government.se/4aa5de/contentassets/0e04164d7eed462aa511ab03c890372e/national-security-strategy.pdf|title=National Security Strategy|last=Sweden, Prime Minister's Office|date=2017|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref> configure their military forces mainly for territorial defence; others, such as France, Russia, the UK and the US,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/content/download/514659/8664385/Strategic%20review%20of%20defense%20and%20national%20security%202017%20%E2%80%93%20Key%20points.pdf|title=Strategic Review of Defence and National Security|last=France|date=2017|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-russias-new-national-security-strategy|title=Unpacking Russia's New National Security Strategy|last=Olika|first=O|date=2016|website=www.csis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> invest in higher-cost [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary capabilities]], which allow their armed forces to [[Power projection|project power]] and sustain [[military operation]]s abroad.{{See also|Terrorism|Border guard|Military aggression}}

=== Infrastructure security ===
[[File:Supon päämaja Helsingissä 02.jpg|thumb|The [[SUPO]] headquarters in [[Punavuori]], [[Helsinki]]]]
Infrastructure security is the [[security]] provided to protect [[infrastructure]], especially [[critical infrastructure]], such as [[airport]]s, [[highway]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/highway/index.shtm |title=Highways For Travelers |website=[[Transportation Security Administration]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915095420/http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/highway/index.shtm |archive-date=15 September 2012}}</ref> [[rail transport]], [[hospital]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[transport hub]]s, network communications, [[Media (communication)|media]], the [[Grid (electricity)|electricity grid]], [[dam]]s, [[power plant]]s, [[seaport]]s, [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], and [[water system]]s. Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to [[sabotage]], [[terrorism]], and [[contamination]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/who_we_are/index.shtm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216161520/http://www.tsa.gov/who_we_are/index.shtm |archive-date=2008-12-16}}</ref>

Many countries have established government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure, usually, through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as United States [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]], and also dedicated transport police such as the [[British Transport Police]]. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the [[Amtrak Police]] in the United States. Critical infrastructure is vital for the essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage can have a serious impact on the economy and essential services. Some of the threats to infrastructure include:

* [[Terrorism]]: person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted.
* [[Sabotage]]: person or groups such as ex-employees, anti-government groups, environmental groups. Refer to [[People's Alliance for Democracy#Seizure of Suvarnabhumi International Airport|Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors]].
* [[Information warfare]]: private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and damage a country's cyberinfrastructure. [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia|Cyberattacks on Estonia]] and [[cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war]] are examples.
* [[Natural disaster]]: hurricane or other natural events that damage critical infrastructures such as oil pipelines, water, and power grids. See [[Hurricane Ike#Oil and gas spills|Hurricane Ike]] and [[Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina]] for examples.

=== Computer security ===
{{main|Computer security}}
[[Computer security]], also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as [[computer]]s and smartphones, as well as [[computer network]]s such as private and public networks, and the [[Internet access|Internet]]. It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed, and the field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], May 07, 2013, The Australian</ref> Since unauthorized access to critical civil and military infrastructure is now considered a major threat, cyberspace is now recognised as a domain of warfare. One such example is the use of [[Stuxnet]] by the USA and Israel against the [[Iranian nuclear programme]]<ref name=":6" />

=== Political security ===
[[Barry Buzan]], [[Ole Wæver]], [[Jaap de Wilde]] and others have argued that national security depends on [[political security]]: the stability of the social order.<ref name=":5">{{cite book |title=Security: a new framework for analysis |year=1998 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-55587-784-2 |pages=239}}</ref> Others, such as Paul Rogers, have added that the equitability of the international order is equally vital.<ref name=":0" /> Hence, political security depends on the rule of [[international law]] (including the [[Law of war|laws of war]]), the effectiveness of [[International institutions|international political institutions]], as well as [[diplomacy]] and [[negotiation]] between nations and other security actors.<ref name=":5" /> It also depends on, among other factors, effective political inclusion of disaffected groups and the [[human security]] of the citizenry.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/humansecurity/|title=UN Trust Fund for Human Security|last=United Nations|website=www.un.org |language=en |access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref>

=== Economic security ===
{{Main|Economic security}}
Economic security, in the context of [[international relations]], is the ability of a [[Nation-state|nation state]] to maintain and develop the national economy, without which other dimensions of national security cannot be managed. Economic capability largely determines the defense capability of a nation, and thus a sound economic security directly influences the national security of a nation. That is why we see countries with sound economy, happen to have sound security setup too, such as [[The United States]], [[China]], [[India]] among others. In larger countries, strategies for economic security expect to access resources and markets in other countries and to protect their own markets at home. [[Developing country|Developing countries]] may be less secure than economically advanced states due to high rates of unemployment and underpaid work.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Ecological security ===
{{main|Environmental security}}Ecological security, also known as environmental security, refers to the integrity of [[ecosystems]] and the [[biosphere]], particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a [[Biodiversity|diversity of life-forms]] (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/161|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2010|last=United Nations General Assembly|date=2010|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref> The degradation of ecosystems, including [[Soil erosion|topsoil erosion]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[climate change]], affect economic security and can precipitate [[mass migration]], leading to increased pressure on resources elsewhere. Ecological security is also important since most of the countries in the world are developing and dependent on [[agriculture]] and agriculture gets affected largely due to climate change. This effect affects the economy of the nation, which in turn affects national security.

The scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate.<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|29–33}} Romm (1993) classifies the major impacts of ecological changes on national security as:<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|15}}
* ''Transnational environmental problems.'' These include global environmental problems such as [[climate change]] due to [[global warming]], [[deforestation]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|15}}
* ''Local environmental or resource pressures''. These include resource scarcities leading to local conflict, such as disputes over [[water scarcity]] in the [[Middle East]]; migration into the United States caused by the failure of agriculture in [[Mexico]];<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|15}} and the impact on the conflict in Syria of erosion of productive land.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleick|first=Peter H.|date=2014-03-03|title=Water, Drought, Climate Change, and Conflict in Syria|journal=Weather, Climate, and Society|volume=6|issue=3|pages=331–340|doi=10.1175/wcas-d-13-00059.1|s2cid=153715885|issn=1948-8327|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f68c69ca0074017330dd804454bc128ae8db1f73}}</ref> Environmental insecurity in [[Rwanda]] following a rise in population and dwindling availability of farmland, may also have contributed to the genocide there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ditext.com/diamond/10.html |title=Malthus in Africa: Rwanda's Genocide |author=Diamond, Jared |author-link=Jared Diamond|access-date=26 September 2010}}</ref>
* ''Environmentally threatening outcomes of warfare.'' These include acts of war that degrade or destroy ecosystems.

=== Security of energy and natural resources ===
{{Main|Energy security}}
Resources include water, sources of energy, land, and minerals. Availability of adequate natural resources is important for a nation to develop its industry and economic power. For example, in the [[Persian Gulf War]] of 1991, [[Iraq]] captured [[Kuwait]] partly in order to secure access to its oil wells, and one reason for the US counter-invasion was the value of the same wells to its own economy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Water resources are subject to disputes between many nations, including [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], and in the [[Middle East]].

The interrelations between security, energy, natural resources, and their sustainability is increasingly acknowledged in national security strategies and resource security is now included among the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|date=2015|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|volume=8|issue=6|url=https://academic.oup.com/jwelb/article-abstract/8/6/497/2578664}}</ref> In the US, for example, the military has installed [[solar photovoltaic]] [[microgrids]] on their bases in case of [[power outage]].<ref>Prehoda, et al. 2017.

== Issues in national security ==

=== Consistency of approach ===
The dimensions of national security outlined above are frequently in tension with one another. For example:
* The high cost of maintaining large [[Military|military forces]] can place a burden on the economic security of a nation And annual defense spending as percent of GDP varies significantly by country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of central government expenditure, 2015)|last=World Bank|date=2017|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref> Conversely, economic constraints can limit the scale of expenditure on [[Military|military capabilities]].
* Unilateral security action by states can undermine political security at an international level if it erodes the [[rule of law]] and undermines the authority of [[International organization|international institutions]]. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003 and the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] in 2014 have been cited as examples.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wars in peace : British military operations since 1991|others=Johnson, Adrian (Historian),, Chalmers, Malcolm, 1956–, Clarke, Michael, 1950–, Codner, Michael,, Fry, Robert (Robert Alan), 1951–, Omand, David|year=2014|isbn=9780855161934|location=London, UK|oclc=880550682}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47443&Cr=ukraine&Cr1=#.WjekA99l_IV|title=UN News - Backing Ukraine's territorial integrity, UN Assembly declares Crimea referendum invalid|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2014-03-27|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref>
* The pursuit of economic security in competition with other nation states can undermine the ecological security of all when the impact includes widespread [[Soil erosion|topsoil erosion]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[climate change]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/prosperitywithou00jack_0|title=Prosperity without growth: economics for a finite planet|last=Jackson|first=T|date=2009|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=9781849713238|location=London|oclc=320800523|url-access=registration}}</ref> Conversely, expenditure on mitigating or adapting to ecological change places a burden on the national economy.
If tensions such as these are not managed effectively, national security policies and actions may be ineffective or counterproductive.

=== National versus transnational security ===
Increasingly, national security strategies have begun to recognise that nations cannot provide for their own security without also developing the security of their regional and international context.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-national-security-strategy-of-the-united-kingdom-security-in-an-interdependent-world|title=The national security strategy of the United Kingdom: security in an interdependent world|last=UK, Cabinet Office|date=2008|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":7" /> For example, Sweden's national security strategy of 2017 declared:<blockquote>"Wider security measures must also now encompass protection against epidemics and infectious diseases, combating terrorism and organised crime, ensuring safe transport and reliable food supplies, protecting against energy supply interruptions, countering devastating climate change, initiatives for peace and global development, and much more."<ref name=":7" /></blockquote>

The extent to which this matters, and how it should be done, is the subject of debate. Some argue that the principal beneficiary of national security policy should be the nation state itself, which should centre its strategy on protective and coercive capabilities in order to safeguard itself in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of [[Full-spectrum dominance|strategic supremacy]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45289|title=Joint Vision 2020 Emphasizes Full-spectrum Dominance|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2000|website=archive.defense.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmdfence/512/51202.htm|title=Re-thinking defence to meet new threats|last=House of Commons Defence Committee|date=2015|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/building-a-british-military-fit-for-future-challenges-rather-than-past-conflicts|title=Building a British military fit for future challenges rather than past conflicts|last=General Sir Nicholas Houghton|date=2015|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref> Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships between nations can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcnl.org/updates/peace-through-shared-security-79|title=Peace Through Shared Security|last=FCNL|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0"/> In the UK, for example, Malcolm Chalmers argued in 2015 that the heart of the UK's approach should be support for the Western strategic military alliance led through [[NATO]] by the United States, as "the key anchor around which international order is maintained".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rusi.org/publication/briefing-papers/force-order-strategic-underpinnings-next-nss-and-sdsr|title=A Force for Order: Strategic Underpinnings of the Next NSS and SDSR|last=Chalmers|first=M|date=2015-05-05|work=RUSI|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}</ref> The Ammerdown Group argued in 2016 that the UK should shift its primary focus to building international cooperation to tackle the systemic drivers of insecurity, including [[climate change]], [[economic inequality]], [[Militarization|militarisation]] and the political exclusion of the world's poorest people.<ref name=":2" />

=== Impact on civil liberties and human rights ===
Approaches to national security can have a complex impact on [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. For example, the rights and liberties of citizens are affected by the use of [[military personnel]] and [[Militarization of police|militarised police forces]] to control public behaviour; the use of [[surveillance]], including [[mass surveillance]] in [[cyberspace]], which has implications for [[privacy]]; [[military recruitment]] and [[conscription]] practices; and the effects of [[warfare]] on [[civilian]]s and [[civil infrastructure]]. This has led to a [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] struggle, particularly in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], between government [[authority]] and the rights and freedoms of the general public.
[[File:National Security Agency, 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[National Security Agency]] harvests personal data across the internet.]]
Even where the exercise of national security is subject to [[good governance]], and the [[rule of law]], a risk remains that the term ''national security'' may become a [[pretext]] for suppressing [[political dissent|unfavorable political and social views]]. In the US, for example, the controversial [[USA Patriot Act]] of 2001, and the revelation by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013 that the [[National Security Agency]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|harvests the personal data of the general public]], brought these issues to wide public attention. Among the questions raised are whether and how national security considerations at times of war should lead to the suppression of individual rights and freedoms, and whether such restrictions are necessary when a state is not at war.

== Perspectives ==
=== Africa ===
Conceptualizing and understanding the National Security choices and challenges of African States is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their (mostly disrupted) state formation and their often imported process of state-building.

Although Post-Cold War conceptualisations of Security have broadened, the policies and practices of many African states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and, even more narrowly- regime security.

The problem with the above is that a number of African states (be specific) have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways. Often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories. The hybridity of security ‘governance’ or ‘providers’ thus exists.<ref name="Luckham, R. 2012">Luckham, R., & Kirk, T. (2012). [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/56358/1/JSRP_Paper2_Security_in_hybrid_political_contexts_Luckham_Kirk_2012.pdf Security in hybrid political contexts: An end-user approach].</ref> States that have not been able to capture this reality in official National Security strategies and policies often find their claim over having the monopoly of force and thus being the Sovereign challenged.<ref name="Luckham, R. 2012" /> This often leads to the weakening of the state. Examples of such states are [[South Sudanese Civil War|South Sudan]] and [[Somali Civil War|Somalia]].

=== Argentina and Brazil ===
National Security ideology as taught by the [[US Army School of the Americas]] to military personnel was vital in causing the military coup of 1964 in Brazil and the 1976 one in Argentina. The military dictatorships were installed on the claim by the military that Leftists were an existential threat to the national interests.<ref>Emir Sader, "The coup in Brazil and the doctrine of National Security" (Portuguese) http://cartamaior.com.br/?/Blog/Blog-do-Emir/O-golpe-no-Brasil-e-a-doutrina-de-seguranca-nacional/2/27107</ref>

=== China ===
{{main|National security of China}}
China's Armed Forces are known as the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA). The military is the largest in the world, with 2.3&nbsp;million active troops in 2005.

The [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]] was established in 1983 to ensure "the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China's socialist system."<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/world/china/mss/index.html Ministry of State Security], Intelligence Resource Program, [[Federation of American Scientists]]</ref>

The Chinese concept of national security is an all-encompassing concept. There are concerns that national security law is used to suppress civil liberties and ethnic minorities.

{{main|National Security Council (India)|National Security Strategy (India) | Terrorism in India | Illegal immigration to India}}

The state of the Republic of India's national security is determined by its internal stability and geopolitical interests. While Islamic upsurge in Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir demanding secession and far left-wing terrorism in India's [[red corridor]] remain some key issues in India's internal security, [[Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism|terrorism from Pakistan based militant groups]] has been emerging as a major concern for New Delhi.

[[Illegal immigration to India]], most of whom are Muslims from Bangladesh and Myanmar ([[Rohingya]] muslims) are a national security risk. There is an organised influx of nearly 40,000 illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya Muslim immigrants in Delhi who pose a [[#India|national security risk]], threaten the national integration, and alter the demographics. A lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay filed a [[Public interest litigation in India|Public interest litigation]] (PIL) in the "Supreme Court of India" (SC) to identify and deport these. Responding to this PIL, [[Delhi Police]] told the SC in July 2019 that nearly 500 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have been deported in the preceding 28 months.<ref name=illegalbang3>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/nearly-500-illegal-bangladesh-nationals-detained-deported-delhi-police-to-sc/articleshow/70471951.cms Nearly 500 illegal Bangladesh nationals detained, deported: Delhi police to SC], Times of India, 31 July 2019.</ref> There are estimated 600,000 to 700,000 illegal Bangladeshi and [[Rohingya]] immigrants in [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR) region specially in the districts of [[Gurugram]], [[Faridabad]], and [[Nuh district|Nuh]] ([[Mewat]] region), as well as interior villages of [[Bhiwani district|Bhiwani]] and [[Hisar district|Hisar]].

=== Russia ===
In the years 1997 and 2000, Russia adopted documents titled "National Security Concept" that described Russia's global position, the country's interests, listed threats to national security, and described the means to counter those threats. In 2009, these documents were superseded by the "''National Security Strategy to 2020''". The key body responsible for coordinating policies related to Russia's national security is the [[Security Council of Russia]].

According to provision 6 of the ''National Security Strategy to 2020'', national security is "the situation in which the individual, the society and the state enjoy protection from foreign and domestic threats to the degree that ensures constitutional rights and freedoms, decent quality of life for citizens, as well as sovereignty, territorial integrity and stable development of the Russian Federation, the defense and security of the state."

=== Ukraine ===
National security of Ukraine is defined in Ukrainian law as "a set of legislative and organisational measures aimed at permanent protection of vital interests of man and citizen, society and the state, which ensure sustainable development of society, timely detection, prevention and neutralisation of real and potential threats to national interests in areas of law enforcement, fight against corruption, border activities and defense, migration policy, health care, education and science, technology and innovation policy, cultural development of the population, freedom of speech and information security, social policy and pension provision, housing and communal services, financial services market, protection of property rights, stock markets and circulation of securities, fiscal and customs policy, trade and business, banking services, investment policy, auditing, monetary and exchange rate policy, information security, licensing, industry and agriculture, transport and communications, information technology, energy and energy saving, functioning of natural monopolies, use of subsoil, land and water resources, minerals, protection of ecology and environment and other areas of public administration, in the event of emergence of negative trends towards the creation of potential or real threats to national interests.".<ref>[http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/964-15 Закон України «Про основи національної безпеки України» від 19.06.2003 №&nbsp;964-IV]</ref>

The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in Ukraine is the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine]].  
It is an advisory state agency to the [[President of Ukraine]], tasked with developing a policy of national security on domestic and international matters. All sessions of the council take place in the [[Presidential Administration Building (Kiev)|Presidential Administration Building]]. The council was created by the provision of [[Supreme Council of Ukraine]] #1658-12 on October 11, 1991. It was defined as the highest state body of collegiate governing on matters of defense and security of Ukraine with the following goals:

* Protecting sovereignty
* Constitutional order
* Territorial integrity and inviolability of the republic
* Developing strategies and continuous improvement of policy in the sphere of defense and state security
* Comprehensive scientific assessment of the military threat nature
* Determining position toward modern warfare
* Effective control over the execution of the tasks of the state and its institutions keeping defense capabilities of Ukraine at the level of defense sufficiency

=== United Kingdom ===
The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in the UK is the [[National Security Council (United Kingdom)]] which helps produce and enact the [[National Security Strategy (United Kingdom)|UK's National Security Strategy]]. It was created in May 2010 by the new [[coalition government]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The National Security Council is a committee of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] and was created as part of a wider reform of the national [[security apparatus]]. This reform also included the creation of a [[National Security Adviser (United Kingdom)|National Security Adviser]] and a [[National Security Council (United Kingdom)#National Security Secretariat|National Security Secretariat]] to support the National Security Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/national-security-council |title=The National Security Council: national security at the centre of government |author=Dr Joe Devanny & Josh Harris |publisher=Institute for Government & King's College London |access-date=6 November 2014}}</ref>

==== National Security Act of 1947 ====
{{Main|National Security Act of 1947|United States National Security Council}}
The concept of national security became an official guiding principle of [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy in the United States]] when the [[National Security Act of 1947]] was signed on July 26, 1947, by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]].<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|3}} As amended in 1949, this Act:
:* created important components of American national security, such as the precursor to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]];
:* subordinated the military branches to the new cabinet-level position of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]];
:* established the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]];<ref name="Davis">{{cite book |title=U.S. Foreign Policy and National Security: Chronology and Index for the 20th Century |last=Davis |first=Robert T. |series=Praeger Security International Series |editor=Robert T.

Notably, the Act did ''not'' define national security, which was conceivably advantageous, as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke against diverse threats to interests of the state, such as domestic concerns.<ref name="Romm 1993" />{{rp|3–5}}

The notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present, though understated, from the beginning. The Act established the National Security Council so as to "advise the President on the integration of domestic, military and foreign policies relating to national security".<ref name="Paleri" />{{rp|52}}

While not defining the "interests" of national security, the Act does establish, within the National Security Council, the "Committee on Foreign Intelligence", whose duty is to conduct an annual review "identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the United States ''as specified by the President''" (emphasis added).<ref>{{USC|50|402}}</ref>

<!--During the [[Cold War]]'s [[Polarity in international relations#Bipolarity|bipolar system]], states were relying on the two [[superpower]]s to guarantee their national security.

To reflect on the institutionalisation of new bureaucratic infrastructures and governmental practices in the post-[[World War II]] period in the U.S., when a culture of semi-permanent military mobilisation brought around the National Security Council, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, national-security researchers apply a notion of a ''national security state'':<ref>Yergin, Daniel.

A general perception grew that the future would not allow time to mobilize, that preparation would have to become constant.
