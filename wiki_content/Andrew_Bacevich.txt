He is a Professor Emeritus of International Relations and History at the [[Boston University]] [[Frederick S.

==Early life and education==
Bacevich was born in [[Normal, Illinois]], the son of Martha Ellen (née Bulfer; later Greenis) and Andrew Bacevich, Sr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nwitimes/obituary.aspx?n=martha-ellen-greenis-bacevich&pid=154748279&fhid=8241|title=Martha Greenis Obituary|work=The Times}}</ref> His father was of Lithuanian descent and his mother was of Irish, German, and English ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westpointcoh.org/westpointcoh/interview/navigating-an-ethical-critique-for-a-new-kind-of-war-in-iraq/print|title=OralHistory|work=westpointcoh.org|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925123600/http://www.westpointcoh.org/westpointcoh/interview/navigating-an-ethical-critique-for-a-new-kind-of-war-in-iraq/print |archive-date=2013-09-25}}</ref> He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] in 1969 and served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]], serving in Vietnam from the summer of 1970 to the summer of 1971.<ref name="uranium" />

Later he held posts in Germany, including in the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]]; the United States; and the Persian Gulf up to his retirement from the service with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the early 1990s. His early retirement is thought to be a result of his taking responsibility for the [[Camp Doha]] (Kuwait) explosion<ref name="uranium">{{cite book|title=Environmental Exposure Report {{ndash}} Depleted Uranium in the Gulf (II)|date=December 13, 2000|chapter=TAB I {{ndash}} The Camp Doha Explosion and Fires (July 1991)|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|chapter-url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/du_ii_tabi.htm}}</ref> in 1991 in command of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Andy Bacevich|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=August 16, 2008 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2008/08/about-andy-bacevich/212910/}}</ref> He holds a [[Ph.D.]] in American Diplomatic History from [[Princeton University]], and taught at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] before joining the faculty at [[Boston University]] in 1998.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Writings==
Bacevich has described himself as a "Catholic conservative"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2010/are-americans-god%E2%80%99s-chosen-people-2/ | work=BU Today | title=Are Americans God's Chosen People? | first=Rich | last=Barlow | date=November 22, 2010 | access-date=February 18, 2013}}</ref> and initially published writings in a number of politically oriented magazines, including ''[[Wilson Quarterly|The Wilson Quarterly]]''. He advocates for a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newbostonpost.com/2016/08/31/andrew-bacevich-christian-realism-for-foreign-affairs/|title=Andrew Bacevich: 'Christian realism' for foreign affairs {{!}} NewBostonPost|website=newbostonpost.com|date=31 August 2016|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> His recent writings have professed a dissatisfaction with the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] and many of its intellectual supporters on matters of U.S. [[foreign policy]].

On August 15, 2008, Bacevich appeared as the guest of ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] to promote his book, ''The Limits of Power.'' As in both of his previous books, ''The Long War'' (2007) and ''The New American Militarism: How Americans are Seduced by War'' (2005), Bacevich is critical of U.S. foreign policy in the post-[[Cold War]] era, maintaining the United States has developed an over-reliance on military power, in contrast to diplomacy, to achieve its foreign policy aims. He also asserts that policymakers in particular, and the U.S. people in general, overestimate the usefulness of military force in foreign affairs. Bacevich believes romanticized images of war in popular culture (especially films) interact with the lack of actual military service among most of the U.S. population to produce in the U.S. people a highly unrealistic, even dangerous notion of what combat and military service are really like.

Bacevich conceived ''The New American Militarism'' as "a corrective to what has become the conventional critique of U.S. policies since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] but [also] as a challenge to the orthodox historical context employed to justify those policies." Finally, he attempts to place current policies in historical context, as part of a U.S. tradition going back to the Presidency of [[Woodrow Wilson]], a tradition (of an interventionist, militarized foreign policy) which has strong bi-partisan roots. To lay an intellectual foundation for this argument, he cites two influential historians from the 20th century: [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[William Appleman Williams]]. Ultimately, Bacevich eschews the partisanship of current debate about [[U.S. foreign policy]] as short-sighted and ahistorical. Instead of blaming only one president (or his advisors) for contemporary policies, Bacevich sees both Republicans and Democrats as sharing responsibility for policies which may not be in the nation's best interest.

In March 2003, at the time of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], Bacevich wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that "if, as seems probable, the effort encounters greater resistance than its architects imagine, our way of life may find itself tested in ways that will make the Vietnam War look like a mere blip in American history."<ref name=MacQuarrie/>

Bacevich's book ''American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of US Diplomacy'', published in 2004, was highly praised by Professor of International Relations and author [[Peter Gowan]] for being "a tonic to read: crisp, vivid, pungent, with a dry sense of humour and sharp sense of hypocrisies." Gowan describes Bacevich as a "conservative, who explains that he believed in the justice of America's war against Communism, and continues to do so, but once it was over came to the conclusion that U.S. expansionism both preceded and exceeded the logic of the Cold War, and needed to be understood in a longer, more continuous historical durée."<ref name=Gowan>{{cite journal |url=https://newleftreview.org/II/21/peter-gowan-instruments-of-empire |title=Instruments of Empire |first=Peter |last=Gowan |journal=[[New Left Review]] |date=May–June 2003}}</ref>

Bacevich wrote an editorial about the [[Bush Doctrine]] published in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in March 2007.<ref name=Bacevich>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/03/01/rescinding_the_bush_doctrine/ |title=Rescinding the Bush Doctrine
|first=Andrew J. |last=Bacevich |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=2007-03-01 |access-date=2007-05-01}}</ref>

In an article of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' dated March 24, 2008, Bacevich depicts Democratic Presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] as the best choice for [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] in the fall. Part of his argument includes the fact that "this liberal Democrat has promised to end the U.S. combat role in Iraq. Contained within that promise, if fulfilled, lies some modest prospect of a conservative revival."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amconmag.com/2008/2008_03_24/article.html|title=The American Conservative|website=The American Conservative|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612235904/http://www.amconmag.com/2008/2008_03_24/article.html|archive-date=2008-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also goes on to mention that "For conservatives to hope the election of yet another Republican will set things right is surely in vain. To believe that President John McCain will reduce the scope and intrusiveness of federal authority, cut the imperial presidency down to size, and put the government on a pay-as-you-go basis is to succumb to a great delusion."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Arnold|first=Beth|date=March 25, 2008|title=Obama: Even the Conservatives' Right Choice|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-even-the-conservati_b_93338|access-date=November 21, 2021|website=HuffPost}}</ref>

In the October 11, 2009, issue of ''The Boston Globe'', he wrote that the decision to commit more troops to Afghanistan may be the most fateful choice of the [[Obama administration]]. "If the Afghan war then becomes the consuming issue of Obama's presidency – as Iraq became for his predecessor, as Vietnam did for [[Lyndon Johnson]], and as [[Korean war|Korea]] did for [[Harry Truman]] – the inevitable effect will be to compromise the prospects of reform more broadly."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/10/11/afghanistan___the_proxy_war/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Afghanistan – the proxy war | first=Andrew J. | last=Bacevich | date=October 11, 2009}}</ref>

In his article "Non Believer" in the July 7, 2010, issue of ''[[The New Republic]]'', Bacevich compared President George W. Bush, characterized as wrong-headed but sincere, with President Obama, who, he says, has no belief in the Afghanistan war but pursues it for his own politically cynical reasons: "Who is more deserving of contempt? The commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause, however misguided, in which he sincerely believes? Or the commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause in which he manifestly does not believe and yet refuses to forsake?"<ref name="TNR01">Bacevich, Andrew, [http://www.tnr.com/blog/foreign-policy/76091/non-believer "Non-Believer"], ''The New Republic'', July 7, 2010.

WK8, NY ed.).</ref>

In an October 2010 interview with ''[[Guernica Magazine]]'', Bacevich addressed his seemingly contradictory stance on Obama. While Bacevich supported Obama during the 2008 presidential race in which Obama repeatedly said he believed in the Afghanistan war, Bacevich has become increasingly critical of Obama's decision to commit additional troops to that war: "I interpreted his campaign rhetoric about Afghanistan as an effort to insulate him from the charge of being a national security wimp. His decision to escalate was certainly not a decision his supporters were clamoring for."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/2062/bacevich_10_1_10/ | work=Guernica Magazine | title=Blood Without Guts | first=Andrew J. | last=Bacevich | date=October 1, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002853/http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/2062/bacevich_10_1_10/ | archive-date=October 6, 2010 }}</ref>

Regarding nuclear policy in particular, Bacevich noted in ''The Limits of Power'' that there is no feasible scenario under which nuclear weapons could sensibly be used and keeping them entails many other risks: "For the United States, they are becoming unnecessary, even as a deterrent. Certainly, they are unlikely to dissuade the adversaries most likely to employ such weapons against us – Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability. If anything, the opposite is true. By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness (and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified), the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics ... ."<ref>pp. 178-179</ref>
