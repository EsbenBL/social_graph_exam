==Major contributions==
Breiger's primary contributions have been to the field of social network analysis. The most widely cited are, with co-authors [[Harrison White]] and [[Scott A. Boorman]], "''Social Structure from Multiple Networks. I. Blockmodels of Roles and Positions''" published in 1976.<ref>White, Harrison C., Scott A. Boorman, and Ronald L. Breiger. "Social structure from multiple networks. I. Blockmodels of roles and positions." American journal of sociology (1976): 730-780.</ref> and "''The Duality of Persons and Groups''" published in 1974.<ref>Breiger, Ronald L. "The duality of persons and groups." Social forces 53.2 (1974): 181-190.</ref>

Beginning in 2000, Breiger devoted considerable attention to elucidating the mutual implications of social network analysis and the sociology of culture.<ref name="Breiger, Ronald L.

Breiger has played an important role in applying network analytic techniques to the study of terrorism. For instance, in November 2002, Breiger chaired a workshop on dynamic social network modeling and analysis for the Committee on Human Factors of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] convened at the request of the Office of Naval Research.<ref name=Start.umd.edu /><ref name="Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis">{{cite book|title=Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis, edd.

In 2018 he was the recipient of the [[Mathematical sociology#Awards in mathematical sociology|James S.
