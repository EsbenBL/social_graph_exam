'''Alban William Housego''' "'''A. W.'''" "'''Bill'''" '''Phillips''', [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (18 November 1914 – 4 March 1975)<ref name=ODNB>Nicholas Barr, "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66812 Phillips, Alban William Housego (1914–1975)]" (subscription required), ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 4 July 2008.</ref> was a New Zealand [[economist]] who spent most of his academic career as a professor of economics at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). His best-known contribution to [[economics]] is the [[Phillips curve]], which he first described in 1958. He also designed and built the [[MONIAC]] hydraulic economics computer in 1949.

==Early life==
Phillips was born at [[Te Rehunga]] near [[Dannevirke]], New Zealand, to Harold Housego Phillips, a dairy farmer, and his wife, Edith Webber, a schoolteacher and postmistress.<ref name=ODNB/>

He left New Zealand before finishing school to work in Australia at a variety of jobs, including crocodile hunter and cinema manager. In 1937 Phillips headed to China, but had to escape to Russia when Japan invaded China. He travelled across Russia on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and made his way to United Kingdom in 1938, where he studied [[electrical engineering]]. At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Phillips joined the [[Royal Air Force]] and was sent to Singapore. When Singapore fell, he escaped on the troopship ''Empire State'', which came under attack before safely arriving in [[Java (island)|Java]].

When Java, too, was overrun Phillips was captured by the Japanese, and spent three and a half years interned in a [[prisoner of war]] camp in the then [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia).<ref name="Leeson">{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Alban William Housego|author2=Robert Leeson |title=A.W.H. Phillips: Collected Works in Contemporary Perspective|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-57135-7}}</ref> During this period he learned [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]] from other prisoners, repaired and miniaturised a secret radio, and fashioned a secret water boiler for tea which he hooked into the camp lighting system.<ref name="Leeson" /> In 1946, he was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for his war service.

After the war he moved to [[London]] and began studying [[sociology]] at the [[London School of Economics]], because of his fascination with prisoners of war's ability to organize themselves. But he became bored with sociology and developed an interest in [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian theory]], so he switched his course to [[economics]] and within eleven years was a professor of economics.

While a student at the LSE Phillips used his training as an engineer to develop [[MONIAC Computer|MONIAC]], an [[analogue computer]] which used [[hydraulics]] to model the workings of the British economy, inspiring the term [[hydraulic macroeconomics]]. It was very well received and Phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the LSE. He advanced from assistant lecturer in 1951 to professor in 1958.

His work focused on British data and observed that in years when the [[unemployment rate]] was high, [[wage]]s tended to be stable, or possibly fall. Conversely, when unemployment was low, wages rose rapidly. This sort of pattern had been noticed earlier by [[Irving Fisher]], but in 1958 Phillips published his own work on the relationship between inflation and unemployment, illustrated by the [[Phillips curve]]. Soon after the publication of Phillips' paper, the idea that there was a trade-off between a strong economy and low inflation caught the imagination of academic economists and policy-makers alike. [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[Robert Solow]] wrote an influential article describing the possibilities suggested by the Phillips curve in the context of the [[United States]]. What people think of as the Phillips curve has changed substantially over time, but remains an important feature of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] analysis of economic fluctuations. Had he lived longer, Phillips' contributions might have been worthy of a [[The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize]] in economics. He made several other notable contributions to economics, particularly relating to stabilization policy.

He returned to Australia in 1967 for a position at [[Australian National University]] which allowed him to devote half his time to Chinese studies. In 1969 the effects of his war deprivations and smoking caught up with him. He had a [[stroke]], prompting an early retirement and return to [[Auckland]], New Zealand, where he taught at the [[University of Auckland]]. He died in Auckland on 4 March 1975.
