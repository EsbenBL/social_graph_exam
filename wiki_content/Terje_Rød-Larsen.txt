'''Terje Rød-Larsen''' (born 22 November 1947) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[diplomat]], [[politician]], and [[sociologist]].

Rød-Larsen came to wide international prominence as a key figure in the 1990s negotiations that led to the [[Oslo Accords]]—the first-ever agreements between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) --  when he served as the Director of the [[Fafo Foundation|Fafo]] institute.''<ref name="nytimes_review">Brantley, Ben, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/theater/review-a-byzantine-path-to-middle-east-peace-in-oslo.html "Review: A Byzantine Path to Middle East Peace in 'Oslo',"]  July 11, 2016, ''[[New York Times]]'' retrieved May 6, 2017</ref><ref name="oslo_play_review_chcago_tribune">Jones, Chris, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/broadway/ct-oslo-jones-ae-0423-20170420-column.html "'Argo' and the new play 'Oslo' are stories about heroes nobody knows,"] April 21, 2017, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' retrieved May 6, 2017</ref><ref name="charlie_rose_2017_05_05_pbs_org">[[Charlie Rose|Rose, Charlie]] (interviewer), with interviewees diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen, playwright [[J.

In 1993, Rød-Larsen was appointed Ambassador and Special Adviser for the Middle East Peace process to the Norwegian Foreign Minister, and the following year, he became the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process|Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories]] at the rank of [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General]].

Rød-Larsen briefly served as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Planning and Cooperation of Norway in the [[Jagland's Cabinet|Jagland cabinet]] in 1996. He had to resign after a tax affair [regarding him, came to public attention].<ref>[[Lars Nehru Sand]]. https://www.nrk.no/ytring/den-misforstattes-kampskrift-1.15219328</ref>

Rød-Larsen then returned to the United Nations, where he again became an Under-Secretary-General, serving as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority from 1999 to 2004.

==Biography==
Rød-Larsen grew up in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and studied social sciences, culminating in a Ph.D. in [[sociology]]. He taught at Norwegian universities until 1981, when he helped found [[Fafo Foundation|FAFO]], a research organization funded by the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]].

===Early Middle East work===
In 1989 Rød-Larsen moved to [[Cairo]], when his wife [[Mona Juul]], who worked for the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was stationed there. He continued to work for FAFO, as the organization had become more internationally oriented during the 1980s. Rød-Larsen performed a detailed sociological study of living conditions in the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Eastern Jerusalem]]. In the course of this work, Rød-Larsen made contacts that proved to be useful in secret negotiations between [[Israel]] and the [[PLO]].

===Oslo Accords===
When serving as the Director of the [[Fafo Foundation|Fafo]] institute in the early 1990s, Rød-Larsen became a key figure in the 1990s negotiations that led to the [[Oslo Accords]] --  the first-ever agreements between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). He served a pivotal role in the negotiations not only overtly, but in secret back-channel maneuvers and communications -- largely arranged and facilitated by him and his wife, Norwegian diplomat [[Mona Juul]]. She was able to facilitate high-level contacts with the Norwegian foreign minister, [[Johan Jørgen Holst]], who was instrumental in reaching the Oslo Accords -- leading to the peace agreement signing on September 13, 1993 in [[Washington D.C.]].''<ref name="nytimes_review"/><ref name="oslo_play_review_chcago_tribune"/><ref name="charlie_rose_2017_05_05_pbs_org"/><ref name="jt_rogers_2016_y06_17_nytimes"/>

The 2016-2017 Broadway play, ''[[Oslo (play)|Oslo]],'' by noted playwright [[J. T. Rogers]], is a widely-praised dramatization of the previously unheralded secret work of Rød-Larsen and his wife, and others, in developing the back-channel communications that (reportedly) saved the Oslo negotiations from collapsing.<ref name="nytimes_review" /><ref name="oslo_play_review_chcago_tribune" /><ref name="charlie_rose_2017_05_05_pbs_org" /><ref name="jt_rogers_2016_y06_17_nytimes" />

The same year Rød-Larsen became formally employed by the  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a special advisor on Middle Eastern affairs.

===Mid-1990s to Mid-2000s===
From 1994 to 1996, Rød-Larsen served as former [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]]'s first "Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories."

In 1996, Rød-Larsen served briefly as minister of administration in the government of [[Thorbjørn Jagland]], before being forced to resign as the result of a tax scandal.

In 9/9/1999, Rød-Larsen was appointed as [[UN]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]]'s personal representative to the [[PLO]] and [[Palestinian Authority]] on the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. He was also the UN Special Coordinator for peace negotiations in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite press release | url = https://www.un.org/press/en/1999/19990921.sga705.doc.html | title = Secretary-General appoints Terje Rød-Larsen of Norway as United Nations Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process | publisher = United Nations | date = 21 September 1999 | access-date = March 2, 2020}}</ref> He subsequently left the post in 2004 to become President of the International Peace Academy, a NYC-based think tank, and was also designated as UN Special Representative (Date of Appointment : 3/1/2005) for the implementation of Security Council [[Resolution 1559]], which calls for [[Syria]]n withdrawal of [[Lebanon]] and the disarmament of [[Hezbollah]].

====20 August====
On this date Rød-Larsen told reporters. "There is a golden opportunity for Lebanon to solidify its democracy, to assert it authority, to produce a situation where Lebanon can be reconstructed and where Lebanese can live peacefully with its neighbors in prosperity. All this is at hand."<ref name=CNN-08-20>{{cite news|title=U.N. envoy: Lebanon facing critical test|date=20 August 2006|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/20/mideast.main/index.html}}</ref>

The United Nations special envoy to Syria and Lebanon said on 22 August 2006 it could take the Lebanese army and international troops two to three months to fill a "security vacuum" in southern Lebanon and warned that "unintended" acts could spark renewed fighting.

"There is now a security vacuum which the Lebanese government is trying to fill" with the help of international forces, said Terje Rød-Larsen. "But I think realistically, up to a point, you will have such a vacuum in Lebanon for the next two, three months," he added. "The situation is still extremely fragile... Unintended incidents can kick off renewed violence, which might escalate and spin out of control."<ref name=Haaretz-08-22 />
