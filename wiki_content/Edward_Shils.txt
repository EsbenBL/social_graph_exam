'''Edward Albert Shils''' (1 July 1910 – 23 January 1995) was a [[Distinguished Service Professor]] in the [[Committee on Social Thought]] and in Sociology at the [[University of Chicago]] and an influential sociologist. He was known for his research on the role of [[intellectuals]] and their relations to power and public policy. His work was honored in 1983 when he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]]. In 1979, he was selected by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities|National Council on the Humanities]] to give the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the highest award given by the U.S. federal government for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.<ref>[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html "Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities"], National Endowment for the Humanities website (retrieved January 22, 2009).</ref>

==Education==
Shils grew up in [[Philadelphia]], where he went to high school.<ref name=keene/> Though he taught sociology and social thought, he did not have a formal degree in those fields. His undergraduate degree, from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], was in [[French literature]]. He came to the attention of [[Louis Wirth]], a distinguished sociologist at the University of Chicago, who hired Shils as a research assistant. Thereafter, Shils became recognized as an outstanding teacher in the field of sociology. His knowledge of the literatures of numerous cultures and fields was deemed to be impressive. He taught sociology, [[social philosophy]], English literature, history of [[Chinese science]] and other subjects.

==Career==
A specialist in the thought of sociologist [[Max Weber]], he translated works by Weber and by sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] into English.  He served with the [[British Army]] and the [[United States Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Upon returning to Chicago, he was appointed Associate Professor in 1947, and Professor in 1950. In 1971, he was named Distinguished Service Professor.

For many years, Shils held joint appointments at Chicago and other universities. He was: reader in sociology at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1946 to 1950; a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]], from 1961 to 1970; a fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], from 1970 to 1978; and an honorary professor in [[social anthropology]] at the [[University of London]] from 1971 to 1977. He was named an honorary fellow at the London School of Economics in 1972 and an honorary fellow at Peterhouse in 1979. He was also a professor at the [[University of Leiden]] from 1976 to 1977.

He attempted to bridge the research traditions of German and American sociology. At Chicago, he attracted leading European scholars to teach at the University, including [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], [[Raymond Aron]] and the British sinologist [[Michael Loewe]], among others. Professor Shils was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].

==Personal life==
Edward Shils married the historian Irene Coltman in England towards the end of 1951.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=2R7HMXwvIlbSCBPxXVc4Dg&scan=1|title=Index entry|access-date=10 November 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref>   Edward Shils and Irene Coltman had a son. They divorced. Shils died in January 1995. He was survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Adam and Carrie Shils of [[Chicago]]; a grandson, Sam Shils; and a nephew, [[Edward Benjamin Shils]], professor emeritus at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]<ref>[http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/950330/shils.shtml "Service for Edward Shils"], ''Chicago Chronicle'', 30 March 1995</ref>  A large photo of Shils hangs in the Shils Reading Room at the University of Chicago's Social Science Research Building.

Shils had a fraught relationship with [[Saul Bellow]], a colleague at the University of Chicago who also served on the Committee on Social Thought. Shils served as his "mentor, character model and editor" and figures prominently in many of Bellow's novels, including ''[[Mr. Sammler's Planet]]'' (Artur Sammler), ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]'' (Professor Durnwald), and ''[[Ravelstein]]'' (Rakhmiel Kogon). Artur Sammler and Professor Durnwald are both described glowingly, but in ''Ravelstein'' the Shils character is treated with "animosity [that] reaches lethal proportions" following a falling out between the two.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last1=Staples|first1=Brent|title=Mr. Bellow Writes On, Wrestling With the Ghost of Edward Shils|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/22/opinion/editorial-observer-mr-bellow-writes-on-wrestling-with-the-ghost-of-edward-shils.html|work=New York Times|date=22 April 2000}}</ref>
