== Work ==

=== Influences ===
While early influences included those of systems theory and cybernetics ([[Gregory Bateson]]),<ref>White, M. & Epston, D. (1990). ''Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends'', pp. 1-2.</ref> White's main work drew on a wide range of sources, including literary theory ([[Jerome Bruner]]), cultural anthropology ([[Clifford Geertz]], [[Barbara Myerhoff]], [[Victor Turner]]), non-structuralist psychology ([[William James]], [[Lev Vygotsky]]) and French critical / [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] philosophy ([[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Michel Foucault]]).<ref>White, M. (2007). ''Maps of Narrative Practice''. (New York: W.W. Norton)</ref>

=== Theoretical and practice innovations ===
Key [[Therapy|therapeutic]] ideas developed by White include 'externalizing the problem',<ref>''Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends'', pp. 54-56.</ref> commonly summarised as 'the person is not the problem, the problem is the problem'; 're-authoring' the dominant stories of people's lives; and the idea of 'double-listening' to accounts of trauma: not only the accounts of trauma itself, but how people have responded to trauma.

Key practices of narrative therapy and 'maps' of narrative practice include:
* The statement of position map / externalising conversations map
* Re-authoring conversations
* Re-membering conversations
* Definitional ceremonies
* Scaffolding conversations
* The absent but implicit
* Responding to personal failure conversations<ref>''Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends''; ''Maps of Narrative Practice''; White, M. (2000). ''Reflections on Narrative Practice'' Adelaide, South Australia: Dulwich Centre Publications</ref>
