==Biography==
Parsons was the daughter of [[Henry Clews]], a wealthy [[New York City|New York]] [[banker]], and Lucy Madison Worthington. Her brother, [[Henry Clews Jr.]], was an [[artist]]. On September 1, 1900, in [[Newport, Rhode Island]],<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |title= Miss Clews is Married |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06EFDA1039E733A25751C0A96F9C946197D6CF |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Newport, Massachusetts |date=1900-09-02 |page=5 |access-date=2010-01-01 }}</ref> she married future three-term [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congressman|congressman]] [[Herbert Parsons (New York politician)|Herbert Parsons]], an associate and political ally of [[United States President|President]] [[Teddy Roosevelt]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Robert C | title = Cartoon of the Day | work = HarpWeek | publisher = HarpWeek, LLC | url = http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Month=November&Date=16 | access-date = 2007-05-16}}</ref> When her husband was a member of Congress, she published two then-controversial books under the [[pseudonym]] John Main.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Parsons, Elsie Clews | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year = 2007 | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058571 | access-date = 2007-05-16 }}</ref>

Parsons became interested in anthropology in 1910.<ref name="ECPP" /> She believed that [[folklore]] was a key to understanding a culture and that anthropology could be a vehicle for social change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.andreageyer.info/revolttheysaid/p.html|title=Revolt, They Said|website=www.andreageyer.info|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref>

Her work ''Pueblo Indian Religion'' is considered a classic; here she gathered all her previous extensive work and that of other authors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gladys A. Reichard |title=The Elsie Clews Parsons collection Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society vol. 94, No. 3, Studies of Historical Documents in the Library of the American Philosophical Society |date=June 20, 1950 |pages=308–309}}</ref> It is, however, marred by intrusive and deceptive research techniques.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strong|first=Pauline|year=2013|title=Parsons, Elsie Clews.|journal=Theory in Social and Cultural Anthropology, ed.

She is, however, pointed to by current critical scholars as an archetypical example of an "Antimodern Feminist" thinker, known for their infatuation with Native American Indians that often manifested as a desire to preserve a "traditional" and "pure" Indian identity, irrespective of how Native Peoples themselves approached issues of modernization or cultural change. Scholars Sandy Grande and [[Margaret D. Jacobs]] argue that her racist and objectivizing tendencies towards indigenous peoples of the Americas are evidenced, for example, by her willingness to change her name and appropriate a Hopi identity primarily to increase her access to research sites and participants.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grande|first=Sandy|title=Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2015|isbn=9781610489881|edition=10th anniversary [2nd]|location=Lanham, MD|pages=190}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Engendered encounters: feminism and Pueblo cultures, 1879–1934|last=Jacobs|first=Margaret D.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8032-7609-3|location=Lincoln, NE|pages=[https://archive.org/details/engenderedencoun0000jaco/page/102 102]|url=https://archive.org/details/engenderedencoun0000jaco/page/102}}</ref>

== Feminist ideas ==
Parsons feminist beliefs were viewed as extremely radical for her time. She was a proponent of trial marriages, [[Uncontested divorce|divorce by mutual consent]] and access to reliable contraception, which she wrote about in her book ''The Family'' (1906).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Until Choice Do Us Part|last=Eby|first=Clare Virginia|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-226-08597-5|location=Chicago and London|pages=preface}}</ref> She also wrote about the effects society had on the growth of individuals, and more precisely the effect of gender role expectations and how they stifle individual growth for both women and men. ''The Family'' (1906) was met with such back-lash she published her second book ''Religious Chastity'' (1913) under the pseudonym "John Main" as to not affect her husband, [[Herbert Parsons (New York politician)|Herbert Parsons]] political career. Her ideas where so far ahead that only after her death did they begin to be discussed. This has led to her becoming recognized as one of the early pioneers of the [[feminist movement]]. Her writings and her lifestyle challenged conventional [[Gender role|gender roles]] at the time and helped spark the conversation for [[gender equality]].
