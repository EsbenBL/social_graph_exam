==Research works==
===Electoral districting and redistricting===
Altman's contributions to electoral districting and [[redistricting]] have been both theoretical and implementational. He established that the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the districting [[Computational problem|problem]] is [[NP-hard]] and hence optimal redistricting is likely to be [[Intractability (complexity)#Intractability|intractable]].<ref name="Scholar 1">{{cite journal| title=Is Automation the Answer: The Computational Complexity of Automated Redistricting|journal=[[Rutgers Computer and Technology Law Journal]] | last=Altman|first=Micah| year=1997 | issue=23|pages=81–142}}</ref><ref name="The conversation">{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/why-the-democrats-wont-win-the-house-in-2018-68037|title=Why the Democrats won't win the House in 2018|website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=2016-11-23|last1=McGann|last2=Keena|first2=Alex|last3=Smith|first3=Charles Anthony|last4=Latner|first4=Michael|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008144305/https://theconversation.com/why-the-democrats-wont-win-the-house-in-2018-68037|archivedate=2019-10-08|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref>

The undesirable implications of this result are that redistricting cannot be fully automated in practice and the choice of constraints and manual selection of the winning, "optimal" plan from a group of auto-generated plans, reintroduce value-laden and politically biased decision making back into the redistricting process (something that the use of "objective" computer programs was hoped to avoid), while potentially also legitimizing such undercover [[gerrymandering]] for the less knowledgeable public.<ref name="Scholar 1"/>

Further, computational simulations that he performed showed also that even the constraints that have been traditionally considered politically non-preferential, such as the overall compactness of the district, are not necessarily non-preferential because compactness requirements have different effects on political groups if the groups are distributed in geographically different ways.<ref name="Scholar 2">{{cite web | url=http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1871/ | title=Districting Principles and Democratic Representation | publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]| date=March 31, 1998 | accessdate=January 25, 2013|author=Micah Altman}}</ref> This result was referenced by the [[Supreme Court justice]]s  in the [[Vieth v. Jubelirer]] case.<ref name="Cornell">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html | title=Vieth V. Jubelirer (02-1580) 541 U.S. 267 (2004) 241 F. Supp. 2d 478, affirmed.|publisher=[[Cornell University Law School]]|date=April 28, 2004 | accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref>

Altman and his colleagues later created the DistrictBuilder software (a successor to the BARD package), the first open-source system to enable the public to participate in redistricting directly through the creation of legal redistricting plans.<ref name="Scholar 3">{{cite journal|title=BARD: Better Automated Redistricting|last1=Altman|first1=Micah|last2=McDonald|first2=Michael P.|journal=[[Journal of Statistical Software]]|volume=42|issue=4|year=2011|doi=10.18637/jss.v042.i04}}</ref><ref name="US News 1">{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/03/09/technology-gives-citizens-a-say-in-redistricting|title=Technology Gives Citizens a Say in Redistricting|last=Kurtzleben|first=Danielle|publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|date=2011-03-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109234655/https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/03/09/technology-gives-citizens-a-say-in-redistricting|archivedate=2018-11-09|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name="Washington 1">{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-rigged-redistricting-process/2011/03/18/ABmFxAs_story.html|title=The rigged redistricting process|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|last1=Mann|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Ornstein|first2=Norman J.|date=2011-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128044545/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-rigged-redistricting-process/2011/03/18/ABmFxAs_story.html|archivedate=2019-01-28|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name="Tech Pres">{{cite web| url=http://techpresident.com/news/21731/pursuit-tech-answer-gerrymandering-good-government-groups-must-wait-another-ten-years|title=In Pursuit of a Tech Answer to Gerrymandering, Good-Government Groups Must Wait Another Ten Years|last=Judd|first=Nick|website=[[techPresident]]|date=2012-02-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109112037/http://techpresident.com/news/21731/pursuit-tech-answer-gerrymandering-good-government-groups-must-wait-another-ten-years|archivedate=2018-11-09|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref> This effort was awarded the Brown Democracy medal and Pizzigati award (see awards and recognition), after being used by the public to  create thousands of legal districting plans --  which increased previous levels of public participation in redistricting.<ref name="US News 1" />

===Scientific data curation, preservation and replication===
Altman's research in data curation and replication began in a collaboration with the Harvard libraries and Harvard-MIT Data Center (which is now a part of the Institute of Quantitative Social Science). This work included development of an open source institutional repository for data, named the Virtual Data Center, co-led with [[Sidney Verba]] and Gary King.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/jcdl01-abs.shtml|title=An Overview of the Virtual Data Center Project and Software|last1=Altman|first1=Micah|last2=Andreev|first2=Leonid|last3=Diggory|first3=Mark|last4=King|first4=Gary|last5=Kiskis|first5=Daniel L.|last6=Kolster|first6=Elizabeth|last7=Krot|first7=Michael|last8=Verba|first8=Sidney|year=2001|publisher=First Joint Conference on Digital Libraries}}</ref> The successor to the Virtual data center, the [[Dataverse|Dataverse Network]], remains in broad use for data preservation and scientific replication.

Altman co-authored ''Numerical Issues in Statistical Computing for the Social Scientist'' with Jefferson Gill, and Michael P. McDonald in 2004, which demonstrated that the [[reproducibility]] of statistical analyses used in social science are threatened by errors and limitations in the statistical computations and software used to estimate them.<ref name=kreuter /><ref name=gill2014 /> Based on this analysis, Altman, McDonald and Gill developed methods to detect issues in social science statistical models and provide more replicable and reliable estimates.<ref name=kreuter />

Altman’s research was focused on preservation, scientific replication, and scholarly communication. It included the development of standards for data citation;<ref name="Scholar 4">{{cite book|title=Recommendations for Replication and Accurate Analysis, Numerical Issues in Statistical Computing for the Social Scientist|author=Micah Altman|display-authors=et al|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|John Wiley & Sons]]|date=January 2004|pages=253–266|doi=10.1002/0471475769.ch11|series=Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics|isbn=9780471236337}}</ref> the creation of semantic [[Fingerprint (computing)|fingerprint]] methods to verify data for scientific reuse, and long-term archiving;<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/cite-abs.shtml|title=A Proposed Standard for the Scholarly Citation of Quantitative Data|last1=Altman|first1=Micah|last2=King|first2=Gary|journal=[[D-Lib Magazine]]|date=March–April 2007|volume=13|issue=3–4|ssrn=1081955}}</ref><ref name="Scholar 5">{{cite book|chapter=A Fingerprint Method for Scientific Data Verification|title=Advances in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering|url=https://archive.org/details/advancescomputer00sobh|url-access=limited|last=Altman|first=Micah|editor-last=Sobh|editor-first=Tarek|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/advancescomputer00sobh/page/n324 311]–316|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8741-7_57|isbn=9781402087417|publisher=Springer}}</ref> the analysis of technical and institutional approach to long-term preservation;<ref name=grand>{{cite journal|url=https://grandchallenges.pubpub.org/pub/final|title=A Grand Challenges-Based Research Agenda for Scholarly Communication and Information Science|journal=Mit Grand Challenge Participation Platform|last1=Altman|first1=M.|last2=Bourg|first2=C.|last3=Cohen|first3=P.|last4=Choudhury|first4=GS|last5=Henry|first5=C.|last6=Kriegsman|first6=S.|last7=Minow|first7=M.|last8=Selematsela|first8=D.|last9=Sengupta|first9=A.|last10=Suber|first10=P.|last11=Turnator|first11=E.|publisher=MIT Grand Challenges Summit|via=PubPub|doi=10.21428/62b3421f|date=2018-12-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505194047/https://grandchallenges.pubpub.org/pub/final|archivedate=2019-05-05|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref> the creation of taxonomic standards for author attribution (working with [[Amy Brand]] and other);<ref>{{cite journal|title=Publishing: Credit where credit is due|author1=Liz Allen|author2=Jo Scott|author3=Amy Brand|author-link3=Amy Brand|author4=Marjorie Hlava|author5=Micah Altman|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=508|date=April 16, 2014|issue=7496|pages=312–313|doi=10.1038/508312a|pmid=24745070}}</ref> and the characterization of grand-challenge problems in scholarly communications.<ref name=grand />

===Information privacy===
Over the last decade, Altman has been a leader in the Harvard University Privacy Tools project,  which conducts research and develops tools to improve data privacy. Altman has published several research articles with this group characterizing the mathematical underpinnings on information privacy threats, and developing new technical and legal approaches to privacy protection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/comment/so-just-how-should-internet-users-store-their-data-1.793191|title=So, just how should internet users store their data?|last=Marsden|first=Rhodri|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=2018-11-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320075412/https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/comment/so-just-how-should-internet-users-store-their-data-1.793191|archivedate=2019-03-20|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/06/07/controlling-cambridge-analytica-managing-the-new-risks-of-personal-data-collection/|title=Controlling Cambridge Analytica: Managing the new risks of personal data collection|last1=Micah|first1=Altman|last2=Wood|first2=Alexandra|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|date=2018-06-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075430/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/06/07/controlling-cambridge-analytica-managing-the-new-risks-of-personal-data-collection/|archivedate=2018-11-28|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2018/06/14/what-facebook-can-learn-from-academia-about-protecting-privacy/KGTNRTq15aFIASBwxfYVNP/story.html|title=What Facebook can learn from academia about protecting privacy|last1=Micah|first1=Altman|last2=Wood|first2=Alexandra|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2018-06-14|accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref>
