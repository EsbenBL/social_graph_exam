This program is a 2-summer internship aimed at diversifying the conservation sector by giving opportunities to students from underrepresented backgrounds in the field and those committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Through this experience, approximately 20 undergraduates gain experience each summer through one summer of lab research and an additional summer of an internship with environmental groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conservationscholars.yale.edu/|title=The Program|website=DDCSP YSE|publisher= Yale School of the Environemnt|language=en-US|access-date=2021-07-12}}</ref>

=== Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Conferences ===
In 2018, the [https://jedsi.yale.edu/new-horizons-conservation New Horizons in Conservation Conference] - spearheaded by Taylor - took place in Washington, DC. More than 200 students, faculty, Environmental Program and Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program alumni, and conservation professionals—the majority of them people of color—gathered to "celebrate and assess" diversity, equity, and inclusion in the environmental sector, marking a milestone in conservation history. "The students and young professionals who attended this conference represent the future of conservation," Taylor said of the conference, "They are multicultural, multi-faceted, and talented, and they are poised to take on leadership roles in this sector. Diversity benefits us all, and there is strength in it." Programming included an extensive speaker series, community building, and career and academic development for program alumni.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://seas.umich.edu/news/05_02_2018/new_horizons_conservation|title=2018 New Horizons in Conservation: Addressing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Challenges Conference {{!}} University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability|website=seas.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>

The New Horizons in Conservation Conference is now an annual gathering for people who are from underrepresented backgrounds in the conservation field and those who are committed to the principals diversity, equity, and inclusion. The event draws attendees from across the nation, in varying professions and career stages, including but not limited to undergraduate and graduate students, academics, environmental professionals, policy advocates, and elected officials. New Horizons also works to bolster the critical pipelines built by diversity pathway programs across the nation by providing spaces for participants to connect with peers, network, engage in hands-on professional development workshops and training, attend local field trips, and hear from a diverse range of leaders and visionaries in the field. The second annual New Horizons in Conservation Conference to took place in Chicago, Illinois in April 2019.

In 2021, Taylor began the [https://jedsi.yale.edu/ Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Sustainability Initiative (JEDSI)] at Yale School of the Environment. JEDSI seeks to examine the relationship between social inequalities, lived experiences, and environmental outcomes. JEDSI currently focuses on eight primary areas of research, teaching, and practice: Environmental History
Nature, Outdoor Experiences, Attitudes, and Perceptions
Environmental Inequalities, Resilience, and Sustainability
Food and Farming:  Access, Sovereignty, Food Justice
Institutional Diversity, Transparency, and Workforce Dynamics
Diversity Pathway Programming

== Work on environmental justice ==

Taylor's award-winning book, ''The Environment and the People in American Cities'' (Duke University Press, 2009), focused on the environmental challenges American cities faced in the 17th through 20th centuries.  She documented the race, class, and gender dynamics that arose as urban dwellers tried to deal with environmental problems.  The book also demonstrated that from the outset environmental inequalities arose in American cities and were perpetuated in deliberate and unintentional ways.  An "ambitious"<ref name="smith">{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Kimberly K. |title=Dorceta E.

In it, she examines the emergence and rise of the American conservation movement from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, demonstrating how race, class, and gender influenced every aspect of the movement from the establishment of parks to outdoor recreation and forest conservation; and the movement's links to nineteenth century ideologies. "Far-ranging," "nuanced," and "comprehensive," one scholar suggested that ''The Rise of the American Conservation Movement'' documents the movement in ways that will inspire readers to reconsider what they have been previously taught about environmental history.<ref name=":5" />

Taylor's second book and third piece of her series, ''Toxic Communities:  Environmental Racism, Industrial Pollution, and Residential Mobility'' (New York University Press, 2014) chronicles the contamination of minority and low income communities in the U.S.  It examines seven different theories that have been used to explain why racial minorities and the poor are often found living adjacent to toxic facilities or undesirable land uses, and particularly challenges the assumption that minority communities have the requisite mobility to move away from such facilities.<ref name="dillon">{{Cite journal|journal=Urban Studies|volume=52|issue=9|title= Book review: Toxic Communities: Environmental Racism, Industrial Pollution, and Residential Mobility|date=2015-05-19

The study examines the relationship between demographic characteristics and the distribution of food outlets in 18 small and medium-sized cities in the state. It also examines effective nutrition and behavioral interventions, and mechanisms for enhancing access to food and participation in local food initiatives. These issues are being studied in Sault Ste.
