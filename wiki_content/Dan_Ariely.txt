In 2021, data from his influential 2012 publication was reanalyzed and found to have been manipulated,<ref name=DataColada/> with the explicit suggestion being made that the data was faked.<ref name=Buzzfeed/> The paper was retracted and Ariely denies the accusation of fraud.<ref>{{cite news |title=Behavioral researcher says he 'undoubtedly made a mistake' in false data scandal |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/behavioral-researcher-says-he-undoubtedly-made-a-mistake-in-false-data-scandal/ |work=www.timesofisrael.com |publisher=Times of Israel}}</ref>

==Early life and family==
Dan Ariely was born in [[New York City]] while his father was studying for an [[MBA degree]] at [[Columbia University]]. The family emigrated to [[Israel]] when he was three. He grew up in [[Ramat Hasharon]].<ref name=haa /> In his senior year of high school, he was active in [[Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed]], an Israeli [[youth movement]]. While he was preparing a ''{{transl|he|ktovet esh}}'' (fire inscription) for a traditional nighttime ceremony, the flammable materials he was mixing exploded, causing [[third-degree burns]] over 70 percent of his body.<ref name=haa /> In his writings, Ariely describes how that experience led to his research on "how to better deliver painful and unavoidable treatments to patients."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.mit.edu/ariely/www/MIT/Papers/mypain.pdf | title=Painful Lessons | access-date=2013-05-14 | author=Ariely, Dan}}</ref><ref>[https://www.thecut.com/2015/07/terrible-accident-led-to-dan-arielys-career.html Dahl, Melissa. "How a Terrible Accident Inspired Dan Ariely’s Career Path." ''New York Magazine'' 31 July 2015.]</ref>

Dan married Sumedha (Sumi) Gupta Ariely in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Daniel Ariely, PhD|url=https://www.mentorcoach.com/positive-psychology-coaching/interviews/interview-daniel-ariely-phd/|access-date=2021-08-24|website=Mentor Coach|language=en-US}}</ref> They have two children and are now divorced. {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

==Education and academic career==
Ariely was a [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] major at [[Tel Aviv University]] but transferred to [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]. However, in his last year he dropped philosophy and concentrated solely on psychology. In 1996 he earned a Ph.D. in [[cognitive psychology]] from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], and completed a second PhD in Marketing at [[Duke University]] in 1998, at the urging of Nobel economic sciences laureate [[Daniel Kahneman]].<ref name=haa /><ref>http://labs.vtc.vt.edu/hnl/articles/Ariely_CV.pdf</ref>
 
Ariely taught at [[MIT]] between 1998 and 2008, where he was formerly the [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Professor of [[Behavioral Economics]] at [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. In 2008 Ariely returned to Duke University as [[James B. Duke Professor]] of Psychology and Behavioral Economics.

Ariely published a paper in the journal [[Psychological Science]] in 2004 dealing with the connection between monetary and social payments for effort.<ref>[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00757.x Effort for Payment: A Tale of Two Markets]</ref> In July 2021, after the work of researchers from Hong Kong, the journal published an "Expression of Concern" regarding the statistical analysis of the paper.<ref>[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211035782?af=R&ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys Expression of Concern: Effort for Payment: A Tale of Two Markets]</ref>

In 2012, Ariely and co-authors published a [[PNAS]] paper finding that people are more honest when signing an ethics declaration at the beginning of a form rather than at the end.<ref>[https://www.pnas.org/content/109/38/15197 Signing at the beginning makes ethics salient and decreases dishonest self-reports in comparison to signing at the end]</ref> The Social and Behavioral Sciences Team of the Obama administration recommended the intervention as a “nonfinancial incentive” to improve honesty - e.g. on tax declarations - in its 2016 annual report.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=O’GradyAug. 24|first1=Cathleen|last2=2021|last3=Pm|first3=4:10|date=2021-08-24|title=Fraudulent data raise questions about superstar honesty researcher|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/fraudulent-data-set-raise-questions-about-superstar-honesty-researcher|access-date=2021-08-25|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en}}</ref> In 2020, Ariely and his co-authors published a follow-up paper in PNAS, stating that they failed to [[Reproducibility|replicate]] the results.<ref>[https://www.pnas.org/content/109/38/15197 Signing at the beginning versus at the end does not decrease dishonesty]</ref>

=== Accusations of data fraud and academic misconduct ===
In August 2021, the blog Data Colada published evidence that the data used for the 2012 PNAS paper was fraudulent.<ref name=DataColada>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-17|title=[98] Evidence of Fraud in an Influential Field Experiment About Dishonesty|url=https://datacolada.org/98|access-date=2021-08-18|website=Data Colada|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=Buzzfeed>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Stephanie |title=A Big Study About Honesty Turns Out To Be Based On Fake Data |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/dan-ariely-honesty-study-retraction |website=BuzzFeed News |access-date=23 August 2021 |language=en |date=20 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2021-08-20 |last1=Gelman |first1=Andrew |title=A scandal in Tedhemia: Noted study in psychology first fails to replicate (but is still promoted by NPR), then crumbles with striking evidence of data fraud « Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science |url=https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/08/19/a-scandal-in-tedhemia-noted-study-in-psychology-first-fails-to-replicate-but-is-still-promoted-by-npr-then-crumbles-with-striking-evidence-of-data-fraud/ |website=statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu |access-date=23 August 2021 |format=Editorial}}</ref> Ariely subsequently asked for the paper to be retracted.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-08-20|title=A study on dishonesty was based on fraudulent data|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/20/a-study-on-dishonesty-was-based-on-fraudulent-data|access-date=2021-08-23|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/fraudulent-data-set-raise-questions-about-superstar-honesty-researcher | title=Fraudulent data raise questions about superstar honesty researcher | publisher=Science | access-date=2021-08-25}}</ref>

Multiple research groups have also failed to replicate one of his famous studies about moral reminders, where it was shown that people are less likely to cheat on a task after making a list of the Ten Commandments.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Replication Project Investigates Effect of Moral Reminders on Cheating Behavior|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/moral-reminders-replication.html|access-date=2021-09-19|website=Association for Psychological Science - APS|language=en-US}}</ref>

After the outbreak of the scandal, the online news journal "Hamakom" claimed that while Ariely was at MIT and ran an experiment regarding the value of placebos ("Commercial Features of Placebo and Therapeutic Efficacy"), he used electric shocks on volunteers without asking or receiving an [[Institutional review board]] approval for such an experiment. This was discovered after one of the participants complained, and an approval was granted  only after the experiment was concluded. The ethics committee decided to forbid Ariely to run experiments for a year, after which he moved to Duke University.<ref>[https://www.ha-makom.co.il/post-tomer-dan-ariely-mit-suspention/ Dan Ariely was suspended from research in MIT after conducting unauthorized experiment with human subjects]</ref>
Ariely confirmed that he was suspended and claimed it was a misunderstanding between him and the IRB.<ref>[https://www.mako.co.il/news-n12_magazine/2021_q3/Article-262e3d50611ab71026.htm  A segment on Dan Ariely in News 12 (Hebrew)]</ref>

In 2010 Ariely misreported on another set of data supposedly collected from an insurance company. In an interview on NPR he claimed he had data from Delta Dental that showed high rates of misdiagnosis from X-Rays. Delta Dental had to intervene and make the correction that they never provided Ariely with this data because they never collected such data.<ref>https://www.wbur.org/npr/131079116/should-you-be-suspicious-of-your-dentist-or-nprs-source</ref>

== Business activities ==
In 2010 Ariely co-founded BEworks, the first management consulting firm dedicated to applying behavioral science to strategy, marketing, operations, and policy challenges. BEworks was acquired by kyu Collective in January 2017.<ref>Nusca, Andrew, "[http://fortune.com/2017/01/09/exclusive-kyu-beworks/ Exclusive: IDEO Investor Kyu Acquires BEworks, a Behavioral Economics Firm]", ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', 9 January 2017</ref>
 
In 2012 he co-founded, with Yuval Shoham and Jacob Bank, Timeful.,<ref name="forbes.com"/> a technology company dedicated to reinventing the way people manage their most precious resource - time. Timeful was acquired by Google In 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/05/time-is-on-your-sidewelcoming-timeful.html|title= Time is on your side—welcoming Timeful to Google|publisher=Google Blog}}</ref>
 
In 2013 he co-founded, with Doron Marco and Ayelet Carasso, Genie,<ref name="genie.cooking"/> a kitchen appliance designed to cook personalized healthy dishes in about a minute.

In 2018 he co-founded the company Kayma, which specializes in solving complex wide-scale problems through behavioral economics and original research methods.<ref name=":0" />
 
In October 2015, Ariely was named chief behavioral economist for Qapital. Ariely, who has also invested in the company,<ref>Anderson, Jenny, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/savings-app-behavioral-economist/414522/ The Savings App Designed by a Behavioral Economist]", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 5 November 2015</ref> uses his access to the app's platform and database to assist him in independent research on consumer saving and spending behavior. In turn, Qapital can access Ariely's research to test technologies and ideas for use in the app.  ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'' magazine observed: "It's a synergistic relationship that points at the emergence of a new trend: the collaboration between startups and social scientists."<ref>Entis, Laura, "[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/251662 How This Famous Behavioral Economist Is Trying to Help People Solve Their Most Common Money Problems]", ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', 13 October 2015</ref>

In February 2016, Ariely was named Chief Behavioral Officer for Lemonade, an insurance company operating in the U.S. Ariely integrates aspects of behavioral economics into Lemonade's insurance model and helps to align incentives between the insurer and insured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonade.com/blog/oh-behave/
|title= Oh, Behave!|publisher=Lemonade Blog}}</ref>

==Books==
Ariely is the author of the books ''Dollars and Sense: How We Misthink Money and How to Spend Smarter'', [[Predictably Irrational|''Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions'']],<ref>{{cite magazine | title=What Was I Thinking? | author=Elizabeth Kolbert | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date= 25 February 2008 | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/25/what-was-i-thinking}}</ref> ''The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home'' and ''[[The Honest Truth about Dishonesty|The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone – Especially Ourselves]]''.

He explains the impetus for his first book: {{Quote|sign=|source=|I have a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology, and I have a Ph.D. in business administration. But what I do lies between psychology and economics. I ask questions that economists would ask, but instead of assuming straightaway that people behave rationally, I just observe how people behave. In "Predictably Irrational", I talk about how people think, mostly about financial decisions. The things that we buy. One chapter asks the question, "How do we decide how much something is worth?" Economic theory has a very simple assumption about this. But I ask the question, "How do we really do it?"<ref name="learningfirst.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.learningfirst.org/predictably-irrational-conversation-best-selling-author-dan-ariely |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001104618/http://www.learningfirst.org/predictably-irrational-conversation-best-selling-author-dan-ariely |archive-date=2010-10-01 }}</ref>}}  When asked whether reading ''Predictably Irrational'' and understanding one's irrational behaviors could make a person's life worse (such as by defeating the benefits of a [[placebo]]), Ariely responded that there could be a short-term cost, but that there would also likely be long-term benefits, and that reading his book would not make a person worse off.<ref>[http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/2.28.08_Issue.pdf "Predictably Irrational Is an Irresistible Look at Our Not-So-Rational Foibles"] Derek Tokaz, ''The Commentator'', Feb. 28, 2008 [[New York University School of Law]]</ref>

Asked to describe ''The Upside of Irrationality'', Ariely says, {{Quote|sign=|source=|The first half is about motivation in the workplace. It asks questions like, "What is the real effect of bonuses? What happens when we give high bonuses?" It turns out it motivates people, but it doesn't always bring higher performance. It often actually brings lower performance. Because money can stress people...The second part of "The Upside of Irrationality" is about the personal life. It's about the question, how do we find happiness? And how do we adapt to good and bad things that happen to us? And it's a little bit about emotion.<ref name="learningfirst.org"/>}}

[[Michael S. Roth]] writes of ''The Honest Truth About Dishonesty'', "Ariely raises the bar for everyone. In the increasingly crowded field of popular cognitive science and behavioral economics, he writes with an unusual combination of verve and sagacity. He asks us to remember our fallibility and irrationality, so that we might protect ourselves against our tendency to fool ourselves."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-roth/dan-ariely-dishonesty_b_1769685.html | title=Book Review: Dan Ariely's the (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty| website=[[HuffPost]]| date=2012-08-12}}</ref>

In 2008 Ariely, along with his co-authors, Rebecca Waber, [[Ziv Carmon]] and [[Baba Shiv]], was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in medicine for their research demonstrating that "high-priced fake medicine is more effective than low-priced fake medicine."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/ | title=Winners of the Ig® Nobel Prize | publisher=Improbable Research | access-date=2013-05-15}}</ref>
