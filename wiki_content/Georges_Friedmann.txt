'''Georges Philippe Friedmann''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁidman|lang}}; 13 May 1902 – 15 November 1977), was a French [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher]], known for his influential work on the effects of industrial labor on individuals and his criticisms of the uncontrolled embrace of technological change in twentieth-century [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].

He was the third president of the [[International Sociological Association]] (1956-1959).<ref name="presidents">{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/about/presidents/ |title=ISA Presidents |publisher=International Sociological Association|access-date=2012-07-25}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Friedmann was the last child of Adolphe Friedmann (1857-1922), a Berlin merchant, and Elizabeth Nathan (1871-1940). He was born in Paris, where his parents moved after their marriage in Berlin in 1882. They acquired French nationality in 1903.

After a brief period studying industrial chemistry, Friedmann prepared for the philosophy ''[[agrégation]]'' at the prestigious [[Lycée Henri-IV|Lycée Henri IV]] in Paris. He studied philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] from 1923-1926. He served as an assistant to the sociologist [[Célestin Bouglé]] at the Centre de documentation sociale, a social science research center at the ENS funded by the banker [[Albert Kahn (banker)|Albert Kahn]] and, later, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

Upon the death of his father in 1929, Friedmann inherited a fortune of 2.6 million francs, which enabled him to finance several of his young classmates' intellectual journals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lallement|first=Michel|date=2014|title=Georges Friedmann au Cnam (1946-1959)|url=http://technique-societe.cnam.fr/medias/fichier/chc1-2014-1_1422283474502-pdf?pk_campaign=chc|journal=Cahiers du CNAM|volume=1|pages=43–74}}</ref> Friedmann eventually donated a large part of the fortune to the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Fondation Curie]] for cancer research. After his death, Degas paintings Friedmann had inherited from his father's collection were donated to the [[Louvre]].

Friedmann married his first wife, Hania Olszweska, a Polish Catholic, in 1937. The couple had one daughter, Liliane, born in 1941 in Toulouse. After Hania's death in 1957, Friedmann married Marcelle Rémond in 1960.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reynaud|first=Jean-Daniel|date=1994|title=FRIEDMANN, Georges (1902-1977). Professeur d'Histoire du travail (1946-1959)|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/inrp_0298-5632_1994_ant_19_1_8449|journal=Bibliothèque Historique de l'Éducation|volume=19|pages=544–549|via=Persée}}</ref>

After taking his family to Toulouse, Friedmann joined the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], when he was hunted by the Nazi [[Gestapo]] due to his Communist activities. He later wrote that he escaped the [[Gestapo]] in 1943, and was hidden in a school in [[Dordogne]] by a pair of young schoolteachers.<sup>[[Georges Friedmann#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> Friedmann's journals from the war, published posthumously in 1987, recounted his experiences as a member of the resistance.

He received his ''Doctorat d'état'' in 1946, with his major thesis on mechanization in industrial production and minor thesis on Leibniz and Spinoza, both published as monographs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/isa-past-presidents/list-of-presidents/georges-friedmann/|title=Georges Friedmann|website=International Sociological Association}}</ref>

== Scholarly work ==
At the ENS, Friedmann was close to the Philosophies group that opposed the influence of [[Henri Bergson]] and was influential in bringing Marx’s earlier philosophical texts to France, and included [[Georges Politzer]], [[Norbert Guterman]]n, [[Paul Nizan]], and [[Henri Lefebvre]]. The group's initial journal, ''Esprit,'' and its successor, ''Philosophies'', were funded by Friedmann's personal wealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=French Marxism Between the Wars: Henri Lefebvre and the Philosophies|last=Burkhard|first=Bud|publisher=Humanity Books|year=2000|location=Amherst, NY|pages=26}}</ref>

During the 1930s, Friedmann made several trips to the [[Soviet Union]], where observed the Soviet industry and technology. His 1938 book, ''De la Sainte Russie à l’U.R.S.S.'' established him as an authority on Soviet society in France. But even his moderate criticisms of the U.S.S.R. and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] caused bitter conflict with members of the [[French Communist Party]] and began Friedmann’s move away from political activism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gouarné|first=Isabelle|title=Engagement philosoviétique et posture sociologique dans l'entre-deux-guerres : le rôle politico-intellectuel de Georges Friedmann|journal=Sociologie du Travail|volume=54|issue=3|pages=356–374|doi=10.1016/j.soctra.2012.06.002|year=2012}}</ref>

Friedmann’s doctoral thesis, published after the end of the war in 1946, examined the "human problems" of automation and mechanization European industrial production. A critical, historical overview of paradigms of industrial management, particularly [[scientific management]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial psychology]], and [[Human relations movement|human relations]], ''Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel'' examined social scientists’ efforts to "humanize" industrial labor that had been fragmented and [[Deskilling|de-skilled]] by industrialization and Taylorism. Friedmann argued that while these efforts were an improvement on the "technicist ideology" of management engineering, social science would not lead to significant changes in labor practices without class conflict and the transformation of the capitalist economic system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel|last=Friedmann|first=Georges|publisher=Gallimard|year=1946|isbn=978-2070225897|location=Paris|pages=381–388}}</ref>

Friedmann’s book is considered a founding text of French ''sociologie du travail'', and he was influential in the refounding of French sociology after World War II, playing a major role in the foundations of the Centre d'études sociologues and the Institute des Sciences Sociales du Travail (ISST).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Servants of post-industrial power? : sociologie du travail in Modern France|last=1937-|first=Rose, Michael|date=1979|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780333236499}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=French Sociology|last=Heilbron|first=Johan|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2015|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=chapter four}}</ref> His influential students included [[Alain Touraine]], [[Michel Crozier]], Jean-Daniel Reynaud, and Jean-René Tréanton, who conducted some of the first empirical work in [[industrial sociology]] in France. Friedmann later founded the Centre d'études de communications de masse (CECMAS) at the [[École pratique des hautes études|École pratiques des hautes études]], whose early participants included [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Roland Barthes]].

Friedmann continued to travel extensively around the world, observing and publishing on labor practices and industrial models in the United States, Israel, and South America. His analysis of the nature of the Jewish people and Israeli society in ''The End of the Jewish People''?, one of his few works to be translated into English, attracted media attention in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E7D7113AE63ABC4152DFB166838C679EDE&legacy=true|title=Victory, or Defeat?|last=Lask|first=Thomas|date=July 19, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>

Friedmann gradually shifted from emphasis on labor to a broader concern with "technical civilization." His final book, ''La Puissance et la Sagesse'', a mixture of autobiography and reflection on contemporary society, modified his earlier Marxism and emphasized the importance of interiority and morality on humanizing postwar consumer society.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/editionscnrs/1669|title=Georges Friedmann : Un sociologue dans le siècle, 1902-1977|last=Segrestin|first=Denis|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2013|editor-last=Grémion|editor-first=Pierre|location=Paris|pages=141–152|chapter=«La Puissance et la Sagesse» : Georges Friedmann face à la civilisation technicienne}}</ref>
