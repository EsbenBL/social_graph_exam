'''Mançur Lloyd Olson Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|s|ər}};<ref>''The Economic Journal'', Vol. 109, No. 456, Features (Jun., 1999), p. F445.</ref> January 22, 1932 – February 19, 1998) was an American [[economist]] and [[Political science|political scientist]] who taught at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. His most influential contributions were in [[institutional economics]], and in the role which [[private property]], [[taxation]], [[public goods]], [[collective action]], and [[contract]] rights play in [[economic development]].

==Education and career==
Olson graduated from [[North Dakota State University]], and was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] before he earned a [[PhD]] in [[economics]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1963.

His first job was as an assistant professor at [[Princeton University]]. Afterwards, he served as Deputy Assistant [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare]] for two years in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1969 he left government and joined the economics department of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where he remained until his death.<ref name=nyt/>

===Academic work===
In his first book, ''[[The Logic of Collective Action|The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups]]'' (1965), he theorized that what stimulates people to act in groups is incentive; members of large groups do not act in accordance with a common interest unless motivated by personal gain (economic, social, etc.). While small groups can act on shared objectives, large groups will not work towards shared objectives unless their individual members are sufficiently motivated.<ref>Mancur Olson Jr., 1965, 2nd ed., 1971. ''The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups'', Harvard University Press, [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674537514 Description], [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?recid=24500&content=toc Table of Contents], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzTeOLtf7_wC&printsec=find&pg=PA5=onepage&q&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false preview].</ref>

In 1982, he expanded the scope of his earlier work in an attempt to explain ''[[The Rise and Decline of Nations]]'' (1982). He argues that groups such as cotton farmers, steel producers, and [[labor unions]] have an incentive to form [[lobby groups]] and influence policies in their favor. These policies will tend to be [[protectionist]], which will hurt [[economic growth]]; but because the benefits of such policies are concentrated, and their costs are diffused throughout the whole population, there will be little public resistance to them. As distributional coalitions accumulate, nations burdened by them will fall into economic decline. His work influenced the formulation of the [[Calmfors–Driffill hypothesis]] of [[collective bargaining]].<ref>Mancur Olson, 1982. ''The Rise and Decline of Nations: Economic Growth, Stagflation, and Social Rigidities'', Yale University Press, 1982.

In his final book, ''[[Power and Prosperity]]'' (2000), Olson distinguished between the economic effects of different types of government, in particular, [[tyranny]], [[anarchy]], and [[democracy]]. Olson argued that under anarchy, a "roving bandit" only has the incentive to steal and destroy, whilst a "stationary bandit"—a tyrant—has an incentive to encourage some degree of economic success as he expects to remain in power long enough to benefit from that success. A stationary bandit thereby begins to take on the governmental function of protecting citizens and their property against roving bandits. In the move from roving to stationary bandits, Olson sees the seeds of [[civilization]], paving the way, eventually for democracy, which by giving power to those who align with the wishes of the population, improves incentives for good government.<ref>Mancur Olson, 2000. ''Power and Prosperity: Outgrowing Communist and Capitalist Dictatorships'', Oxford University Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BX3cZqSbHlMC&printsec=find&pg=PA241=onepage&q&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=BX3cZqSbHlMC&printsec=frontcover#PPR5,M1 links.] ''[[Foreign Affairs]] ''[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/55913/richard-n-cooper/power-and-prosperity-outgrowing-communist-and-capitalist-dictato review].</ref> Olson's work on the roving vs. stationary bandits is influential in analysis of the political and economic order structured in [[warlord]] states and societies.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Policy work===
To help bring his ideas to the attention of policymakers, Olson founded the Center for Institutional Reform in the Informal Sector ("IRIS Center"), funded by [[USAID]] (United States Agency for International Development). Based at the University of Maryland, the Center sought to supply an intellectual foundation for legal and economic reform projects carried out by USAID in formerly communist states that were attempting to make the transition to market-driven democratic governments governed by the [[rule of law]]. It was particularly active in East and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.

The Center also became actively involved in projects in South America, Africa, and Asia, where it became a proponent of [[judicial independence]].  It sponsored the first conference on [[corruption]] in francophone Africa in the 1990s, when it was a very sensitive subject. The IRIS Center continued to operate after Olson's death, but was eventually folded into other programs at the University of Maryland.

To honor Olson's many contributions, the [[American Political Science Association]] established the Olson Award for the best PhD dissertation in Political Economy.<ref>[http://www.apsanet.org/MEMBERSHIP/Organized-Sections-by-Title/Organized-Section-25-Mancur-Olson-Best-Dissertation-Award Organized Section 25: Mancur Olson Best Dissertation Award]</ref> In 2013 the University of Maryland announced the creation of a new [[Financial endowment#Endowed professorships|endowed professorship]]—the Mancur Olson Professor of Economics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.umd.edu/about/news/97 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231744/http://www.econ.umd.edu/about/news/97 |archive-date=2013-12-02 }}</ref> Maryland Professor of Economics Peter Murrell was the first Mancur Olson Professor.
