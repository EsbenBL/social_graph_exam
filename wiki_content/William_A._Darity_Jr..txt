==Research==

===Focus===
Darity's economic research has varied widely in topic, but many of his studies focus largely on [[economic stratification]],<ref name="stratification"/> [[economic inequality]], the [[labor market]] and "marriage market" outcomes, caste and race, disconnected youth, ethnic diversity and conflict, and job tenure versus work experience.<ref name="ECONOM"/> He has specifically studied financial crises in [[developing countries]],<ref name="duke"/> North-South theories of development and trade, and the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name="CAMILLE"/> He has also studied the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]], or what is called the [[African diaspora]], the spread of African culture and influence through the slave trade. He has stated that much of the history wasn't documented or analyzed, and that there's a need to fill in gaps of knowledge and analyze cause and effect in modern times.<ref name="toler"/>

As a social theorist and researcher, he has also studied social psychological effects of exposure to unemployment,<ref name="CAMILLE"/> group-based [[post traumatic stress disorder]],<ref name="duke"/> schooling and the racial achievement gap, racialized "tracking" in schools, the economics of [[black reparations]],<ref name="duke"/> and social policy as they relate to race and ethnicity.<ref name="duke"/> Recently he has focused on what he perceives as a "disconnect" between the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in the field of African American fictional literature and film.<ref name="versa"/>

===Notable studies===

====Incident reports====
Darity was one of three conductors and writers of a study that found that white respondents tend to over-report incidents of mistreatment at work, while black employees are not aware of the mistreatment or are less likely to report them.<ref name="CREE"/>

====Baby bonds program====
With economist Darrick Hamilton, Darity has proposed a federal wealth redistribution program aimed at remediating the racial wealth gap.<ref name="baby"/> Called [[baby bonds]], the program calls for the issuance of government backed bonds for each child born into poverty to be redeemed when the child reaches 18 years of age.<ref name="wealth"/>

====Skin tone and marriage====
In 2009, Darity, along with Arthur Goldsmith and Darrick Hamilton, published "Shedding 'Light' on Marriage: The Influence of Skin Shade on Marriage for Black Females" in the ''[[Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization]]''.<ref name="CREE"/> The study found that American black women with lighter skin were more likely to attain a "high status black spouse" than darker-skinned women, and analyzed social theories that could explain the disparity.<ref name="skin"/>

====Unemployment rates====
He has also been referenced by the media as an expert concerning [[Barack Obama]]'s political strategies as related to unemployment ratings and economic policy.<ref name="obama"/> Darity criticized Obama's October 2011 economic strategy as "bribing the private sector to put people back to work. I was hoping that there would be some effort to create a plan, there would be some effort to have a plan for direct job creation, where the federal government would directly put people back to work."

In February 2012, Darity responded critically through ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' to a government report claiming that black [[unemployment in the United States]] had dropped from 15.8% to 13.6%. According to Darity, the drop was more likely the result of a massive spike in black workers dropping from the work force, and therefore no longer being included in the statistics for black employment. "If a large proportion of the persons exiting from the labor force were black, that could drop the black [unemployment] rate without any significant new employment," Darity wrote.<ref name="UNEMPL"/>

In 2012, in response to the protracted economic crisis, Darity called for a federal [[job guarantee]] program called the National Investment Employment Corps, which would guarantee all U.S. citizens over the age of 18 a job at a minimal salary of $20,000, as well as $10,000 in benefits, including medical coverage and retirement savings.<ref name="pbx"/><ref name="cnbc"/>

==Personal life==
Darity lives in [[Durham, North Carolina]], with his family. He played [[harmonica]] in a local [[blues]] band.<ref name="duke"/>
