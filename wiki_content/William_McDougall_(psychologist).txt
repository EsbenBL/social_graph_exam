He wrote a number of influential textbooks, and was important in the development of the theory of [[instinct]] and of [[social psychology]] in the English-speaking world.

McDougall was an opponent of [[behaviourism]] and stands somewhat outside the mainstream of the development of Anglo-American psychological thought in the first half of the 20th century; but his work was known and respected among lay people.

==Biography==

He was born at [[Tonge, Middleton]] in the Manchester area on 22 June 1871, the second son of Isaac Shimwell McDougall and his wife Rebekah Smalley.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=34716|first=Graham|last=Richards|title=McDougall, William}}</ref> His father was one of the McDougall brothers who developed [[self-raising flour]], but concentrated on his own business as a chemical manufacturer.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shephard |first1=Ben |title=Headhunters: The Pioneers of Neuroscience |date=2015 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-09-956573-4 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_T4jCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 |language=en}}</ref> 

McDougall was educated at a number of schools, and was a student at [[Owens College, Manchester|Owens College]], Manchester and [[St John's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=MDGL890W|name=McDougall, William}}</ref> He studied medicine and physiology in London and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. After teaching at [[University College London]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he was recruited to occupy the [[William James]] chair of psychology at [[Harvard University]] in 1920, where he served as a professor of psychology from 1920 to 1927. He then moved to [[Duke University]], where he established the Parapsychology Laboratory under [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]], and where he remained until his death. He was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. Among his students were [[Cyril Burt]], [[May Smith (psychologist)|May Smith]], [[William Brown (psychologist)|William Brown]] and [[John Flügel]].<ref name=measuring>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9780521026185| last = Wooldridge| first = Adrian| title = Measuring the Mind: Education and Psychology in England C.1860-c.1990| date = 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1zcWgGd-CEC| access-date= 15 March 2015| pages=57–58}}</ref>

==Views==
McDougall's interests and sympathies were broad. He was interested in [[eugenics]], but departed from [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] orthodoxy in maintaining the possibility of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as suggested by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]; he carried out many experiments designed to demonstrate this process.<ref name="Berger">Berger, Arthur S. (1988). ''Portrait of William McDougall''. In ''Lives and Letters in American Parapsychology: A Biographical History, 1850–1987''. McFarland. pp. 118–124. {{ISBN|0-89950-345-4}}</ref> Opposing behaviourism, he argued that behaviour was generally goal-oriented and purposive, an approach he called '''hormic psychology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὁρμή ''hormḗ'' "impulse"). He first outlined hormic psychology in An Introduction to Social Psychology (London, 1908.) Hormic psychology serves as one of the foundational frameworks for understanding the wide range of human motivational forces. The term “hormic” comes from the Greek word for impulse and according to Hilgard (1987) was drawn from the work of T. P. Nunn, a British colleague (Larson, 2014).

However, in the theory of [[motivation]], he defended the idea that individuals are motivated by a significant number of inherited instincts, whose action they may not consciously understand, so they might not always understand their own goals. His ideas on instinct strongly influenced [[Konrad Lorenz]] {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}, though Lorenz did not always acknowledge this {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}. McDougall underwent [[psychoanalysis]] with [[C. G. Jung]], and was also prepared to study [[parapsychology]]. 

Because of his interest in [[eugenics]] and his unorthodox stance on [[evolution]], McDougall has been adopted as an iconic figure by proponents of a strong influence of inherited traits on behavior, some of whom are regarded by most mainstream psychologists as [[scientific racism|scientific racists]]. He wrote: <blockquote>
"...; the few distinguished Negroes, so called, of America – such as Douglass, Booker Washington, Du Bois – have been, I believe, in all cases mulattoes or had some proportion of white blood. We may fairly ascribe the incapacity of the Negro race to form a nation to the lack of men endowed with the qualities of great leaders, even more than to the lower level of average capacity" (McDougall, William., The Group Mind, p.187, Arno Press, 1973; Copyright, 1920 by G.P. Putnam's Sons).
</blockquote>

McDougall married at the age of 29 ("against my considered principles", he reports in his autobiographical essay, "for I held that a man whose chosen business in life was to develop to the utmost his intellectual powers should not marry before forty, if at all"). He had five children.

McDougall's book ''The Group Mind'' received "very hostile reviews" from psychologists but sold well to the public. The [[Media of the United States|American Press]] was critical of McDougall as his lectures on national eugenics were seen as racist.<ref name="Berger"/>

==Psychical research==

McDougall was a strong advocate of the [[scientific method]] and academic professionalisation in psychical research. He was instrumental in establishing [[parapsychology]] as a university discipline in the US in the early 1930s. The traditional historiography of psychical research, dominated by the ‘winners’ of the race for ‘the science of the soul’, reveals fascinating epistemological incommensurabilities and a complex set of interplays between scientific and metaphysical presuppositions in the making and keeping alive of the scientific status of psychology. Thus, revised histories of psychical research and its relationship to psychology with a critical thrust not limited to that which has been viewed with suspicion anyway, offer both a challenge and a promise to historians, the discussion of which the present article hopes to stimulate (Sommer, 2012). <ref>Asprem, E. (2010), [https://archive.today/20130105082201/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123349587/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 "A Nice Arrangement of Heterodoxies: William McDougall and the Professionalization of Psychical Research"], ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', '''46''' (2):123–143.</ref> In 1920, McDougall served as president of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and in the subsequent year of its US counterpart, the [[American Society for Psychical Research]].<ref>{{Citation

McDougall worked to enlist a number of scientific, religious, ethical, political and philosophical issues and causes into a wide “actor-network” which finally pushed through the institutionalization and professionalization of parapsychology (Asprem, 2010). He was also a member of the ''[[Scientific American]]'' committee that investigated the medium [[Mina Crandon]].<ref name="Berger"/> He attended séances with the medium and was sceptical about her "[[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasmic]] hand". He suspected that it was part of an animal, artificially manipulated to resemble a hand. McDougall's suspicion was confirmed by independent experts who had examined photographs of the hand.<ref name="Berger"/>

McDougall was critical of [[spiritualism]], he believed that some of its proponents such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] misunderstood psychical research and "devote themselves to propaganda".<ref name="Berger"/> In 1926, McDougall concluded "I have taken part in a considerable number of investigations of alleged supernormal phenomena; but hitherto have failed to find convincing evidence in any case, but have found rather much evidence of fraud and trickery."<ref>Valentine, Elizabeth R. (2011). ''Spooks and Spoofs: Relations Between Psychical Research and Academic Psychology in Britain in the Inter-War Period.'' History of the Human Sciences 25: 67–90.</ref> 

McDougall, however, continued to encourage scientific research on psychic phenomena and in 1937 was a founding co-editor (with Joseph Banks Rhine) of the peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Parapsychology]]'', which continues to be published. Because he was the first to formulate a theory of human instinctual behavior, he influenced the development of the new field of social psychology.

== Animism ==
In 1911, McDougall authored ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism''. In the work he rejected both [[materialism]] and [[Darwinism]] and supported a form of [[Lamarckism]] where mind guides [[evolution]]. McDougall defended a form of [[animism]] where all matter has a mental aspect; his views were very similar to [[panpsychism]] as he believed that there was an animating principle in matter and had claimed in his work that there were both [[psychological]] and [[biological]] evidence for this position.<ref>The New international encyclopaedia, Volume 7, Dodd, Mead and company, 1923, p. 282</ref> McDougall had defended the theory that [[mind]] and the brain are distinct but interact with each other though he was not a dualist or a monist as he believed his theory of animism would replace both the philosophical views of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]].<ref>David Ray Griffin ''Parapsychology, philosophy, and spirituality: a postmodern exploration'' 1997, p. 139</ref><ref>William McDougall ''Body and mind: a history and a defense of animism'' Methuen, 1911</ref> As a parapsychologist he also claimed [[telepathy]] had been scientifically proven, he used evidence from psychic research as well as from biology and psychology to defend his theory of animism.<ref>Janet Oppenheim ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914'' 1988, pp. 263–264</ref>

McDougall produced another work attacking materialism titled ''Materialism and Emergent Evolution'' (1929).  Materialism and Emergent Evolution (1929) was the only distinctive psychological approach to the field other than Floyd Allpott's book titled Social Psychology, written in 1924. In the book he had also criticised the theory of [[emergent evolution]] as he claimed it had ignored the evidence of [[Lamarckism]] and had ignored the evidence of mind guiding evolution. McDougall's last work on the subject titled ''The Riddle of Life'' (1938) criticised [[organicism]] as according to McDougall even though the theory of organicism had rejected materialism it had not gone far enough in advocating an active role for a nonphysical principle.<ref>Peter J. Bowler ''Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain'' 2001, pp. 181–184</ref>
