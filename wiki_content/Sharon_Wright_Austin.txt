She then completed a master's degree in political science with a minor in education at the [[University of Memphis]] in 1989, followed in 1993 by a PhD in political science with a focus on American Government from the [[University of Tennessee]].<ref name="profile19">{{cite web |url=https://afam.clas.ufl.edu/dir_message/ |date=2019 | website=University of Florida African-American Studies |title=Dr. Sharon Austin | publisher=University of Florida |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> Although Austin was interested in [[African Americans|African-American]] political participation and minority politics in the United States, she was sometimes discouraged from pursuing these topics early in her career because of the perception that they were not valued by the editors and reviewers at top political science journals.<ref>{{cite news |last=Todd |first=Sarah |url=https://qz.com/work/1679115/the-top-us-political-science-journal-will-now-be-led-by-12-female-professors/ |date=2019-07-31 |title=A top US political science journal ignored race and gender—until 12 women took over | publisher=Quartz |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
Austin is a leading scholar of the political behavior of African-American women, the elections of African-Americans to local offices, and the political behavior of minority groups in American politics, particularly activism among African-Americans in rural areas.<ref name="apsr19a">{{cite web |url=https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-2020-apsr-editor-sharon-wright-austin-of-university-of-florida/ |date=2019-09-04 | website=Political Science Now |title=Meet 2020 APSR Editor, Sharon Wright Austin of University of Florida | publisher=American Political Science Association |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

After receiving her PhD from the University of Tennessee in 1993, Austin became a professor of Pan-African studies at the [[University of Louisville]]. In 1995 she moved to the [[University of Missouri]], where she was a professor of Political Science and Black Studies. In 2001 she moved to the [[University of Michigan]] for one year, before becoming a professor at the [[University of Florida]] in 2001.<ref name="profile19"/> From 2012-2019, Austin was the Director of the African-American Studies Program there.<ref name="profile19"/><ref name="austin19">{{cite news |url=https://www.gainesville.com/opinion/20190204/sharon-d-wright-austin-and-taisha-saintil-should-amendment-4-be-delayed |last1=Austin |first1=Sharon Wright |last2=Saintil |first2=Taisha |title=Should Amendment 4 be delayed? |work=The Gainesville Sun |location=Gainesville |date=2019-02-04 |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> When Austin became Director in 2012, the University of Florida began offering a major in African-American Studies, and under her tenure the program grew to the point that the University of Florida had the most students majoring in African-American Studies of any program in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.alligator.org/news/a-sense-of-home-after-years-african-american-studies-program/article_c107af08-3668-11e9-aae4-377177770715.html |last=Rubin |first=April |title='A sense of home': After 50 years, African American Studies program to be department |work=The Independent Florida Alligator |date=22 February 2019 |access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref>

In 2000, Austin published her first book, ''Race, Power, and Political Emergence in Memphis''. The book studied the features, successes, and limitations of African-American electoral politics in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] from the 1870s to the 1990s, in the context of unremitting [[white supremacy]] and powerful White electoral coalitions.<ref name="honey05">{{cite journal |last1=Honey|first1=Michael |title=Book Review: Race, Power, and Political Emergence in Memphis |journal=Urban Affairs Review |volume=41 |number=2 |date=1 November 2005 |pages=260–266 |doi=10.1177/1078087405275576|s2cid=143953954 }}</ref> The book was a continuation of the research that comprised her PhD dissertation at the University of Tennessee, ''Aftermath of the Voting Rights Act of 1965: Racial Voting Patterns in Memphis Mayoral Elections, 1967-1991''.<ref name="profile19"/>

Austin's second book, ''The Transformation of Plantation Politics in the Mississippi Delta: Black Politics, Concentrated Poverty, and Social Capital in the Mississippi Delta'', was published in 2006. This book "persuasively demonstrates" that there "has been no transformation of politics in the Mississippi Delta" since the 1960s, and that by the 2000s "the area's wealthy white elite continues to dominate politics there".<ref name="berry07">{{cite journal |last1=Berry|first1=Jeffrey M. |title=Book Review: The Transformation of Plantation Politics: Black Politics, Concentrated Poverty, and Social Capital in the Mississippi Delta |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=5 |number=2 |date=June 2007 |pages=361–362 |doi=10.1017/S1537592707070971| jstor = 20446447  }}</ref> This finding is counterintuitive, because on the surface the rate of electoral success of African-Americans there appeared to skyrocket: there were 57 African-American elected officials in Mississippi in 1970, and 897 in 2000.<ref name="berry07"/> The book arrived at this finding through a combination of historical and sociological methods, personal interviews, and statistical analysis on extensive data.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Uneke|first1=Okori A. |title=Book Review: The Transformation of Plantation Politics: Black Politics, Concentrated Poverty, and Social Capital in the Mississippi Delta |journal=International Social Science Review |volume=82 |number=1/2 |date=2007 |pages=106–108}}</ref>

In 2018, Austin published her third book, ''The Caribbeanization of Black Politics: Race, Group Consciousness, and Political Participation in America''. Austin tested the extent to which the political behaviour of Black immigrants would differ from or resemble the distinctive contemporary and historical features of African-American politics, since the phenomenon of Black immigrants arriving to the United States from several different countries simultaneously is relatively recent, and recent immigrants may not have been present for various formative events in African-American political history.<ref name="pinderhughes19">{{cite journal |last=Pinderhughes|first=Dianne M. |title=Book Review: The Caribbeanization of Black Politics: Race, Group Consciousness, and Political Participation in America |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume= 17 |number=1 |date=March 2019 |pages=266–267|doi=10.1017/S1537592718004176 }}</ref> To test this question, Austin chooses to focus on the cities [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], and [[New York City]], and presents results from 2,359 survey or interview respondents who were African-Americans, Cape Verdeans, Haitians, or West Indians there,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gooding |first=Cory Charles |title=Book Review: The Caribbeanization of Black Politics: Race, Group Consciousness, and Political Participation in America |journal=Contemporary Sociology |volume=48 |number=4 |date=2019 |pages=396–397|doi=10.1177/0094306119853809a |s2cid=198614017 }}</ref> making this book "the largest comparative African-American urban survey."<ref name="pinderhughes19"/> The book documents how the construction of a racial consciousness and the incorporation of immigrants into an existing political group identity can function as important mechanisms for engaging minority groups in political processes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Reuel |title=Book Review: The Caribbeanization of Black Politics: Race, Group Consciousness, and Political Participation in America |journal=The Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics |date=2019 |pages=1–3 |doi=10.1017/rep.2019.44|doi-access=free }}</ref>
