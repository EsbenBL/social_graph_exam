'''Michael Herman Schwartz''' (born May 9, 1942) is an American [[Sociology|sociologist]] and prominent critic of the [[Iraq War|Iraq war]]. He is a Distinguished Teaching Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], where he also serves as faculty director of the Undergraduate College of Global Studies and Chair of the Sociology Department. Schwartz has written extensively in the areas of [[economic sociology]] and [[social movements]].

==Career==
Schwartz received his doctorate from the Department of Social Relations, [[Harvard University]], where he was a student of [[Harrison White]] and [[Charles Tilly]]. His writings on Iraq have appeared in ''TomDispatch'', ''[[Asia Times]]'', ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', and ''[[Contexts]]''. In ''Radical Protest and Social Structure'', Schwartz develops the concept of "structural ignorance" to refer to how individuals make choices and decisions in regard to collective action based on their position in the social structure, which constrains their access to relevant information.
