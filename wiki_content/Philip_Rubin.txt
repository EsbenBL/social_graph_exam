==Education==
Philip Rubin received his BA in [[psychology]] and [[linguistics]] in 1971 from [[Brandeis University]] and subsequently attended the [[University of Connecticut]] where he received his PhD in experimental psychology in 1975 under the tutelage of [[Michael Turvey]], [[Ignatius Mattingly]], [[Philip Lieberman]], and [[Alvin Liberman]].

==Career==
Philip Rubin's research spans a number of disciplines, combining computational, engineering, linguistic, physiological, and psychological approaches to study [[embodied cognition]], most particularly the biological bases of speech and language. He is best known for his work on [[articulatory synthesis]]  (computational modeling of the physiology and acoustics of speech production), [[speech perception]], [[sinewave synthesis]], [[signal processing]], perceptual organization, and theoretical approaches and modeling of complex temporal events. At the same time, he has been involved in leadership roles related to science administration, policy, and advocacy.

==Speech Synthesis and Speech Production==
Starting in the early 1970s, Rubin worked on foundational issues in [[speech technology]]. 
These include: participating with Rod McGuire on Haskins aspects of the [[ARPANET]] [[Network Voice Protocol]], a predecessor of [[Voice over IP]]; 
collaborating with Leonard Szubowicz, [[Douglas Whalen]], and others on digitized speech, particularly extensions of the Haskins [[Pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) implementation,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Haskins Laboratories' pulse code modulation (PCM) system |journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=550–559 |last1=Whalen |first1=D.H. |last2=Wiley |first2=E.R. |last3=Rubin |first3=P.E. |last4=Cooper |first4=F.S. |year=1990 |doi=10.3758/BF03204440 |s2cid=14213591 |doi-access=free }}</ref> 
focusing on expanding temporal markers and event labels; and working with Patrick Nye on the Digital [[Pattern_playback|Pattern Playback]], which was eventually replaced by Rubin's [[HADES (software)|HADES]] system. 

During his time at [[Haskins Laboratories]], Rubin was responsible for the design of many computational models and other software systems. Most prominent are ASY,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/facilities/asy-demo.html |title=ASY |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> the Haskins [[articulatory synthesis]] program, 
and SWS,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/featured/sws/sws.html |title=Haskins Laboratories |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> the Haskins [[sinewave synthesis]] program,  both developed in the 1970s. 
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://haskinslabs.org/about-us/history/decades-discovery/decades-discovery-1970s |title=Haskins Laboratories Decades of Discovery |publisher=haskinslabs.org |access-date=2020-10-16}}</ref>
ASY expanded the Mermelstein vocal-tract model developed at [[Bell Laboratories]], adding additional articulatory control, simulation of [[Nasalization|nasal]] sounds, sound generation, and digital sound production. 
Most importantly, Rubin designed and implemented an approach for describing and controlling articulatory events, now known as speech [[gesture|gestures]]. 
In addition to use in standard [[articulatory synthesis]], the ASY program has been used as part of a gestural-computational model <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/research/gestural.html |title=Haskins Laboratories |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> that combines [[articulatory phonology]], task dynamics,<ref>{{cite journal|title=TADA: An enhanced, portable Task Dynamics model in MATLAB |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=2430 |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |bibcode=2004ASAJ..115.2430N|last1=Nam |first1=Hosung |last2=Goldstein |first2=Louis |last3=Saltzman |first3=Elliot |last4=Byrd |first4=Dani |year=2004 |doi=10.1121/1.4781490 }}</ref> and [[articulatory synthesis]]. With [[Louis M. Goldstein|Louis Goldstein]] and Mark Tiede,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/StAFF/tiede.html |title=Mark Tiede |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> Rubin designed a radical revision of the [[articulatory synthesis]] model, known as CASY,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/facilities/casy.html |title=CASY |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> the configurable articulatory synthesizer. This 3-dimensional model of the [[vocal tract]] permits researchers to replicate [[MRI]] images of actual speakers and has been used to study the relation between speech production and perception. 

The sinewave synthesis system designed by Rubin, known as SWS, is based on a technique for [[speech synthesis|synthesizing speech]] by replacing the [[formants]] (main bands of energy) with pure tone whistles, and was designed to explore the spatiotemporal aspects of speech signals. It was the first sinewave synthesis system developed for the automatic, large-scale creation of stimuli for perceptual experiments, and  has been used by [[Robert Remez]], Rubin, David B. Pisoni,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~srlweb/personal/pisoni.html |title=David B. Pisoni - Personal Page |publisher=Indiana.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> and other colleagues and researchers to study the time-varying characteristics of the speech signal. 
Rubin is also the designer of the [[HADES (software)|HADES]] signal processing system and the SPIEL programming language, a predecessor of [[MATLAB]]. 

From 1992 through 2012, Rubin was the core and administrative leader of Haskins Laboratories' main research activity, the [[National Institutes of Health]]/[[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|NICHD]] funded P-01 program project, “The Nature and Acquisition of the Speech Code and Reading.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/P01-HD001994-45 |title=Haskins Laboratories NIH A-40 P01 grant |publisher=grantome.com |access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>

In 1998, he was the co-founder and first President of AVISA, the Auditory-Visual Speech Association, now part of the [[International Speech Communication Association]] (ISCA). 

He is co-creator, with Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ling75.arts.ubc.ca/labsite/ |title=Communication Dynamics Labsite |publisher=Ling75.arts.ubc.ca |access-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509064259/http://ling75.arts.ubc.ca/labsite/ |archive-date=2012-05-09 }}</ref> of the Talking Heads website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/featured/heads/heads.html |title=Haskins Laboratories |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref>

==Theoretical Contributions==
With [[Carol Fowler]], [[Robert Remez]], and [[Michael Turvey]], Rubin introduced the consideration of speech in terms of a [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] / action theory perspective.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fowler | first1 = C. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = P. | last3 = Remez | first3 = R. | last4 = Turvey | first4 = M. | year = 1980 | title = Implications for speech production of a general theory of action | journal = B. Butterworth (Ed.), Language Production, Vol. I: Speech and Talk | volume = I | pages = 373–420 }}</ref> Rubin's theoretical approach to perception and production, particularly in the case of speech, eschews attention to the momentary and punctate aspects of the signal, focusing not on traditional features and cues, but on [[spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] coordination of global aspects of the system, such as [[frequency spectrum|spectral]] coherence over long stretches of time (an approach related to current speech understanding systems, like [[Siri]] or [[Amazon Alexa]]).

With Robert Remez and various other colleagues, he has used the technique of [[sinewave synthesis]] to explore perceptual organization. They have noted that "the criteria for the perceptual organization of speech - visible, audible, and even palpable - are actually specified in a general form, removed from any particular sensory modality ..."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Remez | first1 = R.E. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Berns | first3 = S.M. | last4 = Pardo | first4 = J.S. | last5 = Lang | first5 = J.M. | year = 1994 | title = On the perceptual organization of speech | url =http://www.columbia.edu/~remez/RER_PercOrg2005.pdf | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 129–156 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.101.1.129 | pmid=8121955}}</ref>, 
but, to Rubin, related to the underlying [[frequency spectrum|spectral]] coherence of signals created by biological activity. 

Rubin's approach stresses the constraints and structure stemming from the realities of [[embodied cognition|embodied]] systems, again across both time and physical space. He expanded the modeling of speech production to incorporate an event based approach to control movement over time and articulatory space of the [[vocal tract]], by building on the conceptual approach developed by Paul Mermelstein and colleagues at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mermelstein | first = P. | year = 1973 | title = Articulatory model for the study of speech production | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 1070–1082 | doi = 10.1121/1.1913427 | pmid = 4697807 | bibcode = 1973ASAJ...53.1070M }}</ref> This work was influenced, in part, by the event-based focus of [[James J. Jenkins]]. Rubin's [[articulatory synthesis]] model, ASY, illustrates how simple physical changes, such as [[Soft palate|velar]] opening, directly account for degrees of [[Nasalization|nasality]], avoiding the complexity of attempting to reconcile numerous spectral cues.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = P. | last2 = Baer | first2 = T. | last3 = Mermelstein | first3 = P. | year = 1981 | title = An articulatory synthesizer for perceptual research | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 70 | issue = 2| pages = 321–328 | doi=10.1121/1.386780| bibcode = 1981ASAJ...70..321R }}</ref> This event orientation evolved into a gestural computational system<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saltzman | first1 = E. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = P.

Goldstein|Louis Goldstein]], and the task dynamic model of [[Elliot Saltzman]]. In this system utterances are organized ensembles (or constellations) of units of articulatory action called [[gesture|gestures]]. Each gesture is modeled as a dynamical system that characterizes the formation (and release) of a local constriction within the vocal tract (the gesture’s functional goal or `task’). Goldstein and Rubin have described the "dances of the vocal tract" that underlie the production of continuous speech.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goldstein | first1 = L. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Speech: Dances of the Vocal Tract | journal = Odyssey Magazine | volume = 2007 | issue = 1| pages = 14–158 }}</ref>

[[biomechanics|Biomechanical]] constraints stemming from such embodiment also can be exploited in the recovery of vocal tract shapes from the acoustic signal as seen in the continuity mapping approach of John Hogden, used by Hogden, Rubin, and colleagues to re-conceptualize how realistic physical constraints affect [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hogden | first1 = J. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = P. | last3 = McDermott | first3 = E. | last4 = Katagiri | first4 = S. | last5 = Goldstein | first5 = L.   | year = 2007 | title = Inverting mappings from smooth paths through Rn to paths throughs Rm.

This involves [[reverse engineering]] the path from the acoustic signal to its physiological source (aka: the [[inverse problem]]) using a [[gradient]] [[maximum likelihood]] approach. 

Rubin expanded his approach to understanding the importance of spatiotemporal coordination in his collaborations on [[multimodality|audiovisual speech]] with Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, Hani Yehia, and other colleagues, focusing on [[multimodality]] by exploring the simultaneous combination of speech, facial information, and gesture,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yehia | first1 = H. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = P. | last3 = Vatikiotis-Bateson | first3 = E. | year = 1998 | title = Quantitative association of vocal-tract and facial behavior | journal = Speech Communication | volume = 26 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 23–24 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6393(98)00048-X }}</ref> leading to innovations in [[voice analysis|analysis]], [[speech synthesis|synthesis]], and [[simulation]]. 

==National Science Foundation==
From 2000-2003 Rubin was the Director of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=BCS |title=Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) in Arlington, Virginia, where he helped launch the Cognitive Neuroscience,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5316 |title=Funding - Cognitive Neuroscience - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> Human Origins (HOMINID),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2009/nsf09521/nsf09521.htm |title=Human Origins (HOMINID) |publisher=Nsf.gov |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> Documenting Endangered Languages,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12816 |title=Documenting Endangered Languages |publisher=Nsf.gov |access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref> and other programs,
was part of the NBIC convergence (Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information technology and Cognitive science) activities, and was the first chair of the Human and Social Dynamics priority area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=11678 |title=Funding - Human and Social Dynamics - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> 

Rubin returned to the NSF during the second term of the Obama Administration to serve as a Senior Advisor in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).

==Science Policy and Advocacy==
Rubin has been in several leadership roles related to science policy and advocacy. From 2006-2011 he was the Chair of the [[United States National Academies|National Academies]] Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bbcss/ |title=BBCSS Home |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> a member-at-large of the Board of the [[Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences|Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] (FABBS);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefederationonline.org/ |title=Federation of Associations in Brain and Behavioral Sciences |publisher=Thefederationonline.org |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> and the co-leader of the Yale-Haskins Teagle Foundation Collegium on Student Learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Teagle.html |title=Teagle Collegium |publisher=Haskins.yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> He is also the former Chairman of the Board of the [[Discovery Museum and Planetarium]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], where he also worked with museum staff, trustees, city and state representatives, and others to establish the Discovery Magnet School on museum grounds, the first pre-K to 8 interdistrict public magnet school in the region with a science theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bridgeportedu.net/domain/852 |title=Discovery Magnet School |publisher=www.bridgeportedu.net |access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref> 
He is currently the President-Elect and a member of the Board of Directors of [[Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences|FABBS]]. 

==Ethical Issues Related to Research and Emerging Technologies==
While at the NSF during the Clinton and Bush administrations, Rubin was the NSF ''ex officio'' representative to the National Human Research Protection Advisory Committee (NHRPAC)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/nhrpac/nhrpac.htm |title=Archive of the National Human Research Protections Advisory Committee |publisher=Hhs.gov |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> and the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/ |title=Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) |publisher=Hhs.gov |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> established to provide advice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on issues related to the protection of human research subjects. He was also the co-chair of the inter-agency National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on Science (COS) Human Subjects Research Subcommittee (HSRS) under the auspices of the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and was also formerly the co-chair of the HSRS Behavioral Research Working Group. After leaving the NSF in 2003, he continued to be active on human subjects issues as they relate to [[public policy]], including lecturing, writing, co-authoring an [[American Association of University Professors|AAUP]] report,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/comm/rep/A/humansubs.htm |title=Research on Human Subjects: Academic Freedom and the Institutional Review Board (2006) |publisher=AAUP |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> participating in activities of the Yale Bioethics Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/bioethics/ |title=Yale University's Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics |publisher=Yale.edu |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> and serving on the advisory board of the ''Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csueastbay.edu/JERHRE/ |title=JERHRE |publisher=Csueastbay.edu |access-date=2012-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929193439/http://www.csueastbay.edu/jerhre/ |archive-date=2017-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Rubin has been a long-time member of the [[Yale University]] Technology and Ethics working group
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bioethics.yale.edu/technology-and-ethics |title=Yale University Technology and Ethics |publisher=Yale.edu |access-date=2020-10-16}}</ref> 
and Yale's Science, Technology, and Utopian Visions (STUVWG) and Mind, Brain, Culture and Consciousness (MBCC) working groups, both hosted by the [[Whitney Humanities Center]]. He was a member of the Steering Committee of MBCC.

He has also expressed concerns about the ethical and scientific oversight of the use of certain tools and techniques by the intelligence, law enforcement, military, and national security communities, considering some of them to be boondoggles. An example includes his serving as the Chair of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) Committee on Field Evaluation of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences-Based Methods and Tools for Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bbcss/Committee_on_Field_Evaluation.html |title=Committee on Field Evaluation |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> In a workshop report from that committee he provided an analysis of the use of voice stress technologies in the detection of deception and said "not only is there no evidence that voice stress technologies are effective in detecting stress, but also the hypothesis underlying their use has been shown to be false."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12854/field-evaluation-in-the-intelligence-and-counterintelligence-context-workshop-summary |title=Field Evaluation in the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Context |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |access-date=2015-05-04}}</ref>  He was also a member of the NRC Committee on Developing Metrics for Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49084 |title=Project: Developing Metrics for Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Research: A Study (COMPLETED) |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> On April 6, 2011, he provided testimony at a hearing of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform]] - Behavioral Science and Security: Evaluating TSA's SPOT Program.<ref>{{cite web|last1=House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|title=Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight Hearing - Behavioral Science and Security: Evaluating TSA's SPOT Program|url=https://science.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-investigations-and-oversight-hearing-tsa-spot-program|publisher=US Government|access-date=4 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504211658/https://science.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-investigations-and-oversight-hearing-tsa-spot-program|archive-date=4 May 2015}}</ref>
In his written and oral congressional testimony, he criticized the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]'s [[SPOT (TSA program)|SPOT]] passenger screening program, including raising concerns about the limitations that the [[Department of Homeland Security]] imposed on an outside review and oversight committee for the SPOT program, known as the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), of which he was a member.
