'''Emilio Stanley Mwai Kibaki''', [[State Commendations of Kenya|C.G.H.]] (born 15 November 1931)  is a [[Kenya]]n politician who was the third [[Heads of State of Kenya|President of Kenya]], serving from December 2002 until April 2013.

He had previously served as the fourth [[Vice-President of Kenya]] for ten years from 1978 to 1988 under President [[Daniel arap Moi]]. He also held cabinet ministerial positions in the Kenyatta and Moi governments, including time as minister for Finance (1969–1981) under Kenyatta, and Minister for Home Affairs (1982–1988) and Minister for Health (1988–1991) under Moi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.africadatabase.org/en/person/6256.html/en/person/6256.html |title=List of positions held |access-date=1 June 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. people.africadatabase.org {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

Kibaki served as an [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] Member of Parliament from 1992 to 2002. He unsuccessfully vied for the presidency in 1992 and 1997. He served as the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Official Opposition]] in Parliament from 1998 to 2002. In the [[2002 Kenyan general election|2002 presidential election]], he was elected as President of Kenya.

==Early life and education==
Kibaki was born in 1931 in Thunguri village, Othaya division of Kenya's then [[Nyeri District]], now [[Nyeri County]]. He is the youngest son of [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] peasants Kibaki Gĩthĩnji and Teresia Wanjikũ. Though baptised as Emilio Stanley by Italian missionaries in his youth, he has been known as Mwai Kibaki throughout his public life.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/31/kenya.international2|title=Baptized record|work=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=7 June 2009|first=David|last=Beresford|date=31 December 2007}}</ref>

Family oral history maintains that his early education was made possible by his much older brother-in-law, Paul Muruthi, who insisted that young Mwai should go to school instead of spending his days grazing his father's sheep and cattle and baby-sitting his little nephews and nieces for his older sister. Kibaki turned out to be an exemplary student. He attended Gatuyainĩ School for the first two years, where he completed what was then called Sub "A" and sub "B" (the equivalent of standard one and two or first and second grade). He later joined Karima mission school for the three more classes of primary school. He later moved to Mathari School (now [[Nyeri High School]]) between 1944 and 1946 for Standard four to six, where, in addition to his academic studies, he learnt carpentry and masonry as students would repair furniture and provide material for maintaining the school's buildings. He also grew his own food as all students in the school were expected to do, and earned extra money during the school holidays by working as a conductor on buses operated by the defunct Othaya African Bus Union. After Karima Primary and Nyeri Boarding primary schools, he proceeded to [[Mang'u High School]] where he studied between 1947 and 1950. He passed with a maximum of six points in his "O" level examination<ref name="State House profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm |title=State House profile |publisher=Statehousekenya.go.ke |access-date=7 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611125620/http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm |archive-date=11 June 2009 }}</ref> by passing six subjects with Grade 1 Distinction.

Influenced by the veterans of the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] in his native village, Kibaki considered becoming a soldier in his final year in Mang'u. However, a ruling by the Chief colonial secretary, Walter Coutts, which barred the recruitment of the Kikuyu, Embu and Meru communities into the army, put paid to his military aspirations. Kibaki instead attended [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala]], Uganda, where he studied Economics, History and [[Political Science]], and graduated best in his class in 1955 with a First Class Honours Degree (BA) in Economics.<ref name="State House profile"/> After his graduation, Kibaki took up an appointment as Assistant Sales Manager Shell Company of East Africa, Uganda Division. During the same year, he earned a scholarship entitling him to postgraduate studies in any British University. He consequently enrolled at the prestigious [[London School of Economics]] for a BSc in public finance, graduating with a distinction. He went back to Makerere in 1958 where he taught as an Assistant Lecturer in the economics department until 1961.<ref name="State House profile"/> In 1961, Kibaki married [[Lucy Kibaki|Lucy Muthoni]], the daughter of a church minister, who was then a secondary school head teacher.<ref name="State House profile"/>

==Political career prior to presidency==

===1960–2002===
In early 1960, Mwai Kibaki left academia for active politics by giving up his job at Makerere and returning to Kenya to become an executive officer of [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU), at the request of [[Thomas Joseph Mboya]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goidsu'ortly |first1=David |title=Tom Mboya |date=1982 |publisher=Heinemann |location=London |page=147 |edition=first }}</ref> (who was the secretary general of KANU). Kibaki then helped to draft [[Lancaster House Conferences (Kenya)|Kenya's independence constitution]].

In 1963, Kibaki was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Makadara Constituency|Donholm Constituency]] (subsequently called Bahati and now known as Makadara) in [[Nairobi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mzalendo.com/Members.Details.php?ID=20|title=Eye on Kenyan Parliament|publisher=mzalendo|access-date=7 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508232657/http://www.mzalendo.com/Members.Details.php?ID=20|archive-date=8 May 2008}}</ref> His election was the start of a long political career. In 1963 Kibaki was appointed the Permanent Secretary for the Treasury.<ref name="turks">Daily Nation, 13 April 2003: {{cite web|url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/13042003/Comment/Opinion_Analysis1304200324.html |title=The Influential Young Turks of the 60s |access-date=2017-04-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040109145832/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/13042003/Comment/Opinion_Analysis1304200324.html |archive-date=9 January 2004 }}</ref> Appointed Assistant Minister of Finance and chairman of the Economic Planning Commission in 1963, he was promoted to Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/mwai-kibaki|title=Mwai Kibaki: Biography from|publisher=Answers.com|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> In 1969, he became Minister of Finance and Economic Planning where he served until 1982.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2612893.stm|title=Profile – Kenya's New Leader," BBC News Online|publisher=BBC News|date=29 December 2002|access-date=1 June 2010|first=Russell|last=Smith}}</ref>

In 1974, Kibaki, facing serious competition for his Donholm Constituency seat from a Mrs. Jael Mbogo, whom he had only narrowly and controversially beaten for the seat in the 1969 elections,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/03/kenya.xanrice|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Wave of anarchy blamed on Kenya's 'General Coward'|first=Xan|last=Rice|date=3 February 2008|access-date=19 May 2010}}</ref> moved his political base from [[Nairobi]] to his rural home, Othaya, where he was subsequently elected as Member of Parliament. The same year ''Time'' magazine rated him among the top 100 people in the world who had the potential to lead. He has been re-elected Member of Parliament for Othaya in the subsequent elections of 1979, 1983, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007.<ref name="statehousekenya2">PROFILE OF HIS EXCELLENCY HON.

When [[Daniel arap Moi]] succeeded [[Jomo Kenyatta]] as President of Kenya in 1978, Kibaki was elevated to [[Vice-President of Kenya|Vice Presidency]], and kept the Finance portfolio until Moi changed his ministerial portfolio from Finance to Home Affairs in 1982. When Kibaki was the minister of Finance Kenya enjoyed a period of relative prosperity, fueled by a commodities boom, especially coffee, with remarkable fiscal discipline and sound monetary policies.<ref name="encyclopedia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/mwai-kibaki|title=Columbia Encyclopedia: Mwai Kibaki|publisher=Answers.com|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

Kibaki fell out of favor with President Moi in March 1988, and was dropped as vice president and moved to the Ministry of Health.<ref name="statehousekenya2"/><ref name="encyclopedia1"/> He seemingly took the demotion in his stride without much ado.

Kibaki's political style during these years was described as gentlemanly and non-confrontational. This style exposed him to criticism that he was a spineless, or even cowardly, politician who never took a stand: according to one joke, "He never saw a fence he didn't sit on".<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1740693.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514230752/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1740693.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 May 2013|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Nairobi's corruption busting new leader tries to undo Moi's years of misrule|first=Declan|last=Walsh|date=4 January 2003|access-date=19 May 2010}}</ref> He also, as the political circumstances of the time dictated, projected himself as a loyal stalwart of the ruling single party, KANU. In the months before multi-party politics were introduced in 1992, he infamously declared that agitating for multi-party democracy and trying to dislodge KANU from power was like "trying to cut down a fig tree with a razor blade".<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

It was therefore with great surprise that the country received the news of Kibaki's resignation from government and leaving KANU on Christmas Day in December 1991, only days after the repeal of Section 2A of the Constitution, which restored the [[multi-party system]] of government. Soon after his resignation, Kibaki founded the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party (DP)]]<ref>[http://a24media.com/downloads/pdf/scripts/english/en_mwai_kibaki.pdf Mwai Kibaki. Trailer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072110/http://a24media.com/downloads/pdf/scripts/english/en_mwai_kibaki.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}. a24media.com</ref> and entered the presidential race in the upcoming multi-party elections of 1992. He was criticized as a "johnny come lately" opportunist who, unlike his two main opposition presidential election opponents in that year, [[Kenneth Matiba]] and [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga]], was taking advantage of multiparty despite not having fought for it.

Kibaki came third in the subsequent presidential elections of 1992, when the divided opposition lost to president Moi and KANU despite having received more than two-thirds of the vote. He then came second to Moi in the 1997 elections, when again, Moi beat a divided opposition to retain the presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanelections.tripod.com/ke.html#1997_Presidential_Election|title=AFRICAN ELECTIONS DATABASE-Elections in Kenya|publisher=Africanelections.tripod.com|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> In January 1998, Kibaki became the leader of the [[official opposition]] with the Democratic Party being the official opposition party in Parliament.

===2002 elections===
In preparation for the 2002 elections, Kibaki's Democratic Party affiliated with several other opposition parties to form [[National Alliance Rainbow Coalition]] (NARC). A group of disappointed KANU presidential aspirants then quit KANU in protest after being overlooked by outgoing President Moi when Moi had founding Father [[Jomo Kenyatta]]'s son, [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] (now Kibaki's successor as Kenya's 4th President after the 2013 General Election), nominated to be the KANU presidential candidate, and hurriedly formed the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP). NAK later combined with the LDP to form the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] (NARC). On 14 October 2002, at a large opposition rally in [[Uhuru Park]], [[Nairobi]], Kibaki was nominated the NARC opposition alliance presidential candidate after Raila Odinga made the famous declaration, ''Kibaki Tosha!''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/465904/-/tkag72/-/index.html|title=The deal and deal makers in Kibaki's 2002 victory|publisher=Nation.co.ke|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

On 3 December 2002, Kibaki was injured in a road accident while on his way back to Nairobi from a campaign meeting at Machakos junction {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} From Nairobi. He was subsequently hospitalized in [[Nairobi]], then London, after sustaining fracture injuries in the accident.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2540671.stm|title=Kenyan candidate treated in London|publisher=BBC News|date=5 December 2002|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> He still walks rather awkwardly as a result of those injuries. The rest of his presidential campaign was thus conducted by his NARC colleagues in his absence, led by [[Raila Odinga]] and [[Kijana Wamalwa]] (who went on to become the Vice President) who campaigned tirelessly for Kibaki after stating, "The captain has been injured in the field... but the rest of the team shall continue."<ref name="bbc"/>

On 27 December 2002, Kibaki and NARC won a landslide victory over KANU, with Kibaki getting 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate [[Uhuru Kenyatta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/k/kenya/|title=Ref Elections in Kenya|publisher=Psephos.adam-carr.net|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

==Presidency==

===2002: Swearing-in, end of KANU rule, retirement of Moi===
On 29 December 2002, still nursing injuries from the motor vehicle accident and in a wheel chair, Mwai Kibaki was sworn-in as the third President and [[Commander in Chief]] of the Armed Forces of the Republic of [[Kenya]],infront of thousands of cheering supporters at the historic Uhuru Park within Nairobi City. At his inauguration, he stressed his opposition to government corruption, saying: "Government will no longer be run on the whims of individuals."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marsgroupkenya.org/pdfs/governance/EMILIO_MWAI_KIBAKI.pdf|title=EMILIO MWAI KIBAKI 1.

Thus ended four decades of KANU rule, KANU having hitherto ruled Kenya since independence.

Kenya's 2nd President, [[Daniel Arap Moi]], who had been in power for 24 years since 1978 as an African [[Big man (political science)|Big man]] President, also began his retirement.

===Leadership style===
President Kibaki's style was that of a low key publicity averse but highly intelligent and competent technocrat.<ref name="See for instance">{{cite news|author=Gitau Warigi|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/africa/4875562.stm|title=Kibaki's 'mafia' on the run|publisher=BBC News|date=14 April 2006|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

His style of leadership has given him the image of a seemingly aloof, withdrawn [[technocrat]] or [[intellectual]] and has made him seem out of touch with the street,<ref name="MICHELA WRONG Page 11"/> and his seemingly hands-off leadership-by-delegation style made his governments, especially at cabinet level, seem dysfunctional.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/531732/-/view/printVersion/-/e8mee7z/-/index.html|author=Bernard Namunane and David Mugonyi|date=17 February 2009|title=Chaos in cabinet as Karua and Ruto clash|work=Daily Nation|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

===First term health issues===
It is widely acknowledged that age and the 2002 accident denied the country the witty, sporty, eloquent Kibaki of the previous years. A man who could make lengthy and flowery contributions on the floor of Parliament without notes was confined to reading speeches at every forum.<ref name="nation">{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Its-a-mixed-bag-of-fortunes-as-Kibaki-heads-off-to-retirement/-/1064/1741314/-/au5cgnz/-/index.html|title=It's a mixed bag of fortunes as Kibaki heads off to retirement - Daily Nation|publisher=nation.co.ke|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref>

In late January 2003, it was announced that the President had been admitted to Nairobi Hospital to have a blood clot– the after-effect of his car accident– removed from his leg. He came out of hospital and addressed the public outside the hospital on TV in a visibly incoherent manner, and speculation since then is that he had suffered a stroke, his second, the first being said to have occurred sometimes in the 1970s.<ref name="nation1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/531642/-/item/0/-/a8f3q1z/-/index.html|title=Kibaki's failing health put on hold all pledges he had made|work=Daily Nation|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> His subsequent ill health greatly diminished his performance during his first term and the affairs of government during that time are said to have been largely run by a group of loyal aides, both in and out of government.<ref name="nation1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nairobichronicle.wordpress.com/2009/03/22/assertive-kibaki-suprises-kenyans/|title=Assertive Kibaki suprises &#91;sic&#93; Kenyans|work=The Nairobi Chronicle|date=23 March 2009|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> Kibaki did not look well, for instance, when he appeared live on TV on 25 September 2003 to appoint [[Moody Awori]] Vice President after the death<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3176177.stm|title=Kenya's vice-president dies|publisher=BBC News|date=23 August 2003|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref> in office of Vice President, [[Michael Wamalwa Kijana]].

===2003: Free primary education===
In January 2003, Kibaki introduced a free primary education initiative, which brought over 1 million children who would not have been able to afford school the chance to attend.<ref name=Schools>{{cite web|title=Kenya: Free primary education brings over 1 million into school|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-free-primary-education-brings-over-1-million-school|work=UN Children's Fund|publisher=ReliefWeb|access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref> The initiative received positive attention, including praise from [[Bill Clinton]], who would travel to Kenya to meet Kibaki.<ref name="Clinton Visits Kenya">{{cite news|title=Clinton Visits Kenya|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=711100n|publisher=CBS News|access-date=16 October 2012|date=22 July 2005}}</ref><ref>Education Next, Fall 2005: [https://archive.today/20120527005613/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MJG/is_4_5/ai_n15675349/pg_5 "Private schools for the poor: education where no one expects it"]</ref>

===2005: Constitutional referendum, the NARC fallout and government of national unity===
The [[2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum]] was held on 21 November 2005. The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process was how much power should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration of power in the president added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament. The draft presented by the Attorney General Amos Wako for the referendum retained sweeping powers for the Presidency.<ref>[http://www.4cskenyatuitakayo.org/downloads/ANALYSIS%20OF%20WAKO%20DRAFT.pdf Analysis of the Wako Draft] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

[[File:Mwai Kibaki-2a.jpg|left|thumb|President Kibaki in 2005]]
Though Kibaki the proposal, some members of his own cabinet, mainly from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) wing led by Raila Odinga, allied with the main opposition party KANU to mobilize a powerful NO campaign that resulted in a majority of 58% of voters rejecting the draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kenya:+post-referendum+blues%3B+Although+the+government+lost+the...-a0142575262|title=Analysis by Wanjohi Kabukuru|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com|access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

===2008: National accord and Grand Coalition Government===
The Country was only saved by the mediation of former United Nations Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] with a Panel of "Eminent African Personalities" backed by the [[African Union]], the United States and the United Kingdom.

Following the mediation, a deal, called the national accord, was signed in February 2008 between [[Raila Odinga]] and Kibaki, now referred to as the "two Principals". The accord, later passed by the Kenyan Parliament as the [[National Accord and Reconciliation Act 2008]] provided ''inter alia'' for power-sharing, with Kibaki remaining President and [[Raila Odinga]] taking a newly re-created post of Prime Minister.

On 17 April 2008, [[Raila Odinga]] was sworn in as Prime Minister, along with a power-sharing Cabinet, with 42 [[government minister|ministers]] and 50 assistant ministers, Kenya's largest ever. The cabinet was fifty percent Kibaki appointed ministers and fifty percent Raila appointed ministers, and was in reality a carefully balanced ethnic [[coalition]]. The arrangement, which also included [[Kalonzo Musyoka]] as vice president, was known as the "Grand Coalition Government".<ref>"Odinga Sworn in as Kenyan Premier" {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7351842.stm |title=Odinga sworn in as Kenyan premier |date=17 April 2008 |access-date=2009-06-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917011332/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7351842.stm |archive-date=17 September 2016}}-accessed 8 June 2009.</ref>

President Kibaki, the economist whose term as Finance minister in the 1970s is widely celebrated as outstanding, did much as president to repair the damage done to the country's economy during the 24-year reign of his predecessor, President Moi.

===Political legacy===
President Kibaki was accused of ruling with a small group of his elderly peers, mainly from the educated side of the Kikuyu elite that emerged in the Kenyatta era, usually referred to as the "Kitchen Cabinet"<ref name="See for instance"/> or the "[[Mount Kenya]] Mafia".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7199757.stm|work=BBC News|title=Kenya's 'mafia' feel the heat|date=21 January 2008|access-date=19 May 2010|first=Noel|last=Mwakugu}}</ref> There was therefore the perception that his was a [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] presidency.

The Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence (CIPEV) put it thus:

<blockquote>
The post election violence [in early 2008]therefore is, in part, a consequence of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the polls to be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to heed the views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.<ref>Report of the Justice Philip Waki Chaired Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence [CIPEV] formed to probe into the post 2007 Kenya General Elections Violence: pp. 29–30</ref>
</blockquote>

Critics posit that President Kibaki failed to take advantage of the 2002 popular mandate for a complete break with the past and fix the politics largely mobilized along ethnic interests.

I the sum total, the Kibaki Presidency did not do nearly enough to address the problem of tribalism in Kenya.

Lawyer George Kegoro, in an article published in the ''[[Daily Nation]]'' newspaper on 12 April 2013<ref name="nation2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/Will-the-roads-and-economy-define-Kibakis-legacy/-/440808/1746850/-/lfd8x4/-/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413044636/http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/Will-the-roads-and-economy-define-Kibakis-legacy/-/440808/1746850/-/lfd8x4/-/index.html |archive-date=2013-04-13 |url-status=dead |title=KEGORO: Will the roads and economy define Kibaki's legacy or the lost chances? - Daily Nation|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref> summarized the Kibaki Political Legacy thus:-

<blockquote>
"Kibaki was, by far, a better manager of the economy than Moi before him. He brought order to the management of public affairs, a departure from the rather informal style that characterised the Moi regime. Kibaki's push for free primary education remains an important achievement, as will the revival of key economic institutions such as the Kenya Meat Commission and the Kenya Cooperative Creameries, ruined during the Moi-era. ... However, Kibaki was not all success. Having come to power in 2003 on an anti-corruption platform, he set up two commissions, the Bosire Commission on the Goldenberg scandal and the Ndung'u Commission, which investigated irregular land allocation. However, the reports were not implemented. Further, the Kibaki administration was rocked by a corruption scandal of its own, the [[Anglo Leasing]] scam, involving his close associates. John Githongo, an inspired appointment by Kibaki for an anti-corruption czar, resigned from the government in 2005, citing lack of support from the president. As he leaves office, therefore, the fight against corruption remains unfulfilled. ... But, perhaps, the most controversial aspect of the Kibaki tenure will always be his relationship with senior politicians of his day, particularly Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. The context of this complex relationship includes the post-election violence of 2007, whose roots go back to the dishonoured Memorandum of Understanding between Kibaki and Raila in 2002. The quarrel over the MoU directly led to the break-up of the Narc government, after which Kibaki showed Odinga the door and invited the opposition to rule with him. The effect was that the opposition, rejected at the polls, joined government while Raila's faction, validly elected to power, was consigned to the opposition. ... To the supporters of Raila and Kalonzo, Kibaki will be remembered as a person who did not keep political promises."

[[File:Forty KSh.jpg|thumb|The forty shilling coin with President Mwai Kibaki's Portrait Inscription]]

Michela Wrong describes the situation thus:<ref name="MICHELA WRONG Page 11"/>

<blockquote>
"Whether expressed in the petty bribes the average Kenyan had to pay each week to fat-bellied policemen and local councillors, the jobs for the boys doled out by civil servants and politicians on strictly tribal lines, or the massive scams perpetrated by the country's ruling elite, corruption had become endemic. 'Eating', as Kenyans dubbed the gorging on state resources by the well-connected, had crippled the nation. In the corruption indices drawn up by the anti-graft organisation Transparency International, Kenya routinely trail[s] near the bottom ... viewed as only slightly less sleazy than [[Nigeria]] or [[Pakistan]] ..."
</blockquote>

The ''[[Daily Nation]]'', in an article published on 4 March 2013 titled "End of a decade of highs and lows for Mwai Kibaki" summarised it thus:

<blockquote>
For a leader who was popularly swept into power in 2002 on an anti-corruption platform, Kibaki's tenure saw graft scandals where hundreds of millions of shillings were siphoned from public coffers. Kibaki's National Rainbow Coalition – which took power from the authoritarian rule of Daniel arap Moi—was welcomed for its promises of change and economic growth, but soon showed that it was better suited to treading established paths.

The initial response to corruption was very solid ... but it became clear after a while that these scams reached all the way to the president himself," said Kenya's former anti-corruption chief John Githongo in Michela Wrong's book ''It's Our Turn to Eat''. Most notorious of a raft of graft scandals was the multi-billion shilling Anglo Leasing case, which emerged in 2004 and involved public cash being paid to a complicated web of foreign companies for a range of services—including naval ships and passports—that never materialised."<ref name="nation3">{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/Features/DN2/Highs-and-lows-for-Mwai-Kibaki/-/957860/1709822/-/item/0/-/mrlir/-/index.html|title=End of a decade of highs and lows for Mwai Kibaki - Daily Nation|publisher=nation.co.ke|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref>

</blockquote>

===2010 Constitution===
However, the passage of Kenya's transformative 2010 Constitution, successfully championed by President Kibaki in the [[2010 Kenyan constitutional referendum|Kenyan constitutional referendum]] in 2010 was a major triumph and achievement, which went a long way into addressing Kenya's governance and institutional challenges. With the new Constitution started wide-ranging institutional and legislative reforms, which President Kibaki skilfully and successfully steered in the final years of this presidency."His greatest moment was the promulgation of the new Constitution... It was a very deep and emotional moment for him," Kibaki's son Jimmy was quoted as saying.<ref name="nation4">{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/Features/DN2/Highs-and-lows-for-Mwai-Kibaki/-/957860/1709822/-/item/1/-/mrlis/-/index.html|title=End of a decade of highs and lows for Mwai Kibaki - Daily Nation|publisher=nation.co.ke|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref>

===2013: Power handover===
A proud looking but rather worn President Kibaki handed over the Kenyan presidency to his successor, [[Uhuru Kenyatta]], on 9 April 2013 at a [[Inauguration of Uhuru Kenyatta 2013|public inauguration ceremony]] held at Kenya's largest stadium. "I am happy to pass the torch of leadership to the new generation of leaders", said Kibaki. He also thanked his family and all Kenyans for the support they had given him throughout his tenure in office, and cited the various achievements his government made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.today/20130615173514/http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-116062/kibakis-farewell-speech|title=Kibaki's Farewell Speech &#124; the Star}}</ref>
