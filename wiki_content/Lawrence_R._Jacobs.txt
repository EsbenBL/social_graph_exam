== Early life == 
Jacobs was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and raised in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]]. His father, Henry Jacobs, served in the [[U.S. Army]] and worked in [[New York City]] as a [[stenographer]], opening his own firm. His mother, Judy Jacobs, was a registered nurse.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lohud/obituary.aspx?n=henry-jacobs&pid=183735614&fhid=4011 |title=Henry Jacobs: 1929-2017 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Croton-on-Hudson Journal News |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>

Jacobs graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1981 with a B.A. in History and English and received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] in political science in 1990.<ref name="HumphreySchool20180214" />

== Career as researcher == 
Recurring topics in Jacobs' research include American democracy, health care reform, political communications, and central banking.

===American democracy===
Jacobs' first book, ''The Health of Nations'', and related studies identified the political and institutional conditions that explain why two broadly similar countries – the U.S. and Britain – designed dramatically different health programs, the [[National Health Service]] in 1946 and the [[Medicare Act]] of 1965. He used American and British archival evidence to demonstrate that the preferences of citizens along with the organization of interest groups and the administrative capacity of government institutions were critical factors in accounting for the cross-national differences.<ref name="Jacobs1993" />

Jacobs’s 2000 book ''Politicians Don’t Pander'' (co-authored with Robert Y. Shapiro) looked at how changes in contemporary American politics and, especially, political parties altered the conditions that had facilitated some level of government responsiveness prior to the 1970s; the result is a more insular policy-making process that is less responsive to the preferences of most citizens. The book stated that the motivations of politicians during the 1980s and 1990s shifted from responding to majority opinion to crafting the words, arguments, and symbols to change public opinion to support the policies political elites and their allies and donors favored.<ref name="JacobsShapiro2000" /> ''Politicians Don’t Pander'' received awards from the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[American Sociological Association]], and the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo3637632.html |title=Politicians Don't Pander: Awards |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=University of Chicago Press |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

Jacobs extended his analysis of elite efforts at manipulation with James Druckman in the 2015 book ''Who Governs? Presidents, Public Opinion, and Manipulation''. Citing polls and other evidence from presidential archives, they reported that presidents starting with [[Lyndon Johnson]] used their private research on public opinion to design arguments and personal images to build personal popularity and win elections in order to defy the policy preferences of most Americans.<ref name="DruckmanJacobs2015" /> 

Jacobs’s investigation of the sources of U.S. international economic and foreign policy confirmed the pattern of weak government unresponsiveness to the policy preferences of most Americans. In a 2005 study with [[Benjamin Page]] published in ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', Jacobs' statistical analyses found that the views of business executives (rather than public opinion and policy experts) drove the policy of senior U.S. government officials.<ref name="JacobsPage2005" />

===Health care reform===
Jacobs has published books on the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in 1965, the enactment of the [[Affordable Care Act]] in 2010, and the failure of [[Bill Clinton]]’s effort at health reform in 1993-94. His 2015 book on the Affordable Care Act, ''Health Care Reform and American Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know'', co-written with [[Theda Skocpol]], is in its third printing.<ref name="JacobsSkocpol2015">{{cite book |last1= Jacobs |first1= Lawrence |author-link1= Lawrence R. Jacobs |last2= Skocpol |first2= Theda |author-link2= Theda Skocpol |date=December 28, 2015 |title=Health Care Reform and American Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/health-care-reform-and-american-politics-9780190262044?cc=us&lang=en& |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |isbn= 9780190262044}}</ref>

Jacobs has used his research on health policy to rethink the sources and effects of government policy. Typically, political observers focus on the impacts of public opinion, organized interest groups, and other forces on policy. Jacobs' work with political scientists [[Suzanne Mettler]] and Ling Zhu, in such journal articles as "What Health Reform Teaches Us About American Politics,"<ref name="Jacobs2010" /> considers instead how the passage of the Affordable Care Act is changing public opinion to support the law and spurring more Americans to alter their political behavior – including voting – to back health reform.

===Political communications ===
Jacobs' book ''Talking Together: Public Deliberation in America and the Search for Community'' (co-authored with Fay Lomax Cook, and Michael X. Delli Carpini) and related work comprised the first national empirical study of how Americans attempted to persuade each other about matters of politics or met in formally organized deliberative forums to discuss community concerns. The research in ''Talking Together'' indicated that more than one out of four Americans join organized deliberations – on par with more traditional forms of political engagement such as contacting a government official or attempting to persuade someone to vote for a favored candidate.<ref name="JacobsCookCarpini2009" />

===Central banks===
Central banks and, specifically, the political dynamics of their policies is one of Jacobs' recent areas of research. His book ''Fed Power: How Finance Wins'', written with [[Desmond King (professor)|Desmond King]], is an investigation of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]’s bias toward finance in its response to the [[2008 financial crisis]].<ref name="JacobsKing2016" /> ''Fed Power'' was updated in its second edition to cover the impact on the [[Biden administration]] by [[Black Lives Matter]] protests and the growing influence of progressives in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name="JacobsKing2021"/> More recently, Jacobs and King are investigating the variations across western countries in how central banks regulate risk, manage access to capital, and respond to the inequality generated by their policies.<ref name="JacobsKing2018" />

Jacobs is a longstanding co-editor of the [[University of Chicago Press]] series in American politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/CSAP.html |title=Chicago Studies in American Politics |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=University of Chicago Press |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

Professor Jacobs’ research has received a number of awards as well as grants from, among others, the National Science Foundation, Ford Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the McKnight Foundation.<ref name="HumphreySchool20180214">{{cite web |url=https://www.hhh.umn.edu/news/larry-jacobs-presented-mcknight-presidential-chair-public-affairs |title=Larry Jacobs Presented McKnight Presidential Chair in Public Affairs |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2018-02-14 |website=Humphrey School News |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

==Career as public intellectual ==
Jacobs is a leading public intellectual, offering non-partisan commentary and programming on American politics and government policy. In 2005, Jacobs founded the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance (CSPG) at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. Under his direction, it has become a regional hub for research and initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civic engagement, with a mission to foster conversations and collaborations across the partisan divides in Minnesota and America. CSPG developed the first online non-partisan professional training program for election administrators.<ref name="StarTribune20160907">{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Kelly |url=http://www.startribune.com/u-launches-first-of-its-kind-program-for-elections-officials/392673401/ |title=U launches first-of-its-kind program for elections officials |work=[[Star Tribune]] |location=Minneapolis-St. Paul |date=2016-09-07 |accessdate=2020-01-24 }}</ref> It also runs an iconic leadership development program called the Policy Fellows, which has supported Minnesota’s civic culture for three decades.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hhh.umn.edu/professional-development/policy-fellows-program|title=Center for the Study of Politics and Governance: Policy Fellows Program |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2015-07-24|website=Humphrey School of Public Affairs |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Its alumni include U.S. Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]], former U.S. Senator [[Norm Coleman]] and many other prominent leaders in government, business, and non-profits. The Center also works closely with [[Minnesota Legislature|legislators in Minnesota]] by convening an annual one-day retreat of the entire legislature known as One Minnesota.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/minnesota/2019/ |title=One Minnesota Legislative Conference |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Minnesota State Legislature |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> It also collaborates on a similar initiative across the Midwest with the Council of State Governments.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.csg.org/LeadershipCenter/billd.aspx |title=Bowhay Institute for Legislative Leadership Development |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Council of State Governments |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> In addition, CSPG hosts dozens of public events on state and national politics and public policy each year.

Professor Jacobs runs the "Dialogue Across Difference" series, which has drawn over 100,000 viewers to its live conversations, YouTube recordings, and podcasts.<ref name=CSPGPublicEvents>{{cite web |url=https://www.hhh.umn.edu/research-centers/center-study-politics-and-governance/public-events-cspg |title=Public Events |last= |first= |date= |website= Center for the Study of Politics and Governance |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |access-date= 2021-08-19}}</ref><ref name=CSPGPastPublicEvents>{{cite web |url= https://www.hhh.umn.edu/news-events-media/past-events?body_value=&field_event_organization_target_id=741 |title=All Past Events |last= |first= |date= |website= Center for the Study of Politics and Governance |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |access-date= 2021-08-19}}</ref> 

Jacobs has been widely recognized for his non-partisan work with CSPG, the media, and civic organizations. The Minneapolis University Rotary Club awarded Jacobs its “Citizen of the Year Award” in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.csg.org/LeadershipCenter/billd.aspx |title=2016-2017 Rotarian of the Year  |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Minneapolis University Rotary Club |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> The University of Minnesota recognized his community engagement with its “Outstanding Community Service Award” in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://engagement.umn.edu/ocsa |title=Outstanding Community Service Awards  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2012-07-26|website=University of Minnesota |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

In 2003, he chaired the [[American Political Science Association]]'s Task Force on Inequality and
American Democracy, the organization's first formal task force in half a century on the consequences of rising economic inequality for American democracy. The Task Force’s report in 2005 spurred increased media attention, research, and teaching on the political effects of rising economic and racial disparities.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.apsanet.org/portals/54/Files/Task%20Force%20Reports/taskforcereport.pdf |title=American Democracy in An Age of Rising Inequality |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=American Political Science Association |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>

For nearly 15 years, Jacobs taught with former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] at the Humphrey School.<ref name="StarTribune20180115" /> Their course concentrated on the [[U.S. Constitution]] and national security and tracked the growing pattern across Democratic and Republican administrations of unilateral exercises of executive power since the [[Second World War]].
