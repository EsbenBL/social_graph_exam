Born in [[Havana]], Cuba, Reinhart arrived in the United States on January 6, 1966, at the age of 10, with her mother and father and three suitcases. They settled in [[Pasadena, California]], during the early years before moving to South Florida, where she grew up. When the family moved to Miami, Reinhart started college at two-year [[Miami Dade College]], before transferring to [[Florida International University]], where she received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Economics (''[[summa cum laude]]'') in 1975.<ref name="Warsh">{{cite web |url=http://www.economicprincipals.com/issues/2009.11.01/779.html |work=Economic Principals |first=David |last=Warsh |date=November 1, 2009 |title=What The Woman Lived |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> After her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], Reinhart worked for her master's degree in Philosophy, eventually receiving this degree in 1981 from [[Columbia University]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Reinhart|first1=Carmen|title=C.V.|url=http://www.carmenreinhart.com/c.v./|website=Carmen M.

==Work on the 2008 near-meltdown==

Fellow economist [[Alan Blinder]] credits both Reinhart and [[Kenneth Rogoff]] with describing highly relevant aspects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial institution near-meltdown]] and resulting [[Great Recession|serious recession]].<ref name="What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?, Alan Blinder, Nov. 2014"/>

In a normal recession such as [[Early 1990s recession|1991]] or [[Recession 2000s|2000]], the Keynesian tools of tax cuts and infrastructure spending ([[fiscal stimulus]]), and lowered interest rates (monetary stimulus), will usually right the economic ship in a matter of months and lead to recovery and economic expansion.  Even the [[Early 1980s recession|serious recession of 1982]], which Blinder states "was called the Great Recession in its day", fits comfortably within this category of a typical recession, which will respond to the standard tools.<ref name="What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?, Alan Blinder, Nov. 2014"/>

By contrast, the 2008 near-meltdown destroyed parts of the financial system and left other parts reeling and in serious need of de-leveraging.  Large amounts of governmental debt, household debt, corporate debt, and financial institution debt were left in its wake.  And because of this debt, the normal tools of tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending were somewhat less available and/or politically difficult to achieve.  Indeed, economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued that even the combination of the [[Public Law 110-343|Oct. 2008 bailout]] plus the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|Feb. 2009 bailout]] did not go big enough, although Blinder states that they were large compared to previous bailouts. Moreover, since interest rates were already near zero, the standard monetary tool of lowering rates was not going to provide much help.<ref name="What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?, Alan Blinder, Nov. 2014"/>

Recovery from what Blinder terms a Reinhart-Rogoff recession may require debt forgiveness, either directly or implicitly, by encouraging somewhat higher than normal rates of inflation.<ref name="What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?, Alan Blinder, Nov. 2014">[https://www.princeton.edu/ceps/workingpapers/243blinder.pdf "What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?,"] Alan S. Blinder, Princeton University Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies Working Paper No. 243, November 2014.</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==
In 2013, Reinhart and Rogoff were in the spotlight after researchers discovered that their 2010 paper "[[Growth in a Time of Debt]]" in ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' Papers and Proceedings had methodological and computational errors. The work argued that debt above 90% of GDP was particularly harmful to economic growth, while corrections have shown this is not the case, and that the negative correlation between debt and growth does not increase above 90% as their work had contended. A separate and previous criticism is that the negative correlation between debt and growth need not be causal.<ref name='Alexander01' /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/how-much-unemployment-was-caused-by-reinhart-and-rogoffs-arithmetic-mistake |title=How Much Unemployment Was Caused by Reinhart and Rogoff's Arithmetic Mistake? |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] |date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Rogoff and Reinhart claimed that their fundamental conclusions were accurate, despite the errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ed9616b6-e433-3e1d-a249-bfc62992babf|title=[Paywalled article, title unknown]|website=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/apr/17/rogoff-reinhart-defend-debt-study|title=Rogoff and Reinhart defend their numbers|first=Phillip|last=Inman|date=April 17, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref>

A review by [[Thomas Herndon|Herndon]], Ash, and [[Robert Pollin|Pollin]] of her widely cited paper with Rogoff, "Growth in a Time of Debt", argued that "coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics lead to serious errors that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies in the post-war period".<ref>{{cite document |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf |title=Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth?
