'''Mehmet Naim Talu''' (22 July 1919 &ndash; 15 May 1998)<ref>{{cite web |title=Naim Talu Biography |url= https://www.biyografya.com/biyografi/8475 |language=tr|website=biyografya.com |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[economist]], [[banker]], [[politician]] and former [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister of Turkey]].

==Biography==
Naim Talu was born in Istanbul in 1919. He was educated at [[Kabataş Erkek Lisesi]]. After graduating with a degree in economics from [[Istanbul University]] in 1943, he worked for a while in Sümerbank, a state owned textile company. He transferred to the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Central Bank of Turkey]] in 1946. He became the general director of the bank in 1967 after serving one year as deputy. Following the reorganization of the Central Bank in 1970, he was appointed [[List of Governors of the Central Bank of Turkey|Governor]] of this institution. He died in Istanbul in 1998.

==Political career==
Naim Talu started his political career in 1971 by appointment to the ministry of trade in the second [[Nihat Erim|Erim]] cabinet. He kept his post also in the cabinet of [[Ferit Melen|Melen]] until [[List of Presidents of Turkey|President]] [[Cevdet Sunay]] admitted him to the Senate in 1972. Commissioned by President [[Fahri Korutürk]] following the resignation of Prime Minister Ferit Melen, he formed the 36th government on 15 April 1973 in consensus of the [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] with the [[Republican Reliance Party]]. His caretaker government lasted beyond the general elections in 1973, which did not set a clear majority for any party. With the forming of a coalition cabinet of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People’s Party]] along with the [[National Salvation Party]] under [[Bülent Ecevit]] on 26 January 1974, Talu’s prime ministry ended. His membership in the Senate continued until 1976.

Naim Talu was a member of the board of [[Akbank]], one of Turkey’s largest banks, between 1974 and 1976, prior to his appointment as the chairman, which lasted until shortly before his death in 1998. He served the same period as a member of the board of trustees of the Sabancı Foundation VakSA.

He was survived by his wife Gevher Talu and his two daughters Tülin Talu and Füsun San.
