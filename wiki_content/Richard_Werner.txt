'''Richard Andreas Werner''' (born 5 January 1967) is a [[German people|German]] banking and development [[economist]] who is a university [[professor]] at [[De Montfort University]]. 

He has proposed the "Quantity Theory of Credit", or "Quantity Theory of Disaggregated Credit", which disaggregates credit creation used for the real economy (GDP transactions) on the one hand, and financial transactions on the other hand.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/36569/ |title = Towards a new monetary paradigm: A quantity theorem of disaggregated credit, with evidence from Japan|journal = Kredit und Kapital|volume = 30|pages = 276–309|date = July 1997|last1 = Werner|first1 = R. A.}}</ref> In 1995, he proposed a new monetary policy to swiftly deal with banking crises, which he called '[[Quantitative Easing]]', published in the Nikkei. <ref>Richard A. Werner (1995), Keiki kaifuku, ryōteki kinyū kanwa kara, (How to Create a Recovery through ‘Quantitative Monetary Easing’), The Nihon Keizai Shinbun (Nikkei), ‘Keizai Kyōshitsu’ (‘Economics Classroom’), 2 September 1995 (morning edition), p. 26; English translation by T. John Cooke (November 2011) [http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/340476/]</ref> He also first used the expression "QE2" in public, referring to the need to implement 'true quantitative easing' as an expansion in credit creation.<ref>Richard Werner, "''Keizai Kyoshitsu: Keiki kaifuku, ryoteiki kinyu kanwa kara,''" ''Nikkei, 2 September 1995. ‘QE2’ was first used publicly by Richard Werner live on CNBC on 22 September 2009. He argued that 'true quantitative easing' was needed, namely an expansion in productive credit creation. This required a second attempt by central banks, "a kind of QE2". Squawkbox, CNBC, live studio panel, 18:00-21:00 hrs London time, 22 September 2009. Meanwhile, the expression is today mainly used to refer to a second round of what Prof. Werner would consider the 'wrong type' of QE. </ref> His 2001 book '[[Princes of the Yen]]' was a number one general bestseller in Japan. In 2014 he published the first empirical evidence that each bank creates credit when it issues a new loan. <ref>Werner, Richard A. (2014).

==Early life==
In 1989, Werner earned a BSc in economics at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE).  During his postgraduate studies at [[Oxford University]] he spent over a year in Japan, studying at the [[University of Tokyo]] and working at the Nomura Research Institute.<ref name="southampton">University of Southampton, [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/management/about/staff/werner.page? Richard Werner]; retrieved 2011-08-20</ref> His [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] in economics was conferred by Oxford. In 1991, he became European Commission-sponsored Marie Curie Fellow at the Institute for Economics and Statistics at [[Oxford]].<ref name="southampton"/> His 1991 discussion paper at the institute warned about the imminent 'collapse' of the Japanese banking system and the threat of the "greatest recession since the Great Depression". In Tokyo, he also became the first Shimomura Fellow at the Research Institute for Capital Formation at the [[Development Bank of Japan]].  He was a Visiting Researcher at the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies at the [[Bank of Japan]]; and he was a Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Monetary and Fiscal Studies at the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]].<ref name="southampton"/>

==Career==
Werner was chief economist of [[Jardine Fleming]] from 1994 to 1998 and published several articles on the Japanese credit cycle and monetary policy, many of which are in Japanese. In 1997, he joined the faculty of [[Sophia University]] in [[Tokyo]].<ref name="southampton"/> Werner was senior managing director and senior portfolio manager at [[Bear Stearns]] Asset Management. He worked at the [[University of Southampton]] for 14 years, mainly as Chair and Professor in International Banking.<ref name="southampton"/> He is the founding director of the university's Centre for Banking, Finance and Sustainable Development and organiser of the European Conference on Banking and the Economy (ECOBATE), first held on 29 September 2011 in [[Winchester Guildhall]], with Lord Adair Turner, FSA Chairman, as keynote speaker. From 2011 to 2019, he was a member of the ECB Shadow Council.{{Citation needed|reason=a reliable credible and non partial citation is needed for this|date=October 2018}}

Werner has developed a theory of [[Money creation#Alternative theories|money creation]] called the [[Quantity Theory of Credit]], which is in line with [[Schumpeter|Schumpeter's]] [[credit theory of money]].<ref>Richard A. Werner (1992), ‘Towards a quantity theory of disaggregated credit and international capital flows’, Paper presented at the Royal Economic Society Annual Conference, York, April 1993 and at the 5th Annual PACAP Conference on Pacific-Asian Capital Markets in Kuala Lumpur, June 1993</ref> He has argued, since 1992, that the banking sector needs to be reflected appropriately in macroeconomic models since it is the main creator and allocator of the money supply, through the process of credit creation by individual banks.<ref>Richard A. Werner (1992), ‘Towards a quantity theory of disaggregated credit and international capital flows’, later published as Werner, Richard A. (1997). ‘Towards a New Monetary Paradigm: A Quantity Theorem of Disaggregated Credit, with Evidence from Japan’, Kredit und Kapital, vol. 30, no. 2, July 1997, pp. 276-309. See also Werner, Richard A. (2012). Towards a New Research Programme on ‘Banking and the Economy’ – Implications of the Quantity Theory of Credit for the Prevention and Resolution of Banking and Debt Crises, International Review of Financial Analysis, 25, 94-105, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521912000555]</ref>

Werner's book ''[[Princes of the Yen]]'', about the modern economic development of Japan, including the bubble of the 1990s and subsequent bust, was a number one general bestseller in Japan in 2001.<ref>Yamagawa, Hiroshi.  [http://www.profitresearch.com/e/press/media_quotes/media_english/q_jt_July01.htm  "BOJ planned bubble, decade of misery,"] ''The Japan Times,'' 27 July 2001; retrieved 2011-08-20</ref>  The book covers the monetary policy of the [[Bank of Japan]] specifically and central bank informal guidance of bank credit in general.<ref>[http://www.profitresearch.com/e/press/media_quotes/media_english/asahi_shinbun_may01.htm "Book exposes BOJ 'rulers',"] ''Asahi Shimbun.'' May 10, 2001; retrieved 2011-08-20</ref>

Werner proposed a policy he called "quantitative easing" in Japan in 1994 and 1995. At the time working as chief economist of Jardine Fleming Securities (Asia) Ltd. in Tokyo, he used this expression during presentations to institutional investors in Tokyo. It is also, among others, in the title of an article he published on September 2, 1995, in the [[Nihon Keizai Shinbun]] (Nikkei).<ref name="Richard Werner 1995">Richard Werner, Keizai Kyoshitsu: Keiki kaifuku, ryoteiki kinyu kanwa kara, Nikkei, 2 September 1995.</ref> According to Werner, he used this phrase in order to propose a new form of monetary stimulation policy by the central bank that relied neither on interest rate reductions (which Werner claimed in his Nikkei article would be ineffective) nor on the conventional [[Monetarism|monetarist]] policy prescription of expanding the [[money supply]] (e.g. through "printing money", expanding high-powered money, expanding bank reserves or boosting deposit aggregates such as [[M2 (economics)|M2]] –all of which Werner also claimed would be ineffective).<ref>Nikkei 2 Sept. 1995, op. cit; see also Lyonnet and Werner (2012), Lessons from QE and other ‘unconventional’ monetary policies – Evidence from the Bank of England, Centre for Banking, Finance and Sustainable Development Discussion Paper, University of Southampton</ref> Instead, Werner argued, it was necessary and sufficient for an economic recovery to boost "credit creation", through a number of measures.<ref name="Richard Werner 1995"/> He also suggested direct purchases of non-performing assets from the banks by the central bank; direct lending to companies and the government by the central bank; purchases of commercial paper, other debt, and equity instruments from companies by the central bank; and stopping the issuance of [[government bonds]] to fund the public sector borrowing requirement, instead having the government borrow directly from banks through a standard loan contract.<ref>Richard Werner, Keizai Kyoshitsu: Keiki kaifuku, ryoteiki kinyu kanwa kara, Nikkei, 2 September 1995. But also other publications, e.g. Japanese Economist, 14 July 1998 [http://profitresearch.com/e/articles/economist_engl/a_econ_july98.htm]; Financial Times, 9 February 2000 [http://profitresearch.com/e/articles/letters_comments/q_ft_LettersToEd_Feb9_00.htm]</ref><ref>Richard A. Werner, New Paradigm in Macroeconomics: Solving the Riddle of Japanese Macroeconomic Performance, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan</ref>

Werner is founding director and chairman of Local First Community Interest Company, which promotes the establishment of not-for-profit local community banks, modelled on the successful German local co-operative, Raiffeisen and Sparkasse savings banks that have enabled German small firms to become top exporters and job creators in Germany.<ref>[http://www.local-first.org.uk]</ref>

In 2019, Werner took out a discrimination case against his employer, Southampton University, claiming he was discriminated against and ‘victimised’ in a ‘harassment and bullying’ campaign for being German and Christian, during his 14 years career at the university.  The £2.5m payout was one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal and was so high because the university failed to defend itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/17699079.professor-wins-2-5m-payout-southampton-university-missed-tribunal/|title = £2.5m awarded to professor because Southampton University failed to turn up to tribunal}}</ref> In July 2019, after a successful appeal by the University, the judgement was set aside and the case was set to proceed in the usual fashion. Werner was then, in August 2020, granted permission to appeal the decision in the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions/dr-r-werner-v-university-of-southampton-1404855-2018 Dr R Werner v University of Southampton]</ref> In the meantime Werner brought a discrimination claim against the [[University of Cambridge]] after they withdrew a conditional offer of employment in 2018.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions/mr-ra-werner-v-the-chancellor-masters-and-scholars-of-university-of-cambridge-3303850-slash-2019 Mr RA Werner v The Chancellor Masters & Scholars of University of Cambridge]</ref>
