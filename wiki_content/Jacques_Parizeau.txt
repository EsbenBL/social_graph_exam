'''Jacques Parizeau''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|GOQ}} ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑk parizo}}; August 9, 1930{{spnd}}June 1, 2015) was a [[Québécois people|Québécois]] [[economist]] and politician who was a noted  [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereigntist]] and the 26th [[premier of Quebec]] from September 26, 1994, to January 29, 1996.

==Early life and career==
Parizeau was born in [[Montreal]], Quebec, the son of Germaine (née Biron) and Gérard Parizeau, from a family of wealth and privilege. Gérard Parizeau built one of Quebec’s great fortunes and one of the province’s largest financial firms from a brokerage he established in the 1930s. Jacques' great-grandfather was a founder of the Montreal ''Chambre de Commerce'' and his grandfather was a doctor of renown and a ''Chevalier'' of the ''Legion d’honneur.''<ref name=MtlGaz_Obit>{{cite news |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jacques-parizeau-obit |title=Former PQ leader Jacques Parizeau dies at 84 |date=June 2, 2015 |work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|access-date=June 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602144843/http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jacques-parizeau-obit |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live |first=Hubert |last=Bauch}}</ref>

As a teenager, Parizeau had radical views and distributed leaflets for Communist [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]]'s election campaigns. While sympathetic to the [[Labor-Progressive Party]] he never joined.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Tx01YC8VMcC&pg=PA157|title=René Lévesque and the Parti Québécois in Power|first=Graham |last=Fraser|date=November 21, 2001 |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|isbn=9780773523104}}</ref>

His parents supported bilingualism and sent him to English summer camp.  He attended [[Collège Stanislas (Quebec)|Collège Stanislas]], a [[Roman Catholic]] [[private school]]. He went on to graduate with a [[PhD]] from the [[London School of Economics]] in [[London]], [[England]], as well as degrees at [[HEC Montréal]], [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]] and [[Faculté de droit de Paris]]. Because of a prior commitment to return to instruct at HEC, he left England, where career opportunities were offered in British academia.  He served an internship with the Bank of Canada in Ottawa, and directed his brightest students to [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in Kingston, Ontario for postgraduate studies.<ref name=MtlGaz_Obit />

Parizeau's predilection for three-piece, Savile Row suits, and proper manner of speaking French and English, earned him the nickname "Monsieur".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jacques-parizeau-former-quebec-premier-dead-at-84-1.2977182|title=Jacques Parizeau, former Quebec premier, dead at 84|date=June 2, 2015 |publisher=[[CBC News]]}}</ref>

A believer in [[economic interventionism]], he was one of the most important advisors to the provincial government during the 1960s, playing an important behind-the-scenes role in the [[Quiet Revolution]]. He was especially instrumental in the [[nationalization]] of [[Hydro-Québec]] (a hydro-electric utility) in 1962-1963, the nationalization of the [[Asbestos Corporation Limited]] mines in 1982, and worked with [[Eric Kierans]] to create the [[Quebec Pension Plan]] in 1963-1966.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1084227010836&call_pageid=968332188492 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211043/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&c=Article&cid=1084227010836&call_pageid=968332188492 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-29 |location=Toronto |work=The Star }}</ref>

He joked that the Quiet Revolution was essentially carried out by three or four cabinet ministers, two dozen civil servants and 50 chansonniers.<ref name=MtlGaz_Obit /> (At the end of his career, he said that he would like to be remembered most for his contributions to the reformation of Quebec.)

Parizeau gradually became a committed [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]], and officially joined the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' (PQ) on September 19, 1969. In 1970, he became the president of the PQ’s executive council until 1973. He ran for office in the Montreal districts of [[Ahuntsic (provincial electoral district)|Ahuntsic]] in 1970 and [[Crémazie (electoral district)|Crémazie]] in 1973, but lost in both.<ref name="montrealgazette.com">{{Cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/timeline-of-jacques-parizeaus-life |first=Catherine |last=Solyom |date=June 2, 2015 |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|website=[[Montreal Gazette]]|title=Timeline of Jacques Parizeau's life}}</ref>

After the PQ was elected to office in the [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 provincial election]], which saw Parizeau elected in the district of [[L'Assomption (provincial electoral district)|L'Assomption]], the new premier, [[René Lévesque]], appointed him as Minister of Finance.<ref name=MtlGaz_Obit />  Parizeau played an important role in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]] campaign in favour of the government's proposals for [[sovereignty-association]].

[[File:Jacques Parizeau ministre 2.jpg|thumb |Parizeau at a 1981 conference at [[Laval University]]]]

As Minister of Finance in Quebec, he was responsible for a number of innovative economic proposals, including the [[Quebec Stock Savings Plan]] ("QSSP") and the Fonds de solidarité (Solidarity Fund) FTQ in 1983.<ref name="montrealgazette.com" /> As of May 2020, the latter's net assets were $13.8 billion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fonds FTQ {{!}} Company vision and mission statement {{!}}Who we are |url=https://www.fondsftq.com/en/a-propos/qui-sommes-nous.aspx |website=Fonds de solidarité FTQ |publisher=Fonds de solidarité FTQ |access-date=3 November 2020}}</ref>

Married to [[Poland|Polish]] immigrant [[Alice Parizeau|Alice Poznanska]] (1930–1990). Jacques Parizeau was criticized for supporting the [[Charter of the French Language]]. This law limits access to English-language public schools to children whose parents didn't receive their education in English in Canada, and was generally opposed by the English-speaking minority.

In 1984, he had a falling out with Lévesque. Lévesque had moved away from pursuing [[sovereignty association|sovereignty]] to accept a negotiation with the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]], called ''[[Beau Risque]]''. Parizeau opposed this shift, resigned from Cabinet along with many other members, and temporarily retired from politics. Lévesque was taken by surprise with all these retirements and retired soon after. He was replaced by [[Pierre-Marc Johnson]].

In 1987, Johnson also left the PQ leadership after losing the [[1985 Quebec general election|1985 election]].  Parizeau, still a widely liked figure, was elected to replace him as party leader on March 19, 1988.

It was revealed in 2013 that federal [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] offered in 1987 to appoint Parizeau as an independent [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] in his attempt to secure passage of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] through the upper house as well as part of his strategy to achieve reconciliation with Quebec sovereigntists which led to the [[Meech Lake Accord]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Brian Mulroney offered Senate seat to Jacques Parizeau |url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/brian-mulroney-offered-senate-seat-jacques-parizeau-151550996.html |access-date=September 13, 2013 |author=Andy Radia |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |date=September 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602134544/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/brian-mulroney-offered-senate-seat-jacques-parizeau-151550996.html |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Mulroney once offered a Senate seat to Jacques Parizeau |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2013/09/12/mulroney-offered-senate-seat-jacques-parizeau.html |access-date=September 13, 2013 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=September 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602134601/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mulroney-once-offered-a-senate-seat-to-jacques-parizeau-1.1699201 |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Parizeau rejected the offer and went on to become PQ leader and premier.

==Elections, 1995 referendum and aftermath==
In the [[1989 Quebec general election|1989 election]], Parizeau's first as PQ leader, his party did not fare well. But five years later, in the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 election]], it won a majority government. Parizeau promised to hold a referendum on Quebec sovereignty within a year of his election, and despite many objections, he followed through on this promise. In the beginning, support for sovereignty was only about 40% in the public opinion polls. As the campaign wore on, however, support for the "Yes" side grew larger. This growth halted, however, and Parizeau came under pressure to hand more of the campaign over to the more moderate and conservative [[Lucien Bouchard]], the popular leader of the federal ''[[Bloc Québécois]]'' party. Parizeau agreed and as the campaign progressed he lost his leadership role to Bouchard.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=The 1995 Quebec referendum: Turning the 'Yes' tide |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-1995-quebec-referendum-turning-the-yes-tide |date=October 30, 1995 |medium=Television |language=en |publisher=[[CBC Digital Archives]] |access-date=May 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602135642/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-1995-quebec-referendum-turning-the-yes-tide |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum]] he caused an uproar when it was reported by columnist [[Chantal Hébert]] in the ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' newspaper that despite the guarantee of an offer of partnership with the rest of Canada before declaring sovereignty following a "Yes" vote, Parizeau had told a group of foreign diplomats that what mattered most was to get a majority vote from Quebec citizens for the proposal to [[secede]] from Canada because with that, Quebecers would be in a "lobster pot," evidently indicating that like lobsters in a lobster trap, Quebecers would not be able to escape the consequences of a vote for independence once it was cast.<ref name=WilsonSmithFulton>{{cite news|last1=Wilson-Smith|first1=Anthony|last2=Fulton|first2=E. Kaye|title=Parizeau's Lobster Flap|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/parizeaus-lobster-flap/|access-date=13 July 2015|work=[[Maclean's]]|date=July 24, 1995}}</ref> The "Yes" side would lose the referendum by 55,000 votes. In his concession speech, Parizeau said sovereignty had been defeated by "[[money and ethnic votes|l'argent et des votes ethniques]]" ("money and ethnic votes"), and referred to the [[Francophones]] who voted Yes in the referendum as "''nous''" (us) when he said that this majority group was, for the first time, no longer afraid of political independence.

Many suspected he may have been drinking.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/10/04/andrew-coyne-dont-be-fooled-the-parti-quebecois-has-never-been-inclusive/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140830121110/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/10/04/andrew-coyne-dont-be-fooled-the-parti-quebecois-has-never-been-inclusive/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 30, 2014 |title=Andrew Coyne: Don't be fooled, the Parti Québécois has never been inclusive |author=Andrew Coyne |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=October 4, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/separation-anxiety-the-1995-quebec-referendum/money-and-the-ethnic-vote.html |title=Parizeau blames "money and the ethnic vote" for referendum loss |date=October 30, 1995 |medium=Television |language=en |publisher=CBC Digital Archives |access-date=June 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602141619/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/quebec-referendum-reaction |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> He resigned as PQ leader and Quebec premier the next day. The English-language media, as well as non-sovereigntist newspapers such as ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' and ''[[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]]'', associated Parizeau's resignation only with these remarks,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} against which the sovereigntist-friendly media (notably the newspaper ''[[Le Devoir]]'') argued that he had made the decision beforehand, drawing attention to a television interview conducted on the eve of the vote with the [[TVA (TV network)|Groupe TVA]] channel in which Parizeau spoke of his intentions to step down in the event of defeat.  (This interview had previously been held under "embargo", which is to say that the station agreed not to broadcast it until the referendum was over.)

Parizeau was replaced by [[Lucien Bouchard]] as PQ leader and Quebec premier on January 29, 1996.

Parizeau retired to private life, but continued to make comments critical of Bouchard's new government and its failure to press the cause of Quebec independence. He owned an estate at his vineyard in [[France]], a farm in the [[Eastern Townships]] of Quebec and a home in [[Montreal]]. His biographer is [[Pierre Duchesne (politician)|Pierre Duchesne]].

In 2005 he spoke of the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum]] in the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] documentary [[Breaking Point (2005 film)|''Breaking Point'']].

His wife and former secretary during his premiership, [[Lisette Lapointe]] won a seat in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] as a candidate for the PQ in the provincial riding of [[Crémazie (Quebec provincial electoral district)|Crémazie]] in the [[2007 Quebec general election]].

In June 2008, along with the other four living former Premiers of Quebec, Parizeau was named a Grand Officer of the [[National Order of Quebec]] by Premier [[Jean Charest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/deputes/parizeau-jacques-4781/biographie.html |title=Jacques Parizeau|website=National Assembly of Québec |language=fr}}</ref>

[[File:Jacques Parizeau1.jpg|thumb|alt=August 26th, 2007 — Québec's 26th Premier |Parizeau in August 2007]]
At a 2013 meeting of ''[[Option nationale]]'', Parizeau stated to the room that the target of sovereignty for Quebec is still realizable, and that the PQ should make the maximum effort to attain it, including using public funds.<ref>http://www.brandonsun.com/national/breaking-news/parti-quebecois-should-use-public-funds-to-promote-independence-parizeau--194527651.html?thx=y#sthash.m7WlOShE.dpuf{{dead link|date=June 2015}}</ref>

In October 2013, to the surprise of many Quebecers, Parizeau nuanced his earlier infamous "money and ethnic votes" statement to come out against the wholesale adoption of the [[Quebec Charter of Values]], which would have banned most religious symbols and clothing in the public sector (but not the crucifix over the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] President's chair).<ref name=CBC_Parizeau_OnQuebecCharter>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jacques-parizeau-former-pq-premier-slams-charter-of-values-1.1893919 |title=Jacques Parizeau, former PQ premier, slams charter of values |date=October 3, 2013 |publisher=CBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602133537/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jacques-parizeau-former-pq-premier-slams-charter-of-values-1.1893919 |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>  "Federalism is turning into true defenders of minorities in Quebec," he said to Radio-Canada at the time. "We can't put ourselves in a situation like that."<ref name=CBC_Parizeau_OnQuebecCharter /> By "we", he meant the Franco-Quebecois, the majority in Quebec, and who had voted in the majority for sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/5-ways-jacques-parizeau-shaped-the-future-of-quebec-1.3097398|title=5 ways Jacques Parizeau shaped the future of Quebec|date=June 2, 2015 |website=CBC News}}</ref>

In an interview with [[CHMP-FM|98.5 FM Montreal]], Jacques Parizeau clarified the controversial comments he made in a 1995 speech following the sovereignty referendum's yes-side loss. He said that when he laid blame for the loss, he said "ethnic votes" and not the ethnic vote, and was referring to a coalition of Greek, Italian, and Jewish organizations which actively campaigned on the "no" side.<ref name=CBC_Parizeau_OnQuebecCharter />

Parizeau let his PQ membership lapse and supported the fledgling party [[Option nationale]] and its youthful leader [[Jean-Martin Aussant]].  After [[Pierre Karl Péladeau]] entered provincial politics, Parizeau publicly decried the state of the PQ. In September 2014, after the party's defeat in the [[2014 Quebec general election|general election]], he stated that it faced "a field of ruin." During the [[2015 Parti Québécois leadership election|PQ leadership campaign of 2015]], Parizeau told Radio-Canada in his last televised interview that "the party was gradually demolished and it has lost its soul."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-sovereignty-movement-has-faltered-without-jacques-parizeau/article24762791/|first=Les |last=Perreaux|date=June 2, 2015 |title=Quebec sovereignty movement has faltered without Jacques Parizeau|website=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

==Elections as party leader==
He lost the [[1989 Quebec general election|1989 election]], and won the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 election]]. He announced his resignation the day after the "Yes" side in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]] was defeated.

==Death==
In a social media posting, Parizeau's wife announced his death after five months of hospitalization, on June 1, 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/former-quebec-premier-jacques-parizeau-dead-at-84/article24742213/ |title=Former Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau dead at 84 |first=Les |last=Perreaux |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 2, 2015 |access-date=June 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602132054/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/former-quebec-premier-jacques-parizeau-dead-at-84/article24742213/ |archive-date=June 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> He was 84.
