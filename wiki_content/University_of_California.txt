The '''University of California''' ('''UC''') is a [[public university|public]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university|research]] [[university system]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The system is composed of the campuses at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|Los Angeles]],  [[University of California, Merced|Merced]], [[University of California, Riverside|Riverside]], [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego]], [[University of California, San Francisco|San Francisco]], [[University of California, Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]], and [[University of California, Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]], along with numerous research centers and academic abroad centers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-system/parts-of-uc|title=The parts of UC|date=January 15, 2020|website=University of California|language=en|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> The system is the state's [[land-grant university]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nifa.usda.gov/land-grant-colleges-and-universities |title=Land-Grant Colleges and Universities |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture |date=2020 |access-date=January 1, 2021}}</ref>

The University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] before moving to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1873.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/programs-and-initiatives/faculty-resources-advancement/faculty-handbook-sections/brief-history.html|title=A brief history of the University of California {{!}} UCOP|website=www.ucop.edu|language=en|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://150.universityofcalifornia.edu/|title=UC 150th Anniversary Timeline|last=California|first=University of|website=UC 150th Anniversary Timeline|language=en|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref> Over time, several branch locations and satellite programs were established. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus [[University of California, Berkeley|in Berkeley]], with UC President [[Robert Gordon Sproul]] staying in place as chief executive of the UC system, while [[Clark Kerr]] became the first chancellor of UC Berkeley<ref name="Stadtman2" /><ref name="MargaretLeslieDavis" /><ref name="ClarkKerr1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellors|title=Past Chancellors {{!}} Office of the Chancellor|website=chancellor.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref> and [[Raymond B.

The University of California currently has 10 campuses, a combined student body of 285,862 students, 24,400 faculty members, 143,200 staff members and over 2.0 million living [[Alumnus|alumni]].<ref name="At a glance" /> Its newest campus in [[University of California, Merced|Merced]] opened in fall 2005. Nine campuses enroll both [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] students; one campus, [[University of California, San Francisco|UC San Francisco]], enrolls only graduate and professional students in the [[Medicine|medical]] and health sciences. In addition, the [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|UC Hastings College of the Law]], located in San Francisco, is legally affiliated with UC, but other than sharing its name is entirely autonomous from the rest of the system. Under the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]], the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public [[higher education]] plan, which also includes the [[California State University]] system and the [[California Community Colleges]] system. UC is governed by a [[University of California Regents|Board of Regents]] whose autonomy from the rest of the state government is protected by the state constitution.<ref name="Grodin_Page243" /> The University of California also manages or co-manages three national laboratories for the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]]: [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL), [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucop.edu/laboratory-management/index.html|title=UC National Laboratories {{!}} UCOP|website=www.ucop.edu|language=en|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref>

Collectively, the colleges, institutions, and alumni of the University of California make it the most comprehensive and advanced postsecondary educational system in the world, responsible for nearly $50 billion per year of economic impact.{{Failed verification|date=December 2020}}<ref>{{cite web |title=The University of California's Economic Contribution to the State of California |url=http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/sept11/f7attach.pdf |publisher=UC Regents |access-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> Major publications generally rank most UC campuses as being among the best universities in the world.

===The Morrill Acts and the liberal arts college===

In 1849, the state of California ratified its first constitution, which contained the express objective of creating a complete educational system including a state [[university]].<ref>[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Report_of_the_Debates_in_the_Convention/HfIJAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PR10&printsec=frontcover Cal. Const. Art. IX, § 4] (1849).</ref> Taking advantage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]], the [[California State Legislature]] established an Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College in 1866.<ref name="Stadtman">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/7 7–34]}}</ref><ref name="Marsden">{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=George M.|title=The Soul of the American University: From Protestant Establishment to Established Nonbelief|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195106503|pages=134–140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9QOfEZrrLYC&pg=PA134}}  Page 138 of this source incorrectly states that the date of the final negotiations in which Governor Low participated was October 8, 1869, but it is clear from the context and the endnotes to that page (which cite documents from 1867) that the reference to 1869 is a typo.</ref> However, it existed only on paper, as a placeholder to secure federal [[Land-grant university|land-grant funds]].<ref name="Marsden" />

Meanwhile, [[Congregational]] [[minister of religion|minister]] [[Henry Durant]], an alumnus of [[Yale University|Yale]], had established the private Contra Costa Academy, on June 20, 1853, in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California.<ref name="Stadtman" /> The initial site was bounded by Twelfth and Fourteenth Streets and Harrison and Franklin Streets in [[downtown Oakland]]<ref name="Stadtman" /> (and is marked today by State Historical Plaque No. 45 at the northeast corner of Thirteenth and Franklin). In turn, the Academy's trustees were granted a charter in 1855 for a [[College of California]], though the college continued to operate as a [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory school]] until it added college-level courses in 1860.<ref name="Stadtman" /><ref name="Marsden" /> The college's trustees, educators, and supporters believed in the importance of a [[liberal arts education]] (especially the study of the Greek and Roman [[classics]]), but ran into a lack of interest in [[liberal arts college]]s on the [[American frontier]] (as a true college, the college was graduating only three or four students per year).<ref name="Marsden" />

In November 1857, the college's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the [[Golden Gate]] in what is now [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] for a future planned campus outside of Oakland.<ref name="Stadtman" /> But first, they needed to secure the college's water rights by buying a large farm to the east.<ref name="Stadtman" /> In 1864, they organized the College Homestead Association, which borrowed $35,000 to purchase the land, plus another $33,000 to purchase 160 acres (650,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of [[Southside, Berkeley, California|land to the south of the future campus]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Helfand|first1=Harvey|title=University of California, Berkeley: An Architectural Tour|date=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=9781568982939|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41A6PwEj4QgC&pg=PA4}}</ref> The Association subdivided the latter parcel and started selling lots with the hope it could raise enough money to repay its lenders and also create a new [[college town]].<ref name="Stadtman" /> But sales of new homesteads fell short.<ref name="Stadtman" />

Governor [[Frederick Low]] favored the establishment of a state university based upon the [[University of Michigan]] plan, and thus in one sense may be regarded as the founder of the University of California.<ref name="Stadtman" /><ref name="Marsden" /> At the College of California's 1867 [[Graduation|commencement exercises]], where Low was present, [[Benjamin Silliman Jr.]] criticized Californians for creating a state [[Institute of technology|polytechnic school]] instead of a real university.<ref name="Stadtman" /><ref name="Marsden" /> That same day, Low reportedly first suggested a merger of the already-functional College of California (which had land, buildings, faculty, and students, but not enough money) with the nonfunctional state college (which had money and nothing else), and went on to participate in the ensuing negotiations.<ref name="Stadtman" /><ref name="Marsden" /> On October 9, 1867, the college's trustees reluctantly agreed to join forces with the state college to their mutual advantage, but under one condition—that there not be simply an "Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College", but a complete university, within which the assets of the College of California would be used to create a College of Letters (now known as the [[UC Berkeley College of Letters and Science|College of Letters and Science]]).<ref name="Stadtman" /><ref name="Marsden" /><ref>This agreement is evident in section 7 of the Organic Act, in which the state agreed to establish the College of Letters in consideration of the College of California's gift.  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=srpAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA250 Cal. Stats., 17th sess., 1867–1868, ch. 244, § 7].</ref> Accordingly, the Organic Act, establishing the University of California, was introduced as a bill by [[California State Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[John W. Dwinelle]] on March 5, 1868, and after it was duly passed by both houses of the state legislature, it was signed into [[Law of California|state law]] by Governor [[Henry H. Haight]] (Low's successor) on March 23, 1868.<ref name="Stadtman" /><ref name="Marsden" /><ref>Harvey Helfand, ''University of California, Berkeley: An Architectural Tour and Photographs,'' (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2002), 6.</ref> However, as legally constituted, the new university was ''not'' an actual merger of the two colleges, but was an entirely new institution which merely inherited certain objectives and assets from each of them.<ref name="Stadtman_Page_34">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/34 34]}}</ref> The University of California's second president, [[Daniel Coit Gilman]], opened its new campus in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in September 1873.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/daniel_gilman.html|title=Daniel Coit Gilman and the Early Years of UC – Special Topics – A History of UCSF|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref>

===The UC affiliates===

Section 8 of the Organic Act authorized the Board of Regents to affiliate the University of California with independent self-sustaining professional colleges.<ref name="Stadtman4">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/125 125–141]}}</ref><ref>See [https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/srpAAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA250 Cal. Stats., 17th sess., 1867–1868, ch. 244, § 8].</ref>  "Affiliation" meant UC and its affiliates would "share the risk in launching new endeavors in education."<ref name="Stadtman4" /> The affiliates shared the prestige of the state university's [[brand]], and UC agreed to award degrees in its own name to their graduates on the recommendation of their respective faculties, but the affiliates were otherwise managed independently by their own boards of trustees, charged their own tuition and fees, and maintained their own budgets separate from the UC budget.<ref name="Stadtman4" /> It was through the process of affiliation that UC was able to claim it had medical and law schools in San Francisco within a decade of its founding.<ref name="Stadtman4" />

In 1879, California adopted its second and [[California Constitution|current constitution]], which included unusually strong language to ensure UC's independence from the rest of the [[Government of California|state government]].<ref name="Grodin_Page243">{{cite book |last1=Grodin |first1=Joseph R. |last2=Shanske |first2=Darien |last3=Salerno |first3=Michael B. |author-link1=Joseph Grodin|title=The California State Constitution |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199988648 |pages=243 |edition=2nd |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_California_State_Constitution/3Yx2CgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA243 |access-date=June 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9">[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%209.&article=IX Cal. Const. Art. IX, § 9].</ref> This had lasting consequences for the [[Hastings College of the Law]], which had been separately chartered and affiliated in 1878 by an act of the state legislature at the behest of founder [[Serranus Clinton Hastings]].<ref name="BarnesPages447172">{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Thomas Garden |title=Hastings College of the Law: The First Century |date=1978 |publisher=University of California Hastings College of the Law Press |location=San Francisco |pages=44, 71–72}}</ref> After a falling out with his own handpicked board of directors, the founder persuaded the state legislature in 1883 and 1885 to pass new laws to place his law school under the direct control of the Board of Regents.<ref name="BarnesPage7882">{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Thomas Garden |title=Hastings College of the Law: The First Century |date=1978 |publisher=University of California Hastings College of the Law Press |location=San Francisco |pages=78–82}}</ref> In 1886, the [[Supreme Court of California]] declared those newer acts to be unconstitutional because the clause protecting UC's independence in the 1879 state constitution had stripped the state legislature of the ability to amend the 1878 act.<ref name="BarnesPage8485">{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Thomas Garden |title=Hastings College of the Law: The First Century |date=1978 |publisher=University of California Hastings College of the Law Press |location=San Francisco |pages=84–85}}</ref><ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3HwWAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA215 People v. Kewen]'', 69 Cal. 215, 10 P. 393 (1886).</ref> To this day, the Hastings College of the Law remains an affiliate of UC, maintains its own board of directors, and is not governed by the Regents.<ref name="Stadtman4" /><ref name="BarnesPage8485" />

In contrast, [[Toland Medical College]] (founded in 1864 and affiliated in 1873) and later, the dental, pharmacy, and nursing schools in SF were affiliated with UC through written agreements, and not statutes invested with constitutional importance by court decisions.<ref name="Stadtman4" /> In the early 20th century, the Affiliated Colleges (as they came to be called) began to agree to submit to the Regents' governance during the term of President [[Benjamin Ide Wheeler]], as the Board of Regents had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC brand but over which UC had no real control.<ref name="Stadtman4" /> While Hastings remained independent, the Affiliated Colleges were able to increasingly coordinate their operations with one another under the supervision of the UC President and Regents, and evolved into the health sciences campus known today as the University of California, San Francisco.<ref name="Stadtman4" />

===North-south tensions and decentralization===

In August 1882, the California State Normal School (whose original [[normal school]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] is now [[San Jose State University]]) opened a second school in Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/about_sjsu/history/timeline/1880/|title=San José State University: About SJSU: 1880–1899|publisher=San José State University}}</ref> In 1887, the Los Angeles school was granted its own board of trustees independent of the San Jose school, and in 1919, the state legislature transferred it to UC control and renamed it the Southern Branch of the University of California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm |title=UCLA Library Special Collections / University Archives Home Page |access-date=June 20, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615035434/http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2006}}</ref> In 1927, it became the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California at Los Angeles]]; the "at" would be replaced with a comma in 1958.<ref name="Dundjerski">{{cite book |last1=Dundjerski |first1=Marina |title=UCLA: The First Century |date=2011 |publisher=Third Millennium Publishing |location=Los Angeles |isbn=9781906507374 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbLr-4QteEYC&pg=PA46 |access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

Los Angeles surpassed San Francisco in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]] to become the most populous metropolis in California. Because Los Angeles had become the state government's single largest source of both tax revenue and votes, its residents felt entitled to demand more prestige and autonomy for their campus. Their efforts bore fruit in March 1951, when UCLA became the first UC site outside of Berkeley to achieve ''de jure'' coequal status with the Berkeley campus. That month, the Regents approved a reorganization plan under which both the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses would be supervised by chancellors reporting to the UC President.<ref name="Stadtman2">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/355 355–358]}}</ref><ref name="MargaretLeslieDavis">{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Margaret Leslie|title=The Culture Broker: Franklin D.

Due to stubborn resistance from President Sproul and several vice presidents and deans—who simply carried on as before—the chancellors ended up as glorified [[Provost (education)|provosts]] with limited control over academic affairs and long-range planning while the President and the Regents retained ''de facto'' control over everything else.<ref name="ClarkKerr2">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|pages=39–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA39}}</ref>

Upon becoming president in October 1957, Clark Kerr supervised UC's rapid transformation into a true public university system through a series of proposals adopted unanimously by the Regents from 1957 to 1960.<ref name="ClarkKerr3">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|pages=191–205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA191}}</ref><ref name="Trombley">{{cite news |last1=Trombley |first1=William |title=Chancellors Emerge as Powerful Force in University: New Role of UC Campus Chiefs Seen as One of Most Significant Developments of Past Five Years |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 27, 1965 |page=A1}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newspapers.</ref> Kerr's reforms included expressly granting all campus chancellors the full range of executive powers, privileges, and responsibilities which Sproul had denied to Kerr himself, as well as the radical decentralization of a tightly knit bureaucracy in which all lines of authority had always run directly to the President at Berkeley or to the Regents themselves.<ref name="ClarkKerr3" /><ref name="Trombley" /><ref name="ChancellorBylaw" /><ref name="ChancellorDuties" /> In 1965, UCLA Chancellor [[Franklin David Murphy|Franklin D.

During the 20th century, UC acquired additional satellite locations which, like Los Angeles, were all subordinate to administrators at the Berkeley campus. California farmers lobbied for UC to perform [[applied research]] responsive to their immediate needs; in 1905, the Legislature established a "University Farm School" at [[Davis, California|Davis]] and in 1907 a "Citrus Experiment Station" at [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] as adjuncts to the College of Agriculture at Berkeley. In 1912, UC acquired a [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|private oceanography laboratory]] in San Diego, which had been founded nine years earlier by local business promoters working with a Berkeley professor. In 1944, UC acquired Santa Barbara State College from the California State Colleges, the descendants of the State Normal Schools.<ref name="Gerth">{{cite book|last1=Gerth|first1=Donald R.|title=The People's University: A History of the California State University|date=2010|publisher=Berkeley Public Policy Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780877724353|page=39}}</ref> In 1958, the Regents began promoting these locations to general campuses, thereby creating [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]] (1958), [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] (1959), [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]] (1959), [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]] (1960), and [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] (1964).<ref name="Stadtman3">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/400 400–420]}}</ref><ref name="ClarkKerr4">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA221}}</ref> Each campus was also granted the right to have its own chancellor upon promotion. In response to California's continued population growth, UC opened two additional general campuses in 1965, with [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] opening in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]] opening in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].<ref name="Stadtman3" /> The youngest campus, [[University of California, Merced|UC Merced]] opened in fall 2005 to serve the [[San Joaquin Valley]].

After losing campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to the University of California system, supporters of the California State College system arranged for the state constitution to be amended in 1946 to prevent similar losses from happening again in the future.<ref name="Gerth" />

===The Master Plan for Higher Education===

The [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] of 1960 established that UC must admit undergraduates from the top 12.5% (one-eighth) of graduating high school seniors in California. Prior to the promulgation of the Master Plan, UC was to admit undergraduates from the top 15%. UC does not currently adhere to all tenets of the original Master Plan, such as the directives that no campus was to exceed total enrollment of 27,500 students (in order to ensure quality) and that public higher education should be [[College tuition in the United States|tuition-free]] for California residents. Five campuses, Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego each have current total enrollment at over 30,000.<ref name=Enrollment/>

After the state electorate severely limited long-term [[property tax]] revenue by enacting [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] in 1978, UC was forced to make up for the resulting collapse in state financial support by imposing a variety of fees which were tuition in all but name.<ref name="Lindsay">{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=Leon|title=Will California's tuition-free colleges become history?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/1217/121742.html|access-date=August 29, 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|publisher=The First Church of Christ, Scientist|date=December 17, 1982}}</ref><ref name="Lindsey">{{cite news|last1=Lindsey|first1=Robert|title=California Weighs End of Free College Education|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/28/science/california-weighs-end-of-free-college-education.html|access-date=August 29, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1982}}</ref><ref name="Gordon">{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Larry|title=California universities consider adopting the T-word: tuition|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/14/local/la-me-tuition-20100614|access-date=August 29, 2016|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 14, 2010}}</ref> On November 18, 2010, the Regents finally gave up on the longstanding [[legal fiction]] that UC does not charge tuition by renaming the Educational Fee to "Tuition."<ref>Regents of the University of California, [http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/3101.html Regents Policy 3101: The University of California Student Tuition and Fee Policy], UC Office of the President (as approved on January 21, 1994, and with amendments through November 18, 2010).</ref> As part of its search for funds during the 2000s and 2010s, UC quietly began to admit higher percentages of highly accomplished (and more lucrative) students from other states and countries,<ref name="Warren">{{cite news |last1=Warren |first1=Jeffrey E. |title=UC, where are your native sons and daughters? |url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/UC-where-are-your-native-sons-and-daughters-2354592.php |work=SFGate |publisher=Hearst Communications|date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> but was forced to reverse course in 2015 in response to the inevitable public outcry and start admitting more California residents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Miriam|last2=Belkin|first2=Douglas|title=Foreign Students Pinch University of California Home-State Admissions|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-students-pinch-university-of-california-home-state-admissions-1447650060|access-date=August 30, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|date=November 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Stephanie|title=Public Colleges Chase Out-of-State Students, and Tuition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/public-colleges-chase-out-of-state-students-and-tuition.html|access-date=August 26, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

===Academic organization===

Davis, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara all followed Berkeley's example by aggregating the majority of [[College of Arts and Sciences|arts, humanities, and science departments]] into a relatively large College of Letters and Science. Therefore, at [[UC Berkeley College of Letters and Science|Berkeley]], [[UC Davis College of Letters and Science|Davis]], [[UCLA College of Letters and Science|Los Angeles]], and [[UCSB College of Letters and Science|Santa Barbara]], their respective College of Letters and Science is by far the single largest academic unit on each campus.  The College of Letters and Science at Los Angeles is the largest academic unit in the entire UC system.<ref name="UCLAGeneralCatalog">{{cite book |last1=UCLA Registrar’s Office Academic Publications |title=UCLA General Catalog 2021-22 |date=2021 |publisher=Regents of the University of California |location=Los Angeles |url=https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/browse/College%20and%20Schools/CollegeofLettersandScience/Overview |access-date=September 24, 2021 |chapter=College of Letters and Science}}</ref> Riverside later [[UCR College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences|separated the natural sciences]] and kept only [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|social sciences grouped with arts and humanities]], an example followed by Merced at its founding.

Due to President Kerr's interest in not reproducing the impersonal undergraduate experience often seen in such gigantic academic units, San Diego and Santa Cruz both implemented [[residential college]] systems inspired by British models (in which each college has distinctive general education requirements reflecting its chosen theme)<ref name="ClarkKerr5">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|pages=273–280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA273}}</ref> and grouped most academic departments into a small number of broadly defined divisions which are all independent of the colleges.

Finally, Irvine is organized into 13 schools and San Francisco is organized into four schools, all of which are relatively narrow in scope.

===Academic calendar===

Eight campuses operate on the quarter system, while two (Berkeley and Merced) are on the semester system. However, all five law schools operate on the semester system, as does the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA]].

===UC Libraries===
{{Main|University of California Libraries}}
At 40.8 million print volumes,<ref>[https://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/facts-and-figures Facts and Figures: UC Libraries] Accessed July 27, 2020.</ref> the University of California [[library]] system is home to one of the largest collections of printed materials in the world.  On July 27, 2021, all ten campuses went live with a unified online library catalog, UC Library Search.  Besides on-campus libraries, the UC system also maintains two regional library facilities (one each for Northern and Southern California), which each accept older items from all UC campus libraries in their respective region. As of 2019, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 7.4 million items, while Southern Regional Library Facility is home to 6.5 million items.

==Research==
In 2006 the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition |Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)]] awarded the University of California the SPARC Innovator Award for its "extraordinarily effective institution-wide vision and efforts to move [[scholarly communication]] forward", including the 1997 founding (under then UC President [[Richard C. Atkinson]]) of the [[California Digital Library |California Digital Library (CDL)]] and its 2002 launching of CDL's [[California Digital Library#eScholarship|eScholarship]], an [[institutional repository]]. The award also specifically cited the widely influential 2005 [[academic journal publishing reform]]  efforts of UC faculty and librarians in "altering the marketplace" by publicly negotiating contracts with publishers, as well as their 2006 proposal to amend UC's [[copyright]] policy to allow [[open access]] to UC faculty research.<ref name="SPARC">{{cite web|author1=SPARC editors|title=SPARC Innovator: University of California (July 2006)|url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/initiatives/innovator/uc|website=[[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]]|publisher=[[Association of Research Libraries]]|access-date=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021140055/http://www.sparc.arl.org/initiatives/innovator/uc|archive-date=October 21, 2015|date=July 2006}} [http://www.sparc.arl.org/sites/default/files/UC_pdf.pdf PDF]</ref> On July 24, 2013, the [[UC Academic Senate]] adopted an [[open-access mandate|Open Access Policy]], mandating that all UC faculty produced research with a publication agreement signed after that date be first deposited in UC's eScholarship [[open access repository]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=eScholarship editors|title=UC Open Access Policy|url=http://escholarship.org/about_open_access.html|website=eScholarship|publisher=University of California|access-date=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013155757/http://escholarship.org/about_open_access.html|archive-date=October 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

University of California systemwide research on the [[SAT]] exam found that, after controlling for familial income and parental education, so-called achievement tests known as the SAT II had 10 times more predictive ability of college aptitude than the SAT I.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Geiser |first1 = Saul |last2 = Studley |first2 = Roger |title = UC and the SAT: Predictive Validity and Differential Impact of the SAT I ad SAT II at the University of California |publisher = University of California, Office of the President. |date = October 29, 2001 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/~rag/ed351B/sat_study.pdf}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[File:UC Office of the President.jpg|thumb|right|Office of the President in [[Oakland]]]]
All University of California campuses except [[Hastings College of the Law]] are governed by the [[Regents of the University of California]] as required by the [[California Constitution|Constitution of the State of California]].<ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9" /> Eighteen regents are appointed by the [[Governor of California|governor]] for 12-year terms.<ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9" /> [[University of California Student Regent|One member]] is a student appointed for a one-year term.<ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9" /> There are also seven ''[[List of Latin phrases: E|ex officio]]'' members—the [[Governor of California|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of California|lieutenant governor]], speaker of the [[California State Assembly|State Assembly]], [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction|State Superintendent of Public Instruction]], president and vice president of the alumni associations of UC, and the UC president.<ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9" /> The Academic Senate, made up of faculty members, is empowered by the regents to set academic policies.<ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9" />  In addition, the system-wide faculty chair and vice-chair sit on the Board of Regents as non-voting members.<ref name="CalConsArt9Sec9" />

Originally, the president was the chief executive of the first campus, Berkeley. In turn, other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were treated as off-site departments of the Berkeley campus, and were headed by [[provost (education)|provosts]] who were subordinate to the president. In March 1951, the regents reorganized the university so that day-to-day "[[chief executive officer]]" functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred in 1952 to [[Chancellor (education)|chancellors]] who were vested with a high degree of autonomy, and reported as equals to UC's president.<ref name="Stadtman2" /><ref name="MargaretLeslieDavis" /><ref name="ClarkKerr1" /><ref name="ChancellorDuties" /> As noted above, the regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964,<ref name="Stadtman3" /> and the three campuses added since then have also been run by chancellors. In turn, all chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the University of California President. Today, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff to the Regents of the University of California share an office building in downtown Oakland that serves as the UC system's [[headquarters]].

Kerr's vision for UC governance was "one university with pluralistic decision-making."<ref name="ClarkKerr7">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA218}}</ref> In other words, the internal delegation of operational authority to chancellors at the campus level and allowing nine other campuses to become separate centers of academic life independent of Berkeley did not change the fact that all campuses remain part of one legal entity.

===Finances===
{{main|University of California finances}}
The [[California|State of California]] currently (2015–2016) spends nearly $3 billion on the UC system, funding approximately 43.3% of the system. In 1980, the state funded 86.8% of the UC budget.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.webbcanyonchronicle.com/#!Part-One-State-reduces-UC-funding-causing-tuition-increases/cjds/563ede730cf2833083323cfb|title=Part One: State reduces UC funding causing tuition increases|last=Reznik|first=Ethan|date=November 19, 2015|newspaper=Webb Canyon Chronicle|issue=One|volume=VIII|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref> While state funding has somewhat recovered, as of 2019 state support still lags behind even recent historic levels (e.g. 2001) when adjusted for inflation.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">UC 2019-2020 operating budget https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2019-20-budget-summary.pdf</ref>

In May 2004, UC President [[Robert C. Dynes]] and CSU Chancellor [[Charles B. Reed]] struck a private deal, called the "Higher Education Compact", with Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Schwarzenegger]]. They agreed to slash spending by about a billion dollars (about a third of the university's core budget for academic operations) in exchange for a funding formula lasting until 2011. The agreement calls for modest annual increases in state funds (but not enough to replace the loss in state funds Dynes and Schwarzenegger agreed to), private fundraising to help pay for basic programs, and large student fee hikes, especially for graduate and professional students. A detailed analysis of the Compact by the Academic Senate "Futures Report" indicated, despite the large fee increases, the university core budget did not recover to 2000 levels.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Committee on Planning and Budget|title=Current Budget Trends and The Future of the University of California|publisher=University of California|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/ucpb/futures.report0506.pdf|date=May 2006|access-date=March 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226210332/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/ucpb/futures.report0506.pdf|archive-date=February 26, 2008}}</ref>  Undergraduate student fees have risen 90% from 2003 to 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paddock |first=Richard C. |title=Less to bank on at state universities |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-compact7oct07,0,5052218,full.story?coll=la-home-center |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=October 6, 2007 |access-date=October 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606013321/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-compact7oct07%2C0%2C5052218%2Cfull.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date=June 6, 2010  }}</ref> In 2011, for the first time in UC's history, student fees exceeded contributions from the State of California.<ref>{{cite news |title=University of California Budget|url=http://budget.universityofcalifornia.edu/?page_id=1120}}</ref>

Note that the distinction between "academic year" and "fiscal year" salaries (shown above) is important. Academic year salaries are for those whose work covers a standard 9-month academic calendar (not listed here); fiscal year salaries are extrapolations of the academic year salary to cover the entire fiscal year (11 months, since the last month is considered usable as vacation) for those who provide full-year service. Fiscal year salaries are computed by using the monthly rate of the academic year salary and multiplying by 11.

The UC system provides for merit pay higher than the nominal maximum of a salary range. However, once pay achieves a high threshold (varies by category, at least $300,000 in 2016), it requires either presidential or regental approval.

===Criticism and controversies===
The members of the UC governing structure have been criticized for confusion about their roles and responsibilities and for enjoying controversial perks.

In 2008, the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], the regional accreditor of the UC schools, criticized the UC system for "significant problems in governance, leadership and decision making" and "confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the university president, the regents and the 10 campus chancellors with no clear lines of authority and boundaries".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/12/BAPOV0C6G.DTL|title=UC criticized for poor governance, controls|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=February 12, 2008|last=Schevitz|first=Tanya|date=February 12, 2008}}</ref>

Besides substantial six-figure incomes, the UC President and all UC chancellors enjoy controversial perks such as free housing in the form of university-maintained mansions.<ref name="sfgate_free_mansions">{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/14/MNGDFFO0JJ1.DTL|title=Free mansions for people of means: UC system spends about $1 million yearly on upkeep|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=November 14, 2005|page=A9|author=Tanya Schevitz & Todd Wallack}}</ref> In 1962, Anson Blake's will donated his {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate ([[Blake Garden, Kensington|Blake Garden]]) and mansion (Blake House) in [[Kensington, California|Kensington]] to the University of California's Department of Landscape Architecture. In 1968, the Regents decided to make Blake House the official residence of the UC President. As of 2005, it cost around $300,000 per year to maintain Blake Garden and Blake House; the latter, built in 1926, is a {{convert|13239|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mansion with a view of San Francisco Bay.<ref name="sfgate_free_mansions"/>

All UC chancellors traditionally live for free in a mansion on or near campus that is usually known as ''University House'', where they host social functions attended by guests and donors.<ref>See University of California Regents Policy 7708, [http://policy.ucop.edu/_files/smg-docs/smg_uni_house.pdf "University-Provided Housing,"] August 1, 2009, 2, and University of California Policy BFB-G-45, [http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3420356/BFB-G-45 "Implementing Requirements on Expenses Incurred in Support of Official Responsibilities of the President and Chancellors,"] July 30, 2010, 2.</ref> UC San Diego's [[Audrey Geisel University House|University House]] was closed from 2004 to 2014 for $10.5 million in renovations paid for by private donors, which were so expensive because the 12,000-square-foot structure sits on top of a sacred Native American cemetery and next to an unstable coastal bluff.<ref name="Kucher">{{cite news|last1=Kucher|first1=Karen|title=Chancellor's home gets $10M rehab|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2013/dec/19/university-house-ucsd-chancellor-khosla-geisel/|access-date=January 14, 2016|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Schwab">{{cite news|last1=Schwab|first1=Dave|title=10 years later, Chancellor's house finally becomes a home|url=http://sdnews.com/bookmark/24447797-10-years-later-Chancellor-s-house-finally-becomes-a-home|access-date=January 14, 2016|work=SDNews.com|publisher=San Diego Community News Group|date=January 24, 2014}}</ref>

In many recent years, the University of California has faced growing criticism for high admissions of out-of-state or international students as opposed to in-state, California students. In particular, UC Berkeley and UCLA have been heavily criticized for this phenomenon due to their extraordinarily low acceptance rates compared to other campuses in the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-uc-audit-admissions-20160328-story.html|title=UC schools harm local students by admitting so many from out of state, audit finds|first=Teresa|last=Watanabe|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At a Board of Regents meeting in 2015, California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] reportedly said about the problem: “And so you got your foreign students and you got your 4.0 folks, but just the kind of ordinary, normal students, you know, that got good grades but weren’t at the top of the heap there—they’re getting frozen out.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/23/gov-brown-says-normal-californians-cant-get-berkeley-problem-some-californians-blame|title=Gov.

Although it shares the name and public status of the UC system, the [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|Hastings College of the Law]] is not controlled by the Regents or President; it has a separate board of directors and must seek funding directly from the Legislature. However, under the California Education Code, Hastings degrees are awarded in the name of the Regents and bear the signature of the UC president.<ref>{{cite web |author=State of California|title=California Education Code Section 92203|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/edc/92200-92215.html|work=California Education Code|publisher=FindLaw|year=2008|access-date=March 6, 2008}}</ref> Furthermore, Education Code section 92201 states that Hastings "is affiliated with the University of California, and is the law department thereof".<ref>{{cite web |author=State of California|title=Education Code section 92201|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/edc/92200-92215.html|work=California Education Code|publisher=FindLaw|year=2008|access-date=March 6, 2008}}</ref>

=== Graduate salaries ===
Graduates of University of California system campuses generally earn competitive salaries following graduation. According to the 2020-2021 ''PayScale'' College Salary Report, a bachelor's degree holder from any of the UC campuses with undergraduate programs (excluding [[University of California, Merced|Merced]], which is unranked) earned a median mid-career income of over $100,000 a year, with mid-career defined as graduates with over 10 years of work experience. Every UC campus, with the exceptions of [[University of California, Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]], [[University of California, Riverside|Riverside]], and [[University of California, Merced|Merced]], ranked in the top 100 universities nationally, as well as in the top 20 in the state of California in terms of median mid-career earnings of graduates. Bachelor's degree holders from two UC campuses, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego]], ranked among the top 50 nationally, and among the top 10 in the state of California in terms of median mid-career earnings.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|title=Best Colleges in California|url=https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/california?search=university%20of%20california|access-date=May 2, 2021|website=PayScale}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite web|title=Best Universities and Colleges|url=https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors?search=university%20of%20californ|access-date=May 2, 2021|website=PayScale}}</ref> The ''Payscale'' College Salary Report reports the median annual income by university and level of experience for graduates who hold a bachelor's degree only, and does not take into account university alumni with advanced degrees or differences in college major in its rankings.

==Admissions==
Each UC campus handles admissions separately, but a student wishing to apply for an undergraduate or transfer admission uses one application for all UC campuses. Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly and separately by each department or program to which one applies.

In May 2020, UC approved plans to suspend standardized testing score requirements in admissions until 2024.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoover |first1=Eric |title=Golden State Blockbuster: U. of California Will Replace ACT and SAT With New Test — or None at All |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Golden-State-Blockbuster-U/248832?cid=wcontentgrid_hp_1b |access-date=May 23, 2020 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=May 21, 2020}}</ref> In May 2021, after a student lawsuit, the University of California announced that it would no longer consider SAT and ACT scores in admissions and scholarship decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 15, 2021|title=University of California drops SAT scores for admission|url=https://apnews.com/article/university-of-california-california-education-8c7c069867e82757ab2cca7152d9197e|access-date=May 16, 2021|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>

=== Freshmen ===
Before 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus but otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were ''redirected'' to another campus with available space.<ref name="RobinsonNina">{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Nina |title=Undergraduate Access to the University of California After the Elimination of Race-Conscious Policies |date=March 2003 |publisher=University of California Office of the President |location=Oakland |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED476308.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Trombley2">{{cite news |last1=Trombley |first1=William |title=Enrollment Drop Poses Crisis at UC Riverside: Faced With Loss of 50 Faculty Positions, Campus Has Begun Strong Recruiting Drive |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 6, 1972 |page=B1}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newspapers.</ref> Students who did not want to be redirected were refunded their application fees.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}  UC Riverside chancellor [[Ivan Hinderaker]] explained in 1972: "Redirection has been a negative rather than a plus. Some come with a [[Chip on shoulder|chip on their shoulders]] so big they never give the campus a chance. They poison the attitudes of the students around them."<ref name="Trombley2" />

Therefore, in 1986, the undergraduate application system was changed to the current "multiple filing" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.<ref name="RobinsonNina" />

The University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below).  Part of the eligibility process is completion of the A-G requirements in high school.  All eligible California high school students who apply are accepted to the university, though not necessarily to the campus of choice.<ref name="ELC">{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Admissions: Local Eligibility|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/undergrad_adm/paths_to_adm/freshman/local_eligibility.html|publisher=University of California|date=May 31, 2007|access-date=March 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Master Plan Renewed|url=http://www.ucop.edu/acadinit/mastplan/MPComm1987.pdf|publisher=University of California|date=July 1987|access-date=April 9, 2009}}</ref> Eligible students who are not accepted to the campus(es) of their choice are placed in the "referral pool", where campuses with open space may offer admission to those students; in 2003, 10% of students who received an offer through this referral process accepted it.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/sep03.htm|title=Freshman admission of GTO students|publisher=University of California Office of the President|access-date=March 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706191621/http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/sep03.htm|archive-date=July 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2007, about 4,100 UC-eligible students who were not offered admission to their campus of choice were referred to UC Riverside or the system's newest campus, UC Merced.<ref>{{cite web |last=Agha|first=Marisa|title=UC system fall '07 freshman admission numbers up|publisher=The Press Enterprise|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/highereducation/stories/PE_News_Local_C_ucadmit06.3bbf195.html|date=April 5, 2007|access-date=August 22, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623114519/http://www.pe.com/localnews/highereducation/stories/PE_News_Local_C_ucadmit06.3bbf195.html|archive-date=June 23, 2007}}</ref> In 2015, all UC-eligible students rejected by their campus of choice were redirected to UC Merced, which is now the only campus that has space for all qualified applicants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_28421818/uc-admission-rates-fall-lowest-levels|title=UC admission rates fall to lowest levels|first1=Sharon|last1=Noguchi|first2=Sophie|last2=Mattson|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=July 2, 2015|access-date=July 2, 2015}}</ref>

The old undergraduate admissions were conducted on a two-phase basis. In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a "comprehensive review" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder. Students who did not qualify for regular admission were "admitted by exception"; in 2002, approximately 2% of newly admitted undergraduates were admitted by exception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/compreview/exception.pdf|title=University of California. ''Admission by Exception''.|access-date=April 9, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830010032/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/compreview/exception.pdf|archive-date=August 30, 2008}}</ref>

The process for determining admissions varies. At some campuses, such as [[UC Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] and [[UC Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]], a point system is used to weight [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], [[SAT]] Reasoning or [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores, and SAT Subject scores, while at [[UCSD|San Diego]], [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[UCLA|Los Angeles]], academic achievement is examined in the context of the school and the surrounding community, known as a holistic review.

[[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Race]], [[gender]], [[Nationality|national origin]], and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] were not used as UC admission criteria due to the passing of [[California Proposition 209 (1996)|Proposition 209]]. This information was collected for statistical purposes.

====Eligibility in the Local Context====
Eligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0. Fully eligible ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of UC's undergraduate campuses, though not necessarily at their first-choice campus or even to a campus to which they applied.<ref name="ELC" />

====Early Academic Outreach Program====
The [[EAOP|Early Academic Outreach Program]] (EAOP) was established in 1976 by University of California (UC) in response to the [[California State Legislature|State Legislature's]] recommendation to expand post-secondary opportunities to all of California's students including those who are first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.<ref>University of California EAOP, 2003 in Review.

=== Transfer students ===
The University of California admits a significant number of transfer students primarily from the [[California Community Colleges]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/|title=Transfer {{!}} UC Admissions|website=admission.universityofcalifornia.edu|access-date=July 15, 2016}}</ref> Approximately one out of three UC students begin at a community college before graduating.<ref name=":0" /> In evaluating a transfer student's application the universities conduct a "comprehensive review" process that includes consideration of grade point averages of the generally required, transferable and or related courses for the intended major. The review may also include consideration of an applicant's enrollment in selective honor courses or programs, extracurricular activities, essay, family history, life challenges, and the location of the student's residence. Different universities emphasize different factors in their evaluations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/reviewed/index.html |title=How applications are reviewed {{!}} UC Admissions |website=admission.universityofcalifornia.edu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326154514/http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/reviewed/index.html |archive-date=March 26, 2016 |access-date=July 14, 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

==Peripheral enterprises==
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}
The University of California has a long tradition of involvement in many enterprises that are often geographically or organizationally separate from its general campuses, including national laboratories, observatories, hospitals, continuing education programs, hotels, conference centers, an airport, a seaport, and an art institute.

===National laboratories===
[[File:UC_campuses_and_labs.png|thumb|372x372px|This map shows the locations of the ten UC campuses and the national laboratories associated with UC. A third national laboratory associated with UC is in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].]]
The University of California directly manages and operates one [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucop.edu/laboratory-management/|title=Office of the National Laboratories {{!}} UCOP|website=www.ucop.edu|language=en|access-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref>
* [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL) ([[Berkeley, California]])

UC is a limited partner in two separate private [[Limited liability company|limited liability companies]] that manage and operate two other Department of Energy national laboratories:
* [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) ([[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]) operated by [[Los Alamos National Security]], LLC.
* [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) ([[Livermore, California]]) operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.

====Laboratory missions====
'''Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory''' conducts unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines with key efforts focused on fundamental studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, new energy systems and environmental solutions, and the use of integrated computing as a tool for discovery.

'''Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory''' uses advanced science and technology to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain reliable. LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.

'''Los Alamos National Laboratory''' focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attack.

The UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. During the [[World War II]] [[Manhattan Project]], Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into [[stockpile stewardship]] after the end of the [[Cold War]].

Historically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, [[LLNL]] was not officially severed administratively from [[LBNL]] until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.

====Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore====
The UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with [[Bechtel Corporation]], [[BWXT]], and the [[Washington Group International]], and together they created a private company called [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a [[Lockheed Martin]] Corporation-created company that included, among others, the [[University of Texas System]]. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.<ref>{{cite news 
|last=Broad|first=William J.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/national/22alamos.html|title=California Is Surprise Winner in Bid to Run Los Alamos|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 2005|access-date=February 10, 2008}}</ref>

On June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]]. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL.

On October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System.

Other than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.

===High-performance networking===
The University of California is a founding and charter member of the [[Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California]], a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.

===Other national research centers===
From September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] at [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] —the largest grant ever awarded the university. [[UC Santa Cruz]] managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of [[NASA]]'s missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.

Since 2002, the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-funded [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] at [[UC San Diego]] has been managed by the University of California, which took over from the previous manager, [[General Atomics]].

===Observatories===
The University of California manages two [[Observatory|observatories]] as a multi-campus research unit headquartered at [[UC Santa Cruz]].
*[[Lick Observatory]] atop [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], in the [[Diablo Range]] just east of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].
*[[Keck Observatory]] at the {{convert|4,145|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} summit of [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]].

The Astronomy Department at the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] campus manages the [[Hat Creek Radio Observatory]] in [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]].

===Medical centers and schools===
The University of California operates five medical centers throughout the state:

* [[UC Davis Medical Center]], in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]];
* [[UC Irvine Medical Center]], in [[Orange, California|Orange]];
* [[UCLA Health System|UCLA Medical Center]], comprising two distinct hospitals:
**[[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], in Los Angeles;
**[[Santa Monica - UCLA Medical Center]], in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]];
* [[UCSD Medical Center|UC San Diego Medical Center]], comprising two distinct hospitals:
**[[UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest]], in [[San Diego]]; 
**[[Jacobs Medical Center]], in [[La Jolla]]; and
* [[UCSF Medical Center]], in San Francisco.

Each medical center serves as the primary [[Teaching hospital|teaching site]] for that campus's [[medical school]]. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools|title=2013 Best Medical Schools|year=2012|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref>  The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded - the [[UCSF Medical Center]] was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by ''U.S. News and World Report'''s 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-hospitals/articles/2010/07/14/best-hospitals-2010-11-the-honor-roll.html|title=U.S. News Best Hospitals 2012–13: the Honor Roll|last1=Comarow|first1=Avery|date=July 16, 2012|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref> UC also has a sixth medical school—[[UC Riverside School of Medicine]], the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984) each began as the respective county hospitals of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]], and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].  As of 2021, UC medical centers handle each year about 8.1 million outpatient visits, 349,074 emergency room visits, and roughly 1.1 million inpatient days.<ref name="At a glance" />

There are two medical centers that bear the UCLA name, but are not operated by UCLA: [[Harbor–UCLA Medical Center]] and [[Olive View – UCLA Medical Center]]. They are actually [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]-operated facilities that UCLA uses as [[teaching hospital]]s.

===UC Extension===
For over a century, the university has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of [[Continuing Legal Education]] and [[Continuing Medical Education]] in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates [[CEB (Continuing Education of the Bar)|Continuing Education of the Bar]] under a joint venture agreement with the [[State Bar of California]].

===UC Agriculture and Natural Resources===
The University of California division of Agriculture and Natural Resources plays an important role in the state's agriculture industry, as mandated by UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and [[Youth development]] research, every county in the state has a [[cooperative extension]] office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support [[4-H]] programs and have nutrition, family, and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ca4h.org/|title=University of California 4-H Youth Development Program|publisher=Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California|access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref> is a national leader in studying [[thriving]] in the field of [[youth development]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4h.ucanr.edu/About/Framework/PYD/Thrive|title=4-H Thrive|last=Resources|first=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural|website=4h.ucanr.edu|language=en-US|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>

===UC Natural Reserve System===
The [[University of California Natural Reserve System|NRS]] was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than {{convert|756,000|acre|km2}}.

===Travel and conference facilities===
* UC Berkeley operates the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station in [[Mo'orea]], [[French Polynesia]] on land donated in 1981 by the heir to the founder of the [[Gump's]] home furnishings store.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Geissinger |first1=Steve |last2=Geissinger |first2=Michael |title=Despite state budget crunch, UC runs 'Fantasy Island' station |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/04/14/despite-state-budget-crunch-uc-runs-fantasy-island-station/ |access-date=February 3, 2019 |work=East Bay Times |publisher=Bay Area News Group |date=April 14, 2008}}</ref>
* UC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its "Cal Discoveries Travel" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in [[Pinecrest, Tuolumne County, California|Pinecrest, California]], the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.
* Berkeley Lab operates its own [[hotel]], the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.
* UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services operates two on-campus hotels, the 61-room Guest House and the 254-room Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, and a lavish off-campus conference center at [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] (with a mix of chalet-like condominiums, lodge rooms, and stand-alone cottages). During the summer, the Lake Arrowhead conference center hosts the Bruin Woods vacation programs for UCLA alumni and their families. 
* Separately, UCLA Health operates the 100-room Tiverton House just south of the UCLA campus to serve its patients and their families. 
* UC Santa Cruz leased the University Inn and Conference Center in downtown Santa Cruz from 2001 to 2011 for use as off-campus student housing.
* The UC Office of the President's Education Abroad Program operates two mini-campuses that support UC students, faculty, and alumni overseas: California House in [[London]] and La Casa de la Universidad de California in [[Mexico City]]. UC Davis's UC Center Sacramento supports students [[Internship|interning]] with the [[Government of California|California state government]]. None of these facilities have on-site housing, but there is also a [[University of California, Washington Center|UC Washington Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with a dormitory for students interning with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

===University Airport===
[[UC Davis]] operates the [[University Airport]] as a utility airport for [[air shuttle]] service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples. It is also a public general aviation airport. University Airport's ICAO identifier is KEDU.

===Seaport===
[[UC San Diego]]'s [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] owns a seaport, the Nimitz Marine Facility, which is just south of Shelter Island on [[Point Loma]], San Diego. The port is used as an operating base for all of its oceanographic vessels and platforms.
