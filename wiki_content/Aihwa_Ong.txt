'''Aihwa Ong''' ({{zh|s=王爱华|zh|t=王愛華|p=Wáng Ài Huá}}; born February 1, 1950) is Professor of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], a member of the Science Council of the International Panel on Social Progress, and a former recipient of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] for the study of sovereignty and citizenship.  She is well known for her interdisciplinary approach in investigations of globalization, modernity, and citizenship from Southeast Asia and China to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  Her notions of 'flexible citizenship', 'graduated sovereignty,' and 'global assemblages' have widely impacted conceptions of the global in modernity across the social sciences and humanities. 
She is specifically interested in the connection and links between an array of [[social sciences]] such as; socio cultural [[anthropology]], [[urban studies]], science technology, and is even interested in medicine and the arts. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/aihwa-ong|title = Aihwa Ong &#124; Anthropology}}</ref>


Her major works include ''Fungible Life: Experiment in the Asian City of Life'' (2016), ''Neoliberalism as Exception: Mutations in Citizenship and Sovereignty'' (2006), ''Buddha is Hiding: Refugees, Citizenship, the New America'' (2003), ''Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality'' (1999), ''Spirits of Resistance and Capitalist Discipline: Factory Women in Malaysia'' (1987), and the edited volume ''Global Assemblages: Technology, Politics, and Ethics as Anthropological Problems'' (co-edited with Stephen J. Collier, 2005).

==Life and career==
Ong received her B.A. in anthropology (1974) from [[Barnard College]] and earned her Ph.D. (1982) in anthropology from [[Columbia University]].  She was visiting lecturer at [[Hampshire College]] (1982–84) before joining the Department of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California Berkeley]] (1984 – present).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aihwaong.info|title=Personal Page|access-date=6 August 2012}}</ref> She was the Chair of the [[Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Berkeley]] (1999–2001); was Visiting Professor at [[City University of Hong Kong]] (2001), Visiting Professor at [[Yonsei University]] (2010), and a senior researcher at the Asia Research Institute of the [[National University of Singapore]] (2010).  She was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur]] Fellowship for the study of sovereignty and citizenship (2001-2003) and has been awarded grants from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan Foundation]] for the [[Social Science Research Council]].  She received the Cultural Studies Book Award for ''Flexible Citizenship'' (1999) from the Association for Asian American Studies as well as a prize from the [[American Ethnological Society]].  She received honorable mention for ''Buddha is Hiding'' (2003) from the Society for Urban, National, and Transnational Anthropology.  In 2007, Ong was invited to the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos.  She was the Chair of the [[US National Committee for Pacific Science Association]] from 2009-2011, and was named Robert H. Lowie Distinguished Chair in Anthropology in 2015.  She continues to teach, publish, and lecture internationally.

==Academic work==
Aihwa Ong's work deals with particular entanglements of politics, technology, ethics and affects in rapidly changing situations on the Asia Pacific rim.  Ong approaches research from vantage points outside or athwart the United States. This angle of inquiry unsettles and troubles stabilized viewpoints and units of analysis in the social sciences, such as gender, class, citizenship, cities, sovereignty and the nation-state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reassembling International Theory|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|last2=Ong|first2=Aihwa|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Pivot, London|isbn=9781349480722|pages=17–24|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137383969_2}}</ref><ref name=":0" />


As an anthropologist, Ong employs ethnographic observation and analytical concept-work to investigate diverse subjective and institutional effects of ''the global'' on emerging situations for ways of being human today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Andsersen|first=Nina Trige|date=2015-04-23|title="I Don't Do Theory - I Do Concept-Work" An Interview With Aihwa Ong|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/KKF/article/view/28509|journal=Kvinder, Køn & Forskning|language=da|volume=24|issue=1|issn=0907-6182}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470695811.html|title=Wiley: Global Assemblages: Technology, Politics, and Ethics as Anthropological Problems - Aihwa Ong, Stephen J.

Her current work focuses on regimes of governing, technology, and culture that shape new meanings and practices of the human in an emerging global region.

==Work Overview==


'''''Buddha Is Hiding (2003)'''''

This book speaks about the Cambodian [[refugees]] in America and their experience and adventure with American [[citizenship]]. It explains how the Cambodian refugees earn their American citizenship by working their way up through society the hard way. Ong also concentrates on the activity behind American institutions and how it affects the minority citizens in the society, in terms of health care, law, welfare, etc. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/buddha-hiding|title = Buddha is Hiding &#124; Anthropology}}</ref>


'''''Mutations in Citizenship (2006)'''''

This book shows us how the mutations in [[citizenship]] are continuously moving, flowing and changing according to markets, technologies, societies and the population of the society. Ong starts by identifying the elements of citizenship such as citizen’s rights and laws etc. These citizens' rights are becoming incoherent from each other and being reformed to the criteria of neoliberalism and human rights. She also shows us that the “assemblage” are being taken over by political mobilizations of diverse groups instead of national terrain. In Europe, the amount of migrant flows and unregulated markets are what challenges liberal citizenship. But in Asia, foreigners who establish businesses or become entrepreneurs in the Asian region have the rights and the benefits of a citizen, so this shows us the contradiction and unfair problem between Europe and Asia. <ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276406064831|doi=10.1177/0263276406064831|title=Mutations in Citizenship|year=2006|last1=Ong|first1=Aihwa|journal=Theory, Culture & Society|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=499–505|s2cid=144432063}}</ref>


'''''Asian Biotech: Ethics and Communities of Fate (2010)'''''

This book shows us a glimpse of the emerging [[biosciences]] landscape in Asia. Ong provided a collection of case studies on biotech topics including genetically modified foods, clinical trials, blood collection, stem cell research etc. These are studies conducted all over Asia in countries such as [[Singapore]], [[China]] and [[India]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/asian-biotech-ethics-and-communities-fate|title=Asian Biotech: Ethics and Communities of Fate &#124; Anthropology}}</ref>


'''''Fungible Life: Experiment in the Asian City Of Life (2016)'''''

In this book, Ong speaks about the world of bioscience research and explains how Asian biosciences and cosmopolitan sciences go hand in hand and are connected in a tropical climate having the threat of many diseases. She presents examples of [[biomedical]] centers in Asia, such as Singapore and China and explains how they map genetic variants, disease risks, [[biomarkers]], etc. Singapore is a diverse country with citizens having an array of many nationalities. Singapore’s diverse population makes a good example for ethnic stratified databases that represent the populations in Asia. Allowing public access to [[genomic science]] in Asia, researchers and scientists will be able to study and discover the relationships between people, objects and spaces, these researches will eventually make a big impact and evolution in the scientific field and put Asia on the map for these discoveries. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/fungible-life-experiment-asian-city-life|title = Fungible Life: Experiment in the Asian City of Life &#124; Anthropology}}</ref>
