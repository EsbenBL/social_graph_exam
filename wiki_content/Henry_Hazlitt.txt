'''Henry Stuart Hazlitt''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|z|l|ɪ|t}}; November 28, 1894 – July 9, 1993) was an American journalist who wrote about business and economics for such publications as ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The American Mercury]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>Brian Doherty, ''Radicals for Capitalism: a Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement'', New York,  Public Affairs (2007) pp. 33, 91–4, 97, 123, 156, 159, 162–67, 189, 198–99, 203, 213, 231, 238 and 279; George H. Nash, ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America'' (1976) pp. 418–20.</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Henry Hazlitt was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania and raised in [[Brooklyn]], New York. He was a [[Lineal descendant#Collateral descendant|collateral descendant]] of the British essayist [[William Hazlitt]],<ref name="Hall of Fame">"[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAwTAQAAMAAJ&q=%22william+hazlitt%22+%22henry+hazlitt%22 Hall of Fame]", ''Vanity Fair'', February 1934, p. 37.</ref> but grew up in relative poverty, his father having died when Hazlitt was an infant. His early heroes were [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William James]], and his first ambition was for an academic career in psychology and philosophy. He attended New York's [[City College of New York|City College]], but left after only a short time to support his twice-widowed mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen5_1_1.asp |title=Interview with Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=Spring 1984 |access-date=March 8, 2011 }}; Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=[[The Freeman]] |access-date=February 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113132434/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}; [[Llewellyn H. Rockwell|Rockwell, Llewellyn H.]], {{cite web |url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=February 16, 2011 }}</ref>

As he later wrote, his short time at college "had a greater influence than may at first sight be supposed, not as much from the knowledge gained there, as from the increased consciousness of the knowledge which I still had to gain and the consequent ambition to attain it."<ref name="autogenerated6"/>

== Career ==
=== Early accomplishments ===
Hazlitt started his career at ''The Wall Street Journal'' as secretary to the managing editor when he was still a teenager, and his interest in the field of economics began while working there. His studies led him to ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' by [[Philip Wicksteed]] which, he later said, was his first "tremendous influence" in the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen5_1_1.asp |title=Interview with Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=Spring 1984 |access-date=March 8, 2011}}</ref> Hazlitt published his first book, ''Thinking as a Science'' at age 21.<ref name=":0">''[https://mises.org/books/thinking.pdf Thinking as a Science]''</ref> He wrote the book because he realized—through his intense process of self-education—that it was more important to think clearly than to merely absorb information. As he explains in its opening pages:<blockquote>Every man knows there are evils in the world which need setting right. Every man has pretty definite ideas as to what these evils are. But to most men one in particular stands out vividly. To some, in fact, this stands out with such startling vividness that they lose sight of other evils, or look upon them as the natural consequences of their own particular evil-in-chief.

To the Socialist this evil is the capitalistic system; to the prohibitionist it is intemperance; to the feminist it is the subjection of women; to the clergyman it is the decline of religion; to Andrew Carnegie it is war; to the staunch Republican it is the Democratic Party, and so on, ''ad infinitum.''

I, too, have a pet little evil, to which in more passionate moments I am apt to attribute all the others. This evil is the neglect of thinking. And when I say thinking I mean real thinking, independent thinking, hard thinking.<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

=== Military service ===
During [[World War I]], he served in the Army Air Service. While residing in Brooklyn, he enlisted in New York City on February 11, 1918, and served with the Aviation Section of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps until July 9, 1918.  He was then in Princeton, New Jersey, at the US School of Military Aeronautics until October 22, when he was sent to AS Camp Dick in Dallas, Texas, for a few weeks until November 7, and he was honorably discharged from service with the rank of private first class on December 12, 1918.  He returned to New York, residing at [[Washington Square Park]] for many years.<ref name="thefreemanonline1">Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=The Freeman |access-date=February 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113132434/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Editor and author ===
In the early 1920s, he was financial editor of '' The [[New York Evening Mail]]'', and during this period, Hazlitt reported his understanding of economics was further refined by frequent discussions with former Harvard economics professor [[Benjamin Anderson]], who was then working for [[Chase National Bank]] in Manhattan. Later, when the publisher [[W. W. Norton]] suggested he write an official biography of their author [[Bertrand Russell]], Hazlitt spent "a good deal of time," as he described it, with the famous philosopher.<ref name="autogenerated6">Hazlitt, Henry. [https://mises.org/library/hazlitts-reflections-70 "Reflections at 70"]. Henry Hazlitt: An Appreciation. ''[[Foundation for Economic Education]]'', 1989. (pp. 6–9)</ref> Lord Russell "so admired the young journalist's talent" that he had agreed with Norton's proposal,<ref name="mises1">{{cite web |last=Rockwell |first=Llewellyn H. |url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |date=August 18, 2014 |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]}}</ref> but the project ended after nearly two years of work when Russell declared his intention to write his own autobiography.<ref name="autogenerated6"/>

During the interwar decades, a vibrant period in the history of [[American literature]], Hazlitt served as literary editor of ''[[The Sun (New York)|The New York Sun]]''  (1925–1929), and as literary editor of the [[political left|left]]-leaning journal, ''[[The Nation]]'' (1930–1933). In connection with his work for ''The Nation'', Hazlitt also edited ''A Practical Program for America'' (1932), a compilation of [[Great Depression]] policy considerations, but he was in the minority in calling for less government intervention in the economy.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} After a series of public debates with socialist [[Louis Fischer]], Hazlitt and ''The Nation'' parted ways.<ref>Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=The Freeman |access-date=February 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113132434/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}; Rockwell, Llewellyn H., {{cite web |url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |access-date=February 16, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1933, Hazlitt published ''The Anatomy of Criticism'', an extended "trialogue" examining the nature of [[literary criticism]] and appreciation, regarded by some to be an early refutation of literary [[deconstruction]].<ref name="mises1"/><ref>While deconstruction ''per se'' was developed and popularized by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in the 1960s and '70s, the roots of deconstruction can be traced much earlier, e.g., to the francophone [[Republic of Geneva|Genevan]] philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in the 18th century.</ref> In the same year, he became [[H. L. Mencken]]'s chosen successor as editor of the literary magazine, ''[[The American Mercury]]'', which Mencken had founded with [[George Jean Nathan]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746204-2,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628232752/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746204-2,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |title=The Press: Hazlitt for Mencken |publisher=Time.com (Time magazine) |date=October 16, 1933 |access-date=February 16, 2011}}</ref> as a result of which appointment ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' included Hazlitt among those hailed in its regular "Hall of Fame" photo feature.<ref name="Hall of Fame"/> Due to increasing differences with the publisher, [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]], he served in that role for only a brief time, but Mencken wrote that Hazlitt was the "only competent critic of the arts that I have heard of who was at the same time a competent economist, of practical as well as theoretical training," adding that he "is one of the few economists in human history who could really write."{{efn|The quotation appears on the book jacket of the first edition of ''Economics in One Lesson'', which may or may not have been its first appearance.}}

From 1934 to 1946, Hazlitt was the principal editorial writer on finance and economics for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing both a signed weekly column and most of the unsigned editorials on economics, producing a considerable volume of work.<ref name="thefreemanonline1"/> Following [[World War II]], he came into conflict with [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]], publisher of ''The New York Times'', over the newly established [[Bretton Woods system]] which created the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Hazlitt opposed the Bretton Woods agreement, primarily fearing the risk of inflation. After agreeing not to write on the topic, he looked for another venue for his work, deciding on ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, for which he wrote a signed column, "Business Tides", from 1946 to 1966.<ref name="mises1"/>

According to Hazlitt, the greatest influence on his writing in economics was the work of [[Ludwig von Mises]], and he is credited with introducing the ideas of the [[Austrian School]] of economics to the English-speaking layman. In 1938, for example, he reviewed the recently published English translation of Mises's influential treatise ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]'' for ''The New York Times'', declaring it "a classic" and "the most devastating analysis of socialism yet penned."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen5_1_1.asp |title=Interview with Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=Spring 1984 |access-date=March 8, 2011 }}; Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=The Freeman |access-date=February 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113132434/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the [[Jewish]] economist's emigration to the United States from [[National Socialist]]-dominated Europe in 1940, Hazlitt arranged for Mises to contribute editorials to ''The New York Times'', and helped to secure for Mises a teaching position at [[New York University]]. Along with the efforts of his friends, [[Max Eastman]] and [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]], Hazlitt also helped introduce [[F. A. Hayek]]'s ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' to the American reading public. His 1944 review in ''The New York Times'' caused ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', where Eastman served as roving editor, to publish one of its trademark condensations, bringing the future [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate's work to a vast audience.<ref>[[Hulsmann, Jorg Guido]], ''Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism'', 2007, Ludwig von Mises Institute, {{ISBN|978-1-933550-18-3}}, p. xi; Ludwig von Mises Institute, ''Henry Hazlitt: A Giant of Liberty'', pp. 20–7; Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=February 16, 2011}}; ''Henry Hazlitt: an Appreciation'', Foundation for Economic Education, 1989, pp. 8–9.</ref>

Author Tom Malone contends that Hazlitt distinguished himself from other economists largely by his skill as a writer:<blockquote>What set Hazlitt apart from other writers on economics was the incredible clarity of his writing and his ability to make the subject interesting to laymen. He did this by focusing on principles, using practical examples, and writing in a direct and conversational style. He also avoided the technical jargon and reliance on statistics that stud the writing of most economists—to the bane of most readers. When H. L. Mencken selected Hazlitt to succeed him as literary editor at the American Mercury, he called Hazlitt the “only competent critic of the arts that I have heard of who was at the same time a competent economist,” as well as “one of the few economists in human history who could really write.”<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-04-13|title=Henry Hazlitt in One Lesson|url=https://theobjectivestandard.com/2018/04/henry-hazlitt-in-one-lesson/|last=Malone|first=Tom|access-date=2021-02-19|website=The Objective Standard|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>Unlike many other writers of his generation from the [[right-wing politics|political right]], Hazlitt never experienced a period when he was a socialist or [[communism|communist]], or a significant change in his [[classical liberal]] political views. He was the founding vice president of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], which also acquired his large personal library in the 1980s. Established by [[Leonard Read]] in 1946, FEE is considered to be the first "think tank" for free-market ideas. He was also one of the original members of the classical liberal [[Mont Pelerin Society]] in 1947.<ref>Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the Ludwig von Mises Institute |access-date=February 16, 2011}}; ''Henry Hazlitt: an Appreciation'', Foundation for Economic Education, 1989</ref>

With John Chamberlain (and [[Suzanne La Follette]] as [[managing editor]]), Hazlitt served as editor of the early [[free market]] publication ''[[The Freeman]]'' from 1950 to 1952, and as sole editor-in-chief from 1952 to 1953, and its contributors during his tenure there included Hayek, Mises, and [[Wilhelm Röpke]], as well as the writers [[James Burnham]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[Max Eastman]], [[John T. Flynn]], [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], [[Raymond Moley]], [[Morrie Ryskind]], and [[George Sokolsky]].<ref>[[John Chamberlain (journalist)|Chamberlain, John]], ''A Life With the Printed Word'', 1982, [[Regnery]], p.138; Hamilton, Charles H., "''The Freeman'': the Early Years," ''The Freeman'', Dec. 1984, vol. 34, iss. 12.</ref> Prior to his becoming editor, ''The Freeman'' had supported Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in his conflict with President [[Harry Truman]] on the issue of [[communism]], "undiscriminatingly" according to some critics, but upon becoming editor, Hazlitt changed the magazine's policy to one of support for President Truman.<ref name="diggins217">[[John Patrick Diggins|Diggins, John P.]], ''Up From Communism'', [[Columbia University Press]], 1975, p. 217.</ref>

''The Freeman'' is widely considered to be an important forerunner to the conservative ''[[National Review]]'', founded by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], which from the start included many of the same contributing editors.<ref>Chamberlain, John, ''A Life with the Printed Word'', pp. 141, 145–146.</ref> Hazlitt himself was on the masthead of ''National Review'', either as a contributing editor or, later, as contributor, from its inception in 1955 until his death in 1993. Differences existed between the journals: ''The Freeman'' under Hazlitt was more [[secularism|secular]] and presented a wider range of [[foreign policy]] opinion than the later ''National Review''.<ref name="diggins217"/>

Even prior to her success with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', the novelist [[Ayn Rand]] was a friend of both Hazlitt and his wife, Frances, and Hazlitt introduced Rand to Mises, bringing together the two figures who would become most associated with the defense of pure ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism.<ref>Burns, Jennifer, ''[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]'', 2009, [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 141–43; cf. Branden, Barbara, ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'', Doubleday, 1986, pp. 168–69, 181n.</ref> The two became admirers of Hazlitt and of one another.<ref>See, e.g., the first issue of Rand's ''Objectivist Newsletter'' which declared Mises "the most distinguished economist of our age" and "an intransigent advocate of freedom and capitalism" (''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'', "Review: ''[https://mises.org/resources/2714 Planned Chaos]'' by Ludwig von Mises," vol. 1, no. 1, Jan. 1962), and the second issue which declared Hazlitt's ''Economics in One Lesson'' to be "a classic in the literature of freedom" and "the finest primer available for students of capitalism" (''The Objectivist Newsletter'', "Review: ''Economics in One Lesson'' by Henry Hazlitt," vol. 1, no. 2, Feb. 1962); Mises invited Rand to attend his seminar as an "honored guest" (Burns, ''Goddess of the Market'', p. 177) and praised her novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' as "a pitiless unmasking of the insincerity of the policies adopted by governments and political parties" and "a cogent analysis of the evils that plague our society" in a letter to Rand (dated January 23, 1958, quoted in Hülsmann, ''Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism'', p. 996.); and see, McConnell, Scott, ''100 Voices: an Oral History of Ayn Rand'', "Sylvester Petro," New American Library, 2010, pp. 165–70.</ref>

Hazlitt became well known both through his articles and by frequently debating prominent politicians on the radio, including: Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]], and U.S. Senators [[Paul Douglas]] and [[Hubert H. Humphrey]], the future Vice President.<ref name="thefreemanonline1"/> In the early 1950s, he also occasionally appeared on the [[CBS Television]] current events program ''[[Longines Chronoscope]]'', interviewing figures such as Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] and Congressman [[Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.]], along with coeditor [[William Bradford Huie]].<ref>''[[Longines Chronoscope]]'' programs are at the [[Library of Congress]]'s [https://www.archives.gov National Archives and Records] cataloged as "Television Interviews, 1951–1955"; [[IMDbTitle:0366050|Longines Chronoscope (TV Series 1951–1955) – IMDb]] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWzO8KDZ?url=http://www.archives.gov |date=July 22, 2007 }}</ref> At the invitation of philosopher [[Sidney Hook]], he was also a participating member of the [[American Committee for Cultural Freedom]] in the 1950s.<ref>[[Sidney Hook|Hook, Sidney]], ''Out of Step'', Carroll & Graf, 1987, chapter 26.</ref>

When he finally left ''[[Newsweek]]'' in 1966, the magazine replaced Hazlitt with three university professors: "free-market [[monetarism|monetarist]] [[Milton Friedman]] of the [[University of Chicago]], middle-of-the-roader [[Henry Wallich]] of [[Yale]], and [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] [[Paul A. Samuelson]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT.]]"<ref name="thefreemanonline1"/> His last published scholarly article appeared in the first volume of ''The Review of Austrian Economics'' (now, ''[[The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics]]'') in 1987.

He was awarded an honorary [[doctoral degree]] at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in [[Guatemala]].

In ''A New Constitution Now'' (1942), published during [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s unprecedented third term as [[President of the United States]], Hazlitt called for the replacement of the existing fixed-term presidential tenure in the United States with a more Anglo-European system of "cabinet" government, under which a head of state who had lost the confidence of the legislature or cabinet might be removed from office after a no-confidence vote in as few as 30 days.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chad|date=2020-10-07|title=The Forgotten Hazlitt Book|url=https://mises.org/library/forgotten-hazlitt-book|access-date=2020-10-09|website=Mises Institute|language=en}}</ref> In 1951, following Roosevelt's death in 1945, the United States imposed [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|presidential term limits]].

== Personal life ==
Henry was born to Stuart Clark and Bertha (Zauner) Hazlitt on November 28, 1894, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  They resided at 819 North Broad Street in Philadelphia. The Hazlitt family was originally from England, although his paternal grandmother was from Ireland.  His maternal grandparents were German immigrants.  Henry's father, a clerk, died of diabetes when Henry was only five months old. His mother, Bertha, then married Frederick E. Piebes, who was engaged in manufacturing, and they resided in Brooklyn, where Henry was raised.  Henry is listed on the 1905 New York state census as Henry S. Piebes, and he is listed on Frederick's will as Henry Hazlitt Piebes, Frederick's adopted son.  His stepfather died in 1907, leaving Henry to support his mother and probably leading to the ambition that enabled him to work at the ''Wall Street Journal'' while he was still a teenager.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1929, Hazlitt married Valerie Earle, daughter of the noted photographer and [[Vitagraph]] film director [[William P. S. Earle]]. They were married by the [[Pacifism|pacifist]] minister, [[John Haynes Holmes]], but later divorced.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A15F93954167A93C2A8178ED85F4D8285F9 |title=Valerie Earle Wed To Henry Hazlitt |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 10, 1929 |access-date=February 14, 2012}}</ref> In 1936, he married Frances Kanes, the author of ''The Concise Bible'',<ref>Hazlitt, Frances Kanes, ''The Concise Bible'', Liberty Press, 1962.</ref> with whom he later collaborated to produce an anthology of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers, ''The Wisdom of the Stoics: Selections from Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius'' (1984). They were married until Frances' death in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/obituaries/henry-hazlitt-98-a-journalist-who-concentrated-on-economics.html |title=Obituary, Henry Hazlitt |newspaper=The New York Times |date= July 10, 1993|access-date=March 11, 2011 |first=Louis |last=Uchitelle|author-link=Louis Uchitelle}}</ref>

Hazlitt died at the age of 98 in Fairfield, Connecticut. At the time of his death, he resided in Wilton, Connecticut.

== Legacy ==
Hazlitt was a prolific writer{{according to whom|date=October 2021}}, authoring 25 works in his lifetime.

In 1981, President [[Ronald Reagan]] in his speech before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (or "CPAC") named Hazlitt as one of the "[i]ntellectual leaders" (along with [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Russell Kirk]], [[James Burnham]] and [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]]) who had "shaped so much of our thoughts..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/#ixzz1kykZhgRn |title=Address by President Ronald Reagan to the Conservative Political Action Conference |publisher=the American Conservative Union |date=March 20, 1981 |access-date=January 29, 2012 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110134608/http://www.conservative.org/acuf/our-philosophy/ |archive-date=January 10, 2012 }}</ref>

[[Ludwig von Mises]] said at a dinner honoring Hazlitt: "In this age of the great struggle in favor of freedom and the social system in which men can live as free men, you are our leader. You have indefatigably fought against the step-by-step advance of the powers anxious to destroy everything that human civilization has created over a long period of centuries... You are the economic conscience of our country and of our nation."<ref name="mises4"/>

=== Henry Hazlitt Foundation ===
From 1997 to 2002, there was an organization called The [[Henry Hazlitt Foundation]] which actively promoted [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] networking online, especially through its website Free-Market.Net. This organization was named in honor of Hazlitt because he was known for introducing a wide range of people to libertarian ideas through his writing and for helping free-market advocates connect with each other. The foundation was started after Hazlitt's death and had no official connection with his estate.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Hazlitt Policy Center ===
On 1 March 2019, the [[Young Americans for Liberty]] announced the launch of the [[Hazlitt Policy Center]] "to provide YAL's elected officials with modern legislation, facts, and strategies to give them the extra muscle they need to be effective liberty legislators."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=f1340031d3e25504f5712bcb1&id=4e07eecb53|title=Holding liberty legislators accountable}}</ref><ref>https://hazlittpolicy.org/</ref>
