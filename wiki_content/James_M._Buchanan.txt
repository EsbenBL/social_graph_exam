'''James McGill Buchanan Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|b|juː|ˈ|k|æ|n|ən}}; October 3, 1919 – January 9, 2013) was an American [[economist]] known for his work on [[public choice theory]]<ref name="Baird"/> (included in his most famous work, co-authored with [[Gordon Tullock]], ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]'', 1962), for which he received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1986. Buchanan's work initiated research on how politicians' and bureaucrats' self-interest, utility maximization, and other non-wealth-maximizing considerations affect their decision-making. He was a member of the Board of Advisors of [[The Independent Institute]] as well as of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchanan |first1=James M |last2=Burton |first2=John |last3=Wagner |first3=R.E. |title=The consequences of Mr. Keynes |date=1978 |publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/THE%20CONSEQUENCES%20OF%20MR%20KEYNES.pdf |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-date=June 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200628192058/http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/THE%20CONSEQUENCES%20OF%20MR%20KEYNES.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> a member (and for a time president) of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]],<ref name="membership">{{cite web|title=Mont Pelerin Society Past Presidents|url=https://www.montpelerin.org/past-presidents-2/|access-date=4 September 2018|publisher=[[Mont Pelerin Society]]|archive-date=September 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904155415/https://www.montpelerin.org/past-presidents-2/|url-status=live}}</ref> a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the [[Cato Institute]], and professor at [[George Mason University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/meet-the-economist-behind-the-one-percents-stealth-takeover-of-america|title=Meet the Economist Behind the One Percent's Stealth Takeover of America|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25|archive-date=March 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326223856/https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/meet-the-economist-behind-the-one-percents-stealth-takeover-of-america|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Background==
Buchanan was born in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], the eldest child of James and Lila (Scott) Buchanan, a family of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] descent.  He was a grandson of [[John P. Buchanan]], a governor of Tennessee in the 1890s.<ref>Reuben Kyle, ''From Nashborough to the Nobel Prize: The Buchanans of Tennessee'' (Murfreesboro: Twin Oaks Press, 2012).</ref>  He attended [[Middle Tennessee State College|Middle Tennessee State Teachers College]] (since 1965 known as [[Middle Tennessee State University]]) in 1940 by living at home and working on the farm.  Buchanan completed his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1941. He served in the [[United States Navy]] on the staff of Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] in [[Honolulu]] during [[World War II]], when he met Anne Bakke, whom he married on October 5, 1945. Anne, of Norwegian descent, was working as a nurse at the military base in Hawaii. She died in 2005.

Buchanan identified as a socialist in his youth and was unaware of the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Chicago school of economics|strong market-oriented approach to economics]]. His studies there, particularly under [[Frank Knight|Frank H. Knight]], converted him to "a zealous advocate of the market order".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/ancillary/IPEL.html|title=Ideological Profiles of the Economics Laureates|work=Econ Journal Watch|access-date=17 February 2016|archive-date=August 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809084612/https://econjwatch.org/ancillary/IPEL.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Buchanan received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1948 with a thesis on "Fiscal Equity in a Federal State", which was heavily influenced by Knight. It was also at Chicago that he first read and found enlightening the work of Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]].<ref name="NYTObit">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/business/economy/james-m-buchanan-economic-scholar-dies-at-93.html?_r=0 | title=James M.

Buchanan's original political and economic views leaned heavily socialist and were reinforced by his stint spent in the Navy. While serving in the military, Buchanan felt soldiers from the south and west regions were discriminated against in favor of soldiers from the New England region. He believed the soldiers from the north-east universities were viewed as a part of the establishment and received promotions to officer because of their affiliations. Buchanan would state in an interview<ref>Horn, Karen Ilse. ''Roads to Wisdom, "Conversations with Ten Nobel Laureates in Economics''," pg.94-95 Edward Elgar, 2011.</ref> with Karen Horn, “Out of the 20 boys from the establishment universities, 12 or 13 were picked. against a background of a total of 600. It was overtly discriminatory towards those of us who were not members of the establishment,”. Buchanan went so far as to say he would have become a communist had he been approached by a recruiter. Buchanan would go on to say that his socialist views were less "pro government" and more "anti-big business". His ideology did not change until attending The University of Chicago, where he began studying under Frank Knight. Then he started to advocate for a free market system. 

==Career==

Buchanan was the founder of the new [[Virginia school of political economy]].

He taught at the [[University of Virginia]] from 1956-1968, where he founded the Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy. From 1955 to 1956 he was a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission|Fulbright Scholar]] in Italy.

He taught at [[UCLA]] 1968–1969, followed by [[Virginia Tech]] 1969-1983, where he held the title Distinguished Professor of Economics and founded the Center for the Study of Public Choice (CSPC). In 1983, a conflict with Economics Department head [[Daniel M. Orr]] came to a head, and Buchanan took the CSPC to its new home at [[George Mason University]],<ref name=Mitchell1988>{{cite journal |author=William C. Mitchell |year=1988 |title=Virginia, Rochester, and Bloomington: Twenty-Five Years of Public Choice and Political Science |journal=Public Choice |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=101–19 |doi=10.1007/BF00115751 |s2cid=153671519 }}</ref> where he eventually retired with [[emeritus]] status.

He also taught at [[Florida State University]] (1951-1956) and the [[University of Tennessee]].

In 1969 Buchanan became the first director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice. He was president of the Southern Economic Association in 1963 and of the Western Economic Association in 1983 and 1984, and vice president of the American Economic Association in 1971.

In 1988, Buchanan returned to Hawaii for the first time since World War II and gave a series of lectures later published by the University Press.

==Personal life and death==

Buchanan died January 9, 2013, in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], at age 93.<ref name="NYTObit" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the Nobel Prize-winning economist who championed [[public choice]] theory influenced a "generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes and the size of government".<ref name="NYTObit" /> The ''[[Badische Zeitung]]'' ([[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]) called Buchanan, who showed how politicians undermine fair and simple tax systems, the "founder of the [[new political economy]]".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Badische Zeitung|date=January 9, 2013|title=Nobelpreisträger James M.

==Thinking==

Buchanan's work focused on [[public finance]], the public debt, voting, rigorous analysis of the theory of [[logrolling]], macroeconomics, [[constitutional economics]], and [[libertarian theory]].<ref>Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. "[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705221504/http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf |date=July 5, 2016 }}", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).</ref>

===Approach to economic analysis===

Buchanan was largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy as a scholarly pursuit.<ref>[[Peter Boettke]], "James M. Buchanan and the Rebirth of [[Political Economy]]", in ''Against the Grain: Dissent in Economics'', ed. S. Press and R. Holt (Aldershot, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing, 1998), pp. 21-39.</ref> He emphasized that public policy cannot be considered solely in terms of distribution, but is instead always a matter of setting the rules of the game that engender a pattern of [[exchange (economics)|exchange]] and [[distribution (economics)|distribution]]. His work in [[public choice theory]] is often interpreted as the quintessential instance of [[economics imperialism]];<ref>Amartya Sen, in ''Economics and Sociology'', ch. 14, Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 263</ref> however, [[Amartya Sen]] has argued that Buchanan should not be identified with economics imperialism, since he has done more than most to introduce ethics, legal political thinking, and indeed social thinking into economics.<ref>R. Swedberg, ''Economics and Sociology: On Redefining Their Boundaries'' (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 263.</ref> Crucial to understanding Buchanan's system of thought is the distinction he made between politics and policy. Politics is about the rules of the game, where policy is focused on strategies that players adopt within a given set of rules. "Questions about what are good rules of the game are in the domain of social philosophy, whereas questions about the strategies that players will adopt given those rules is the domain of economics, and it is the play between the rules (social philosophy) and the strategies (economics) that constitutes what Buchanan refers to as constitutional political economy".<ref>"Where Economics and Philosophy Meet: Review of ''The Elgar Companion to Economics and Philosophy'' with responses from the authors", ''The Economic Journal'', 116 (June), 2006</ref>

In 1972, like [[George McGovern]], Buchanan supported a 100% marginal [[tax rate]] on all inheritances above a certain amount.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Public Choice, Past and Present: The Legacy of James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9781461459095|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyK5vSJuo4sC&pg=PA162|language=en|access-date=July 3, 2017|archive-date=April 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418080451/https://books.google.com/books?id=SyK5vSJuo4sC&pg=PA162|url-status=live}}</ref>

When conducting his economic analysis, Buchanan used [[methodological individualism]], [[rational choice theory|rational choice]], individual [[utility maximization]], and politics as exchange.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Politics as exchange: the classical liberal economics and politics of James M. Buchanan|author1=James D. Gwartney |author2=Randall G. Holcombe |journal=Constitutional Political Economy |volume=25 |page=265|date=May 18, 2014 | issue=3| doi=10.1007/s10602-014-9165-z|s2cid=154198573 }}</ref>

Buchanan's important contribution to [[constitutionalism]] is his development of the sub-discipline of [[constitutional economics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional Economics|url=http://www.walkerd.people.cofc.edu/400/Sobel/2A-8.%20Buchanan%20-%20Constitutional%20Economics.pdf|access-date=15 July 2017|archive-date=August 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828182722/http://www.walkerd.people.cofc.edu/400/Sobel/2A-8.%20Buchanan%20-%20Constitutional%20Economics.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Buchanan the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and "may be called the idealized [[Emmanuel Kant|Kant]]ian world" where the individual "who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour".<ref>James Buchanan, The Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty, Volume 1, Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 314</ref> Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[State (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom to the citizens of this state". This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believed that every [[constitution]] is created for at least several generations of citizens. Therefore, it must be able to balance the interests of the state, [[society]], and each individual.<ref>Buchanan, J., Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty, Vol. 1, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 372.</ref>

Buchanan's work ''Cost and Choice'' (see below in List of publications) is often overlooked for its contributions in defining the parameters of [[opportunity cost]]. In it, he writes that the costs to individuals determine what the price of a good or service is. For example, the physical work that is required to hunt an animal as well as the price of the tools necessary to hunt it and the time spent hunting all play a factor in the price an individual places on the meat. The asking price of the meat will vary from person to person because the input costs required for each person are not the same.

Buchanan is considered to be a quasi-member of the [[Austrian school]] of economics, not formally associated with the school but sharing many common beliefs.<ref name=Baird>{{cite web|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1989/5/cj9n1-10.pdf|title=James Buchanan and the Austrians: The Common Ground|author=Charles W. Baird|website=Object.cato.org|access-date=2017-07-15|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033116/http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1989/5/cj9n1-10.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> As Buchanan puts it: "I certainly have a great deal of affinity with Austrian economics and I have no objections to being called an Austrian. [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises|Mises]] might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not." Buchanan went on to say that: "I didn't become acquainted with Mises until I wrote an article on individual choice and voting in the market in 1954. After I had finished the first draft I went back to see what Mises had said in ''Human Action''. I found out, amazingly, that he had come closer to saying what I was trying to say than anybody else."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen9_1_1.asp |title=An Interview with James Buchanan |website=Mises.org |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=2014-07-30 |access-date=2017-07-15 |archive-date=September 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914022018/https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen9_1_1.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Public choice theory===

James Buchanan is considered the architect of [[public choice theory]]. His work within Public Choice earned him the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 1986.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Public choice theory focuses on people's decision making process within the political realm.  Buchanan used both the fields of economics and [[political science]] to help develop Public Choice.  The same principles used to interpret people's decisions in a  market setting are applied to [[voting]], [[lobbying]], [[wikt:campaigning|campaigning]], and even candidates.  Buchanan maintains that a person's first instinct is to make their decisions based upon their own self-interest, which varied from previous models where government officials acted in constituents' best interest.  Buchanan explains public choice theory as "politics without romance" because, he says, many of the promises made in politics are intended to appear concerned with the interest of others, but in reality are the products of selfish ulterior motives.  According to this view, political decisions, on both sides of the voting booth, are rarely made with the intention of helping anyone but the one making the decision.  Buchanan argues that by analyzing the behaviors of voters and politicians that their actions could become easily predicted.<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Buchanan.html Buchanan Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328221817/http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Buchanan.html |date=March 28, 2014 }}.
