{{other people|Charles Kennedy}}
'''Charles Kennedy''' (1923 â€“ 4 November 1997) was an economist, often considered one of the finest theorists of his generation.

He was born into a large family, the youngest of five sons; he was the son of [[George Kennedy (architect)|George Kennedy]], an architect, and grandson of the painter [[Charles Napier Kennedy]]. A gifted child, he was educated at [[Gordonstoun]], and entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]] at the age of seventeen. His tutor there was [[Thomas Balogh]]. Within two years he had graduated with first-class honours in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], and was immediately recruited into [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Lord Cherwell's]] statistical research group for the duration of World War II.

After the War he re-entered academia, lecturing in Economics for a year at [[Imperial College London]] and another at Balliol. In 1948 he was elected Fellow of Economics at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and in 1950 gained a University lectureship. In 1955, he travelled to the [[West Indies]], where he spent a large amount of time painting; six years later, fond memories persuaded him to leave Oxford and take up a Chair in Economics at the [[University of the West Indies]] in 1961, shortly after being married.

During his time in the West Indies, he wrote prolifically - at least by his standards - and briefly served as Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the university, as well as being a Director of the [[Bank of Jamaica]]. Due to political events, however, he decided to return to the UK, and took the Chair of Economic Theory at the [[University of Kent]] in [[Canterbury]] in 1966. He formally retired four years later, at the young age of 48, but continued teaching part-time (as the Honorary Professor of Economic Theory) until 1984. For his services to the University, he was awarded an honorary [[DLitt]] in 1984.

Kennedy was mildly eccentric; he had a [[phobia]] of libraries, and would not enter one unless accompanied, even then being distinctly uncomfortable. He was not a prolific writer - he only published around fifty papers - but his writing was of a high calibre; of those papers, sixty percent were published in the ''Economic Journal'', ''Oxford Economic Papers'', or the ''Review of Economic Studies''.
