==History==
EPPC was founded in 1976 by [[Ernest W. Lefever]], an American political theorist. He was nominated in 1981 for a [[US State Department]] position by US President [[Ronald Reagan]] before ultimately being rejected for the opportunity for his controversial background.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bradleyfdn.org/On-Lion-Letter/ID/2197/Ethics-and-Public-Policy-Center-celebrates-40-years-of-championing-the-Judeo-Christian-moral-tradition | title=Ethics and Public Policy Center celebrates 40 years of championing the Judeo-Christian moral tradition | website=The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation | access-date=12 November 2018 }}</ref> He served as president of EPPC until 1989 and continued to write scholarly articles for EPPC until his death in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://eppc.org/publications/in-memory-of-ernest-w-lefever/ | title=In Memory of Ernest W.
