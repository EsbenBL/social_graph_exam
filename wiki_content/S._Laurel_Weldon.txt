'''S. Laurel Weldon''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} is a [[Canadian]] and [[Americans|American]] [[political scientist]], currently a Distinguished Professor of Political Science at [[Simon Fraser University]]. She is a [[Democracy#Theory|democratic]] and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] theorist, known for studies of the cross-national evolution of [[women's rights]], policies on the prevention of [[violence against women]], and the [[Women in government|inclusion of women]] in political decision-making. Weldon's work has been noted for contributing to both substantive [[Political philosophy|political theory]] and [[Political methodology|empirical methods]].

==Education==
Weldon's mother, Sirje Weldon, was the Atlantic regional director for the Canadian Bankers Association, and her father, K. Laurence Weldon, was a professor of [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]] at Simon Fraser University.<ref name="nyt99"/>

Weldon attended Simon Fraser University, graduating in 1991 with a BA in political science and sociology and a minor in philosophy. She then completed an MA in political science at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1992, and a PhD in political science at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1999, where she was advised by [[Iris Marion Young]].<ref name="purdue">{{cite web |url=https://cla.purdue.edu/directory/profiles/s-laurel-weldon.html |date=2019-09-02 | website=Purdue University Profiles |title=CLA profiles | publisher=Purdue University Association |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating with a PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, Weldon moved to [[Purdue University]] in 1999. She soon published the 2002 book ''Protest, Policy and the Problem of Violence Against Women'', as well as a series of widely cited cross-national studies on violence against women and women's political participation.<ref name="sfu19">{{cite web |url=https://www.sfu.ca/fass/news/2019/07/s-laurel-weldon-wins-human-rights-book-award/ |date=2019-07-26 | website=Simon Fraser University |title=S. Laurel Weldon wins Human Rights Book award for The Logics of Gender Justice | publisher=Simon Fraser University |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

In 2011, Weldon published the book ''When Protest Makes Policy: How Social Movements Represent Disadvantaged Groups'', which studied the role of [[social movement]]s in democracy through several case studies on American social movements. This work provided evidence that social movements can be an effective means for systematically [[disadvantaged]] groups to promote their collective aims, and that in some cases strong social movements can provide more effective safeguards against negative political outcomes than the official inclusion of group members in formal institutions like [[legislature]]s.<ref name="umich">{{cite web |url=https://www.press.umich.edu/1285595/when_protest_makes_policy |year=2019 | website=University of Michigan Press |title=When Protest Makes Policy: How Social Movements Represent Disadvantaged Groups | publisher=University of Michigan Press |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> The book won the [[American Political Science Association]]'s 2012 [[Victoria Schuck Award]] for the best book published on women and politics.<ref name="apsa12">{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/schuckrecipients |year=2012 | website=American Political Science Association |title=Victoria Schuck Award Recipients | publisher=American Political Science Association |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> In 2013, Weldon was a co-editor of the first ''Oxford Handbook on Politics and Gender''.<ref name="purdue"/>

Weldon's third book was coauthored with [[Mala Htun]] and published in 2018; in ''The Logics of Gender Justice: State Action on Women’s Rights Around the World'', Weldon and Htun studied the evolution of women's rights issues such as family law, abortion, paid parental leave, and contraception from 1975 to 2005.<ref name="sfu19"/> Weldon and Htun received the Human Rights Best Book Award for 2019 from the [[International Studies Association]].<ref name="isa19">{{cite web |url=https://www.isanet.org/Programs/Awards/HRBestBook/PastRecipients |year=2019 | website=International Studies Association |title=Human Rights Best Book Award Past Winners | publisher=International Studies Association |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

Weldon has been a consultant for international organisations including the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]]. She has also been a lead reviewer for selective political science journals: she is part of the 2020-2024 editorial leadership of the [[American Political Science Review]],<ref name="apsr19b">{{cite web |url=https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-2020-apsr-editor-s-laurel-weldon-of-simon-fraser-university/ |date=2019-09-02 | website=Political Science Now |title=Meet 2020 APSR Editor, S.
