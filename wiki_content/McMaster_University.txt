==History==
McMaster University resulted from the outgrowth of educational initiatives undertaken by Baptists as early as the 1830s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingatmcmaster.ca/careers/about/index.php|title=About McMaster & Hamilton|publisher=McMaster University|year=2010|access-date=27 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706213547/http://www.workingatmcmaster.ca/careers/about/index.php|archive-date=6 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was founded in 1881 as Toronto Baptist College. Canadian Senator William McMaster, the first president of the [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]], bequeathed funds to endow a university, which was incorporated through a merger of Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College, [[Woodstock, Ontario]]. In 1887 the Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College was granted royal assent, and McMaster University was officially incorporated.<ref name=AtuTBCaWC/> Woodstock College, Woodstock, and Moulton Ladies' College, Toronto, were maintained in close connection.<ref>{{Citation|editor-last=Burpee|editor-first=Lawrence J.|editor2-last=Doughty|editor2-first=Arthur G.|title=The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History|page=245|volume=21|publisher=Morang & Co., Ltd.|date=1912|location=Toronto}}</ref>
[[File:RCMPostcard.JPG|thumb|McMaster Hall, located in Toronto, was the original location of the university. The building is currently used as the headquarters for [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]].|alt=Portrait of McMaster Hall, located in Toronto, Ontario]]
The new university, housed in McMaster Hall in Toronto, was sponsored by the [[Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec|Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec]] as a sectarian undergraduate institution for its clergy and adherents. The first courses—initially limited to arts and theology leading to a BA degree—were taught in 1890, and the first degrees were conferred in 1894.<ref name="CE">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mcmaster-university/|title=McMaster University|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|last=Green|first=J. Paul |publisher=The Historica Foundation of Canada|date=18 February 2009|access-date=27 January 2011}}</ref>

As the university grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move the university to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university until two years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/about_history_1900s.html|title=McMaster in the 1900s|publisher=McMaster University|year=2008|access-date=13 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630163406/http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/about_history_1900s.html|archive-date=30 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton.<ref name=MAC20 /> As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated the future of the university. The university nearly became federated with the [[University of Toronto]], as had been the case with [[Trinity College (U of T)|Trinity College]] and [[Victoria College (U of T)|Victoria College]].

Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to move the university to Hamilton.<ref name=MAC20 /> The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move.<ref name=MAC30>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/about_history_1930s.html|title=McMaster in the 1930s|publisher=McMaster University|year=2008|access-date=13 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630163532/http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/about_history_1930s.html|archive-date=30 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates.<ref name="CE" /> Lands were transferred from [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)|Royal Botanical Gardens]] to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930.<ref name=MAC30/> McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the [[Royal Conservatory of Music (Toronto)|Royal Conservatory of Music]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schabas|first=Ezra|title=There's Music in These Walls: A History of the Royal Conservatory of Music|location=Toronto|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd|year=2005|page=162|isbn=978-1-55002-540-8}}</ref>

Professional programs during the interwar period were limited to just theology and nursing.{{sfn|Gidney|2004|p=94}} By the 1940s the McMaster administration was under pressure to modernize and expand the university's programs. During the [[Second World War]] and post-war periods the demand for technological expertise, particularly in the sciences, increased.{{sfn|Gidney|2004|p=94}} This problem placed a strain on the finances of what was still a denominational Baptist institution. In particular, the institution could no longer secure sufficient funds from denominational sources alone to sustain science research.{{sfn|Gidney|2004|p=94}} Since denominational institutions could not receive public funds, the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec decided to reorganize the university, creating two federated colleges. The arts and divinity programs were reconstituted as University College and science was reorganized under the newly incorporated Hamilton College as a separate division capable of receiving provincial grants.{{sfn|Gidney|2004|p=94}} Hamilton College was incorporated in 1948 by letters patent under ''The Companies Act'', although it remained only affiliated with the university.<ref name="BILLPr7">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/univsec/bylaws/McMasterAct_760607.pdf|title=An Act Respecting McMaster University (The McMaster University Act, 1976)|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|date=7 June 1976|access-date=27 January 2011}}</ref> The university traditionally focused on undergraduate studies, and did not offer a PhD program until 1949.{{sfn|Jenkins|2004|p=6}}
[[File:Hamilton Hall at McMaster University.jpg|right|thumb|Hamilton Hall was constructed in 1926 in preparation for the university's move to Hamilton.|alt=Hamilton Hall at McMaster University]]
Through the 1950s increased funding advanced the place of sciences within the institution.{{sfn|Gidney|2004|p=95}} In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Engineering and contract record|volume=68|publisher=Hugh C. MacLean|year=1955|page=97}}</ref> Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the humanities and social sciences were given an equal place.{{sfn|Gidney|2004|p=95}} Thus, in 1957 the university reorganized once again under ''The McMaster University Act, 1957'', dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding.<ref name="BILLPr7" /> The historic Baptist connection was continued through [[McMaster Divinity College]], a separately chartered affiliated college of the university.<ref name="CE" /><ref name=DivHis2>{{cite web|url=https://mcmasterdivinity.ca/welcome/history|title=History|publisher=McMaster Divinity College|date=22 January 2018}}</ref> Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies.{{sfn|Jenkins|2004|p=6}} Construction of the [[McMaster Nuclear Reactor]] also began in 1957, and was the first university-based [[research reactor]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] when it began operating in 1959.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|title=Canada enters the nuclear age: a technical history of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|location=Montreal|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1997|page=91|isbn=978-0-7735-1601-4}}</ref>

In 1965, with the support of the Ontario government, the university established a medical school and teaching hospital, graduating its first class of physicians in 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=REA Publishing|last2=Research & Education Association|last3=Staff of Research Education Association|title=Rea's Authoritative Guide to Medical & Dental Schools REA'S AUTHORITATIVE GUIDE TO MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCHOOLS Handbooks and Guides|location=Piscataway, N.J.|publisher=University Press of America|year=1997|page=300|isbn=978-0-87891-479-1}}</ref> In 1968 the university was reorganized under an amended act of the McMaster Act into the Divisions of Arts, Science, and Health Sciences, each with its own vice-president, while the Divinity College continued under its existing arrangement.<ref name="BILLPr7" /><ref name=Hist2>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/univsec/history.cfm |title=History of McMaster University|publisher=McMaster University|year=2011|access-date=21 January 2011}}</ref> In 1974 the divisional structure of the university was dissolved and reorganized again under ''The McMaster University Act, 1976'' and the vice-presidents were replaced by a single vice-president (academic).<ref name="BILLPr7" /> The Faculties of Business, Engineering, Health Sciences, Humanities, Science, and Social Sciences were retained, each under the leadership of a dean.

In 1991, McMaster's [[Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] adopted [[progress testing]], developing the personal progress index (PPI), a system based on progress testing invented concurrently by the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]]'s medical school and the [[Maastricht University]].

==Insignias and other representations==
McMaster uses a number of symbols to represent the institution, with the university's Office of Public Relations managing the university's visual identity. The university's present visual identity, and logo was approved by the university senate in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcmaster.ca/opr/html/opr/mcmaster_brand/main/visual_identity_guidelines.html|title=Visual Identity Guidelines|publisher=McMaster University|access-date=12 January 2016}}</ref> Other symbols utilized by the university includes a flag, unveiled on 29 September 2015, as well as a [[ceremonial mace#Universities|ceremonial mace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/article/mcmaster-to-raise-first-university-flag/|title=McMaster to raise first University flag|publisher=McMaster University|access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref> The university mace was bequeathed in 1950 from the graduating class of 1900. Used in ceremonies such as convocation, the mace symbolizes the authority of the university senate to confer degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://registrar.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fall-2015-Program-AM-FINAL.pdf|title=The Rituals of Convocation|work=Five hundred and Forty-eighth Convocation for the conferring of degrees|access-date=12 January 2016|date=20 November 2015}}</ref> The university also uses several tag lines as a part of its overall branding effort. As of 2007, the branding tag line used by the university is "Learning Without Borders," although the previous tag line, "Inspire, Innovation, and Discovery," is still used to a limited extent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/opr/html/opr/mcmaster_brand/visual_identity/McMaster_brand_manual.pdf|title=McMaster University Brands Standards Manual|date=October 2010|access-date=12 January 2016|publisher=McMaster University}}</ref> 
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Macfireball.png|thumb|upright|The fireball is the emblem of the Faculty of Engineering. The emblem is based on the coat of arms of the defunct Hamilton College.|right]] -->
In addition to the visual representations of the institution, the university's individual departments, faculties, and schools also employ symbols to visually represent them. One such example is the Faculty of Engineering's fireball emblem, adopted by the faculty in 1960. The fireball was adopted from the coat of arms of the defunct Hamilton College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macengsociety.ca/cultured/|title=Culture and Traditions|publisher=The McMaster Engineering Society|access-date=12 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207031634/http://macengsociety.ca/cultured/|archive-date=7 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Motto and songs===
The university's motto, chosen from [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] 1:17, is {{lang|el|ΤΑ ΠΑΝΤΑ ΕΝ ΧΡΙΣΤΩΙ ΣΥΝΕΣΤΗΚΕΝ}}.<ref name=RegisterofArms>{{cite web |url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=1082 |title= Registration of Arms |access-date=21 January 2010 |publisher=Canadian Heraldic Authority}}</ref> The motto, adopted in 1888, is Greek for "In Christ all things consist".<ref name=RegisterofArms/> The McMaster motto is unusual in that it employs Greek instead of Latin or English. The use of Latin reflects the origin of universities in mediaeval institutions in which Latin was more prominent than Greek.{{sfn|Graham|1985|p=3}}<ref name=MACMOT>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/coat/motto.htm |title=The Motto|access-date=4 November 2010|publisher=McMaster University}}</ref> McMaster's founders desired to go back beyond the Middle Ages to the earliest days of the Christian faith, and therefore used the Greek form.<ref name=MACMOT />

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games are "The Alma Mater Song" (1935), with words by Mrs. A.A. Burridge and music by Hugh Brearly; "Shout for McMaster!

===Coat of arms===
After the university moved to Hamilton in 1930, the university petitioned [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] in [[Edinburgh]] for a [[coat of arms]].<ref name=MACCOA/> The request was granted on behalf of [[The Crown]] on 20 October 1930.{{sfn|Graham|1985|p=3}}<ref name=MACCOA>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/opr/html/opr/mcmaster_brand/visual_identity/coatofarms.html|title=The Coat of Arms|access-date=4 November 2010|publisher=McMaster University}}</ref> In 1997 the board of governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster's heraldry while improving the quality of print and electronic reproduction.<ref name=MACCOA /> The university's arms and badge was registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on 15 October 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=1082|title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|publisher=The Canadian Heraldic Authority|date=28 July 2005|access-date=27 January 2011}}</ref>

The coat of arms consists of a shield, a crest, and a motto, together with a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]]. The shield contains an eagle, symbolic of the heavenly vision, with a cross on its breast to indicate Christianity as the inspiration for the university's vision.<ref name=shield/> The [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] of the shield bears an open book, a common symbol of learning. A golden maple leaf is situated on each side of the book, signifying the university's charter was granted by the Province of Ontario.<ref name=shield>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/coat/shield.htm|title=The Shield|access-date=4 November 2010|publisher=McMaster University}}</ref> The helmet, above the shield, has the open visor and forward-facing style typically used by universities.<ref name=shield/> The [[mantling]] surrounding the shield and helmet represents the cloak worn over a knight's armour as protection from the sun. The crest, above the helmet, is a stag and oak tree, which serves as a tribute to the Canadian senator, William McMaster, who also used a stag and oak on his insignias.<ref name=MACCOA /> The motto is above the crest, as is common in [[Scottish heraldry]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Scots Heraldry|last=Innes|first=Thomas|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|year=1956|page=38|isbn=978-0-8063-0478-6}}</ref>
