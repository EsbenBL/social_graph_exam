==Biography==
McCleary holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago, a Master of Theological Studies from Emory University, and a B.A. from Indiana University.

McCleary's work is interdisciplinary with theoretical grounding in the fields of political science, sociology, and economics. Within these disciplines, she conducts research on the political economy of religion. Her research focuses on how religion interacts with economic performance and the political and social behavior of individuals and institutions across societies. McCleary studies how religious beliefs and practices influence productivity, economic growth, and the maintenance of political institutions such as democracy. Her and her husband's work was cited in the March 25, 2013 edition of ''Bloomberg''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pope Francis Should Look East to End Poverty|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-25/pope-francis-should-look-east-to-end-poverty.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref>
