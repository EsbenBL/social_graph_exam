The '''Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research''' (often simply referred to as "The Melbourne Institute") is an [[Australia]]n [[Economics|economic]] research institute based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The institute is a department of the Faculty of Business and Economics at the [[University of Melbourne]].

== History ==

The Melbourne Institute was formed in 1962 as the Institute of Applied Economic Research under the leadership of Professor [[Ronald Henderson]]. It was the first economic research institute in an Australian university. Henderson built up an organisation with about 40 staff by the early 1970s. It engaged in a wide range of research areas including [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] forecasting, [[financial economics]] and social economics, and is best remembered for its work on poverty and the development of the Henderson [[Poverty threshold|Poverty Line]]. The name of the institute was later changed to Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research (IAESR).<ref name=AR97I>[http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/about/annual/report1997/1.pdf Annual Report 1997, "Introduction to the Melbourne Institute"]</ref>

After the Henderson era, [[Duncan Ironmonger]] acted as director for five years, before Professor [[Peter Dixon (economist)|Peter Dixon]] was appointed director.

After some restructuring, the new Melbourne Institute based its operation around Dixon's [[Computable general equilibrium|ORANI]] model of the Australian economy. In the early 1990s Peter Dixon and a number of his senior colleagues left the institute to join [[Monash University]]. This necessitated a second period of adjustment and restructuring initiated by Professor [[Richard Blandy]] who was director from 1992 to 1994.

Professor [[Peter Dawkins (economist)|Peter Dawkins]], took up his position of director in January 1996. In that year, the director and his senior management team, in association with the staff and the advisory board, developed a strategic plan with the unifying theme being the link between economic performance and social outcomes. The first version of this plan was for the period 1996â€“2000 and it is updated annually. In that year, the name of the institute was changed to Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.<ref name=AR97I />

Professor [[John Freebairn]] was appointed director in 2005 and returned to the Department of Economics in 2007. [[Stephen Sedgwick]], former board member of the [[Asian Development Bank]] was director from August 2007 until July 2009. In April 2010 Professor [[Deborah A. Cobb-Clark|Deborah Cobb-Clark]] was appointed the director and Ronald Henderson Professor.

==Current activities==

The Melbourne Institute manages the [[Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey|Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia]] (HILDA) household panel survey, a national longitudinal study of household economies, labour force participation and family change. It is also undertaking a panel study of [[General practitioner]]s examining the determinants of medical workforce shortages, undertakes detailed [[Labour economics|labour market]] research, is examining the relationship of [[poverty]] and [[human capital]] and examines the economic impacts of [[intellectual property]]. The institute produces regular reports which track consumer sentiment and economic activity (both reports get widespread media comment in Australia), and [[List of universities in Australia#Rankings of universities|annual rankings of the standing of Australian Universities]] and of individual disciplines. The institute hosts a biennial conference with a focus on economic performance and social outcomes.
