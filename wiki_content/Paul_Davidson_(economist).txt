'''Paul Davidson''' (born October 23, 1930) is an American [[macroeconomist]] who has been one of the leading spokesmen of the American branch of the [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] school in [[economics]]. He is a prolific writer and has actively intervened in important debates on economic policy ([[natural resources]], [[international monetary systems|international monetary system]], [[developing country|developing countries]]' debt) from a position that is very critical of [[mainstream economics]].

==Life and work==
Davidson did not originally choose economics as a profession. His primary training was in both [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], for which he received [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degrees from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1950.<ref name="cfeps">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfeps.org/people/davidsonp/ |title=Paul Davidson |publisher=Center for Full Employment and Price Stability |access-date=2011-04-03 |archive-date=2018-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727221220/http://www.cfeps.org/people/davidsonp/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was a graduate student in [[biochemistry]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], but switched to economics, receiving his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[City University of New York]] in 1955, and completing his [[PhD]] at the University of Pennsylvania in 1959.

Davidson is Holly Professor of Excellence, [[Emeritus]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] in [[Knoxville]]. He is a [[Visiting Scholar]] at the Schwartz Center For Economic Policy Analysis at the [[New School]]. Besides the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Tennessee, and the New School, Davidson has taught economics at [[Rutgers University]], [[Bristol University]], and the [[University of Cambridge]]. In the early 1960s he worked at [[Continental Oil Company]].<ref name="cfeps"/>

Davidson and [[Sidney Weintraub (economist born 1914 died 1983)|Sidney Weintraub]] founded the ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' in 1978. Davidson continues as editor of that journal. He is also a contributor to the Center for Full Employment and Stability.
