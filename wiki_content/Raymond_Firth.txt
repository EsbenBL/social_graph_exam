'''Sir Raymond William Firth''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|Kt}} {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRAI|FBA}} (25 March 1901 – 22 February 2002) was an [[ethnologist]] from [[New Zealand]]. As a result of Firth's ethnographic work, actual behaviour of societies (social organization) is separated from the idealized rules of behaviour within the particular society (social structure). He was a long serving [[Professor]] of [[Anthropology]] at [[London School of Economics]], and is considered to have singlehandedly created a form of British [[economic anthropology]].<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news | author=Bloch, Maurice | title= Obituary: Sir Raymond Firth | work=The Guardian (UK)| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/obituary/story/0,12212,750257,00.html | access-date=29 November 2006 | location=London | date=26 February 2002}}</ref>

==Early life and academic career==
Firth was born to Wesley and Marie Firth in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, in 1901. He was educated at [[Auckland Grammar School]], and then at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]], where he graduated in economics in 1921.<ref name="AA">Huntsman, Judith (2003). "Raymond Firth (1901–2002)". ''American Anthropologist''. '''105''' (2): 487–490.</ref> He took his economics MA there in 1922 with a 'fieldwork' based research thesis on the Kauri Gum digging industry,<ref>Laviolette, Patrick (2020) Mana and Māori culture: Raymond Firth's pre-Tikopia years. ''History and Anthropology'' 31(3): 393-409.</ref> then a diploma in social science in 1923.<ref name="ASAO">{{cite web|author=Watson-Gegeo, Karen |year=1988 |title=Raymond Firth |work=asao.org |url=http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/firth.htm |access-date=29 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703124832/http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/firth.htm |archive-date=3 July 2007}}</ref> In 1924 he began his doctoral research at the London School of Economics. Originally intending to complete a thesis in economics, a chance meeting with the eminent [[social anthropologist]] [[Bronisław Malinowski]] led to him to alter his field of study to 'blending economic and anthropological theory with Pacific ethnography'.<ref name="AA"/> It was possibly during this period in England that he worked as research assistant to [[James Frazer|Sir James G Frazer]], author of ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.<ref name="AJA">{{cite journal | author= Kessler, Clive S. | year= 2002 | title= Obituary: Raymond W. Firth, 1901–2002 | journal=Australian Journal of Anthropology |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=224–229 | doi= 10.1111/j.1835-9310.2002.tb00202.x }}</ref> Firth's doctoral thesis was published in 1929 as ''Primitive Economics of the New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]]''.

After receiving his PhD in 1927 Firth returned to the southern hemisphere to take up a position at the [[University of Sydney]], although he did not start teaching immediately as a research opportunity presented itself. In 1928 he first visited [[Tikopia]], the southernmost of the [[Solomon Islands]], to study the untouched [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] society there, resistant to outside influences and still with its pagan religion and undeveloped economy.<ref name="AA"/> This was the beginning of a long relationship with the 1200 people of the remote four-mile long island, and resulted in ten books and numerous articles written over many years. The first of these, ''We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia'' was published in 1936 and seventy years on is still used as a basis for many university courses about [[Oceania]].<ref name="Oceania">{{cite journal | author= Macdonald, Judith | year= 2002 | title= Sir Raymond Firth 1901–2002 | journal=Oceania |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=153–155 | doi= 10.1002/j.1834-4461.2002.tb02784.x }}</ref>

In 1930 he started teaching at the University of Sydney. On the departure for Chicago of [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], Firth succeeded him as acting Professor. He also took over from Radcliffe-Brown as acting editor of the journal [[Oceania (journal)|''Oceania'']], and as acting director of the Anthropology Research Committee of the Australian National Research Committee.

After 18 months he returned to the London School of Economics in 1933 to take up a lectureship, and was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1935. Together with his wife [[Rosemary Firth]], also to become a distinguished anthropologist, he undertook fieldwork in [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] in 1939–1940.<ref name="APS"/> During the [[Second World War]] Firth worked for British naval intelligence, primarily writing and editing the four volumes of the [[Naval Intelligence Handbooks|Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series]] that concerned the Pacific Islands.<ref name="Naval intelligence">{{cite web | year= 2003 | title= The Naval intelligence Handbooks | work=Progress in Human Geography, 27,2 | url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/27/2/153.pdf | access-date=29 November 2006}}</ref> During this period Firth was based in Cambridge, where the LSE had its wartime home.

Firth succeeded Malinowski as Professor of Social Anthropology at LSE in 1944, and he remained at the School for the next 24 years.<ref name="AA"/> In the late 1940s he was a member of the Academic Advisory Committee of the then-fledgling [[Australian National University]], along with Sir [[Howard Florey]] (co-developer of medicinal [[penicillin]]), Sir [[Mark Oliphant]] (a nuclear physicist who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]]), and Sir [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Keith Hancock]] ([[Chichele Professor of Economic History]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]). Firth was particularly focused on the creation of the university's School of Pacific Studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.anu.edu.au/?pid=7|title=History of ANU|publisher=Australian National University|access-date=11 May 2016}}</ref>

He returned to Tikopia on research visits several times, although as travel and fieldwork requirements became more burdensome he focused on family and kinship relationships in working- and middle-class London.<ref name="APS">Ortiz, Sutti (2004). "[http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/480109.pdf Sir Raymond Firth]". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611144823/http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/480109.pdf |date=11 June 2011 }} ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''148''' (1): 129–133.</ref> Firth left LSE in 1968, when he took up a year's appointment as Professor of Pacific Anthropology at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. There followed visiting professorships at British Columbia (1969), Cornell (1970), Chicago (1970–1), the Graduate School of the City University of New York (1971) and UC Davis (1974). The second [[festschrift]] published in his honour described him as 'perhaps the greatest living teacher of anthropology today'.<ref name="ASAO"/>

After retiring from teaching work, Firth continued with his research interests, and right up until his hundredth year he was producing articles. He died in London a few weeks before his 101st birthday: his father had lived to 104.

==Personal life==
Firth married [[Rosemary Firth]] (née Upcott) in 1936 and she died in 2001; they had one son, Hugh, who was born in 1946. He was raised a [[Methodist]] then later became a [[humanism|humanist]] and an atheist, a decision influenced by his anthropological studies.<ref name="RSNZ">{{cite web | author= Kitchin, Peter  | year= 2002 | title= Sir Raymond (William) Firth | work=The Independent (UK) | url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/Site/about/governance/yearbooks/year02/firth.aspx | access-date=17 January 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref><ref>"His Methodist upbringing soon turned into a thoroughgoing humanistic atheism. This freed him for the sympathetic study of exotic religions, and for discussions of the role of faith in the anthropologist's own perceptions. He tended to feel a sort of good-natured intolerance of the religious beliefs of his friends and colleagues."

==Māori lament (''poroporoaki'') for Sir Raymond Firth==
Composed on behalf of the [[Polynesian Society]] by its then-President, [[Hugh Kawharu|Professor Sir Hugh Kawharu]] (English translation)<ref name="AA"/>

:You have left us now, Sir Raymond
:Your body has been pierced by the spear of death
:And so farewell. Farewell,
:Scholar renowned in halls of learning throughout the world
:'Navigator of the Pacific'
:'Black hawk' of Tamaki.

:Perhaps in the end you were unable to complete all
:the research plans that you had once imposed upon yourself
:But no matter! The truly magnificent legacy you have left
:will be an enduring testimony to your stature.
		
:Moreover, your spirit is still alive among us,
:We, who have become separated from you in New Zealand,
:in Tikopia and elsewhere.

:Be at rest, father. Rest, forever,
:in peace, and in the care of the Almighty.
