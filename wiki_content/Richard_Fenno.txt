'''Richard Francis Fenno Jr.''' (December 12, 1926 – April 21, 2020) was an American [[political scientist]] known for his pioneering work on the [[U.S. Congress]] and its [[Members of Congress|members]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/remembering-pioneering-rochester-political-scientist-richard-fenno-427532/|title=A giant in the field of American Politics|date=2020-04-24|website=NewsCenter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Bernstein |first=Jonathan |date=April 22, 2020 |title=So Long to Richard Fenno, a Giant of Political Science |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-22/so-long-to-richard-fenno-a-giant-of-political-science |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |location=[[New York City]] |access-date=April 22, 2020 }}</ref> He was Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Rochester]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/people/view.php?fid=36|title=Faculty Directory: Department of Political Science : University of Rochester|website=www.sas.rochester.edu|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref>Nelson Polsby, "The Contributions of President Richard F.

Political scientists considered the research groundbreaking and startlingly original and gave him numerous awards. Many followed his research design on how to follow members from Washington back to their home districts. Fenno was best known for identifying the tendency — dubbed "Fenno's Paradox" — of how most voters say they dislike Congress as a whole, but they trust and reelect their local Congressman.<ref> Schudel, 2020.</ref>
==Biography==
Fenno grew up in Boston and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he graduated from [[Amherst College]] in 1948 and completed a [[Ph.D.]] degree in [[political science]] under [[William Yandell Elliott]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1956.<ref name=":0" /> Fenno moved in 1958 to the [[University of Rochester]] where he spent his career.  He wrote about Republicans and Democrats and explored rural, urban and African American congressional districts in depth. An independent who never publicized his personal political views, he never endorsed any candidates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Fenno's books ''Congressmen in Committees'' (1973) and ''Home Style: House Members in Their Districts'' (1978) (for which he won the first [[D. B. Hardeman Prize]]) established him as a leading scholar of [[American politics]]. With [[William H. Riker|William Riker]], Fenno built the reputation of [[University of Rochester|Rochester's]] political science department.<ref name=":0" /> Riker focused on positive political science, while Fenno focused on establishing Rochester as a center for [[United States Congress|congressional studies]]. He built the first internship program for undergraduates to work in Congress.<ref name="auto">Schudel, 2020. </ref>

Fenno's trademark style of [[political science]] [[research]] is sometimes referred to as "Soak and Poke" (see Fenno 1986).<ref>{{Cite book|last1=King|first1=Gary|title=Designing Social Inquiry|last2=Keohane|first2=Robert O.|last3=Verba|first3=Sidney|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2121-1|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=38|doi=10.1515/9781400821211}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Rather than relying primarily on data sets or [[rational choice theory]], Fenno undertook empirical observation of the movements of political actors on the stage of politics. His most famous book ''Home Style'' is written in this fashion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Fenno won the [[American Political Science Association]]'s (APSA) [[Woodrow Wilson]] Award for the best book in political science in 1978 for ''Home Style''. In 1996, the Association for Budgeting & Financial Management awarded Fenno its [[Aaron Wildavsky]] Award for Lifetime Scholarly Achievement in Public Budgeting, for his work on Congress and appropriations. ''Congress at the Grassroots'' won the 2001 [[V. O. Key]] Award for the best book on [[Southern United States|southern politics]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Fenno served as [[book review]] editor of the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' (1968–1971), as a director of the [[Social Science Research Council]], and as president of APSA (1984–1985). He was also a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Since 1986, APSA's Legislative Studies Section has awarded the Richard F. Fenno Jr. Prize for the best book on legislative studies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Fenno's archival collection is housed at the University of Rochester's River Campus Libraries Department of Rare Books, Special Collections, and Preservation. Research interview and oral history notes are also housed at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]]'s Center for Legislative Activities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

According to Norman J. Ornstein:
:Fenno was hands down the most significant student of Congress of the last half of the 20th century. He was the first to note that voters loved their congressman while hating Congress, he wrote the definitive study of the appropriations process (“The Power of the Purse”) and a series of books where he explored the relationship between legislators at home and in Washington.<ref name="auto"/>

Fenno died in [[Mount Kisco, New York]] on April 21, 2020 from the effects of COVID-19.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Craig |first1=Gary |title='Giant in the field,' emeritus UR political scientist Richard 'Dick' Fenno dies at 93 |url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/04/28/richard-dick-fenno-dies-ur-political-scientist-preeminent-congressional-scholar-covid-19/3033029001/. |access-date=26 May 2020 |publisher=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle |date=28 April 2020}}</ref>
