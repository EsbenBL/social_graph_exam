'''Richard J. Wiseman''' (born 17 September 1966) is a Professor of the Public Understanding of [[Psychology]] at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Phonebook">{{cite web | url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/search?query=richard+wiseman&collection=herts-meta&f.Section | title=University of Herfordshire Phonebook | access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref> He has written several best-selling popular [[psychology]] books that have been translated into over 30 languages. He has given keynote addresses to The [[Royal Society]], The Swiss Economic Forum, [[Google]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].<ref name="About Richard Wiseman">{{cite web | url=http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/about-me/ | title=About Richard Wiseman | access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.quirkology.com/UK/ | title=Quirkology | access-date=23 January 2014}}</ref> He is a fellow for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] and a patron of [[Humanists UK]]. Wiseman is also the creator of the [[YouTube channel]] Quirkology.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Quirkology | title=Quirkology on YouTube | access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Wiseman was born and raised in [[Luton]]. His mother a seamstress and his father an engineer, he learned his trade as a teenage magician working the crowds in Covent Garden.<ref name="All About RW">{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/interview-professor-richard-wiseman-edinburgh-science-festival-guest-curator-1-1494424 | title=Interview: Professor Richard Wiseman, Edinburgh Science Festival guest curator | publisher=The Scotsman | date=11 February 2011 | access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=Like most magicians I got into magic really young. You open that book when you're in the library, and go "this is for me". It happened to me at about age eight.|sign=Richard Wiseman|source=''Interview [[The Scotsman]]''<ref name="All About RW" />}}

At 18 he continued as a street performer and went to [[University College London]] to study [[psychology]], partly because it "was right around the corner". He shared accommodation as a student with [[Adrian Owen]], later also to become a psychologist. In his years as a street performer he learned how to adapt or get out of what you are doing because "Sometimes you would start your act and after five minutes there was no audience." He moved to Edinburgh where he obtained his PhD in Psychology from the [[University of Edinburgh]] for research supervised by [[Robert L. Morris]].<ref name=wisemanphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/20306|hdl=1842/20306|title=The assessment of psychic claimants : an application of schema theory to the evaluation of strong psychic claims|first= Richard|last=Wiseman|date=1992|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.663964}}|website=era.lib.ed.ac.uk|oclc=606153209}} {{free access}}</ref> He went from there to the [[University of Hertfordshire]], becoming Britain's first professor in the Public Understanding of Psychology.<ref name="All About RW" />

In his early years at the University of Hertfordshire, Wiseman partnered with [[Simon Singh]] on a BBC segment about lying for the [[National Science Week]]. The segment spanned TV, radio and print and featured a "politician making a statement, and letting the public vote on whether they thought this figure was telling the truth in each medium."  It was the first time that Wiseman and Singh met. From the beginning, the two got along well and on Singh's idea, ended up creating a show together called Theatre of Science. The show aimed to deliver science to the audience in an entertaining manner. Wiseman describes how one stunt involved standing in a cage between two Tesla coils while lightning struck the cage. Wiseman ended up writing ''The Luck Factor'' in part due to Singh as well. With the success of Singh's book, ''[[Fermat's Last Theorem]]'', Singh introduced Wiseman to his agent and encouraged him to write a similar book in the psychology arena, which led to ''The Luck Factor''.<ref name="Richard Wiseman and Simon Singh: How we met">{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/richard-wiseman-and-simon-singh-how-we-met-9757880.html | title=Richard Wiseman and Simon Singh: How we met | publisher=The Independent | date=28 September 2014 | access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>

==Career and research==

===Psychological research===
Wiseman is known for his critical examination and frequent debunking of unusual phenomena, including reports of [[paranormal]] [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. He is a fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI).<ref name="CSI Fellows and Staff">{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csi_fellows_and_staff/|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer|title=CSI Fellows and Staff}}</ref> His research has been published in numerous academic journals, reported at various conferences,<ref name="Papers">{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardwiseman.com/research/papers.html|title=Richard Wiseman - Research|website=www.richardwiseman.com}}</ref> and featured on television.<ref name="wiseman-imdb">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1320922/|title=Richard Wiseman (I)|publisher=IMdb}}</ref>

Wiseman has studied the principles of good and bad [[luck]], publishing the results in the self-help book ''The Luck Factor''. He showed that both good and bad luck result from measurable habits; for example, lucky people, by expecting good luck, might expend more effort in their endeavours, resulting in more success, reinforcing their belief in good luck. Lucky people are outgoing and observant and therefore have many more chance encounters than unlucky people, each of which could bring a lucky opportunity. Moreover, lucky people are more likely to look on the bright side of 'bad' encounters. In a mental exercise describing being shot during a bank robbery, lucky people considered themselves lucky not to have been killed while unlucky people considered themselves unlucky to have been shot.<ref name="Carter">{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/raising-happiness/201003/happy-go-lucky|title=Happy-go-Lucky|publisher=Psychology Today|last=Carter|first=Christine}}</ref>

===Public engagement===
{{Quote|text=Some people will just see [his work] as fun and say, that's interesting. I would hope a few people then go slightly beyond that and look at the implications. I want people to find that for themselves.|sign=Richard Wiseman|source=''Interview research.''<ref name="Research Interview">{{cite web | url=http://www.research-live.com/features/the-illusion-and-reality-of-research/4006025.article | title=The illusion and reality of research | publisher=research. | date=19 September 2011 | access-date=7 March 2014 | author=Bain, Robert}}</ref>}}

Much of Wiseman's work tends to be oblique, as he prefers to make people go outside, discuss, research and think about the implications of his work rather than trying to convey his points in a 45-minute talk. So instead of talking directly about eyewitness testimony in law he would set something up that looked like it, something like the colour changing card trick.<ref name="Research Interview"/> In this mind set he has presented keynote addresses to organisations around the world and in well known forums and congresses like the Swiss Economic Forum and ESOMAR Congress.<ref name="Research Interview" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.swisseconomic.ch/archiv/live-2012/item/richardwiseman | title=Keynote Speech: Professor Richard Wiseman | date=7 June 2012 | access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref> Much of this work has involved helping organisation become more successful by embracing the lucky mind-set.

In 2001 Wiseman led ''LaughLab'', an international experiment to find the [[world's funniest joke]].<ref name="laughlab">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laughlab.co.uk/|title=laughlab.co.uk|website=www.laughlab.co.uk}}</ref> The winning joke described a caller to emergency services who shoots his friend who has collapsed to comply with the instruction "First, let's make sure he's dead".<ref name="laughlab"/> The experiment also explored regional and cultural variations in humour. These public psychology experiments – such as enlisting people to name, and rate, their favourite gags in the search for the world's funniest jokes – have drawn hundreds of thousands of participants and plenty of press.

In 2011, Wiseman wrote the first section of a collaborative story at Libboo in an attempt to produce a full-length novel in two months. The final result of this experiment, was a novel called, ''Paradox: The Curious Life, and Mysterious Death, of Mr Joseph Wheeler''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Libboo |url=https://www.libboo.com/blog/2011/07/the-mercury-is-rising-fast/ |title=The Mercury is Rising Fast |publisher=Libboo.com |date=19 July 2011 |access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>

In 2013 Richard Wiseman became the first guest curator at Edinburgh's International Science Festival.<ref name="All About RW" /> He participated in the festival with "Richard Wiseman's Beginners Guide to... Climate Change".<ref name="EISF reference">{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/news/environment/earth-and-environment | title=Environment News Earth and Environment | publisher=EDINBURGH INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE FESTIVAL | date=1 March 2012 | access-date=7 March 2014 | author=Pirie, Emma}}</ref> In 2014 he does a repeat of his 'Beginners Guide to' but this time with 3 different talks:

* "Richard Wiseman's Beginners Guide to... Fermat's Last Theorem" with writer and broadcaster [[Simon Singh]].<ref name="EISF Fermats talk">{{cite web | url=http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/events/richard-wisemans-beginners-guide-fermats-la | title=RICHARD WISEMAN'S BEGINNERS GUIDE TO...

Wiseman has also become a content creator on YouTube after uploading a video of the colour changing card trick<ref name="Card Trick Vid">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voAntzB7EwE | title=Colour Changing Card Trick | publisher=Quirkology | date=28 April 2007 | access-date=10 March 2014 | author=Wiseman, Richard}}</ref> in 2007 that has 6. 5 million views as of April 2020. He is best known for his "Bets You Will Always Win" series, which has amassed over 60 million views throughout 10 videos. On 7 January 2014, Wiseman uploaded a video to a new channel called "59 Seconds"<ref name="Quirkology">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Quirkology/ |title=Quirkology |publisher=YouTube |access-date=3 March 2014}}</ref> in promotion of his book of the same name.

Wiseman is a patron of [[Humanists UK]] and appeared in the [[Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People]] Christmas stage show organised by the ''New Humanist''.<ref name="Bha2017">{{cite web|title=Professor Richard Wiseman Psychologist, magician and Patron of the BHA|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/patrons/professor-richard-wiseman/|website=British Humanist Association|access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref> He is also a Distinguished Supporter of [[Humanist Society Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Professor Richard Wiseman announced as latest Distinguished Supporter of Humanist Society Scotland|url=https://www.humanism.scot/what-we-do/news/professor-richard-wiseman-announced-as-latest-distinguished-supporter-of-humanist-society/|website=Humanist Society Scotland|access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2017 Wiseman interviewed [[Richard Dawkins]] at CSIcon Las Vegas 2017 covering topics on [[evolution]], [[extra terrestrials]] and god.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/csicon_las_vegas_2017|title=CSIcon Las Vegas 2017 Conference Report|last=Frazier|first=Kendrick|author-link=Kendrick Frazier|website=www.csicop.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref>

===Edinburgh Secret Society===
The Edinburgh Secret Society organises events for those of a curious disposition. These include verbal, theatrical and experimental presentations intended to inform, entertain and bewilder. This group, as the name states, tends to be low key and has appeared in very few news outlets. The Society motto is 'The king cannot be saved, the king cannot make custard', which is one of many things the group won't openly say the meaning of. It is run by [[Peter Lamont (historian)|Peter Lamont]], friend and colleague, and Richard Wiseman having events involving The Filmhouse, the [[British Science Association]], Edinburgh's World of Illusions, and The [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edinburghsecretsociety.wordpress.com/about-us/ | title=The Edinburgh Secret Society: About Us | access-date=10 March 2014}}</ref> Through the Edinburgh Secret Society Wiseman has found a new following, hosting evenings of irreverent talks and entertainment on topics including self-help and dying. In February 2011 they staged 'An Evening of Death' in A Victorian Anatomy Theatre at the [[University of Edinburgh]], an event that sold out its 250 tickets within minutes.<ref name="All About RW" />

===Teaching===
Wiseman is a professor in "public psychology" at the University of Hertfordshire who divides his time between London and Edinburgh. He is a skeptic who does not believe in extrasensory perception or prayer and who, as a former magician, rejects the purported supernatural experiences reported in seances conducted in darkened rooms where every kind of trickery is available.<ref name="All About RW" />

===Media appearances===
Wiseman's research has been featured on over 150 television programmes, including ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'', ''[[Equinox (TV programme)|Equinox]]'' and ''[[World in Action]]''.<ref name ="wiseman-imdb"/> He is regularly heard on [[BBC Radio 4]], including appearances on ''[[Start the Week]]'', ''[[Midweek (BBC Radio 4)|Midweek]]'' and the ''[[Today programme]]''. Wiseman also makes numerous appearances on some British television shows; in ''[[The Real Hustle]]'' he explains the psychology behind many of the scams and [[confidence trick]]s; in ''Mind Games'' he's a regular team captain of a panel game of puzzles, anagrams and conundrums; and in People Watchers, a hidden-camera show examining human behaviour. Besides being interviewed in several of these television programmes, he was a creative consultant in an episode of Your Bleeped Up Brain and a researcher of the documentary Unlawful Killing.<ref name ="wiseman-imdb"/>

Feature articles about his work have regularly appeared in ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

Wiseman's 2011 book, ''[[Paranormality (book)|Paranormality]]: Why We See What Isn't There'' was electronically self-published in the United States, as Wiseman was told by American publishers there was no interest in [[scepticism]].<ref name=Skepicality160>{{cite web|author=Skepticality|url=http://www.skepticality.com/paranormality/|title=Paranormality|publisher=Skepticality.com|date=5 July 2011|access-date=27 June 2015}}</ref>

In 2011, Wiseman wrote the first section of a collaborative story at Libboo in an attempt to produce a full-length novel in two months. The final result of this experiment, was a novel called, ''Paradox: The Curious Life, and Mysterious Death, of Mr Joseph Wheeler''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Libboo |url=https://www.libboo.com/blog/2011/07/the-mercury-is-rising-fast/ |title=The Mercury is Rising Fast |publisher=Libboo.com |date=19 July 2011 |access-date=29 June 2013}}</ref>

===Focus on the paranormal===
Wiseman is known for his critical examination and frequent debunking of unusual phenomena, including reports of [[paranormal phenomena]]. He is a fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI).<ref name="CSI Fellows and Staff"/> His research has been published in numerous academic journals, reported at various conferences,<ref name="Papers"/> and featured on television.<ref name="wiseman-imdb"/>

In 2004, he took part in a preliminary test of [[Natasha Demkina]], a young Russian woman who claims to have a special vision that allows her to see inside of people's bodies and diagnose illnesses. The test, whose validity has been disputed by Demkina's supporters,<ref name="Demkina_controversy">{{cite news|last=Baty|first=Phil|title=Scientists fail to see eye to eye over girl's 'X-ray vision'|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=192922&sectioncode=26|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=Times HIgher Education|date=10 December 2004}}</ref><ref name=Rennolls>{{cite news|last=Rennolls|first=Keith|title=Distorted visions|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=193121|access-date=20 March 2012|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=17 December 2004}}</ref> was featured in the Discovery Channel documentary, ''The Girl with X-Ray Eyes''.<ref name="hyman-SI">{{cite web|last1=Hyman|first1=Ray|author-link=Ray Hyman|title=Testing Natasha|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/testing_natasha|website=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Center for Skeptical Inquiry|access-date=July 6, 2015}}</ref>

Wiseman has published studies on [[anomalistic psychology]] and the [[psychology of paranormal belief]]. He is the author of the book titled ''[[Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There]]'' (2011) which takes a psychological approach to paranormal phenomena. The book offers its readers tools to investigate paranormal claims using [[QR Code]]s, which Wiseman saw as "exciting use of new media"<ref name=Skepicality160 /> to allow people to see footage and make up their minds themselves.

In 2020, Wiseman, illustrator Jordan Collver and writer Rik Worth created ''Hocus Pocus'', an interactive comic-book series that "promotes skepticism and critical thinking". The first issue focuses on Victorian performer and mind reader [[Washington Irving Bishop]] and pioneer of [[parapsychology]] [[Joseph Banks Rhine]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wiseman |first1=Richard |title=Hocus Pocus: Bringing Skepticism to New Audiences via Comics |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2020/06/hocus-pocus-bringing-skepticism-to-new-audiences-via-comics/ |website=Skeptical Inquirer |publisher=Center for Skeptical Inquiry |access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref> The second issue features the [[Fox sisters]] and [[séances]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hocus Pocus: Magic, Mystery and the Mind |url=http://www.hocuspocuscomic.com/ |website=Hocus Pocus| access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref>

===Dream:ON The App===
Wiseman launched the Dream:ON App at the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]] 2012. It is developed and maintained by YUZA, a mobile experience team based in London. The app is powered by an engine which constantly monitors and adjusts the behaviour of Dream:ON; optimising the experience for the user. When the user enters the [[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement (REM)]] stage of sleep where dreaming is most common, the app delivers unique audio soundscapes which the subconscious is shown to respond to.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dreamonapp.com/faq |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140310095333/http://www.dreamonapp.com/faq |archive-date=10 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

''"We have created a new way of carrying out mass participation experiments. We still know relatively little about the science of dreaming and this app may provide a real breakthrough in changing how we dream, and record and track those dreams."'' – Professor Richard Wiseman

The app is also a social experiment: in the morning it presents users with a graph of their movement during the night, allows users to tag any friends who appeared in their dreams via Facebook and invites them to post a short description of their dreams to an experimental "Dream Bank", creating the world's largest dream experiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamonapp.com/|title=Dream:ON - The App to Influence Your Dreams|website=www.dreamonapp.com|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref>

===The Good Magic Awards===
In collaboration with the [[Good Thinking Society]], Wiseman set up The Good Magic Awards. These awards recognize and reward performers that use magic tricks to improve the lives of people in disadvantaged groups, charities, community groups, hospital patients, and others struggling with physical and psychological challenges.

The awards were announced on March 17, 2020,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/ |title=The Good Magic Awards|publisher= Good Thinking Society |date= 5 May 2020 |access-date=2020-07-06}}</ref> and were  awarded for the first time on May 5, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://goodthinkingsociety.org/good-magic-awards-winners-announced/ |title=The Good Magic Award Winners announced | publisher= Good Thinking Society | date=17 March 2020 | access-date=2020-07-06}}</ref>
