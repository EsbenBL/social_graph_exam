After its establishment in 1936, Ford Foundation shifted its focus from Michigan philanthropic support to five areas of action.  In the 1950 ''Report of the Study of the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program'', the trustees set forth five "areas of action," according to Richard Magat (2012): economic improvements, education, freedom and democracy, human behavior, and world peace.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtvTBwAAQBAJ&q=minority&pg=PA18|title=The Ford Foundation at Work: Philanthropic Choices, Methods and Styles|last=Magat|first=Richard|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9781461329190|language=en}}</ref> These areas of action were identified in a 1949 report by [[Horace Rowan Gaither]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Anna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvBM1BeUwBcC&pg=PA120|title=The Citizen Machine: Governing by Television in 1950s America|publisher=New Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59558-596-7|page=120|access-date=June 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Wilson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFNy-BIExW8C&pg=PA4|title=American Higher Education Transformed, 1940–2005: Documenting the National Discourse|last2=Bender|first2=Thomas|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8018-9585-2|series=American Higher Education Transformed, 1940–2005|page=4|access-date=June 24, 2020}}</ref> 

Since the middle of the 20th century, many of the Ford Foundation's programs have focused on increased under-represented or "minority" group representation in education, science and policy-making. For over eight decades their mission decisively advocates and supports the reduction of poverty and injustice among other values including the maintenance of democratic values, promoting engagement with other nations, and sustaining human progress and achievement at home and abroad.<ref name=":0" />

The Ford Foundation is one of the primary foundations offering grants that support and maintain diversity in higher education with fellowships for pre-doctoral, dissertation, and post-doctoral scholarship to increase diverse representation among Native Americans, African Americans, Latin Americans, and other under-represented Asian and Latino sub-groups throughout the U.S. academic labor market.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith |first=Daryl|year=1996|title=Achieving Faculty Diversity.

==History==

The foundation was established January 15, 1936,<ref name="Overview" /> in Michigan by Edsel Ford (president of the [[Ford Motor Company]]) and two other executives "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare."<ref name="bak">{{cite book| title=Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire| last=Bak| first=Richard| date=3 July 2003| page=217| isbn=978-0471234876}}</ref> During its early years, the foundation operated in Michigan under the leadership of Ford family members and their associates and supported the [[Henry Ford Hospital]] and the [[The Henry Ford|Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village]], among other organizations.

After the deaths of Edsel Ford in 1943 and Henry Ford in 1947, the presidency of the foundation fell to Edsel's eldest son, [[Henry Ford II]]. It quickly became clear that the foundation would become the largest philanthropic organization in the world. The board of trustees then commissioned the Gaither Study Committee to chart the foundation's future. The committee, headed by California attorney [[H. Rowan Gaither]], recommended that the foundation become an international philanthropic organization dedicated to the advancement of human welfare and "urged the foundation to focus on solving humankind's most pressing problems, whatever they might be, rather than work in any particular field...." The report was endorsed by the foundation's board of trustees, and they subsequently voted to move the foundation to New York City in 1953.<ref name="Overview" /><ref name="philanthropynews">{{cite news|url=http://www.philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/michigan-attorney-general-looks-into-policies-of-ford-foundation|title=Michigan Attorney General Looks Into Policies of Ford Foundation|date=11 April 2006|work=Philanthropy News Digest|access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fordfound.org/newsroom/view_news_detail.cfm?news_index=166|title=Ford Foundation website press release|date=2005-12-02|access-date=2007-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905140444/http://www.fordfound.org/newsroom/view_news_detail.cfm?news_index=166|archive-date=2007-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Ford Foundation's first international field office opened in 1952 in New Delhi, India.

The board of directors decided to diversify the foundation's portfolio and gradually divested itself of its substantial Ford Motor Company stock between 1955 and 1974.<ref name="Overview" /> This divestiture allowed Ford Motor to become a [[public company]]. Finally, Henry Ford II resigned from his trustee's role in a surprise move in December 1976. In his resignation letter, he cited his dissatisfaction with the foundation holding on to their old programs, large staff and what he saw as [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] undertones in the foundation's work.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/12/archives/henry-ford-2d-quits-foundation-urges-appreciation-for-capitalism.html| author = Maurice, Caroll | title=Henry Ford 2d Quits Foundation, Urges Appreciation for Capitalism| newspaper=The New York Times| date=12 January 1977 | access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/12/archives/foundation-woes-the-saga-of-henry-ford-ii-part-two-ford-ford.html| author = Weymouth, Lally | title=FOUNDATION WOES THE SAGA OF HENRY FORD II: PART TWO| newspaper=The New York Times| date=12 March 1978 | access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref> In February 2019, Henry Ford III was elected to the Foundation's Board of Trustees, becoming the first [[Ford family]] member to serve on the board since his grandfather resigned in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news/ford-foundation-elects-henry-ford-iii-to-board-of-trustees/|title=Ford Foundation elects Henry Ford III to Board of Trustees|website=Ford Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/02/22/henry-ford-iii-foundation-trustee/2940596002/|title=First Ford since 1976 named to Ford Foundation board|last=Rubin|first=Neal|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>

For many years, the foundation topped annual lists compiled by the [[Foundation Center]] of US foundations with the most assets and the highest annual giving. The foundation has fallen a few places in those lists in recent years, especially with the establishment of the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] in 2000. As of May 4, 2013, the foundation was second in terms of assets<ref name="statements" /> and tenth in terms of annual grant giving.<ref name="giving">{{cite web|url=http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/topfunders/top100giving.html|title=Top 100 U.S. Foundations by Total Giving|date=26 April 2014|publisher=Foundation Center|access-date=2014-05-11}}</ref>

=== Archives ===
In 2012, stating that it is not a research library, the foundation transferred its archives from New York City to the [[Rockefeller Archive Center]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].<ref name="archives">{{cite press release|url=http://www.rockarch.org/collections/news/fordnews.php|title=Rockefeller Archive Center to House Ford Foundation Records|publisher=Rockefeller Archive Center|date=9 April 2012|access-date=2014-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528154557/http://rockarch.org/collections/news/fordnews.php|archive-date=28 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Major grants and initiatives==

Based on recommendations made by the Gaither Study Committee and embraced by the foundation's board of trustees in 1949, the foundation expanded its grant making to include support for higher education, the arts, economic development, civil rights, and the environment, among other areas.

=== Media and public broadcasting ===
In 1951, the foundation made its first grant to support the development of the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), then known as [[National Educational Television]] (NET), which went on the air in 1952.<ref name="behrens">{{cite news| url=http://www.current.org/funding/funding0509ford.shtml| title=Ford outlays seek to broaden 'public media'| last=Behrens| first=Steve| date=16 May 2005| work=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]]| access-date=2014-05-14| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515155106/http://www.current.org/funding/funding0509ford.shtml| archive-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> These grants continued, and in 1969 the foundation gave US$1 million to the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]] to help create and launch ''[[Sesame Street]]''.<ref name="imbd">{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063951/companycredits| title=Sesame Street: Company Credits| website=[[Internet Movie Database]]| access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref>

=== Arts and free speech ===
The foundation underwrote the [[Fund for the Republic]] in the 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, the foundation provided arts and humanities fellowships that supported the work of figures like [[Josef Albers]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Herbert Blau]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Maurice Valency]], [[Robert Lowell]], and [[Margaret Mead]]. In 1961, [[Kofi Annan]] received an educational grant from the foundation to finish his studies at [[Macalester College]] in St. Paul, Minnesota.<ref name="annan">{{cite web| url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/projects/commemorative-chairs/annan| title=Kofi Annan| publisher=Roosevelt Institute| access-date=2014-05-14| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515022219/http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/projects/commemorative-chairs/annan| archive-date=2014-05-15}}</ref>

Under its "Program for Playwrights", the foundation helped to support writers in professional regional theaters such as San Francisco's [[Actor's Workshop]] and offered similar help to  Houston's [[Alley Theatre]] and Washington's [[Arena Stage]].<ref name="fowler">{{cite journal| last=Fowler| first=Keith Franklin| year=1969| title=A History of the San Francisco Actor's Workshop| volume=I-II| page=830| publisher=Yale School of Drama Doctor of Fine Arts Dissertations, Robert B.

=== Law school clinics and civil rights litigation ===
In 1968, the foundation began disbursing $12 million to persuade [[law school]]s to make "law school clinics" part of their curriculum.  Clinics were intended to give practical experience in law practice while providing [[pro bono]] representation to the poor. Conservative critic [[Heather Mac Donald]] contends that the financial involvement of the foundation instead changed the clinics' focus from giving students practical experience to engaging in leftwing advocacy.<ref name="macdonald">{{cite news| first=Heather| last=MacDonald| title=Clinical, Cynical| newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]| date=11 January 2006| page=A14 | access-date=2017-01-11| url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/clinical-cynical-1617.html}} Mac Donald's characterization of clinics as primarily vehicles for leftwing advocacy was disputed in several letters to the editor published two weeks later. See "Letters to the Editor" (25 January 2006). Wall Street Journal. p. A13.</ref>

Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, the foundation expanded into civil rights litigation, granting $18 million to civil rights litigation groups.<ref name="CSPCS">{{cite web|url=http://cspcs.sanford.duke.edu/sites/default/files/descriptive/civil_rights_litigation.pdf|title=Case 36: Social Movements and Civil Rights Litigation", Ford Foundation 1967|last=Schindler|first=Steven|publisher=Center for Strategic Philanthropy & Civil Society, [[Sanford School of Public Policy]]|access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref> The [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] was incorporated in 1967 with a US$2.2 million grant from the foundation.<ref name="CSPCS" /> In the same year, the foundation funded the establishment of the Southwest Council of La Raza, the predecessor of the [[National Council of La Raza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf858006dc/admin/|title=Guide to the National Council of La Raza Records,1968-1996|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref> In 1972, the foundation provided a three-year US$1.2 million grant to the [[Native American Rights Fund]].<ref name="CSPCS" /> The same year, the [[Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund]] opened with funding from numerous organizations, including the foundation.<ref name="CSPCS" /><ref name="latino">{{cite web|url=http://latinojustice.org/about/history|title=Four Decades of Protecting Latino Civil Rights|publisher=Latino Justice|access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref> In 1974, the foundation contributed funds to the [[Southwest Voter Registration Education Project]]<ref name="acosta">{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/wcs01|title=Southwest Voter Registration Education Project|last=Acosta|first=Teresa Palomo|date=2010-06-15|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref> and the [[Latino Institute]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== New York City public school decentralization ===
In 1967 and 1968, the foundation provided financial support for decentralization and community control of public schools in New York City. Decentralization in Ocean Hill–Brownsville led to the firing of some white teachers and administrators, which provoked a [[New York City teachers' strike of 1968|citywide teachers' strike]] led by the [[United Federation of Teachers]].<ref name="Podair2001">{{cite web| last=Podair| first=Jerald E.| title=The Ocean Hill-Brownsville Crisis: New York's Antigone| url=http://www.gothamcenter.org/festival/2001/confpapers/podair.pdf| work=Like Strangers: Blacks, Whites and New York City's Ocean Hill-Brownsville Crisis| publisher=[[Mike Wallace (historian)#Gotham Center|Gotham Center]]| access-date=2014-05-14| date=6 October 2001| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414233032/http://www.gothamcenter.org/festival/2001/confpapers/podair.pdf| archive-date=14 April 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Microcredit ===
In 1976, the foundation helped launch the [[Grameen Bank]], which offers small loans to the rural poor of Bangladesh. The Grameen Bank and its founder [[Muhammad Yunus]] were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2006 for pioneering [[microcredit]].<ref name="nobel">{{cite press release|  url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/press.html| title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006| publisher=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]| date=13 October 2006| access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref>

=== In vitro fertilisation ===
Between 1969 and 1978, the foundation was the biggest funder for research into [[In vitro fertilisation]] in the United Kingdom, which led to the first baby, [[Louise Brown]] born from the technique. The Ford Foundation provided $1,170,194 towards the research.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rbms.2015.04.006 |pmid=28299365 |pmc=5341286 |title=The Oldham Notebooks: An analysis of the development of IVF 1969-1978.

=== International leadership ===
In 2001, the foundation launched the International Fellowships Program (IFP) with a 12-year, $280 million grant, the largest in its history. IFP is entering its concluding phase. The final cohort has been selected, and the program will conclude in 2013. Fellows represent historically disadvantaged groups from outside the United States. IFP has identified nearly 4,350 emerging leaders.

=== Israel ===
In April 2011, the foundation announced that it will cease its funding for programs in Israel as of 2013. It has provided US$40 million to [[nongovernmental organizations]] in Israel since 2003 exclusively through the [[New Israel Fund]] (NIF), in the areas of advancing civil and human rights, helping Arab citizens in Israel gain equality and promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. The grants from the foundation are roughly a third of NIF's donor-advised giving, which totals about US$15 million a year.<ref name="guttman">{{cite news| url=http://forward.com/articles/136816/| title=Ford Foundation, Big Funder of Israeli NGOs, Pulling Out| last=Guttman| first=Nathan| work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]| date=6 April 2011| access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref>

In June 2020, Ford Foundation decided to raise $1 billion through a combination of 30 and 50- year bonds.

== Criticisms and reforms ==
=== Mission-related investments ===
Ranked No. 24 on the Forbes 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list, the Ford Foundation utilized its endowment to invest in innovative and sustainable change leadership shifting the model of grant-making in the 21st century. According to Forbes, "Ford spends between $500 million and $550 million a year to support social justice work around the world. But last year, it also pledged to plow up to $1 billion of its overall $12.5 billion endowment over the next decade into [[Impact investing|impact investing via mission-related investments (MRIs)]] that generate both financial and social returns."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40525515/how-the-ford-foundation-is-investing-in-change|title=How The Ford Foundation Is Investing In Change|date=2018-03-01|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/ford-foundation-outlines-new-grantmaking-approach|title=Ford Foundation Outlines New Grantmaking Approach|last=Center|first=Foundation|work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}</ref> Foundation President Darren Walker wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times that the grant-making philanthropy of institutions like the Ford Foundation "must not only be generosity, but justice."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/opinion/why-giving-back-isnt-enough.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=1|title=Opinion {{!}} Why Giving Back Isn't Enough|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}</ref> The Ford Foundation seeks to address "the underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering" to grapple with and intervene in "''how'' and ''why''" inequality persists.<ref name=":1" />

=== Native Arts and Culture Foundation endowment repatriation ===
{{See also|Financial endowment#Ethics and endowment repatriation}}
In 2007, the Ford Foundation co-founded the independent [[Native Arts and Culture Foundation]] by providing a portion of the new foundation's [[financial endowment|endowment]] out of the Ford Foundation's own. This decision to repatriate a portion of the Ford Foundation's endowment came after self-initiated research into the Ford Foundation's history of support of Native and Indigenous artists and communities. The results of this research indicated "the inadequacy of philanthropic support for Native arts and artists", and related feedback from an unnamed Native leader that "once big foundations put the stuff in place for an Indian program, then it is not usually funded very well. It lasts as long as the program officer who had an interest and then goes away" and recommended that an independent endowment be established and that "[n]ative leadership is crucial".<ref>{{cite web |title=Native Arts and Cultures: Research, Growth and Opportunities for Philanthropic Support |url=https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/1758/2010-native-arts-and-cultures.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513142508/https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/1758/2010-native-arts-and-cultures.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-05-13 |publisher=Ford Foundation |access-date=13 May 2019 |date=2010}}</ref>

===Relationship with the United States Government ===

The foundation was accused of being funded by the US government.<ref name="Roland 2012">{{cite web| first=Naomi Verbong| last=Roland| url=http://www.transatlanticperspectives.org/entry.php?rec=130| title=Funding Transatlantic Exchange between the Arts and Politics| publisher=Transatlanitc Perspectives| date=3 July 2013| access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref><ref name="epstein">{{cite book| first=Jason| last=Epstein| url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1967/apr/20/the-cia-and-the-intellectuals/?pagination=false| title=The CIA and the Intellectuals| work=[[New York Review of Books]]| date=20 April 1967| access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref>  [[John J. McCloy]], the foundation's chairman from 1958–1965, knowingly employed numerous US intelligence agents and, based on the premise that a relationship with the CIA was inevitable, set up a three-person committee responsible for dealing with its requests.<ref name="Saunders 1999">{{cite book| last=Saunders| first=Frances Stonor| title=The cultural cold war: the CIA and the world of arts and letters| date=1 April 2001| publisher=New Press| location=New York| isbn=978-1565846647| pages=138–139| quote=Farfield was by no means exceptional in its incestuous character. This was the nature of power in America at this time. The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America's—and, by definition, their own—interests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP's ambition. The prize was a trusteeship on either the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation, both of which were conscious instruments of covert US policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.}}</ref>{{sfn|Saunders| 2001| p=141| ps=: "Addressing the concerns of some of the foundation's executives, who felt that its reputation for integrity and independence was being undermined by involvement with the CIA, McCloy argued that if they failed to cooperate, the CIA would simply penetrate the foundation quietly by recruiting or inserting staff at the lower levels. McCloy's answer to this problem was to create an administrative unit within the Ford Foundation specifically to deal with the CIA. Headed by McCloy and two foundation officers, this three-man committee had to be consulted every time the Agency wanted to use the foundation, either as a pass-through, or as cover."}} Writer and activist [[Arundhati Roy]] connects the foundation, along with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], with supporting imperialist efforts by the U.S. government during the [[Cold War]]. Roy links the Ford Foundation's establishment of an economics course at the Indonesian University with aligning students with the [[30 September Movement |1965 coup]] that installed [[Suharto]] as president. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Capitalism: A Ghost Story|date=2014|last=Roy|first=Arundhati|publisher=Haymarket|isbn=9781608463855| pages=27–28| quote=By the 1950s the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation, funding several NGOs and international educational institutions, began to work as quasi-extensions of the US government, which at the time was toppling democratically elected government in Latin America, Iran, and Indonesia. (That was also around the time it made its entry into India, then non-aligned but clearly tilting toward the Soviet Union.) The Ford Foundation established a US-style economics course at the Indonesian University. Elite Indonesian students, trained in counterinsurgency by US army officers, played a crucial part in the 1965 CIA-backed coup in Indonesia that brought General Suharto to power. He repaid his mentors by slaughtering hundreds of thousands of communist rebels.}}</ref>

At the height of the Cold War, the Ford Foundation was involved in several sensitive covert operations. One of these involved the Fighting Group Against Inhumanity. Based in West Berlin, the Fighting Group  undertook a range of missions in the East Zone, ranging from intelligence gathering to sabotage. It was funded and controlled by the CIA. In 1950, the U.S. government decided that the Fighting Group needed to bolster its legitimacy as a credible independent organization, so the International Rescue Committee was recruited to act as its advocate. One component of this project was convincing the Ford Foundation to issue a grant to the Fighting Group. With the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, the Ford Foundation was persuaded to give the Fighting Group a grant of $150,000. A press release announcing the grant pointed to the assistance given by the Fighting Group to “carefully screened” defectors to come to the West. The National Committee for a Free Europe, a CIA proprietary, actually administered the grant. (Chester, Covert Network, pp. 89-94.)

=== 2005 Michigan Attorney General investigation ===
In 2005, Michigan Attorney General [[Mike Cox (U.S. politician)|Mike Cox]] began a probe of the foundation. Though the foundation is headquartered in New York City, it is chartered in [[Michigan]], giving that state some jurisdiction. Cox focused on its governance, potential conflicts of interest among board members, and what he viewed as its poor record of giving to charities in Michigan. Between 1998 and 2002, the foundation gave Michigan charities about US$2.5 million per year, far less than many other charities its size.

=== Gender roles and feminist theory ===
American author, conservative philosopher, and critic of [[feminism]] [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], criticized The Ford Foundation in her book ''The War Against Boys'' (2000) as well as other institutions in education and government.<ref name="sommers">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&q=ford+foundation|title=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women|last=Sommers|first=Christina Hoff|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=1994|isbn=978-0-671-79424-8|pages=53, 82}}</ref> Sommers alleged that the Ford Foundation funded feminist ideologies that marginalize boys and men. A Washington Post book review by E. Anthony Rotundo, author of ''"American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity from the Revolution to the Modern Era''," alleges that Sommers "persistently misrepresents scholarly debate, [and] ignores evidence that contradicts her assertions" about a gender war against boys and men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/books/reviews/waragainstboys0703.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com: The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref> Spanish judge {{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Serrano Castro|es}} made similar claims to Sommers in his 2012 book ''The Dictatorship of Gender''.<ref name="castro">{{cite book|title=La dictadura de género|last=Castro|first=Francisco Serrano|publisher={{Interlanguage link multi|Grupo Almuzara|es}}|isbn=978-84-15338-81-9}}</ref> These criticisms argue that the Ford Foundation is advancing a liberal agenda.

=== Criteria for Palestinian grantmaking ===
In 2003, the foundation was critiqued by US news service [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], among others, for supporting Palestinian nongovernmental organizations that were accused of promoting [[antisemitism]] at the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|2001 World Conference Against Racism]]. Under pressure by several members of Congress, chief among them Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]], the foundation apologized and then prohibited the promotion of "violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruction of any state" among its grantees. This move itself sparked protest among university provosts and various non-profit groups on free speech issues.<ref name="sherman">{{cite magazine|last=Sherman|first=Scott|date=5 June 2006|title=Target Ford|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/target-ford|magazine=[[The Nation]]|access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref>

The foundation's partnership with the [[New Israel Fund]] (NIF), which began in 2003, was criticized regarding its choice of mostly progressive grantees and causes. This criticism peaked after the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, where some nongovernmental organizations funded by the foundation backed resolutions equating Israeli policies with [[apartheid]]. In response, the Ford Foundation tightened its criteria for funding. In 2011, [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] Israeli politicians and organizations such as [[NGO Monitor]] and [[Im Tirtzu]] claimed the NIF and other recipients of Ford Foundation grants supported the delegitimization of Israel.<ref name="guttman" />

== Ford Foundation Building ==
Completed in 1968 by the firm of [[Roche-Dinkeloo]], the [[Ford Foundation Building|Ford Foundation Center for Social Justice]] in New York City (originally the Ford Foundation Building) was the first large-scale architectural building in the country to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] was designed with the notion of having urban [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] accessible to all and is an example of the application in architecture of [[environmental psychology]]. The building was recognized in 1968 by the [[Architectural Record]] as "a new kind of urban space". This design concept was used by others for many of the indoor shopping malls and skyscrapers built in subsequent decades. The [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated the building a landmark in 1997.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barron|first=James|date=1997-10-22|title=3 Buildings Are Declared Landmarks|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/22/nyregion/3-buildings-are-declared-landmarks.html|access-date=2020-06-24|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
