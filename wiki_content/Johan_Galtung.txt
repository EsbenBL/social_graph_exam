'''Johan Vincent Galtung''' (born 24 October 1930) is a Norwegian [[sociologist]], and the principal founder of the discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].<ref>[[John David Brewer|John D. Brewer]], ''Peace processes: a sociological approach'', p. 7, Polity Press, 2010</ref>

He was the main founder of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] (PRIO) in 1959 and served as its first director until 1970. He also established the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'' in 1964. In 1969 he was appointed to the world's first [[Chair (academic)|chair]] in peace and conflict studies, at the [[University of Oslo]]. He resigned his Oslo professorship in 1977 and has since held professorships at several other universities; from 1993 to 2000 he taught as Distinguished Professor of Peace Studies at the [[University of Hawaii]]. He has been based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], where he was the first [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Tun Mahathir]] Professor of Global Peace at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] until 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iais.org.my/e/index.php/events-sp-1744003054/past-events/517-public-lecture-seeking-peace-from-resolving-conflict-between-buddhists-and-muslims-in-myanmar-and-sri-lanka-by-prof-dr-johan-galtung.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603050551/http://www.iais.org.my/e/index.php/events-sp-1744003054/past-events/517-public-lecture-seeking-peace-from-resolving-conflict-between-buddhists-and-muslims-in-myanmar-and-sri-lanka-by-prof-dr-johan-galtung.html |archive-date=2015-06-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:09252012GaltungITESMCCM02.JPG|thumb|Galtung speaking at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]].]]
Galtung was born in [[Oslo]]. He earned the [[cand. real.]]<ref name="coe.int">{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/d/Com/Dossiers/Events/2002-10-interkultureller-Dialog/CV_Galtung.asp |title=CV_Galtung |publisher=Coe.int |access-date=2013-11-18}}</ref> degree in mathematics  at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1956, and a year later completed the [[Magister (degree)#Denmark and Norway|mag. art.]] (PhD)<ref name="coe.int"/> degree in sociology at the same university.<ref name="nbl"/> Galtung received the first of thirteen [[honorary doctorate]]s in 1975.<ref name=Galtung-Institut>{{cite web|url=https://www.galtung-institut.de/en/home/johan-galtung//|title=Johan Galtung|access-date= 4 April 2017}}</ref>

Galtung's father and paternal grandfather were both [[physician]]s. The Galtung name has its origins in [[Hordaland]], where his paternal grandfather was born. Nevertheless, his mother, Helga Holmboe, was born in central Norway, in [[Trøndelag]], while his father was born in [[Østfold]], in the south. Galtung has been married twice, and has two children by his first wife [[Ingrid Eide]], Harald Galtung and Andreas Galtung, and two by his second wife Fumiko Nishimura, Irene Galtung and Fredrik Galtung.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://folk.uio.no/ingeba/family/1554.htm |title=Genealogical data for Johan Galtung |access-date=2007-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803201324/http://folk.uio.no/ingeba/family/1554.htm |archive-date=2008-08-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==

Upon receiving his mag. art. degree, Galtung moved to [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City]], where he taught for five semesters as an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology.<ref name="Life of Johan Galtung in Danish">[http://www.visdomsnettet.dk/a-402-1/ Life of Johan Galtung (in Danish)]</ref> In 1959, Galtung returned to Oslo, where he founded the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)]]. He served as the institute's director until 1969, and saw the institute develop from a department within the [[Norwegian Institute of Social Research]] into an independent research institute with enabling funds from the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education]].<ref name="PRIO biography for Johan Galtung">{{Cite web |url=http://www.prio.no/page/Project_detail/Staff_alpha_ALL/9244/47062.html |title=PRIO biography for Johan Galtung |access-date=2007-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528063552/http://www.prio.no/page/Project_detail/Staff_alpha_ALL/9244/47062.html |archive-date=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1964, Galtung led PRIO to establish the first academic journal devoted to Peace Studies: the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]''.<ref name="PRIO biography for Johan Galtung"/> In the same year, he assisted in the founding of the [[International Peace Research Association]].<ref>[http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/ipra/about/history.html History of the IPRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203152016/http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/ipra/about/history.html |date=2011-12-03 }}</ref> In 1969 he left PRIO for a position as professor of peace and conflict research at the [[University of Oslo]], a position he held until 1978.<ref name="PRIO biography for Johan Galtung"/>

He then served as the director general of the International University Centre in [[Dubrovnik]], as well as helping to found and serving as the president of the World Future Studies Federation.<ref name="E. Boulding 1982: 323">(E. Boulding 1982: 323)</ref><ref name="future">{{cite book |last1=Andersson |first1=Jenny |title=The future of the world: Futurology, futurists, and the struggle for the post-Cold War imagination |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198814337}}</ref> He has also held visiting positions at other universities, including [[Santiago, Chile]], the [[United Nations University]] in [[Geneva]], and at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[University of Hawaii]].<ref>[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&a=97294&previousRenderType=2 ''Dagens Nyheter'' 2003-01-15.]</ref> He has served at so many universities that he has "probably taught more students on more campuses around the world than any other contemporary sociologist".<ref name="E.

In December 2010, Galtung gave a lecture entitled "Breaking the Cycle of Violent Conflict" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.

Galtung is a prolific researcher, having made contributions to many fields in sociology. He has published more than 1000 articles and over 100 books.<ref name="transcend.org">[http://www.transcend.org/t_database/members.php?showcv=1&idm=112 TRANSCEND biography on Johan Galtung]</ref> Economist and fellow peace researcher [[Kenneth Boulding]] has said of Galtung that his "output is so large and so varied that it is hard to believe that it comes from a human".<ref name="K. Boulding 1977: 75">(K.

In 2014 he was appointed as the first Tun Mahathir Professor of Global Peace at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]. The chair is supported by the Perdana Global Peace Foundation and is named for its founder and chairman, Malaysia's fourth prime minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. The aim of the chair is to "create greater awareness, promotion and advocacy of global peace including the protection of human rights and criminalization of war."<ref>[http://www.iium.edu.my/aikol/pgpf TUN MAHATHIR PERDANA GLOBAL PEACE FOUNDATION (PGPF) CHAIR FOR GLOBAL PEACE], [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]</ref>

==Mediation for peace==
Galtung experienced [[World War II]] in German-occupied Norway, and as a 12-year-old saw his father arrested by the [[Nazi]]s. By 1951 he was already a committed peace mediator, and elected to do 18 months of social service in place of his obligatory military service. After 12 months, Galtung insisted that the remainder of his social service be spent in activities relevant to peace, to which the Norwegian authorities responded by sending him to prison, where he served six months.<ref name="Life of Johan Galtung in Danish"/>

Because Galtung's academic research is clearly intended to promote peace, in 1957, after mediating in Charlottesville, his sociological work shifted toward more concrete and constructive peace mediation. In 1993, he co-founded TRANSCEND: A Peace Development Environment Network,<ref name=transcend>[http://www.transcend.org/ Transcend.org]</ref><ref name=INTERNATIONALRELATIONS>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/05/27/interview-johan-galtung/|title=Interview - Johan Galtung|access-date=16 November 2014}}</ref> an organization for [[conflict transformation]] by peaceful means. There are four traditional but unsatisfactory ways in which conflicts between two parties are handled:
# A wins, B loses;
# B wins, A loses;
# the solution is postponed because neither A nor B feels ready to end the conflict;
# a confused compromise is reached, which neither A nor B are happy with.
Galtung tries to break with these four unsatisfactory ways of handling a conflict by finding a "fifth way", where both A and B feel that they win, when both give in expecting nothing but peace. This method also insists that basic human needs – such as survival, physical well-being, liberty, and identity – be respected.<ref name="The Basic Human Needs Approach">[https://www.transcend.org/galtung/papers/The%20Basic%20Needs%20Approach.pdf]</ref>

==Major ideas==
Galtung first conceptualized [[peacebuilding]] by calling for systems that would create sustainable peace. The peacebuilding structures needed to address the root causes of conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pbso/pbun.shtml PEACEBUILDING & THE UNITED NATIONS] Peacebuilding Support Office, United Nations</ref>

Galtung has held several significant positions in international [[research]] councils and has been an advisor to several [[international organisations]]. Since 2004 he has been a member of the Advisory Council of the [[Committee for a Democratic UN]].

He has also written many [[empirical]] and [[theoretical]] articles, dealing most frequently with issues of peace and conflict research. His work is distinguished by his unique perspective as well as the importance he attributes to innovation and [[interdisciplinarity]].

He is one of the authors of an influential account of [[news values]] which are the factors which determine what coverage is given to what stories in the [[news]]. Galtung also originated the concept of [[Peace Journalism]], which is increasingly influential in [[media studies|communications and media studies]].

Galtung is strongly associated with the following concepts:
* [[Structural violence]] – widely defined as the systematic ways in which a regime prevents individuals from achieving their full potential. Institutionalized racism and sexism are examples of this.
* [[Negative peace|Negative]] vs. [[positive peace]] – popularized the concept that peace may be more than just the absence of overt violent conflict (negative peace), and will likely include a range of relationships up to a state where nations (or any groupings in conflict) might have collaborative and supportive relationships (positive peace). Though he did not cite them, these terms were, in fact, previously defined and discussed in 1907 by  [https://books.google.ca/books?id=gVwrAVfjYJMC&dq=william+james+positive+peace&source=gbs_navlinks_s Jane Addams] and in 1963 by [[Letter from Birmingham Jail|Martin Luther King Jr.]]
* [[Conflict triangle]]

He has also distinguished himself in public debates concerning, among other things, less-developed countries, defence issues, and the Norwegian EU debate. In 1987 he was given the [[Right Livelihood Award]]. He developed the TRANSCEND Method described above. Economist and fellow peace researcher [[Kenneth Boulding]] has said of Galtung that his "output is so large and so varied that it is hard to believe that it comes from a human".<ref name="K. Boulding 1977: 75"/>

===United States as a republic and empire===
For Johan Galtung, the US is simultaneously a [[republic]] and an [[empire]], a distinction he believes is highly relevant. The US is on one hand loved for its republican qualities, and on the other loathed by its enemies abroad for its perceived military aggressions. Its republican qualities include its work ethic and dynamism, productivity and creativity, the idea of freedom, or liberty, and a pioneering spirit. On the other hand, its military and political manipulation are censured for their aggressiveness, arrogance, violence, hypocrisy and self-righteousness, as well as the US public ignorance of other cultures and extreme materialism.<ref>Article by Dr Zeki Ergas [http://www.stwr.org/united-states-of-america/out-of-sync-with-the-world-some-thoughts-on-the-coming-decline-and-fall-of-the-american-empire.html "Out of Sync with the world: Some Thoughts on the Coming Decline and Fall of the American Empire".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220005456/http://www.stwr.org/united-states-of-america/out-of-sync-with-the-world-some-thoughts-on-the-coming-decline-and-fall-of-the-american-empire.html |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>

In 1973, Galtung criticised the "structural fascism" of the US and other Western countries that make war to secure materials and markets, stating: "Such an economic system is called [[capitalism]], and when it's spread in this way to other countries it's called imperialism", and has praised [[Fidel Castro]] for "break[ing] free of imperialism's iron grip". Galtung has stated that the US is a "killer country" guilty of "neo-fascist [[state terrorism]]" and compared the US to [[Nazi Germany]] for bombing Kosovo during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].<ref name="The Peace Racket">[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_3_peace_racket.html The Peace Racket] by Bruce Bawer, City Journal, Summer 2007.</ref><ref name="barbarians"/>

According to Galtung, the US empire causes "unbearable suffering and resentment" because the "exploiters/ killers/ dominators/ alienators, and those who support the US Empire because of perceived benefits" are engaging in "unequal, non-sustainable, exchange patterns".  In an article published in 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will "decline and fall" by 2020. He expanded on this hypothesis in his 2009 book titled ''The Fall of the US Empire - and Then What? Successors, Regionalization or Globalization? US Fascism or US Blossoming?''.<ref>{{YouTube|rDUEJb1uz_I|Prof. J. Galtung: 'US empire will fall by 2020'}} Russia Today.</ref><ref name=USempirefall>[http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/SAJT/forum/meet/2004/Galtung_USempireFall.html On the Coming Decline and Fall of the US Empire] by Johan Galtung, Transnational Foundation and Peace and Research (TFF), January 28, 2004.</ref>

However, the decline of the US empire did not imply a decline of the US republic, and the "relief from the burden of Empire control and maintenance...could lead to a blossoming of the US Republic". Elaborating on the radio and television program ''[[Democracy Now]]'', he stated that he loved the American republic and hated the [[American imperialism|American empire]]. He added that many Americans had thanked him for this statement on his lecture tours, because it helped them resolve the conflict between their love for their country and their displeasure with its foreign policy.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/6/15/i_love_the_us_republic_and Galtung on ''Democracy Now, 2010'']</ref>

===Predictions===
Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Galtung has made several predictions of when the United States will no longer be a [[superpower]], a stance that has attracted some controversy. In an article published in 2004, he lists 14 'contradictions' that would cause the 'decline and fall' of the US empire.<ref name=USempirefall/>  After the beginning of the [[Iraq War]], he revised his prediction of the "downfall of the US-Empire", seeing it as more imminent.<ref>[http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/utenriks/article7953.ece Amerikas imperium går under innen 2020] ''Adressa'' September 23, 2004.</ref> He claims the US will go through a phase as a fascist dictatorship on its path down, and that the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] is a symptom of this. He claims the election of [[George W. Bush]] cost the US empire five years – although he admits that this estimate was set a bit arbitrarily. He now sets the date for the end of the American Empire at 2020, but not the American Republic. Like Great Britain, Russia and France, he says the American Republic will be better off without the Empire.

==Criticism==

;Criticism by Bruce Bawer and Barbara Kay
During the course of his career, some of Galtung statements and views have drawn criticism, most notably his criticism of Western countries during and after the [[Cold War]] and what his critics perceived as a positive attitude to the [[Soviet Union]], [[Cuba]] and [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. A 2007 article by [[Bruce Bawer]] published in ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' magazine<ref name="The Peace Racket" /> and a subsequent article in February 2009 by [[Barbara Kay]] in the ''[[National Post]]''<ref name=barbarians>[https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1299901 Barbarians within the gate] by Barbara Kay, National Post, February 18, 2009.</ref> criticised some of Galtung's statements, including his opinion that while Communist China was "repressive in a certain liberal sense", [[Mao Zedong]] was "endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood". Calling Galtung a "lifelong enemy of freedom", Bawer claimed that Galtung discouraged Hungarian resistance against the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion in 1956]], and criticized his description in 1974 of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] as "persecuted elite personages".

The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' accused Galtung in May 2012 of antisemitism for (1) suggesting the possibility of a link between the [[2011 Norway attacks]] and Israel's intelligence agency [[Mossad]]; (2) maintaining that "six Jewish companies" control 96% of world media; (3) identifying what he contends are ironic similarities between the banking firm [[Goldman Sachs]] and the conspiratorial antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''; and (4) theorizing that although not justified, antisemitism in post–[[World War I]] [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] was a predictable consequence of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]] holding influential positions.<ref name=Haaretz>{{cite news|last=Aderet|first=Ofer|title=Pioneer of global peace studies hints at link between Norway massacre and Mossad|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/pioneer-of-global-peace-studies-hints-at-link-between-norway-massacre-and-mossad-1.427385|newspaper=Haaretz|date=30 April 2012|access-date=7 September 2012}}</ref> As a result of such statements, in May 2012 TRANSCEND International, an organisation co-founded by Galtung, released a statement attempting to clarify his opinions.<ref>{{cite web|title=TRANSCEND International's Statement Concerning the Label of anti-Semitism Against Johan Galtung|url=https://www.transcend.org/galtung/statement-may-2012/|publisher=TRANSCEND International|access-date=8 September 2012}}</ref> On August 8, 2012, the World Peace Academy in [[Basel]], Switzerland announced it was suspending Galtung from its organization, citing what it posited were his "reckless and offensive statements to questions that are specifically sensitive for Jews."<ref>{{Cite news |author=Weinthal, Benjamin |title=Swiss group suspends 'anti-Semitic' Norway scholar |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=280726 |newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=August 9, 2012 |access-date=August 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69pi9Ogzd?url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=280726 |archive-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Galtung himself has vehemently repudiated the above attacks as [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWsIoXzXIAA2ZB6.jpg "smearing and libel"] in a published statement<ref>{{Cite web|title = STELLUNGNAHME/035: Professor Galtung zu den Vorwürfen des Antisemitismus (Johan Galtung)|url = http://www.schattenblick.de/infopool/politik/meinung/pms00035.html|website = Schattenblick|access-date = 2016-01-12|date = 14 December 2012}}</ref> and a public lecture at the end of the year 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Grenzach-Wyhlen: Zwei Vorträge mit Johan Galtung|url = http://www.suedkurier.de/region/hochrhein/grenzach-wyhlen/Zwei-Vortraege-mit-Johan-Galtung;art372596,5804931|work=[[Südkurier]]|date = 6 December 2012|access-date = 2016-01-12}}</ref>
