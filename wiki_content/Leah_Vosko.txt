Vosko earned her [[Bachelor of Arts]] in political science from [[Trent University]] before attending [[Simon Fraser University]].<ref name = "York U profile">{{cite web |title=Leah Vosko |url=https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/lvosko/ |website=profiles.laps.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> She published her thesis under the title "''Shrink, cut...dye? : NAFTA and women's work in the Canadian clothing industry''" in 1994 and earned her [[Master of Arts]] in gender studies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shrink, cut...dye? : NAFTA and women's work in the Canadian clothing industry |url=http://summit.sfu.ca/item/4997 |website=summit.sfu.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> From there, Vosko earned her PhD at [[York University]].<ref name = "York U profile"/> Her dissertation from York University was titled "''No jobs, lots of work: the gendered rise of the temporary employment relationship in Canada, 1897-1997.''"<ref>{{cite web |title=No jobs, lots of work [microform] : the gendered rise of the temporary employment relationship in Canada, 1897-1997 / |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/34510686 |website=researchgate.net |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
In 2000, following her PhD from York University, Vosko published ''"Temporary Work: The Gendered Rise of a Precarious Employment Relationship"'' through the [[University of Toronto Press]]. Three years later, while working at York University in the Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies, she co-edited "''Changing Canada: Political Economy as Transformation''" through the [[McGill-Queen's University Press]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leah Vosko |url=http://www.migrantworkersrights.net/en/actors/leah-vosko |website=migrantworkersrights.net |accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref> As a [[Canada Research Chair]] in Feminist Political Economy, Vosko conducted research through the Community University Research Alliance on Contingent Employment and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] with Cynthia Cranford and Nancy Zukewich.<ref name = "YU 2003">{{cite web |title=York U. research shows growing labour market insecurity |url=http://news.yorku.ca/2003/09/23/york-u-research-shows-growing-labour-market-insecurity/ |website=news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=September 23, 2003}}</ref> Her research results showed that the Canadian labour market was becoming unstable due to "the growth of temporary and part-time wage work, self-employment and other forms of work not fully protected by labour laws and policies."<ref name = "YU 2003"/> In March 2004, her research on precarious employment regarding foreign labour was featured on [[CBC Radio]].<ref>{{cite web |title=York U. experts featured in CBC Ideas 'Paid to be Poor' |url=http://news.yorku.ca/2004/03/29/york-u-experts-featured-in-cbc-ideas-%E2%80%98paid-to-be-poor%E2%80%99/ |website=news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019 |date=March 29, 2004}}</ref>

In 2005, Vosko received funding from the Ontario government under the Early Researcher Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=York profs receive funding from Ontario government's Early Researcher Award program |url=http://news.yorku.ca/2005/11/25/york-profs-receive-funding-from-ontario-government%E2%80%99s-early-researcher-award-program/ |website=news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=November 25, 2005}}</ref> Vosko's funding went towards her research project regarding precarious employment in first world countries such as the United States and Australia.<ref>{{cite web |title=York CRCs Leah Vosko and Nantel Bergeron receive renewed commitment |url=http://yfile-archive.news.yorku.ca/2005/11/14/york-crcs-leah-vosko-and-nantel-bergeron-receive-renewed-commitment/ |website=yfile-archive.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=November 14, 2011}}</ref> That year she published "''Self-Employed Workers Organize: Law, Policy, and Unions''" through the McGill-Queen's University Press with Cynthia Cranford, [[Judy Fudge]], and Eric Tucker. The book created a multi-disciplinary discourse around how legal, political, and social positions affected labour rights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Self-Employed Workers Organize |url=https://www.mqup.ca/self-employed-workers-organize-products-9780773528727.php |website=mqup.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> The following year she edited "''Precarious Employment: Understanding Labour Market Insecurity in Canada,''" an interdisciplinary book with academic contributors from across Canada that focused on precarious employment and how laws, policies, and labour market institutions affected it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Precarious Employment |url=https://www.mqup.ca/precarious-employment-products-9780773529618.php |website=mqup.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref>

In 2009, Vosko, [[Martha MacDonald]], and Iain Campbell published "''Gender and the Contours of Precarious Employment,''" which focused on precarious employment in Canada, Germany, the United States, Australia and in the European Union. In the book, the authors argue that precarious employment was the result of social, economic, and political inequality at the national and regional level.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gender and the Contours of Precarious Employment |url=https://www.routledge.com/Gender-and-the-Contours-of-Precarious-Employment-1st-Edition/Vosko-MacDonald-Campbell/p/book/9780415494540 |website=routledge.com |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> This was followed by "''Managing the Margins: Gender, Citizenship and the International Regulation of Precarious Employment''" which focused on capitalistic labour markets and the rise in precarious employment such as part‐time, temporary paid employment, and self‐employment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Managing the Margins: Gender, Citizenship, and the International Regulation of Precarious Employment |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199574810.001.0001/acprof-9780199574810 |website=oxfordscholarship.com |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Four years later, Vosko collaborated with [[Valerie Preston]] and Robert Latham to create "''Liberating Temporariness: Imagining Alternatives to Permanence as a Pathway to Social Inclusion.''" The book focused on the ways in which temporariness, such as unstable work, was being institutionalized as a condition of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=Liberating Temporariness? |url=https://www.mqup.ca/liberating-temporariness--products-9780773543812.php |website=mqup.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, she was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada]]'s Division of Social Sciences for her work on the political economy of work, gender, citizenship, migration and labour markets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Royal Society of Canada elects five York profs into its ranks |url=http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2015/09/16/royal-society-of-canada-elects-five-york-u-profs-into-its-ranks/ |website=yfile.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=September 16, 2015}}</ref> That year she also helped lead a panel discussion at York's Global Labour Research Centre about the Canadian political economy.<ref>{{cite web |title=GLRC presents panel discussion on the new Canadian political economy |url=http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2015/12/04/glrc-presents-panel-discussion-on-the-new-canadian-political-economy/ |website=yfile.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=December 4, 2015}}</ref> Vosko focused her research on employment standards and labour rights, specifically regarding migrant workers. As a result, she became the Principal Investigator of an employment standards research partnership titled “''Closing the Enforcement Gap: Improving Employment Standards Protections for People in Precarious Jobs''” with the [[Ontario Ministry of Labour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=WGS Research Seminar – Prof. Leah Vosko |url=https://wgsi.utoronto.ca/event/wgs-research-seminar-prof-leah-vosko |website=wgsi.utoronto.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Simultaneously, she worked as the director of the Employment Standards Database which would work in conjuncture with this partnership to provide researchers with research on employment standards across national contexts. As a result, she was the recipient of York's inaugural Charles Taylor Prize for Excellence in Policy Research by [[Broadbent Institute]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Political science professor receives 2016 Charles Taylor Prize |url=http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2016/05/13/political-science-professor-receives-2016-charles-taylor-prize/ |website=yfile.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=May 13, 2016}}</ref>

The following year, Vosko received $131,793 from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation for her research project "''Canada Labour Code Data Analysis Infrastructure.''" Her project's goal was to create a research tool that would allow for researchers to sift through the large databases the Government of Canada's Labour Program collected efficiently.<ref>{{cite web |title=Five York professors earn prestigious CFI research awards |url=http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2017/08/16/five-york-professors-earn-prestigious-cfi-research-awards/ |website=/yfile.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=August 16, 2017}}</ref> In July 2016, the [[Government of Ontario]] published a study titled "''The Changing Workplaces Review''" which Vosko helped prepare. Due to her research in precarious work, Vosko had been approached by two government advisors to help create their study on the Ontario Employment Standards Act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ontario releases studies led by York researchers in support of Changing Workplace Review |url=http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2016/07/29/ontario-releases-studies-led-by-york-researchers-in-support-of-changing-workplace-review/ |website=yfile.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019 |date=July 29, 2016}}</ref> She was also renewed as a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in the Political Economy of Gender and Work<ref>{{cite web |title=York University gains three new Canada Research Chairs and one renewal |url=http://research.info.yorku.ca/2017/11/york-university-gains-three-new-canada-research-chairs-and-one-renewal/ |website=research.info.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019 |date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> and recognized by York University as a research leader in the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies.<ref>{{cite web |title=York University's Research Leaders' Gala recognizes high-calibre, world-leading research |url=http://research.info.yorku.ca/2017/04/york-universitys-research-leaders-gala-recognizes-high-calibre-world-leading-research/ |website=research.info.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 22, 2019 |date=April 5, 2017}}</ref>

In 2018, her research and recommendations from “''Closing the Enforcement Gap: Improving Employment Standards Protections for People in Precarious Jobs''” with the Ontario Ministry of Labour was used to shape the Canadian Labour Code Bill C-86.<ref>{{cite web |title=York University researchers contribute to federal labour law reform |url=https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2018/11/07/york-university-researchers-contribute-to-federal-labour-law-reform/ |website=yfile.news.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=November 7, 2018}}</ref> That year, Vosko was renewed again as a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in the Department of Political Science.<ref>{{cite web |title=Professor Leah Vosko renewed as Canada Research Chair |url=http://liberal-arts.yorku.ca/professor-leah-vosko-renewed-as-canada-research-chair/ |website=liberal-arts.yorku.ca |accessdate=April 21, 2019 |date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> In 2019, Vosko began collaborating with Mark P.
