'''Clyde Hamilton Coombs''' (July 22, 1912 â€“ February 4, 1988) was an American [[psychologist]] specializing in the field of [[Psychometrics|mathematical psychology]].<ref>[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/coombs-clyde-h.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir]</ref> He devised a voting system, that was hence named [[Coombs' method]].

Coombs founded the Mathematical Psychology program at the [[University of Michigan]].  His students included [[Amos Tversky]], [[Robyn Dawes]], and [[Baruch Fischhoff]], all important researchers in Decision Sciences. The classic text "An Introduction to Mathematical Psychology," by Coombs, Dawes, and Tversky was a must for Michigan graduate students in Mathematical and Experimental Psychology.

In 1959 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.</ref>
