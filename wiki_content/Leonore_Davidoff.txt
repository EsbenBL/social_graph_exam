==Biography==
Davidoff was born in [[New York City]] in 1932, as the second of four children of Ida and Leo Davidoff. <ref name="Leonore Davidoff">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/leonore-davidoff-sociologist-and-historian-whose-own-experiences-helped-her-become-a-worldrenowned-pioneer-of-gender-studies-9868823.html | title=Leonore Davidoff | date=19 November 2014 | agency=The Independent www.independent.co.uk | accessdate=19 November 2014 | author=Thompson, Paul}}</ref> Davidoff's later childhood in a white Protestant community in [[Connecticut]], served as an "early lesson in marginality".<ref name="Leonore Davidoff"/> Her father (a Latvian immigrant) became a neurosurgeon who started the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and her mother (born in Boston to Lithuanian immigrants) was an early women's rights supporter and marriage counselor. Her brother and older sister were also doctors.<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary"/><ref name="Leonore Davidoff"/>

Davidoff, however, chose to study music as a first degree at [[Oberlin College]] [[Ohio]], later switching to sociology. She went on to do an MA at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) in 1956.<ref name="Leonore Davidoff, 1932-2014"/> Her master's thesis was on the ''Employment of Married Women'', and a foundation to her life's work in the research field of women's history. Still, the thesis remained unpublished; at the time, there was "no Feminist Movement to relate to, and she could not see any future in it."<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary by Paul Thompson">{{cite web | url=http://essexsociologyalumni.com/2014/11/13/leonore-davidoff-an-obituary-by-paul-thompson/ | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary by Paul Thompson | publisher=Essex Sociology Alumni essexsociologyalumni.com | accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="Department of Sociology">{{cite web | url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=127 | title=Department of Sociology | publisher=University of Essex www.essex.ac.uk | accessdate=19 November 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129105756/http://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=127 | archive-date=29 November 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Leonore Davidoff 1932-2014">{{cite web | url=http://essexsociologyalumni.com/2014/11/04/leonore-davidoff-1932-2014/ | title=Leonore Davidoff 1932-2014 | publisher=Essex Sociology Alumni essexsociologyalumni.com/ | accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>

It was in her first year at LSE that Davidoff met [[David Lockwood (sociologist)|David Lockwood]], then a PhD student in sociology, who would go on to do significant research on the nature of class in Britain. They married in 1954.<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/06/leonore-davidoff | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary | date=6 November 2014 | agency=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | accessdate=19 November 2014 | author=John, Angela V.}}</ref> For a while after the birth of her three sons, from 1956 onwards, Davidoff focused on her family and lost any basis for institutional research. While a lifelong and "remarkable" marriage, Lockwood and she "did not forge an intellectual partnership": he continued to centre his work on issues of class, and did not pay attention to gender as a critical social dimension.<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary by Paul Thompson">{{cite web | url=http://essexsociologyalumni.com/2014/11/13/leonore-davidoff-an-obituary-by-paul-thompson/ | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary by Paul Thompson | publisher=Essex Sociology Alumni essexsociologyalumni.com | accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="Department of Sociology">{{cite web | url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=127 | title=Department of Sociology | publisher=University of Essex www.essex.ac.uk | accessdate=19 November 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129105756/http://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=127 | archive-date=29 November 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

After a few years of feeling isolated and "'around the colleges but not in them'", Davidoff found support and connections at the [[Lucy Cavendish College]] in Cambridge for mature women.<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/06/leonore-davidoff | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary | date=6 November 2014 | agency=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | accessdate=19 November 2014 | author=John, Angela V.}}</ref> When Lockwood moved to the University of Essex in 1968 as a professor in sociology, Davidoff began working there as a research officer. She became a lecturer in social history in 1975 and taught the UK's first MA in women's history.<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/06/leonore-davidoff | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary | date=6 November 2014 | agency=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | accessdate=19 November 2014 | author=John, Angela V.}}</ref> In 1990, she was made a research professor, retiring a few years later. [[David Lockwood (sociologist)|David Lockwood]] died a few months before Davidoff, in June 2014.

==Work==
Davidoff is best known for her book ''Family Fortunes'', written in 1987 with [[Catherine Hall]].<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary"/> As the sociologist and oral historian, [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)|Paul Thompson]], put it: "it is a brilliant demonstration of the new insights which gender perspectives can yield".<ref name="Leonore Davidoff">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/leonore-davidoff-sociologist-and-historian-whose-own-experiences-helped-her-become-a-worldrenowned-pioneer-of-gender-studies-9868823.html | title=Leonore Davidoff | date=19 November 2014 | agency=The Independent www.independent.co.uk | accessdate=19 November 2014 | author=Thompson, Paul}}</ref> Using case studies of middle-class family and business relationships in urban Birmingham and rural East Anglia, Davidoff and Hall traced the evolution of capitalist enterprise in England at the end of the 18th century. They demonstrated the gendered division of labour through an examination of the family, the economy and religious belief: in particular, the way men operated in the public sphere, and women, in the private, [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]].<ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary"/><ref name="Leonore Davidoff"/><ref name="Leonore Davidoff 1932-2014"/> Davidoff and Hall described ''Family Fortunes'' as "... a book about the ideologies, institutions and practices of the English middle class from the end of the eighteenth to the mid nineteenth centuries[...] The principle argument rests on the assumption that gender and class always operate together, that consciousness of class always takes a gendered form."<ref name="Family Fortunes">{{cite book | title=Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class 1780-1850 | publisher=The University of Chicago Press | date=27 August 1991|last1=Davidoff|first1=Lenore|last2=Hall|first2=Catherine | pages=13}}</ref>
