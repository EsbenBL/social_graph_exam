==Biography==
=== Childhood ===
Paul Ekman was born in 1934 in [[Washington, D.C.]], and grew up in a Jewish family<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Psychologists_100_Most_Eminent.html|title=Jews Among the 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the Twentieth Century|website=www.jinfo.org|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2020}} in [[New Jersey]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]]. His father was a pediatrician and his mother was an attorney. His sister, Joyce Steinhart, is a psychoanalytic psychologist who, before her retirement, practiced in [[New York City]].<ref name="Ekman"/>

Ekman originally wanted to be a psychotherapist, but when he was drafted into the army in 1958 he found that research could change army routines, making them more humane. This experience converted him from wanting to be a psychotherapist to wanting to be a researcher, in order to help as many people as possible.<ref>{{cite news |id={{ProQuest|229138171}} |last1=O'Connor |first1=John |title=First Person: Paul Ekman |work=Financial Times |date=29 November 2008 }}</ref>

=== Education ===
At the age of 15, without graduating from high school, Paul Ekman enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]] , where he completed three years of undergraduate study. During his time in Chicago he was fascinated by [[group therapy]] sessions and understanding group dynamics. Notably, his classmates at Chicago included writer [[Susan Sontag]], film director [[Mike Nichols]], and actress [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people4/Ekman/ekman-con1.html |title=Conversation with Paul Ekman, p. 1 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date=2004-03-11 |access-date=2014-03-03}}</ref>

He then studied two years at [[New York University]] (NYU), earning his BA in 1954.<ref name="Ekman"/>  The subject of his first research project, under the direction of his NYU professor, Margaret Tresselt, was an attempt to develop a test of how people would respond to group therapy.<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45">Ekman, P. (1987). "A life's pursuit." In ''The Semiotic Web '86: An International Yearbook'', Sebeok, T. A.; Umiker-Seboek, J., Eds. Berlin, Mouton De Gruyter, pp. 3–45.</ref>

Next, Ekman was accepted into the [[Adelphi University]] graduate program for [[clinical psychology]].<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/> While working for his master's degree, Ekman was awarded a predoctoral research fellowship from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1955.<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/>  His Master's thesis was focused on facial expression and body movement he had begun to study in 1954.<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/> Ekman eventually went on to receive his Ph.D. in [[clinical psychology]] at [[Adelphi University]] in 1958, after a one-year internship at the [[Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute]].<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/><ref>Eissner, B.

=== Military service ===
Ekman was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958 to serve 2 years as soon as his internship at Langley Porter was finished.<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/> He served as first lieutenant-chief psychologist, at Fort Dix, New Jersey, where he did research on army stockades and psychological changes during infantry basic training.<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions: Paul Ekman. |journal=American Psychologist |date=1992 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=470–471 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.4.470 |last1=No Authorship Indicated }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ekman |first1=P. |last2=Cohen |first2=L. |last3=Moos |first3=R. |last4=Raine |first4=W. |last5=Schlesinger |first5=M. |last6=Stone |first6=G. |title=Divergent Reactions to the Threat of War: A peace and a shelter group were studied to examine their different responses to the Berlin crisis |journal=Science |date=11 January 1963 |volume=139 |issue=3550 |pages=88–94 |doi=10.1126/science.139.3550.88 |pmid=17798702 |bibcode=1963Sci...139...88E |s2cid=44479294 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ekman |first1=Paul |last2=Friesen |first2=Wallace v. |last3=Lutzker |first3=Daniel R. |title=Psychological reactions to infantry basic training. |journal=Journal of Consulting Psychology |date=February 1962 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=103–104 |doi=10.1037/h0041781 |pmid=13889754 }}</ref>

=== Career ===

Upon completion of military service in 1960, he accepted a position as a research associate with Leonard Krasner at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital, working on a grant focused on the operant conditioning of verbal behavior in psychiatric patients. Ekman also met anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] in 1960 who was on the staff of the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital. Five years later, Gregory Bateson gave Paul Ekman motion picture films taken in Bali in the mid-1930s to help Ekman with cross-cultural studies of expression and gesture.<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/>

From 1960 to 1963, Ekman was supported by a post doctoral fellowship from NIMH. He submitted his first research grant through San Francisco State College with himself as the principal investigator (PI) at the young age of 29.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ekman, P. (1987). '"A life's pursuit". In ''The Semiotic Web '86: An International Yearbook'', Sebeok, T. A.; Umiker-Seboek, J., Eds. Berlin, Mouton De Gruyter, pp. 3–45</ref>  He received this grant from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) in 1963 to study nonverbal behaviour. This award would be continuously renewed for the next 40 years and would pay his salary until he was offered a professorship at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF) in 1972.

Encouraged by his college friend and teacher [[Silvan Tomkins|Silvan S. Tomkins]], Ekman shifted his focus from body movement to facial expressions. He wrote his most famous book, ''Telling Lies'', and published it in 1985. The 4th edition is still in print. He retired in 2004 as professor of [[psychology]] in the Department of [[Psychiatry]] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF). From 1960 to 2004 he also worked at the [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute]] on a limited basis consulting on various clinical cases.

After retiring from the University of California, San Francisco, Paul Ekman founded the Paul Ekman Group (PEG) and Paul Ekman International.<ref name="paulekman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.paulekman.com/about-paul-ekman-group-llc/ |title=About Paul Ekman Group LLC  |publisher=Paulekman.com |access-date=2014-03-03}}</ref>

=== Media ===
In 2001, Ekman collaborated with [[John Cleese]] for the [[BBC]] [[documentary film|documentary]] series ''[[The Human Face]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.paul |title=Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Paul Ekman |publisher=Lifeboat.com |date=2002-09-16 |access-date=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105022238/http://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.paul |archive-date=2014-01-05 }}</ref>

His work is frequently referred to in the TV series ''[[Lie to Me]]''.<ref name="The 2009">"The (Real!) Science Behind Fox's ''Lie to Me''". ''Popular Mechanics'' [Online], 2009.</ref>  Dr. Lightman is based on Paul Ekman, and Ekman served as a scientific adviser for the series; he read and edited the scripts and sent video clip-notes of facial expressions for the actors to imitate.  While Ekman has written 15 books, the series ''Lie to Me'' has more effectively brought Ekman's research into people's homes.<ref name="The 2009"/>

He has also collaborated with [[Pixar]]'s film director and animator [[Pete Docter]] in preparation of his 2015 film ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/opinion/sunday/the-science-of-inside-out.html|title=The Science of 'Inside Out'|author=Dacher Keltner & Paul Ekman|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2015-07-03 |access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref> Ekman also wrote a parent's guide to using ''Inside Out'' to help parents talk with their children about emotion, which can be found on his personal website.

=== Influence ===
He was named one of the top [[Time 100]] most influential people in the May 11, 2009 edition of Time magazine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090503142224/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894410_1893209_1893475,00.html The 2009 TIME 100: Paul Ekman], Scientists & Thinkers.

His contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

==Research work==

===Measuring nonverbal communication===
Ekman's interest in [[nonverbal communication]] led to his first publication in 1957, describing how difficult it was to develop ways of empirically measuring nonverbal behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ekman |first1=Paul |title=A Methodological Discussion of Nonverbal Behavior |journal=The Journal of Psychology |date=January 1957 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=141–149 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1957.9713059 }}</ref> He chose the [[Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute]], the psychiatry department of the University of California Medical School, for his clinical internship partly because [[Jurgen Ruesch]] and Weldon Kees had recently published a book called ''Nonverbal Communication'' (1956).<ref name="Ekman, P. pp 3-45"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nonverbalcommuni0000rues |url-access=registration |title=Nonverbal Communication: Notes on the Visual Perception of Human Relations |publisher=University of California Press |author=Jurgen Ruesch, Weldon Kees  |via=Internet Archive |access-date=2014-03-03|year=1969 }}</ref><ref>Ruesch, J.; Kees, W. (1956). ''Nonverbal Communication: Notes on the Visual Perception of Human Relations''. University of California Press, Berkeley,  p. 205.</ref>

Ekman then focused on developing techniques for measuring nonverbal communication. He found that facial muscular movements that created facial expressions could be reliably identified through empirical research. He also found that human beings are capable of making over 10,000 facial expressions; only 3,000 relevant to emotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/53632 |title=Watch Lie To Me: Expressions: Introduction online |publisher=Hulu |access-date=2014-03-03}}</ref> Psychologist [[Silvan Tomkins]] convinced Ekman to extend his studies of nonverbal communication from body movement to the face, helping him design his classic cross-cultural emotion recognition studies.<ref>{{cite web

===Emotions as universal categories===
In ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' published in 1872, [[Charles Darwin]] theorized that emotions were evolved traits universal to the human species. However, the prevalent belief during the 1950s, particularly among [[cultural anthropology|anthropologists]], was that [[facial expressions]] and their meanings were determined through behavioral learning processes. A prominent advocate of the latter perspective was the anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]], who had travelled to different countries examining how cultures communicated using nonverbal behavior.

Through a series of studies, Ekman found a high agreement across members of diverse Western and Eastern literate cultures on selecting emotional labels that fit facial expressions. Expressions he found to be universal included those indicating [[wrath]], [[disgust|grossness]], [[fear]], [[joy]], [[loneliness]], and [[acute stress reaction|shock]]. Findings on [[contempt]] were less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized.<ref>Matsumoto, David (1992) "More evidence for the universality of a contempt expression". ''Motivation and Emotion''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 16, Number 4 / December, 1992</ref> Working with Wallace V. Friesen, Ekman demonstrated that the findings extended to preliterate [[Fore (people)|Fore tribesmen]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], whose members could not have learned the meaning of expressions from exposure to media depictions of emotion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ekman |first1=Paul |last2=Friesen |first2=Wallace V. |title=Constants across cultures in the face and emotion. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1971 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=124–129 |doi=10.1037/h0030377 |pmid=5542557 }}</ref>  Ekman and Friesen then demonstrated that certain emotions were exhibited with very specific display rules, culture-specific prescriptions about who can show which emotions to whom and when. These display rules could explain how cultural differences may conceal the universal effect of expression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=Paul|title=Handbook of social psychophysiology|year=1989|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, England|chapter=The argument and evidence about universals in facial expressions of emotion|editor=H. Wagner & A Manstead|pages=143–64}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Ekman proposed an expanded list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions that are not all encoded in facial muscles.<ref name="Ekman 1999">{{citation | first = Paul | last = Ekman | year = 1999 | url = http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Basic-Emotions.pdf | contribution = Basic Emotions | editor1-first = T | editor1-last = Dalgleish | editor2-first = M | editor2-last = Power | title = Handbook of Cognition and Emotion | place = Sussex, UK | publisher = John Wiley & Sons}}</ref> The newly included emotions are: [[Amusement]], [[Contempt]], [[Contentment]], [[Embarrassment]], [[Anxiety|Excitement]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]],  [[Pride|Pride in achievement]], [[Relief]], [[Contentment|Satisfaction]], [[Pleasure|Sensory pleasure]], and [[Shame]].<ref name="Ekman 1999"/>

===Visual depictions of facial actions for studying emotion===
Ekman's famous test of emotion recognition was the Pictures of Facial Affect (POFA) stimulus set published in 1976. Consisting of 110 black and white images of Caucasian actors portraying the six universal emotions plus neutral expressions, the POFA has been used to study emotion recognition rates in normal and psychiatric populations around the world. Ekman used these stimuli in his original cross-cultural research. Many researchers favor the POFA because these photographs have been rated by large normative groups in different cultures. In response to critics, however, Ekman eventually released a more culturally diverse set of stimuli called the Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion (JACFEE).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dailey |first1=Matthew N. |last2=Joyce |first2=Carrie |last3=Lyons |first3=Michael J. |last4=Kamachi |first4=Miyuki |last5=Ishi |first5=Hanae |last6=Gyoba |first6=Jiro |last7=Cottrell |first7=Garrison W. |title=Evidence and a Computational Explanation of Cultural Differences inFacial Expression Recognition |journal=Emotion |date=December 2010 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=874–893 |doi=10.1037/a0020019 |pmid=21171759 |pmc=7360061 }}</ref>

By 1978, Ekman and Friesen had finalized and developed the [[Facial Action Coding System]]. FACS is an anatomically based system for describing all observable facial movement for every emotion. Each observable component of facial movement is called an action unit or AU and all facial expressions can be decomposed into their constituent core AUs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ekman|first=Paul|title=FACS vs. F.A.C.E.|url=http://www.paulekman.com/products/facs-vs-f-a-c-e/}}</ref> An update of this tool came in the early 2000s.

Other tools have been developed, including the MicroExpressions Training Tool (METT), which can help individuals identify more subtle emotional expressions that occur when people try to suppress their emotions. Application of this tool includes helping people with [[Asperger's]] or [[autism]] to recognize emotional expressions in their everyday interactions. The Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT) teaches recognition of very small, micro signs of emotion. These are very tiny expressions, sometimes registering in only part of the face, or when the expression is shown across the entire face, but is very small. Subtle expressions occur for many reasons, for example, the emotion experienced may be very slight or the emotion may be just beginning. METT and SETT have been shown to increase accuracy in evaluating truthfulness{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

Paul Ekman International was established in 2010 by the EIA Group based on a partnership between Cliff Lansley and Paul Ekman to deliver emotional skills and deception detection workshops around the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cliff Lansley – Member Emotional Intelligence Consortium |url=http://www.eiconsortium.org/members/lansley.html |website=eiconsortium.org |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

===Detecting deception===
Ekman has contributed to the study of social aspects of lying, why people lie,<ref>Ekman, P., 1991: [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uDhAPwAACAAJ Why Kids Lie: How Parents Can Encourage Truthfulness]</ref> and why people are often unconcerned with detecting lies.<ref>Ekman, P., 1996: [http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Why-Dont-We-Catch-Liars.pdf Why don't we catch liars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108055421/http://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Why-Dont-We-Catch-Liars.pdf |date=2010-01-08 }}</ref> He first became interested in detecting lies while completing his clinical work. As detailed in Ekman's ''Telling Lies'', a patient he was involved in treating denied that she was suicidal in order to leave the hospital. Ekman began to review videotaped interviews to study people's facial expressions while lying. In a research project along with Maureen O'Sullivan, called the [[Wizards Project]] (previously named the [[Diogenes Project]]), Ekman reported on facial "[[microexpression]]s" which could be used to assist in [[lie detection]].  After testing a total of 20,000 people<ref>Camilleri, J., "Truth Wizard knows when you've been lying", Chicago Sun-Times, January 21, 2009</ref> from all walks of life, he found only 50 people who had the ability to spot deception without any formal training.  These ''naturals'' are also known as "Truth Wizards", or wizards of deception detection from demeanor.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

In his profession, he also uses oral signs of lying.  When interviewed about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he mentioned that he could detect that former President [[Bill Clinton]] was lying because he used [[distancing language]].<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/16/MN241376.DTL&type=science "The lie detective: San Francisco psychologist has made a science of reading facial expressions"] by Julian Guthrie, ''San Francisco Chronicle'',  September 16, 2002.</ref>

==Contributions==
In his 1993  paper in the psychology journal ''[[American Psychologist]]'', Ekman describes nine direct contributions that his research on facial expression has made to the understanding of emotion.<ref name="Facial Expression and Emotion">{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=Paul|title=Facial Expression and Emotion|journal=American Psychologist|year=1993|volume=48|issue=4|pages=384–92|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.48.4.384|pmid=8512154}}</ref> Highlights include:
* Consideration of both nature and nurture: Emotion is now viewed as a [[physiological]] phenomenon influenced by our cultural and learning experiences.
* Emotion-specific physiology: Ekman led the way by trying to find discrete [[psychophysiological]] differences across emotions. A number of researchers continue to search for emotion-specific autonomic and [[central nervous system]] activations. With the advent of [[neuroimaging]] techniques, a topic of intense interest revolves around how specific emotions relate to physiological activations in certain brain areas. Ekman laid the groundwork for the future field of [[affective neuroscience]].
* An examination of events that precede emotions: Ekman's finding that voluntarily making one of the universal facial expressions can generate the physiology and some of the subjective experience of emotion provided some difficulty for some of the earlier theoretical conceptualizations of experiencing emotions.
* Considering emotions as families: Ekman & Friesen (1978) found not one expression for each emotion, but a variety of related but visually different expressions. For example, the authors reported 60 variations of the anger expression which share core configurational properties and distinguish themselves clearly from the families of fearful expressions, disgust expressions, and so on. Variations within a family likely reflect the intensity of the emotion, how the emotion is controlled, whether it is simulated or spontaneous, and the specifics of the event that provoked the emotion.

==Criticisms==
Most credibility-assessment researchers agree that untrained people are unable to visually detect lies.<ref name=pmid20505706/> 
The application of part of Ekman's work to [[airport security]] via the [[Transportation Security Administration]]'s "[[SPOT (TSA program)|Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques]]" (SPOT) program has been criticized for not having been put through controlled scientific tests.<ref name=pmid20505706>{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=Sharon |title=Airport security: Intent to deceive? |journal=Nature |date=May 2010 |volume=465 |issue=7297 |pages=412–415 |doi=10.1038/465412a |pmid=20505706 |s2cid=4350875 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  A 2007 report on SPOT referring to untrained people stated that "simply put, people (including professional lie-catchers with extensive experience of assessing veracity) would achieve similar hit rates if they flipped a coin".<ref>Hontz, C.R., Hartwig, M., Kleinman, S.M. & Meissner, C.A. "Credibility Assessment at Portals", ''Portals Committee Report'' (2009).</ref> Since controlled scientific tests typically involve people playing the part of terrorists, Ekman says those people are unlikely to have the same emotions as actual terrorists.<ref name=pmid20505706/>

Field research by the EIA Group documented empirical testing of the impact of behavioral analysis in an airport environment by having a small group of trained and untrained subjects identify people from yet another group who had to bring unauthorized items through security.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eiagroup.com/2017/04/11/observe-target-engage-respond-oter/ |title=White Paper – Observe, Target, Engage, Respond (OTER) |website=eiagroup.com |last=Lansley |first=Cliff |date=2017-04-11 |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> But the white paper is not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific paper, and had only two exercises of an airport security shift-length with the control group and two with the trained group, with about 20 participants total.

The methodology used by Ekman and O'Sullivan in their recent work on "[[Wizards Project|Truth Wizards]]" has also received criticism on the basis of validation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=Charles F. |last2=Uysal |first2=Ahmet |title=On lie detection 'Wizards' |journal=Law and Human Behavior |date=2007 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=109–115 |doi=10.1007/s10979-006-9016-1 |pmid=17221309 |s2cid=14216919 }}</ref>

Other criticisms of Ekman's work are based on experimental and naturalistic studies by several other emotion psychologists that did not find evidence in support of Ekman's proposed taxonomy of discrete emotions and discrete facial expression.<ref>Russel and Fernandez-Dols (1997). ''The Psychology of Facial Expression''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521587964}}. Pages 400</ref>

Methodological criticisms of Ekman's work focus on the essentially circular and tautological nature of his experiments, in which test subjects were shown selected photographs of "basic emotions," and then asked to match them with the same set of concepts used in their production. Ekman showed photographs selected from over 3000 pictures of individuals asked to simulate emotions, from which he edited to contain "those which showed only the pure display of a single affect," using no control and subject only to Ekman's intuition.<ref name=EkmanSorenson1969>{{cite journal |last1=Ekman |first1=P. |last2=Sorenson |first2=E. R. |last3=Friesen |first3=W. V. |title=Pan-Cultural Elements in Facial Displays of Emotion |journal=Science |date=4 April 1969 |volume=164 |issue=3875 |pages=86–88 |doi=10.1126/science.164.3875.86 |pmid=5773719 |bibcode=1969Sci...164...86E |s2cid=16462814 }}</ref> If Ekman felt a photograph did not show the correct "pure" emotion, he excluded it.<ref>Jan Plamper. The history of Emotions: An Introduction (Oxford, 2012), 153.</ref>

Ekman received hostility from some anthropologists at meetings of the American Psychological Association and the American Anthropological Association from 1967 to 1969. He recounted that, as he was reporting his findings on universality of expression, one anthropologist tried to stop him from finishing by shouting that his ideas were fascist. He compares this to another incident when he was accused of being racist by an activist for claiming that Black expressions are not different from White expressions. In 1975, [[Margaret Mead]], an anthropologist, wrote against Ekman for doing "improper anthropology", and for disagreeing with [[Ray Birdwhistell]]'s claim opposing universality. Ekman wrote that, while many people agreed with Birdwhistell then, most came to accept his own findings over the next decade.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
However, some anthropologists continued to suggest that emotions are not universal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lutz |first1=C |last2=White |first2=G M |title=The Anthropology of Emotions |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=October 1986 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=405–436 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.15.1.405 }}</ref> Ekman argued that there has been no quantitative data to support the claim that emotions are culture specific. In his 1993 discussion of the topic, Ekman states that there is no instance in which 70% or more of one cultural group select one of the six universal emotions while another culture group labels the same expression as another universal emotion.<ref name="Facial Expression and Emotion" />

Ekman criticized the tendency of psychologists to base their conclusions on surveys of college students. Hank Campbell quotes Ekman saying at the ''Being Human'' conference, "We basically have a science of undergraduates."<ref name="science20">{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/cool-links/doubleblind_test_astrology_21st_century-88961
|title=A Double-Blind Test Of Astrology For The 21st Century|author=Hank Campbell|website=Science20.com|date=16 April 2012|quote=...as the legendary Paul Ekman said at the Being Human conference, 'We basically have a science of undergraduates'}}</ref> Ekman's own studies have used freshman college students as the subject group, comparing their results with those of illiterate subjects from New Guinea.<ref name=EkmanSorenson1969/>

Ekman has refused to submit his more recent work to peer-review, claiming that revealing the details of his work might reveal state secrets and endanger security.<ref name=pmid20505706/> Critics assert that this is instead an attempt to shield his work from methodological criticisms within experimental psychology, even as his public and popular visibility has grown.<ref>Jan Plamper.
