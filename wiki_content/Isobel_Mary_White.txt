'''Isobel Mary White''' (1912–1997) was an [[English Australians|English-Australian]] [[anthropologist]] whose publications beginning in the 1960s concentrated on the role of women in Aboriginal societies in Australia.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=McBryde|first=Isabel|date=1997|title=A Tribute to Isobel Mary White|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24046332|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=21|pages=ix–xii|jstor=24046332|issn=0314-8769|access-date=2020-12-05}}</ref>

== Life ==
'''Isobel Mary Lunn''', known to her friends as Sally, was born and grew up in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], London until the family moved to Birmingham so her father could accept an appointment as Headmaster there.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Melbourne|first=National Foundation for Australian Women and The University of|title=White, Isobel Mary - Woman - The Australian Women's Register|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE5355b.htm|access-date=2020-12-05|website=www.womenaustralia.info|language=en-gb}}</ref>

A gifted mathematician, she went to read economics at Cambridge, under [[John Maynard Keynes|Maynard Keynes]],<ref name=":2" /> and although she completed the course in 1933, university administrators did not actually award her a degree for her efforts. At completing her studies she was awarded a traveling scholarship for 1934/1935 to undertake research in [[Canada]] concerning "migrants and outworkers."<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

She married scientist Michael White in 1938 and had two sons during [[World War II]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Standish|first=Ann|title=White, Isobel Mary - Woman - The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0592b.htm|access-date=2020-04-18|website=www.womenaustralia.info|language=en-gb}}</ref>  During the war Michael and Sally were both working in government service and spending significant time in London in spite of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]], periods of intense bombing. After the war, the family moved to the United States so Michael could pursue his career and Sally could begin to explore her new interest in anthropology, which grew from her research in Canada. Ten years later, her husband was awarded the chair of Zoology in Melbourne, Australia, causing the family to move there.<ref name=":0" />

=== Career ===
In Melbourne, White first pursued her interest in anthropology through her membership in the Victorian Anthropological Society and then, beginning in 1964, with her appointment to the staff of the new Department of Anthropology at [[Monash University]].<ref name=":0" />

Specifically, White chose to research the roles of women in Australia's Aboriginal societies. To do so she studied desert groups, conducting major fieldwork in the late 1960s and 1970s and doing so with the collaboration of linguist Luise Hercus and musicologists Catherine Ellis and Helen Payne. The resulting research was well received.<ref name=":0" />

According to Standish, White noticed how women were marginalized in these societies, <blockquote>Her own field work with Tiwi, as well as with Andagarinja, Jangkundjara and Pidjanjara women, looked at the exclusion of women from male rites examined in the light of reported ignorance of physiological paternity; role of women in physical procreation and birth, role of men in spiritual rebirth at initiation; acceptance of junior status by women and reinforcement of male superiority by men.<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>Beginning in the early 1980s, Sally served on the editorial board of ''[[Aboriginal History]]''. She was a reviewer there for many years and co-edited with Judith Wilson and Isabel McBryde two special volumes (numbers 11 and 12) honoring their Canadian colleague [[Diane Barwick]].<ref name=":0" />

White died in 1997<ref name=":2" /> (not in 1998 as some sources<ref name=":0" /> claim and which was the year of her memorial ceremony).
