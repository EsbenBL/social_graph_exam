Walash |last=Walsh |first=Denise M. |access-date=11 January 2020}}</ref> She completed an MA in political science at [[Columbia University]] in 1986, and a PhD in political science from the [[New School for Social Research]] in 2006.<ref name=profile/> In 2005, she became a professor at the University of Virginia, where she was also a co-founder of the Power, Violence and Inequality Collective, which she co-directed from 2016 to 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://politics.virginia.edu/denise-walsh/ |title=Denise M.

==Career==
Walsh wrote the book ''Women's Rights in Democratizing States: Just Debate and Gender Justice in the Public Sphere'', published in 2010. The book confirms and advances findings that [[democratization]] does not generally increase [[Women in government|women's participation in politics]], as political institutions and parties often block women's advancement during these transitions.<ref name=krook13>{{cite journal |title=Reviewed Work(s): Women's Rights in Democratizing States: Just Debate and Gender Justice in the Public Sphere by Denise Walsh |first=Mona Lena |last=Krook |author-link=Mona Lena Krook |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=11 |number=4 |year=2013 |pages=1161–1163 |publisher=American Political Science Association |doi=10.1017/S1537592713002375|s2cid=144421446 }}</ref> However, by introducing a new variable regarding debate conditions, and by means of paired comparisons of particular periods of democratization in [[Poland]], [[Chile]], and [[South Africa]], Walsh shows that open and inclusive conditions for debate during democratization periods can increase the state's support for advancements in women's rights and inclusion.<ref name=krook13/>
