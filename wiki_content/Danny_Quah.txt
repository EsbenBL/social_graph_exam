Between 1980 and 2010 that economic center of gravity moved 5,000&nbsp;km east, to the [[Persian Gulf]], on a trajectory that continues to take it towards the boundary between [[India]] and [[China]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1758-5899.2010.00066.x| title = The Global Economy's Shifting Centre of Gravity| journal = Global Policy| volume = 2| pages = 3–9| year = 2011| last1 = Quah | first1 = D. }}</ref>

Although the early part of his career saw close attention to technical developments in timeseries econometrics, Quah became heavily influenced by the approach to communicating ideas exemplified in the work of [[Edward Tufte]],<ref>Tufte, Edward. 2001. ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''. Second Edition. New Haven: Graphics Press</ref> and sought similar dissemination of his research to a wider audience. He has also argued that research on economic development needs to be inextricably linked to scholarly work in International Relations.<ref>The Liberalisation Delusion.
