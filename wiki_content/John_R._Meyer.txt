'''John Robert Meyer''' (December 6, 1927 – October 20, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and [[educator]]. Meyer is credited with creating the field of [[transport economics]] and was one of the pioneers of [[cliometrics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/remembering-the-father-of-transportation-economics/|title = Remembering the Father of Transportation Economics|date = October 27, 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
Born in [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]], Meyer attended [[Pacific University]] from 1945 to 1946, after which he served in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] from 1945 to 1948. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of Washington]] in 1950, and a [[doctorate]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1955.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0w-UAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA373|title = Reflections on the Cliometrics Revolution: Conversations with Economic Historians|isbn = 9781135993603|last1 = Lyons|first1 = John S.|last2 = Cain|first2 = Louis P.|last3 = Williamson|first3 = Samuel H.|date = December 12, 2007}}</ref> His dissertation topic (business investment decisions) coincided with that of a Harvard classmate, [[Edwin Kuh]], leading them to merge both papers and publish it as ''The Investment Decision: An Empirical Study'' in 1957.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRk1pApShtIC&pg=PA76|title=Fischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance|isbn=9781118203569|last1=Mehrling|first1=Perry|last2=Brown|first2=Aaron|date=December 27, 2011}}</ref>

Meyer was a professor at Harvard's Department of Economics from 1955 to 1968, and then at [[Yale University]] from 1968 to 1973. He returned to the Cambridge in 1973 as a professor at the [[Harvard Business School]] until 1983. He served as president of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] from 1967 to 1977. Meyer was a consultant to the National Transportation Policy Study Commission from 1977 to 1979. He served as vice chairman and board member of [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. From 1996 to 1998, Meyer served as co-interim director of Harvard's [[Joint Center for Housing Studies]], along with Gerald McCue. Meyer chaired their faculty committee from 1997 to 2003.

He ended his career at Harvard as the James W. Harpel Professor of Capital Formation and Economic Growth Emeritus at the [[Harvard Kennedy School]]. The Joint Center for Housing Studies named a dissertation fellowship in Meyer's honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/students/john-r-meyer-dissertation-fellowship-harvard-doctoral-students|title = John R. Meyer Dissertation Fellowship (For Harvard Doctoral Students) &#124; Joint Center for Housing Studies}}</ref>

===Transport economics and cliometrics===
Meyer and three co-authors (Merton Peck, John Stenason and [[Charles Zwick]]) published ''The Economics of Competition in the Transportation Industries'' in 1959. This book conducted a thorough analysis of costs and demand, which enabled the authors to study what the railroad industry might look like if it were better governed. Regulation of railroads had implicitly given incentivizes to passenger over freight trains. This made railroads less efficient and also less profitable because intercity rail’s great comparative advantage was in moving goods over long distances. They are now credited with creating the field of [[transport economics]]. Meyer's second influential book on the topic was ''The Urban Transportation Problem'', co-authored with [[John F. Kain]] and Martin Wohl. The book described the process of American [[suburbanization]] and the rapid switch from public transportation to cars.

Meyer was also a pioneer of [[cliometrics]]. In 1958, he and fellow Harvard professor [[Alfred H. Conrad]] published ''The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South'' in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''. Using rigorous statistics, the authors concluded that the view that [[slavery in the United States]] would have disappeared without the [[American Civil War]], as purported by [[Charles W. Ramsdell]], [[Ulrich Bonnell Phillips]], and other historians. This anticipated the study by [[Robert Fogel]], who would later arrive at the same conclusion.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Meyer married Lee Stowell, and they had three children: Leslie Karen; Ann Elizabeth; and Robert Conrad. In 2009, Meyer died on October 20th after a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?page=Lifestory&pid=134789325|title=John R.
