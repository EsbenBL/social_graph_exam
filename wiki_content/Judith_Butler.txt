As a child and teenager, Butler attended both [[Hebrew school]] and special classes on [[Jewish ethics]], where they received their "first training in philosophy". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'' that they began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by Butler's Hebrew school's [[Rabbi]] because they were "too talkative in class".<ref name=taught/>  Butler also stated that they were "thrilled" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what they wanted to study in these special sessions, they responded with three questions preoccupying them at the time: "Why was [[Spinoza]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from the synagogue?

==Overview of major works==
{{Original research|discuss=Original research|date=June 2021}}

===''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution'' (1988)===
In the essay "Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory" Judith Butler proposes that [[gender performativity|gender is performative]]. Because gender identity is established through behavior, there is a possibility to construct different genders via different behaviors.<ref name="Jones2018">{{cite web | url = https://www.openculture.com/2018/02/judith-butler-on-gender-performativity.html | first = Josh | last = Jones | date = 7 February 2018 | title = Theorist Judith Butler Explains How Behavior Creates Gender: A Short Introduction to "Gender Performativity" | website = Open Culture | url-status = live | access-date = 8 July 2021}}</ref>

''Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity'' was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Loizidou|first=Elena|date=2007-04-11|title=Judith Butler: Ethics, Law, Politics|pages=1|doi=10.4324/9780203945186|isbn=978-0-203-94518-6}}</ref>  ''Gender Trouble'' discusses the works of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Monique Wittig]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Michel Foucault]].<ref name="Direk-2020">{{cite book |last=Direk |first=Zeynep |title=Ontologies of Sex: Philosophy in Sexual Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ep7pDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112 |series=Reframing the boundaries |date=15 June 2020 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |pages=112 |isbn=978-1-78660-664-8 |oclc=1122448218 |chapter=4. Different Ontologies in Queer Theory}}</ref>

Butler offers a critique of the terms ''gender'' and ''sex'' as they have been used by feminists.<ref>{{cite book|title=Judith Butler|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t306.e100&srn=1&ssid=460269119#FIRSTHIT|publisher=Oxford reference Online Premium|isbn=978-0-19-953291-9|date=January 2010|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001}}</ref> Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make "women" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations.  Butler believes that feminists should not try to define "women" and they also believe that feminists should "focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement."<ref>{{cite book|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017}}</ref> Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be "flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of [[queer theory]].

===''Imitation and Gender Insubordination'' (1991)===
This is Butler's contribution to ''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories'', a collection of the writings of gay and lesbian social theorists. Butler argues that no transparent revelation is afforded by the terms "gay" or "lesbian" yet there is a political imperative to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Imitation and Gender Insubordination|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/gustafson/FILM%20165A.W11/film%20165A%5BW11%5D%20readings%20/Judith_Butler__Imitation_and_Gender_Insubordination.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Butler employs "the concepts of play/performance, drag, and imitation to describe the formation of gender and sexuality as continually created subjectivities always at risk of dissolution from non-performance."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ellis|first=Jason W.|date=2014-04-14|title=Recovered Writing, PhD in English, Queer Studies, Presentation on Judith Butler’s “Imitation and Gender Insubordination” and Introduction to Bodies That Matter Feb. 6, 2008|url=https://dynamicsubspace.net/2014/04/14/recovered-writing-phd-in-english-queer-studies-presentation-on-judith-butlers-imitation-and-gender-insubordination-and-introduction-to-bodies-that-matter-feb-6-2008/|access-date=2021-11-29|website=Dynamic Subspace|language=en}}</ref>

===''Bodies That Matter'' (1993)===
''Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"'' seeks to clear up readings and supposed misreadings of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.<ref>For example, {{Cite journal | last=Jeffreys | first=Sheila | author-link=Sheila Jeffreys | title = The queer disappearance of lesbians: Sexuality in the academy | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–472 | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(94)00051-4 | date = September–October 1994 }}</ref> Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of [[Derrida]]'s theory of iterability, which is a form of [[citationality]]:

<blockquote>Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed ''by'' a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |author-link=Judith Butler |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex" |url=https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl |url-access=registration |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl/page/95 95] |isbn=978-0-415-90365-3}}</ref></blockquote>

===''Excitable Speech'' (1997)===
{{further|Performativity#Judith Butler}}

In ''Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative'', Butler surveys the problems of [[hate speech]] and censorship. They argue that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.<ref name="Jagger">{{cite book |last=Jagger|first=Gill |title=Judith Butler: Sexual politics, social change and the power of the performative |url=https://archive.org/details/judithbutlersexu00jagg|url-access=limited|year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/judithbutlersexu00jagg/page/n121 115]–8 |isbn=978-0-415-21975-4 |ol=OL10187608M |lccn=2007032458}}</ref>

Butler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-0-415-91588-5|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/22 22]|quote="Similarly, MacKinnon's appeal to the state to construe pornography as performative speech and, hence, as the injurious conduct of representation, does not settle the theoretical question of the relation between representation and conduct, but collapses the distinction in order to enhance the power of state intervention over graphic sexual representation."|url=https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/22}}</ref>

Deploying [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s argument from the first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |author-link=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |url=https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl |url-access=registration |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/129 129–33] |isbn=978-0-415-91588-5}}</ref> As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th-century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control.<ref>For example, {{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |author-link=Michel Foucault |others=Trans. Robert Hurley |title=The History of Sexuality: An Introduction. Vol 1. |url=https://archive.org/details/historysexuality02fouc |url-access=limited |orig-year=1976 |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/historysexuality02fouc/page/n27 23] |quote=A censorship of sex? There was installed [since the 17th century] rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy.}}</ref> Extending this argument using [[Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic "I" is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; "If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech".<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |author-link=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |url=https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl |url-access=registration |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/excitablespeechp0000butl/page/140 140] |isbn=978-0-415-91588-5}}</ref>

===''Undoing Gender'' (2004)===
''[[Undoing Gender]]'' collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of their other books. Butler revisits and refines their notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing "restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life".

Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. Butler states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.<ref>Butler, Judith (2004). Undoing Gender. New York: Routledge</ref>

In Butler's discussion of intersex issues and people, Butler addresses the case of [[David Reimer]], a person whose sex was medically "reassigned" from male to female after a botched [[circumcision]] at eight months of age. Reimer was "made" female by doctors, but later in life identified as "really" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl'', which he wrote with [[John Colapinto]].  Reimer died by suicide in 2004.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://slate.com/id/2101678/ | title = Gender Gap: What were the real reasons behind David Reimer's suicide? | last = Colapinto | first = J | author-link = John Colapinto | magazine = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = June 3, 2004 | access-date = February 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110916170908/http://www.slate.com/id/2101678/ | archive-date = September 16, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===''Giving an Account of Oneself'' (2005)===
In ''Giving an Account of Oneself'', Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean Laplanche]], [[Adriana Cavarero]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. Butler theorizes the subject in relation to the social&nbsp;– a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical "I", in the first place.

Butler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.

{{quote|You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking "I" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final "irresponsibility," one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament (page 78).}}

Instead Butler argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|s2cid=143558617|date=2001|title=Giving an Account of Oneself|journal=Diacritics|volume=31|issue=4|pages=22–40|jstor=1566427|doi=10.1353/dia.2004.0002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Butler, Judith|title=Giving an account of oneself|date=2005|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=978-0-8232-3523-0|edition=1st|location=New York|lccn=2005017141|oclc=191818345|ol=OL23241953M}}</ref>

=== ''Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly'' (2015) ===
In ''Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly'', Butler discusses the power of public gatherings, considering what they signify and how they work.<ref name="Notes-Assembly">{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly |date=2015 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-49556-2 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Notes_Toward_a_Performative_Theory_of_As/hgRuCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |language=en}}</ref> They use this framework to analyze the power and possibilities of protests, such as the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests regarding the deaths of [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]] and [[Killing of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]] in 2014.

=== ''The Force of Nonviolence'' (2020) ===
In ''The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind'', Butler connects the ideologies of nonviolence and the political struggle for social equality. They review the traditional understanding of "nonviolence," stating that it "is often misunderstood as a passive practice that emanates from a calm region of the soul, or as an individualist ethical relation to existing forms of power."<ref name="Force of Nonviolence">{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind |date=2020 |publisher=Verso Books |isbn=978-1-78873-279-6 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Force_of_Nonviolence/-n6WDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |language=en}}</ref> Instead of this understanding, Butler argues that "nonviolence is an ethical position found in the midst of the political field."<ref name="Force of Nonviolence" />

Some academics and political activists maintain that Butler's radical departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and Butler's non-essentialist conception of gender—along with their insistence that power helps form the subject—revolutionized feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rottenberg|first=Catherine|title=Judith Butler|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5173|publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia|access-date=9 October 2013|date=27 August 2003}}</ref> [[Darin Barney]] of [[McGill University]] wrote that:

===Criticism===
In 1998, [[Denis Dutton]]'s journal ''Philosophy and Literature'' awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual "Bad Writing Competition", which set out to "celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles."<ref name="bad">{{cite web| url=http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm| first=Denis| last=Dutton| author-link=Denis Dutton| year=1998| title=Bad Writing Contest| access-date=September 14, 2009| archive-date=March 4, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022732/http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm| url-status=dead}}</ref> Butler's unwitting entry, which ran in a 1997 issue of the scholarly journal ''[[Diacritics (journal)|Diacritics]]'', ran thus:
{{quote|The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.<ref name="bad" />}}

Some critics have accused Butler of elitism due to their difficult prose style, while others claim that Butler reduces gender to "discourse" or promotes a form of gender voluntarism. [[Susan Bordo]], for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler's conception of gender as performative.<ref>Hekman, Susan (1998). "Material Bodies." ''Body and Flesh: a Philosophical Reader'' ed. by Donn Welton. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 61–70.</ref> A particularly vocal critic has been feminist [[Martha Nussbaum]], who has argued that Butler misreads [[J.&nbsp;L. Austin]]'s idea of [[performative utterance]], makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no "normative theory of social justice and human dignity."<ref name="The Professor Parody">{{cite news |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha |date=February 22, 1999 |title=The Professor of Parody |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/150687/professor-parody |work=The New Republic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803112258/http://www.akad.se/Nussbaum.pdf |archive-date=August 3, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/150687/professor-parody|title=The Professor of Parody|date=1999-02-22|work=The New Republic|access-date=2020-03-05|issn=0028-6583}}</ref> Finally, [[Nancy Fraser]]'s critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists.  Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances them from "everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves.&nbsp;... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?"<ref>Fraser, Nancy (1995). "False Antitheses." In Seyla Benhabib, Judith Butler, Drucilla Cornell and Nancy Fraser (eds.), ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange''. Routledge. p. 67.</ref>

Butler responded to criticisms of their prose in the preface to the 1999 edition of their book, ''Gender Trouble.''<ref name=interview2001>{{cite journal|last1=Breen|first1=Margaret Soenser|last2=Blumenfeld|first2=Warren J.|last3=Baer|first3=Susanna|last4=Brookey|first4=Robert Alan|last5=Hall|first5=Lynda|last6=Kirby|first6=Vicky|last7=Miller|first7=Diane Helene|last8=Shail|first8=Robert|last9=Wilson|first9=Natalie|s2cid=141316680|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|volume=6|issue=1/2|year=2001|pages=7–23|issn=1566-1768|doi=10.1023/A:1010133821926|title="There Is a Person Here": An Interview with Judith Butler}}</ref>

More recently, several critics—most prominently, [[Viviane Namaste]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Namaste|first1=Viviane|title=Undoing Theory: The "Transgender Question" and the Epistemic Violence of Anglo-American Feminist Theory|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=3|year=2009|pages=11–32|issn=0887-5367|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01043.x|s2cid=145627130}}</ref>
—have criticised Judith Butler's ''Undoing Gender'' for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like "gender politics" and "gender violence" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can "[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialised urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work", and produce instead "a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out".<ref>{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | page= 72 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250| doi= 10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | hdl= 10453/44221 | hdl-access= free }}</ref>

German feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] speaks of Butler's "radical intellectual games" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising their right to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex-marriage]] in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend [[Islam]], including [[Islamism]], from critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emma.de/artikel/eine-antwort-auf-butler-334719|title=Weiberzank – oder Polit-Kontroverse?|last=Alice Schwarzer schreibt|date=29 August 2017|website=Emma|language=de|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>

==Political activism==
Much of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and they served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://outrightinternational.org/content/outright-now-reunion-2018|title=OutRight Now: Reunion 2018|last=Jessica Stern|date=2018-07-23|website=Global LGBT Human Rights Organization {{!}} OutRight|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>  Over the years, Butler has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements.<ref name="mcgill" /> They have also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay.  More recently, Butler has been active in the [[Occupy movement]] and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 BDS ([[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]]) campaign against Israel. They emphasize that [[Israel]] does not and should not be taken to represent all [[Jews]] or Jewish opinion.<ref name="Derstandard15">{{cite news |url=http://derstandard.at/1347492636246/US-Philosophin-Butler-Israel-vertritt-mich-nicht |title=US-Philosophin Butler: Israel vertritt mich nicht |newspaper=[[Der Standard]] |date=15 September 2012 |access-date=15 September 2012|language=de-AT}}</ref>

On September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized [[teach-in]] against the [[2006 Lebanon War]] at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web| title=Coming attractions for fall 2006| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/09/06_eventspreview2.shtml|publisher=UC Berkeley| access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref> Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the [[Christopher Street Day]] (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. They cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, Butler went on to name several groups that they commended as stronger opponents of "homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism".<ref>Butler, Judith. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9dd6r361k I must distance myself from this complicity with racism (Video)]  Christopher Street Day 'Civil Courage Prize' Day Refusal Speech. June 19, 2010.</ref>

In October 2011, Butler attended [[Occupy Wall Street]] and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, they said:

<blockquote>People have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible&nbsp;– that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/10/24/judith_butler_at_occupy_wall_street/|title=Judith Butler at Occupy Wall Street|date=October 24, 2011|website=Salon.com|access-date=December 4, 2017|author=Justin Elliott}}</ref>

===Adorno Prize affair===
When Butler received the 2012 [[Theodor W. Adorno Award|Adorno Prize]], the prize committee came under attack from Israel's Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman; the director of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]'s office in Jerusalem, [[Efraim Zuroff]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Envoy-to-Germany-Awardee-ignores-terror-on-Israel|title=Envoy to Germany: Awardee ignores terror on Israel|last=BENJAMIN WEINTHAL|date=2012-08-28|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref> and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler's selection because of Butler's remarks about Israel and specifically Butler's "calls for a boycott against Israel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4274289,00.html|title=German Jews oppose award for US philosopher|date=August 29, 2012|website=Ynetnews.com|access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Butler responded saying that "[Butler] did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally".<ref name=":1" /> Rather, they wrote, the attacks are "directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies".<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last=JTA|title=Frankfurt ripped for honoring Jewish-American scholar who backs Israel boycott|journal=Haaretz|date=7 September 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/frankfurt-ripped-for-honoring-jewish-american-scholar-who-backs-israel-boycott-1.463424|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref>

In a letter to the ''[[Mondoweiss]]'' website, Butler asserted that they developed strong ethical views on the basis of Jewish philosophical thought and that it is "blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating".<ref name=mondoweiss>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Judith Butler responds to attack: 'I affirm a Judaism that is not associated with state violence'|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2012/08/judith-butler-responds-to-attack-i-affirm-a-judaism-that-is-not-associated-with-state-violence.html|publisher=Mondoweiss|access-date=9 October 2013|date=27 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228153648/http://mondoweiss.net/2012/08/judith-butler-responds-to-attack-i-affirm-a-judaism-that-is-not-associated-with-state-violence.html|archive-date=December 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Comments on Hamas and Hezbollah ===

Butler was criticized for statements they had made about [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]]. Butler was accused of describing them as "social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left."<ref>Petra Marquardt-Bigman, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/09/07/defending-judith-butler-in-the-ivory-tower/ "Defending Judith Butler in The Ivory Tower"], ''The Algemeiner Journal'', September 7, 2012.</ref> They were accused of defending "Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations" and supporting their tactics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weinthal|first=Benjamin|title=Frankfurt to award US advocate of Israel boycott|journal=The Jerusalem Post|date=26 August 2012|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Frankfurt-to-award-US-advocate-of-Israel-boycott|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Illouz|first=Eva|title=Judith Butler gets a taste of her own politics|journal=Haaretz|date=20 September 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/judith-butler-gets-a-taste-of-her-own-politics-1.465861|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref>

Butler responded to these criticisms by stating that their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, their established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented. Butler describes the origin of their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way:
<blockquote>I was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to "the global left" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.<ref name="mondoweiss" /></blockquote>

=== Comments on Black Lives Matter ===

In a January 2015 interview with [[George Yancy]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Butler discussed the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. They said:
{{Quote
|text= What is implied by this statement [Black Lives Matter], a statement that should be obviously true, but apparently is not? If black lives do not matter, then they are not really regarded as lives, since a life is supposed to matter. So what we see is that some lives matter more than others, that some lives matter so much that they need to be protected at all costs, and that other lives matter less, or not at all. And when that becomes the situation, then the lives that do not matter so much, or do not matter at all, can be killed or lost, can be exposed to conditions of destitution, and there is no concern, or even worse, that is regarded as the way it is supposed to be...When people engage in concerted actions across racial lines to build communities based on equality, to defend the rights of those who are disproportionately imperiled to have a chance to live without the fear of dying quite suddenly at the hands of the police. There are many ways to do this, in the street, the office, the home, and in the media. Only through such an ever-growing cross-racial struggle against racism can we begin to achieve a sense of all the lives that really do matter.
}} 
The dialogue draws heavily on their 2004 book ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yancy|first1=George|last2=Butler|first2=Judith|title=What's Wrong With 'All Lives Matter'?|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/whats-wrong-with-all-lives-matter/?_r=0|access-date=7 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 January 2015}}</ref>

===Avital Ronell sexual harassment case===
On May 11, 2018, Butler led a group of scholars in writing a letter to [[New York University]] following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor [[Avital Ronell]]. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the [[Title IX]] complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a "malicious campaign" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed "malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare" for a highly regarded scholar. "If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed."<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Battle-Over-Alleged-Harassment/244295|title=Battle Over Alleged Harassment Escalates as Former Graduate Student Sues Professor and NYU|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=August 16, 2018|last1=Mangan|first1=Katherine}}</ref> Butler, the chief signatory, invoked their title as President Elect of the [[Modern Language Association]]. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from their post. He argued that "Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty's privilege of impunity.&nbsp;... [Butler] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over.

Butler said in 2020 that [[trans-exclusionary radical feminism]] is "a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen."<ref>{{cite news |title=Judith Butler on the culture wars, JK Rowling and living in “anti-intellectual times” |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2020/09/judith-butler-culture-wars-jk-rowling-and-living-anti-intellectual-times |access-date=17 November 2021 |work=New Statesman}}</ref> In 2021 she described the [[anti-gender movement]]s as [[fascism|fascist]] trends and cautioned self-declared feminists from allying with such movements in targeting trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=Why is the idea of ‘gender’ provoking backlash the world over? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2021/oct/23/judith-butler-gender-ideology-backlash |work=The Guardian|access-date=17 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Judith Butler says the ‘anti-gender ideology movement’ is a dangerous ‘fascist trend’ |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/26/judith-butler-anti-gender-ideology/ |access-date=18 November 2021 |work=Pink News}}</ref> Butler also explored the issue in a 2019 paper in which she argued that "the confusion of discourses is part of what constitutes the fascist structure and appeal of at least some of these [anti-gender] movements. One can oppose gender as a cultural import from the North at the same time that one can see that very opposition as a social movement against further colonization of the South. The result is not a turn to the Left, but an embrace of ethno-nationalism."<ref name=Butler2019>{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=Judith |title=What Threat?

====''The Guardian'' interview====
On September 7, 2021, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an interview<ref name="Guardian interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/07/judith-butler-interview-gender |title=Judith Butler: 'We need to rethink the category of woman' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 7, 2021 |accessdate=September 8, 2021 |last=Gleeson|first=Jules}}</ref> of Butler by Jules Gleeson that included Butler's critique of [[Feminist views on transgender topics#Gender critical feminism/trans-exclusionary radical feminism|trans-exclusionary feminists]] ("gender critical feminists" or "[[TERF]]s").

''The Guardian'' was then accused of censoring Judith Butler for having compared TERFs to fascists. British writer [[Roz Kaveney]] called it "a truly shocking moment of bigoted dishonesty", while British transgender activist and writer [[Juno Dawson]], among others, observed that ''The Guardian'' had inadvertently triggered the [[Streisand effect]], in which an attempt to censor yields the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of a topic.<ref name="Guardian accused of censoring">{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/09/08/judith-butler-guardian-interview-terf-trans/ |title=The Guardian accused of 'censoring' Judith Butler interview comparing TERFs to fascists: 'Cowards' |work=[[PinkNews]] |date=September 8, 2021 |accessdate=September 8, 2021 |author=Wakefield, Lily}}</ref> The next day, ''The Guardian'' acknowledged "a failure in our editorial standards".<ref name="Guardian censored"/>
