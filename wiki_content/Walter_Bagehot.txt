'''Walter Bagehot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|dʒ|ə|t}} {{respell|BAJ|ət}}; 3 February 1826&nbsp;– 24 March 1877) was a British journalist, businessman, and essayist, who wrote extensively about government, economics, literature and race. He is known for co-founding the ''[[National Review (1855)|National Review]]'' in 1855, and for his works ''[[The English Constitution]]'' and ''[[Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market]]'' (1873).

==Life==
Bagehot was born in [[Langport]], [[Somerset]], [[England]], on 3 February 1826. His father, Thomas Watson Bagehot, was managing director and vice-chairman of [[Stuckey's Bank]]. He attended [[University College London]] (UCL), where he studied mathematics, and in 1848 earned a master's degree in moral philosophy.<ref>[[Richard Holt Hutton|Hutton, Richard Holt]] (1915). [https://archive.org/stream/worksandlifewal00barrgoog#page/n6/mode/2up "Memoirs."] In: ''The Works and Life of Walter Bagehot,'' Vol. 1. London: Longmans, Green, and Co., pp. 1–54.</ref> Bagehot was [[Call to the Bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], but preferred to join his father in 1852 in his family's shipping and banking business.

In 1858, Bagehot married Elizabeth (Eliza) Wilson (1832–1921), whose father, [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]], was the founder and owner of  ''[[The Economist]]''; the couple were happily married until Bagehot's untimely death at age 51, but had no children.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=David H.|title=Walter Bagehot: A Brief Biography|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/bagehot/bio.html|website=The Victorian Web|access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref>  A collection of their love-letters was published in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women's Studies Subject Guide: Eliza Wilson|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/arc/collection/womensstudies/wilson.html|website=University Archives|publisher=The University of Hull|access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref>

===Journalism===
In 1855, Bagehot founded the ''[[National Review (1855)|National Review]]'' with his friend [[Richard Holt Hutton]].<ref>[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=9428981 ''Walter Bagehot'' by St. Norman John-Stevas The British Council/National Book League/Longmans, Greene & Co.] London.

In the 17 years he served as its editor, Bagehot expanded ''The Economist'''s reporting on politics and increased its influence among policymakers.  He was widely accepted by the British Establishment and was elected to the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]] in 1875.

===Works===
[[File:Walter Bagehot, The English Constitution (1st ed, 1867, title page).jpg|thumb|200px|Title page of the first edition of Bagehot's ''[[The English Constitution]]'', 1867.<ref name="English Constitution">{{citation|author=Walter Bagehot|title=The English Constitution|edition=1st|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|year=1867|oclc=60724184|title-link=:File:Walter Bagehot, The English Constitution (1st ed, 1867).pdf}}.</ref>]]

In 1867, Bagehot wrote ''[[The English Constitution]]'',<ref name="English Constitution"/> a book that explores the nature of the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]], specifically its [[United Kingdom|Parliament]] and [[United Kingdom|monarchy]]. It appeared at the same time that Parliament enacted the [[Reform Act of 1867]], requiring Bagehot to write an extended introduction to the second edition which appeared in 1872.

Bagehot also wrote ''[[Physics and Politics]]'' (1872),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101019642824;view=2up;seq=528;size=150 |title=Physics and Politics. No. I. The Pre-Economic Age. |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |date=November 1867 |website=Hathi Trust |publisher=Fortnightly Review |access-date=17 July 2018 |quote= This three-part article was published over the course of three years in the Fortnightly Review: the first section was published in November, 1867; the second section in April, 1868; and the third in July, 1869.}}</ref> in which he examines how civilisations sustain themselves, arguing that in their earliest phase civilisations are very much in opposition to the values of modern liberalism, insofar as they are sustained by conformism and military success, but once they are secured it is possible for them to mature into systems which allow for greater diversity and freedom. His viewpoint was based on a distinction between the qualities of an “accomplished man” and those of a “rude man”, which he considered the result of iterative inheritances by which the “nervous organisation” of the individual became increasingly refined through the generations.<ref name="Black Deficit">{{cite web |last1=Shilliam |first1=Robbie |title=How Black Deficit Entered the British Academy |url=https://robbieshilliam.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/how-black-deficit-entered-the-british-academy.pdf |website=robbieshilliam.wordpress.com |publisher=Robbie Shilliam |access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref> He regarded this distinction as a moral achievement whereby through the actions of the will, this “accomplished“ elite was able to morally differentiate themselves from “rude men“ by a “hereditary drill“. He equally applied such reasoning to develop a form of [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[scientific racism|racism]], whereby those of [[mixed race]] lacked any “inherited creed” or “fixed traditional sentiments” upon which, he considered, human nature depended. He attempted to provide empirical support for his views by citing [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Edward Tylor]], although neither of them accepted such arguments for hereditary difference in their writings on [[human evolution]]. Tylor in particular rejected Bagehot's view of the centrality of physical heredity and that the modern “savage“ mind was “tattooed over with monstrous images” by which base instincts had been preserved in crevices, as opposed to the accomplished European man, for whom such instincts had been smoothed away through inherited will to exercise reason.<ref name="Black Deficit"/>

In ''[[Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market]]'' (1873) Bagehot seeks to explain the world of finance and banking.<ref>"Bagehot and International Lending". by Professor M. Lipton. ''The Financial Times'' (London, England), Tuesday, June 12, 1984; p. 17; edition 29,344.</ref> His observations on finance are often cited by [[central bank]]ers, most recently in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]] which began in 2007. Of particular importance is "[[Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market#Lender of last resort|Bagehot's Dictum]]" that in times of financial crisis central banks should lend freely to solvent [[depository institutions]], yet only against sound [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] and at [[interest rates]] high enough to dissuade those borrowers that are not genuinely in need.<ref>Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, Bank of England, [http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2009/speech390.pdf "The Repertoire of Official Sector Interventions in the Financial System: Last Resort Lending, Market-Making, and Capital"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220193000/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2009/speech390.pdf |date=20 February 2012 }}, Bank of Japan 2009 International Conference, 27–28 May 2009, p. 5</ref>

===Legacy===
[[File:Bagehot - Lombard Street, 1873 - 5747415.tif|thumb|200px|''Lombard Street'', 1873.]]
Bagehot never fully recovered from a bout of [[pneumonia]] he suffered in 1867, and he died in 1877 from complications of what was said to be a cold.<ref>Roger Kimball, [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/bagehot-kimball-2990 "The Greatest Victorian"], ''The New Criterion'' October 1998.</ref> Collections of Bagehot's literary, political, and economic essays were published after his death. Their subjects ranged from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] to the price of silver. In honour of his contributions, ''[[The Economist]]'''s weekly commentary on current affairs in the UK is entitled "Bagehot". Every year, the British [[Political Studies Association]] awards the Walter Bagehot Prize for the best dissertation in the field of government and [[public administration]].

Minor planet [[2901 Bagehot]] discovered by [[Luboš Kohoutek]] is named in his honor.<ref>{{cite book|title=(2901) Bagehot In: Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |pages = 238|publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-29925-7 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_2902|chapter = (2901) Bagehot}}</ref>

{{as of|June 2021}}, [[Adrian Wooldridge]], [[political editor]] of ''The Economist'', continues to write a weekly column entitled "Bagehot", described as "an analysis of British life and politics, in the tradition of Walter Bagehot".<ref>{{cite news | title=Adrian Wooldridge | newspaper=[[The Economist]] | url=https://mediadirectory.economist.com/people/mr-adrian-wooldridge/ | access-date=19 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=What can Britain today learn from Walter Bagehot? | newspaper=The Economist | date=3 January 2020 | url=https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2020/01/03/what-can-britain-today-learn-from-walter-bagehot | access-date=19 June 2021}}</ref>
