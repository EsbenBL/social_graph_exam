'''John M. Darley''' (April 3, 1938 – August 31, 2018) was an American [[social psychologist]] and professor of [[Psychology]] and Public Affairs at [[Princeton University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jdarley |title=Bio |publisher=wws.princeton.edu |date= |access-date=2017-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812041648/http://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jdarley |archive-date=2018-08-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Darley is best known, in collaboration with [[Bibb Latané]], for developing theories that aim to explain why people might not intervene (i.e. offer aid) at the scene of an [[medical emergency|emergency]] when others are present; this phenomenon is known as the [[Bystander Effect|bystander effect]] and the accompanying [[Diffusion of responsibility|diffusion of responsibility]] effect. This work stemmed from the tragic case of [[Kitty Genovese]], a New Yorker who was [[murder]]ed in March 1964 while 38 people either witnessed or heard her struggling with the assailant.<ref>Latané, B., & Darley, J. M. (1970). The unresponsive bystander: Why doesn't he help? New York: Appleton-Century-Croft</ref> Darley also studied the effect of assessment on performance and proposed Darley's Law, which states that “The more any quantitative performance measure is used to determine an individual’s rewards, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more it will distort the action and thought patterns of those it is intended to monitor.” <ref>Darley J.M.

After hearing of the tragic case of [[Murder of Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese]],<ref name=":2" /> he was inspired to explore why people are less likely to intervene when there are other witnesses present, a phenomenon is the “Bystander effect”. With collaborator, Bibb Latané from Columbia University, Darley developed and conducted experiments to explore the bystander effect and understand the circumstances that create it.<ref name=":1" />

From the mid 1970’s to the mid 1980’s Darley turned his attention to pioneering efforts aimed at applying psychology to engineering and energy conservation.<ref name=":2" /> He worked with colleagues on how behavioral ideas can be used in energy conservation to better the environment and economy.<ref name=":3" />

At the end of his career, Darley’s focus changed to the average person’s conceptions of law and the legal system. This interest of his turned into his main line of research.<ref name=":0" /> Darley saw the current reformatory strategy used in prison system as a poor one, he wanted to develop a psychology based reform strategy.<ref name=":4" />
