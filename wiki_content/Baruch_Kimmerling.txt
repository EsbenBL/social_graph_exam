==Biography==
Baruch Kimmerling was born in the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Turda]], [[Romania]] in 1939.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|last=Joffe|first=Lawrence|title=Obituary: Baruch Kimmerling|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/26/guardianobituaries.israel|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 June 2007}}</ref> He was born with [[cerebral palsy]], a developmental disability which would confine him to a wheelchair for the last three decades of his life.<ref name=haaretz1>{{cite news|last=Haaretz Staff|title=Sociologist Baruch Kimmerling, 'new historian,' dies at age 67|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/sociologist-baruch-kimmerling-new-historian-dies-at-age-67-1.221183|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=Haaretz|date=22 May 2007}}</ref> His family narrowly avoided the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] by escaping from Turda in a [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Romani wagon]] in 1944, after rumors of the imminent deportation of the Jews began circulating. During the journey, the wagon was strafed by a German plane. When the Kimmerling family returned to Turda after the war had ended, they discovered their property had gone.<ref name=guardian/> The family immigrated to [[Israel]] in 1952, and took up residence in a [[Ma'abarot|ma'abara]] (immigrants' camp), Sha'ar ha-Aliya, before moving to a small apartment on the outskirts of [[Netanya]].<ref name=haaretz2>{{cite news|last=Karpel|first=Dalia|title=A life less ordinary|url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-life-less-ordinary-1.202850|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=Haaretz|date=19 October 2006}}</ref>

Despite his significant disabilities, which caused Kimmerling to experience motor difficulties and speech problems, his parents raised him as a typical child and encouraged him to strive high.<ref name=haaretz2/> Exempt from conscription into the [[Israel Defense Forces]], Kimmerling enrolled in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1963, and obtained his [[PhD]] in 1973 as a [[sociologist]].<ref name=guardian/> Kimmerling was known for his work analyzing pre-1948 Jewish settlement in Palestine in terms of [[colonialism]].<ref name=haaretz1/> He lectured widely and wrote nine books and hundreds of essays.<ref name=guardian/> He also wrote numerous newspaper articles, in venues such as ''[[Haaretz]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.<ref name=haaretz1/><ref name=guardian/> He held a chair at the [[University of Toronto]].<ref name=guardian/>

In August 1975, he married Diana Aidan, a [[Libya]]n-born immigrant from [[Italy]] who had moved to Israel from [[Naples]] in 1967, and was a doctoral student under Professor [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]]. She gave up her professional career to become a homemaker. The couple had three children: Shira (born 1976), Eli (born 1978), and Naama (born 1981).<ref name=haaretz2/>

Kimmerling was an outspoken critic of Israeli policies, and spoke out on issues related to the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]].<ref name=thetimes/> He was dubbed one of Israel's [[New Historians]], and himself insisted that he was a patriotic [[Zionism|Zionist]] dedicated to celebrating the diversities of cultures within Israel, and to the ideals of a secular state.<ref name=haaretz2/> Kimmerling was an [[atheism|atheist]], and lamented the inability of Jews and Arabs to "separate religion from nationality."<ref name=guardian/> Unlike some critics of Israeli policy, he publicly opposed the proposed [[Academic boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israeli academics]] by the [[Association of University Teachers]] in the [[United Kingdom]], arguing that it would "weaken the last public sphere of free thinking and free speech in Israel."<ref>{{cite news|last=Lynfield|first=Ben|title=British boycott riles Israeli academics|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0512/p06s01-wome.html|accessdate=10 September 2011|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=12 May 2005}}</ref>

Kimmerling died at the age of 67 after a long battle with [[cancer]].<ref name=haaretz1/> He was buried in the secular cemetery at [[Mishmarot|Kibbutz Mishmarot]], leaving his wife, Diana Aidan, and three children.<ref name=haaretz1/>
