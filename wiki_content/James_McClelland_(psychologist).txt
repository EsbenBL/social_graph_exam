'''James Lloyd''' "'''Jay'''" '''McClelland''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born December 1, 1948) is the Lucie Stern Professor at [[Stanford University]], where he was formerly the chair of the [[Psychology]] Department.<ref>{{cite web|title=James L. McClelland VITA|url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/McClelland_VITA.pdf|access-date=1 Oct 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090928/http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/McClelland_VITA.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-06}}</ref>  He is best known for his work on statistical learning and [[Parallel Distributed Processing]], applying [[connectionist]] models (or [[neural networks]]) to explain cognitive phenomena such as [[spoken word recognition]] and [[visual word recognition]]. McClelland is to a large extent responsible for the large increase in scientific interest in connectionism in the 1980s.

== Early life and education ==
McClelland was born on December 1, 1948 to Walter Moore and Frances (Shaffer) McClelland. He received a B.A. in Psychology from [[Columbia University]] in 1970, and a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1975. He married Heidi Marsha Feldman on May 6, 1978, and has two daughters.<ref name = Marquis>{{cite web | url =http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100016862073 | title = Profile details: James Lloyd McClelland | access-date = August 7, 2012}}</ref>

== Career ==

In 1986 McClelland published ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition''<ref>{{cite book|author=David E. Rumelhart, James L. McClelland and PDP Research Group|title=Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition|year=1987|url=https://archive.org/details/paralleldistribu00rume|isbn=9780262680530|url-access=registration}}</ref> with [[David Rumelhart]], which some still regard as a bible for [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]]. His present work focuses on learning, memory processes, and [[psycholinguistics]], still within the framework of connectionist models.  He is a former chair of the [[Rumelhart Prize]] committee, having collaborated with Rumelhart for many years, and himself received the award in 2010 at the Cognitive Science Society Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon.

McClelland and [[David Rumelhart]] are known for their debate with [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Alan Prince]] regarding the necessity of a language-specific learning module.

In fall 2006 McClelland moved to [[Stanford University]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where he was a professor of psychology and [[Cognitive neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience]]. He also holds a part-time appointment as Consulting Professor at the Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit (NARU) within the School of Psychological Sciences, [[University of Manchester]].
