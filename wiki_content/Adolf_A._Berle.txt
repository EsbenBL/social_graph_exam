'''Adolf Augustus Berle Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|l|i}}; January 29, 1895 – February 17, 1971) was an American lawyer, educator, author, and diplomat.<ref>{{cite book |first = Charles Earle |last = Funk |author-link = Charles Earle Funk |title =  What's the name, please? A guide to the correct pronunciation of current prominent names |location = New York |publisher = Funk & Wagnalls |year = 1936 |oclc = 1463642}}</ref> He was the author of ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', a groundbreaking work on [[corporate governance]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], and an important member of US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s "[[Brain Trust]]."

==Early life==
Berle was born in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the son of Mary Augusta (Wright) and Adolf Augustus Berle.<ref>http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu:8000/findbrow.cgi?collection=Berle,+Adolf+A.</ref> He entered [[Harvard College]] at age 14, earning a bachelor's degree in 1913 and a master's degree in 1914. He then enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]]. In 1916, at age 21, he became the second youngest graduate in the school's history, behind only [[Louis Brandeis]].<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Transaction Man'', 26</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Upon graduation Berle joined the [[US military]]. His first assignment as an [[intelligence officer]] was to assist in increasing sugar production in [[the Dominican Republic]] by working out property and contractual conflicts among rural landowners. Immediately after [[World War I]], Berle became a member of the American delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], advocating for smaller nations' rights of self-determination. In 1919, Berle moved to New York City and became a member of the [[law firm]] of Berle, Berle and Brunner.

===''The Modern Corporation and Private Property''===
Berle became a professor of [[corporate law]] at [[Columbia Law School]] in 1927 and remained on the faculty until retiring in 1964. He is best known for his groundbreaking work in [[corporate governance]] that he co-authored, with economist [[Gardiner Means]], ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]''. It is the most quoted text in corporate governance studies. Berle and Means showed that the means of production in the US economy were highly concentrated in the hands of the largest 200 corporations, and within the large corporations, managers controlled firms despite shareholders' formal ownership.
Berle theorized that the facts of [[market concentration|economic concentration]] meant that the effects of [[competitive-price theory]] were largely mythical.<ref>Title: Corporate Responsibility, Business Motivation, and Reality. Author: Henry G. Manne. Publication: The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. Date: 1962. Page: 57. Online: [http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/343/1/55]</ref> While some advocated [[trust busting]], breaking up the concentrations of firms into smaller entities to restore competitive forces, Berle believed that that would be economically inefficient. Instead, he argued for government regulation and became identified with the school of business statesmanship, which advocated that corporate leadership accept (and theorized that they had, to a great extent, already accepted) that they must fulfill responsibilities toward society in addition to their traditional responsibilities toward shareholders.<ref>Title: Corporate Responsibility, Business Motivation, and Reality. Author: Henry G. Manne. Publication: The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. Date: 1962. Page: 55. Online: [http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/343/1/55]</ref> Corporate law should reflect this new reality, he wrote in ''The Modern Corporation'': "The law of corporations, accordingly, might well be considered as a potential constitutional law for the new economic state, while business practice is increasingly assuming the aspect of economic statesmanship."<ref>p. 313, 1932 edition</ref>
===Roosevelt's Brain Trust===
Berle was an original member of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s "[[Brain Trust]]", a group of advisers who developed policy recommendations. Berle's focuses ranging from economic recovery to diplomatic strategy<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v007/7.3houck.pdf FDR’S Commonwealth Club Address: Redefining Individualism, Adjudicating Greatness, by Davis W. Houck]</ref> during Roosevelt's [[1932 U.S. presidential election|1932 election]] campaign. Roosevelt's "[[Commonwealth Club Address]]", a speech written by Berle on government involvement in industrial and economic policy, was ranked in 2000 as the second-best presidential campaign speech of the 20th century by public address scholars.<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v007/7.3houck.pdf Stephen E. Lucas and Martin J. Medhurst, "American Public Address: The Top One Hundred Speeches of the Twentieth Century," paper presented at the National Communication Association, November 2000, Seattle, Washington. Cited in FDR’S Commonwealth Club Address: Redefining Individualism, Adjudicating Greatness, by Davis W. Houck]</ref>
While remaining an informal adviser of Roosevelt after the election, Berle returned to [[New York City]] and became a key consultant in the successful mayoral election campaign of reformer [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]. 
From 1934 to 1938, Berle managed the city's fiscal affairs as its last [[chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]].
 
===Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs===
{{Further|Foreign policy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration}}
Then, from 1938 to 1944, Berle was Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=Liberal: Adolf A. Berle and the Vision of an American Era |first=Jonathan A. |last=Schwarz |year=1987 |location=London |publisher=Collier Macmillan |isbn=0-02-929170-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/liberaladolfaber00schw }}</ref> Berle's official duties in New York City and as an Assistant Secretary of State did not limit his perception of his real responsibilities or expertise, and in any case, Roosevelt appreciated both his speech-writing skills and his advice on a wide range of international and economic concerns.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> As a result, throughout the Roosevelt administration Berle consulted on important international and industrial New Deal projects, such as creation of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], development of the administration's [[Good Neighbor Policy]] toward Latin America, and establishment of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Outside of Latin America, Berle argued "that control of the incomparable energy reserves of the Middle East would yield 'substantial control of the world.'"<ref>{{cite news |author-link=Noam Chomsky |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |date=April 21, 2011 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/04/21/global_empire_united_states_iraq_noam_chomsky |title=Is the world too big to fail? |work=[[Salon.com]] }}</ref>
by 1941, Berle had charge of the intelligence activities in the State Department, working with the FBI in Latin America and the OSS in Europe.<ref>Christopher Andrew, ''For the President's eyes only: Secret intelligence and the American presidency from Washington to Bush'' (1996) pp 127-31.</ref> He was in touch with anti-fascist and anti-Communist Europeans, with the goal of building a liberal democratic coalition in Europe. Berle became entangled in incessant turf wars among intelligence agencies. Critics on the left accused him of being too hostile toward Moscow, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull was annoyed at his access to Roosevelt. In 1944 he was reassigned to take charge of negotiation with the Allies regarding a postwar commercial aviation agreement.<ref>Alan P. Dobson, "The Other Air Battle: The American Pursuit of Post-War Civil Aviation Rights." ''The Historical Journal'' 28.2 (1985): 429-439.</ref>
===National Lawyers Guild===

In 1939, Berle became an early member of the [[National Lawyers Guild]] (NLG) (1937&ndash;present).  According to the NLG's ''A History of the National Lawyers Guild 1937-1987'', two factions arose as early as 1940.  External events heightening these tensions included the [[Hitler-Stalin Pact]] of September (1939), the Russian invasion of Finland (1940).  One faction, led by Berle and [[Morris Ernst]], supported [[New Deal]] policies.  The other, led by [[Osmond Fraenkel]] and [[Thomas I. Emerson]], supported freedom of speech and press as well as Anti-Fascism (seen at the time as a [[Popular Front]] stance, thus pro-Communist).  Other issues supported by Fraenkel, Emerson, the National Executive Board and many chapters included: support for Loyalist Spain, criticism of [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the FBI, and support for labor unions.  Berle and Ernst recommended anti-communist oaths, which Fraenkel and Emerson opposed.  Many Berle and Ernst supporters left the NLG by 1940.  During the NLG's 1940 convention, newly elected president [[Robert W. Kenny]] of California and secretary [[Martin Popper]] of New York sought to persuade members to return.  During a phone call from Kenny, Berle gave him a short list of lawyers to leave as a simple matter of "cleaning house":  Kenny rejected the request.<ref name=history1937-1987>

===Alger Hiss===
During his tenure as Assistant Secretary of State, Berle rented [[Woodley Mansion]], which had once been owned by [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], from secretary of war [[Henry Stimson]] in 1939.  On September 2, [[Whittaker Chambers]] arrived at Woodley to tell Berle that several senior government officials, including [[Alger Hiss]], a respected member of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], were members of a Soviet "apparatus" designed to influence US policy and pass classified documents and information to the Soviets. Chambers's autobiography asserts that Berle and the journalist who set up the meeting, [[Isaac Don Levine]], met with Roosevelt and conveyed what Chambers told them, but Roosevelt unequivocally refused to take any action.<ref>{{cite book |first=W. |last=Chambers |title=Witness |url=https://archive.org/details/witnesscham00cham |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1952 }}</ref> Hiss remained at the State Department during and after the war in positions, including as Roosevelt's principal adviser on Soviet affairs at the Yalta conference, as a delegate to the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and as Secretary General of the San Francisco conference establishing the United Nations. In 1948, Chambers repeated his accusations to the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]].  Hiss denied the accusation in testimony to the Committee, leading to his trial and conviction for perjury. Berle provided incorrect and misleading testimony before the House Committee about his meeting with Chambers, which was contradicted by both his notes taken subsequent to the meeting and a personal diary entry that acknowledged that Chambers had implicated Hiss in espionage.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Explaining Berle's evasive testimony, [[Allen Weinstein]] wrote in his book ''Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case'': "His major concern in 1948, at a time when Berle was a Liberal Party leader in New York working for [[1948 United States presidential election|Truman's election]], was to defuse, if possible, the influence of anti-Communist sentiment and of the case itself in that election year."<ref>{{cite book |first=Allen |last=Weinstein |title=Perjury: The Hiss Chambers Case |publisher=Alfred A.

In 1943, Berle's duties in the State Department involved political supervision of the various clandestine activities necessitated by the war.  Working with his assistant [[Charles W. Yost]], Berle liaised with the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], and with the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Berle also was a major architect in the development of federal farm and home owners' mortgage programs and in the expansion of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3468301170.html Democracy and the New Deal] encyclopedia.com, accessed May 4, 2010</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1944.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=June 16, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002054/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf| archive-date= 25 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===After World War II===
After the war, Berle served as [[Ambassador]] to [[Brazil]] from 1945 to 1946. In October 1945, two days after the [[List of deposed politicians|deposition]] of president [[Getulio Vargas]], Berle pledged for the freedom of the Brazilian communists who were being incarcerated by the government since the beginning of the month.<ref name=ditder>{{Cite book |author=Gaspari, Elio|title=A Ditadura Derrotada|edition= 2|place=Rio de Janeiro |editor= Editora Intrínseca|year=2014 |page=121|isbn= 978-85-8057-432-6|author-link=Elio Gaspari}}</ref>

He then returned to his academic career at Columbia. Berle was a founding member of the [[Liberal Party of New York]], a breakaway faction of the [[American Labor Party]], which had lost support as a result of its sponsorship of Congressman [[Vito Marcantonio]], a Communist sympathizer. For nearly a decade, Berle served as chairman of the Liberal Party. His main goal was to fight off far-left and Communist influences. He also chaired the [[Twentieth Century Fund]] for the two decades following World War II.

Berle briefly returned to government service for the first half of 1961, serving under President [[John F. Kennedy]] as head of an interdepartmental task force on [[Latin America]]n affairs. During that time, he was primarily involved in forming the US response to a newly communist Cuba, which included both the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] and the initiation of the [[Alliance for Progress]], an economic development policy aimed at the region.<ref name="ReferenceA" />{{rp|325–334}}

Berle continued to write academic work related to corporate law. His article on "Property, Production and Revolution" was a key statement of the theory behind the [[Great Society]] program of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

==Personal life==
Adolf Berle married Beatrice Bishop (1902–1993), the daughter of [[Cortlandt Field Bishop]] (1870–1935) and Amy Bend (1870-1957), in 1927.  Beatrice was the granddaughter [[George Hoffman Bend]] (1838–1900), a member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and prominent in New York Society. Adolf and Beatrice had two daughters and a son. His son had ten children.<ref name=beatrice>{{cite news |first=Shawn G.|last=Kennedy|title=Beatrice Berle, 90, A Doctor, Teacher And Medical Writer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/obituaries/beatrice-berle-90-a-doctor-teacher-and-medical-writer.html|date=14 June 1993|publisher=New York Times Times|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref>

==Legacy==
According to historian Ellis W. Hawley:
:Of the “service intellectuals” helping to shape modern American government, Adolf Berle was one of the most brilliant, versatile, and influential. Moving in and out of governmental positions, attaching himself to rising men of power, and overwhelming weaker personalities with the sheer force of his intellect and the amazing breadth of his expertise, he helped to shape and Implement new policies in such diverse areas as corporate taxation, railroad reorganization, trade relations, sugar controls, Latin American affairs, and urban planning. Through his writings, moreover, he became a leading articulator and shaper of what later scholars would call “[[Corporate liberalism]].” In ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]],'' he not only documented the rise of a managerial elite but set forth the possibility of its becoming a “neutral technocracy” imbued with an overriding sense of social responsibility and public trusteeship.<ref> Ellis W. Hawley, “Berle, Adolph Augustus” in John A. Garraty, ed. ''Encyclopedia of American Biography'' (2nd ed. 1996) p. 94 [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780062700179/page/94/mode/2up online] </ref>
