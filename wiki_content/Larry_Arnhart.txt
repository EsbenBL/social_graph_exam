==Background and career==
He has a Ph.D. in Political Science from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1977, an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1974, and a B.A. in Politics from the [[University of Dallas]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.niu.edu/~ti0uxa1/Field_Biopolitics/Arnhart.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906204115/http://www3.niu.edu/~ti0uxa1/Field_Biopolitics/Arnhart.htm |archivedate=2006-09-06 }}]</ref>

In the Department of Political Science at Northern Illinois University, Arnhart teaches in the fields of [[Political philosophy|political theory]] and [[biopolitics]].

Arnhart is best known as a scholar in the history of political philosophy and as a proponent of "Darwinian natural right," "Darwinian [[conservatism]]," and "[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[liberalism]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phillysoc.org/arnhart2007.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721021225/http://www.phillysoc.org/arnhart2007.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> He argues that the tradition of [[ethical naturalism]] from [[Aristotle]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]] to [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] can be supported by a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] account of [[ethics]] as rooted in human biological nature, which combines liberty and order, freedom and virtue.

In defending Darwinian [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]], Arnhart has debated the proponents of "intelligent design theory" by suggesting that they employ a purely negative rhetoric of criticizing Darwinian evolutionary theory, while offering no positive theory of exactly where, when, and how the "[[intelligent designer]]" intervenes in nature to create "[[Irreducible complexity|irreducibly complex]]" mechanisms.

Arnhart has debated the leading advocates of [[intelligent design]]—[[Michael Behe]], [[William Dembski]], [[John G. West|John West]], [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], and [[Richard Weikart]]—all of whom are fellows of the [[Discovery Institute]]. John West has written a book attacking Arnhart — ''Darwin's Conservatives: A Misguided Quest.''<ref>http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/ArnhartDarwinDesign.php</ref>

In defending Darwinian conservatism, Arnhart tries to persuade conservatives that Darwinian science supports the conservative belief that social order arises not from rational planning but from the [[spontaneous order]] of instincts and habits.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/us/politics/05darwin.html</ref> He suggests that Darwinian biology sustains conservative social thought by showing how the human capacity for spontaneous order arises from social instincts and a moral sense shaped by [[natural selection]] in human evolutionary history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.niu.edu/president/prp/2009/arnhart.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805133056/http://www.niu.edu/president/prp/2009/arnhart.shtml |archivedate=2012-08-05 }}</ref>

He has also developed a Darwinian argument for [[classical liberalism]].<ref>http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/july-2010-darwin-and-politics/</ref>

Recently, Arnhart finished writing the fourth edition of his book ''Political Questions: Political Philosophy from Plato to Pinker.''

He is working on a new book — ''Darwinian Liberalism: The Evolutionary Science of Political Philosophy.'' This book will apply his Darwinian thinking to the history of political philosophy, while arguing for classical liberalism as supported by evolutionary science.
