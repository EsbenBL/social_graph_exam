'''Zygmunt Bauman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|m|ə|n}}; 19 November 1925 – 9 January 2017) was a Polish sociologist and philosopher. He was driven out of the [[Polish People's Republic]] during the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] and forced to give up his [[Polish citizenship]]. He emigrated to Israel; three years later he moved to the United Kingdom. He resided in England from 1971, where he studied at the [[London School of Economics]] and became Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Leeds]], later Emeritus. Bauman was a social theorist, writing on issues as diverse as [[modernity]] and the [[Holocaust]], [[postmodernity|postmodern]] [[consumerism]] and [[liquid modernity]].<ref>Zygmunt, B. (2000).

==Early life and education==
{{expand section|date=May 2020}}
Bauman was born to non-observant [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] family in [[Poznań]], [[Second Polish Republic]], in 1925. In 1939, when Poland was [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union]], his family escaped eastwards into the USSR.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/zygmunt-bauman |title=Zygmunt Bauman |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
In the 1940s Bauman enlisted in the Soviet-controlled [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|First Polish Army]], working as a political instructor. He took part in the [[Battle of Kolberg (1945)]] and the [[Battle of Berlin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tvp.info/28543149/zmarl-filozof-zygmunt-bauman-mial-91-lat |title=Zmarł filozof Zygmunt Bauman.

According to the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]], from 1945 to 1953 Bauman was a political officer in the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW), a military intelligence formed to combat the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] and the remnants of the [[Polish Home Army]].<ref name="ipn.gov.pl">Piotr Gontarczyk: [http://ipn.gov.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/47281/1-7151.pdf ''Towarzysz "Semjon".

S. 74–83</ref> From 1945 to 1948 Bauman worked for military intelligence. However, the nature and extent of his collaboration remain unknown, as well as the exact circumstances under which it was terminated.<ref name="ipn.gov.pl"/>

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bauman confirmed he had been a committed communist during and after World War II and had never made a secret of it. He admitted that joining the military intelligence service at age 19 was a mistake although he had a "dull" desk-job and did not remember informing on anyone.<ref>Aida Edemariam, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/academicexperts.highereducation "Professor with a past"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2007.</ref><ref>''The Guardian'' piece erroneously claimed that the ''Brickhouse article'', to which it referred, was written by [[Bogdan Musiał]], a conservative Polish historian working in Germany. In fact, it was written by the Institute of National Remembrance employee, Piotr Gontarczyk; Musiał had simply repeated Gontarczyk's findings in the German ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref> While serving in the Internal Security Corps, Bauman first studied sociology at the Warsaw Academy of Political and Social Science. In 1953, Bauman, already in the rank of major, was suddenly dishonourably discharged, after his father had approached the Israeli embassy in Warsaw with a view to emigrating to [[Israel]]. As Bauman did not share his father's [[Zionism|Zionist]] tendencies and was indeed strongly anti-Zionist, his dismissal caused a severe, though temporary estrangement from his father. During the period of unemployment that followed, he completed his M.A. and in 1954 became a lecturer at the [[University of Warsaw]], where he remained until 1968.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.miesiecznik.znak.com.pl/biografia-bauman-wszystkie-zycia-zygmunta-baumana/ |title=Wszystkie życia Zygmunta Baumana |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>

While at the [[London School of Economics]], where his supervisor was [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]], he prepared a comprehensive study on the British socialist movement, his first major book. Published originally in Polish in 1959, a revised edition appeared in English in 1972. Bauman went on to publish other books, including ''Socjologia na co dzień'' ("Everyday Sociology", 1964), which reached a large popular audience in Poland and later formed the foundation for the English-language text-book ''Thinking Sociologically'' (1990). Initially, Bauman remained close to orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, but, influenced by [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], he became increasingly critical of Poland's Communist government. Owing to this he was never awarded a [[professorship]] even after he completed his [[habilitation]] but, after his former teacher, [[Julian Hochfeld]], was made vice-director of [[UNESCO]]'s Department for Social Sciences in Paris in 1962, Bauman did in fact inherit Hochfeld's chair.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Social Thought of Zygmunt Bauman before 1968: from the "Mechanistic" to the "Activistic" Version of Marxism |jstor = 24919798}}</ref>

Faced with increasing political pressure connected with a political purge led by [[Mieczysław Moczar]], the Chief of the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|Polish Communist Security Police]], Bauman renounced his membership of the governing [[Polish United Workers' Party]] in January 1968. The [[March 1968 events]] culminated in a purge that drove many remaining Communist Poles of Jewish descent out of the country, including those intellectuals who had fallen from grace with the [[Polish communism|communist]] government.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Bauman, who had lost his chair at the [[University of Warsaw]], was among them. He had to give up Polish citizenship to be allowed to leave the country.

From 1968- 1970 he went to Israel to teach at [[Tel Aviv University]]. Thereafter he accepted the chair of sociology at the University of Leeds, where he intermittently also served as head of the department. After his appointment, he published almost exclusively in English, his third language, and his reputation grew.
 
From the late 1990s, Bauman exerted a considerable influence on the [[Anti-globalization|anti-]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Hidden Paths in Zygmunt Bauman's Sociology: Editorial Introduction |doi=10.1177/0263276418767568 }}</ref>

In a 2011 interview in the Polish weekly, "[[Polityka]]", Bauman criticised Zionism and Israel, saying Israel was not interested in peace and that it was "taking advantage of the Holocaust to legitimize unconscionable acts". He compared the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] to the walls of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] where hundreds of thousands of Jews died in the Holocaust. The Israeli ambassador to Warsaw, Zvi Bar, called Bauman's comments "half truths" and "groundless generalizations."<ref>{{cite news |first=Roman |last=Frister |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5161861 |title=Polish-Jewish sociologist compares West Bank separation fence to Warsaw Ghetto walls |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=1 September 2011 |access-date=4 January 2020 }}</ref>

Bauman was a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Early work===
Bauman's earliest publication in English is a study of the British [[labour movement]] and its relationship to class and [[social stratification]], originally published in Poland in 1960.<ref>''Between Class and Élite. The Evolution of the British Labour Movement: A Sociological Study''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1972.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> He continued to publish on the subject of class and social conflict until the early 1980s. His last book was on the subject of ''Memories of Class''.<ref>''Memories of Class: The Pre-History and After-Life of Class''. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul</ref> Whilst his later books do not address issues of class directly, he continued to describe himself as a [[Socialism|socialist]], and he never rejected [[Marxism]] entirely.<ref>Madeleine Bunting, "Passion and pessimism".

===Modernity and rationality===
[[File:Zygmunt Bauman, fot. M. Oliva Soto (6144135392).jpg|thumb|Bauman in Wrocław, 2011]]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Bauman published a number of books that dealt with the relationship between modernity, bureaucracy, rationality and social exclusion.<ref>See in particular ''Modernity and Ambivalence'', Cambridge: Polity, 1991, and ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Polity/Blackwell, 1990.</ref> Bauman, following [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], came to view European modernity as a trade off: European society, he argued, had agreed to forego a level of freedom to receive the benefits of increased individual security. Bauman argued that modernity, in what he later came to term its 'solid' form, involved removing unknowns and uncertainties. It involved control over nature, hierarchical bureaucracy, rules and regulations, control and categorisation — all of which attempted to remove gradually personal insecurities, making the chaotic aspects of human life appear well-ordered and familiar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NptYDwAAQBAJ&q=zygmunt+bauman+control+over+nature%2C+hierarchical+bureaucracy%2C+rules+and+regulations%2C+control+and+categorisation&pg=PT26 |title=Psychoanalysis in Asia |isbn=978-0-429-91781-3 |access-date=24 April 2020|last1=Gerlach |first1=Alf |last2=Hooke |first2=Maria Teresa Savio |last3=Varvin |first3=Sverre |date=27 April 2018 }}</ref>
Later in a number of books Bauman began to develop the position that such order-making never manages to achieve the desired results.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0zJZuabUSQC&q=zygmunt+bauman+order-making+never++achieves+the+desired+results&pg=PA121 |title=The Empty Couch: The Taboo of Ageing and Retirement in Psychoanalysis |isbn=978-0-415-59861-3 |access-date=24 April 2020|last1=Junkers |first1=Gabriele |year=2013 }}</ref> 

When life becomes organised into familiar and manageable categories, he argued, there are always social groups who cannot be administered, who cannot be separated out and controlled. In his book ''Modernity and Ambivalence'' Bauman began to theorise about such indeterminate persons in terms of an allegorical figure he called, 'the stranger.' Drawing upon Georg Simmel's sociology and the philosophy of [[Jacques Derrida]], Bauman came to write of the stranger as the person who is present yet unfamiliar, society's ''undecidable''. In ''Modernity and Ambivalence'' Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar. Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled or ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is a constant threat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0zJZuabUSQC&q=zygmunt+bauman+always+the+object+of+fear%3B+he+is+the+potential+mugger&pg=PA121 |title=The Empty Couch: The Taboo of Ageing and Retirement in Psychoanalysis |isbn=978-0-415-59861-3 |access-date=24 April 2020|last1=Junkers |first1=Gabriele |year=2013 }}</ref>

Bauman's most famous book, ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of those kinds of fears. Drawing upon [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman developed the argument that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he argued, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorisation of different species, and the tendency to view obedience to rules as morally good, all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass. He argued that for this reason modern societies have not fully grasped the lessons of the Holocaust; it tends to be viewed—to use Bauman's metaphor—like a picture hanging on the wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis the Jews became 'strangers' ''par excellence'' in Europe.<ref>''Modernity and the Holocaust'', p. 53.</ref> The [[Final Solution]] was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempt made by society to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements that exist within it. Bauman, like the philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]], contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://arabcenterdc.org/policy_analyses/modernity-and-the-mechanisms-of-moral-neutralisation/ |title=Modernity and the Mechanisms of Moral Neutralisation |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>

===Postmodernity and consumerism===
In the mid-to-late 1990s, Bauman began to explore ''postmodernity'' and ''consumerism''.<ref>''Work, Consumerism and the New Poor'', Open University, 1998.</ref> He posited that a shift had taken place in modern society in the latter half of the 20th century. It had changed from a society of producers into a society of consumers. According to Bauman, this change reversed Freud's "modern" tradeoff—i.e., security was given up in exchange for more freedom, freedom to purchase, consume, and enjoy life. In his books in the 1990s Bauman wrote of this as being a shift from "modernity" to "post-modernity".

Since the turn of the millennium, his books have tried to avoid the confusion surrounding the term "postmodernity" by using the metaphors of "liquid" and "solid" modernity. In his books on modern consumerism, Bauman still writes of the same uncertainties that he portrayed in his writings on "solid" modernity; but in these books he writes of fears becoming more diffuse and harder to pin down. Indeed, they are, to use the title of one of his books, "liquid fears" – fears about [[paedophilia]], for instance, which are amorphous and have no easily identifiable reference.<ref>See ''In Search of Politics'', Polity, 1999.<!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher, page(s) needed --></ref>

Bauman is credited with coining the term [[allosemitism]] to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as the [[Other (philosophy)|other]].<ref>Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A. Dupont's "Das Alte Gesetz" (1923) and Veit Harlan's "Jud Süss" (1940)", ''The German Quarterly'' 78.4 (2005): 496–516.</ref><ref>Briefel, Aviva.

Retrieved 9 January 2017.</ref> Bauman reportedly predicted the negative political effect that social media have on voter's choice by denouncing them as 'trap' where people only "see reflections of their own face".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/19/inenglish/1453208692_424660.html|title=Zygmunt Bauman: "Social media are a trap|last=De Querol|first=Ricardo|date=25 January 2016|publisher=El Pais}}</ref>

=== Art: a liquid element? ===
[[File:Re-publica 2015 - Tag 3 (17404674595) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Zygmunt Bauman, Berlin, 2015]]
One of Bauman works focuses on the concept of art as influenced by the liquidity of appreciation. The author puts forward the idea that "we desire and seek a realization that usually consists of a constant ''becoming'', in a permanent disposition of ''becoming''".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Arte, ¿líquido?|date=2007|publisher=Sequitur|others=Bauman, Zygmunt, 1925-2017., Ochoa de Michelena, Francisco.|isbn=978-84-95363-36-7|location=Madrid|oclc=434421494}}</ref> In essence, our aim is not the object of our longing but the action of longing itself, and the worst peril is reaching complete satisfaction.

In this framework, Bauman explores how art can position itself in a world where the fleeting is the dominant paradigm. Art is substantially something that contributes to giving immortality to virtually anything: hence the philosopher wonders, "can art transform the ephemeral into an eternal matter?".<ref name=":0" /> Bauman concludes that the current reality is characterized by individuals who do not have time nor space to relate with the everlasting, with absolute and established values. Art and the relation of people with them, both in creating it and in participating in it, is dramatically changing. Citing [[Hannah Arendt]], he asserts that "an object is cultural if it persists; its temporary aspect, its permanence, is opposite to the functional [...] culture sees itself threatened when all the objects in the world, those produced today and those of the past, are exclusively considered from the point of view of utility for the social process of survival".<ref name=":0" /> Withal, the concept of culture and art can only find a sense in the liquid society if it abandons its traditional understanding and adopts the deconstructive approach.

==Awards and honours==
Bauman was awarded the [[European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences]] in 1992 and the [[Theodor W. Adorno Award]] of the city of [[Frankfurt]] in 1998.

==Criticisms==
In 2014, Peter Walsh, a PhD candidate at the [[University of Cambridge]], accused Bauman of plagiarism from several websites, including Wikipedia, in his book ''Does the Richness of the Few Benefit Us All?'' (2013). In this book Bauman is said to have copied verbatim paragraphs from Wikipedia articles on [[Slow Food]] and [[steady-state economy]], along with their bibliography, without attributing sources, authors or the fact that they were copied from Wikipedia. He did use a paragraph from the article on the [[golden handshake]], but this citation was properly attributed to Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|title=KOMPROMITACJE: Zygmunt Bauman przepisuje z Wikipedii albo wielka nauka i małe machlojki|url=http://kompromitacje.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/bauman-przepisuje-z-wikipedii.html|website=kompromitacje.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=13 November 2015}}</ref>

In a response, Bauman suggested that "obedience" to "technical" rules was unnecessary, and that he "never once failed to acknowledge the authorship of the ideas or concepts that I deployed, or that inspired the ones I coined".<ref name="plagiarism">{{cite news|last=Jump|first=Paul|title=Zygmunt Bauman rebuffs plagiarism accusation|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/zygmunt-bauman-rebuffs-plagiarism-accusation/2012405.article|access-date=3 April 2014|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=3 April 2014}}</ref> In a detailed critique of Walsh and co-author David Lehmann, cultural critics [[Brad Evans (author)|Brad Evans]] and [[Henry A. Giroux]] concluded: "This charge against Bauman is truly despicable. It's a reactionary ideological critique dressed up as the celebration of method and a back-door defence of sterile empiricism and culture of positivism. This is a discourse that enshrines data, correlations, and performance, while eschewing matters of substance, social problems, and power."<ref>Brad Evans and Henry A.

"[This biography's] leitmotif is the dichotomy between Bauman's Polish and Jewish identities, the first being the one he chose, the second the one fixed on him by others, in particular other Poles. [p. 9.] [F]or all the difficulties and uprootings of his life, he not only stubbornly refused the role of victim but also managed to achieve the rare status – rare at least in interesting biographies – of being a happy man." (p. 11.)
