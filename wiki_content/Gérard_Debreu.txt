'''Gérard Debreu''' ({{IPA-fr|dəbʁø|lang}}; 4 July 1921 – 31 December 2004) was a French-born [[economist]] and [[mathematician]]. Best known as a professor of [[economics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he began work in 1962, he won the 1983 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Atlas|first=Riva D.|title=Gerard Debreu, 83, Dies; Won Nobel in Economics|date=6 January 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/obituaries/06debreu.html?_r=0}}</ref>

==Biography==
His father was the business partner of his maternal grandfather in [[lace]] manufacturing, a traditional industry in [[Calais]]. Debreu was orphaned at an early age, as his father committed suicide and his mother died of natural causes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Düppe | first = Till | title = Gerard Debreu's secrecy: his life in order and silence | journal = [[History of Political Economy]] | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 413–449 | doi = 10.1215/00182702-1717239 | date = Fall 2012 }}</ref> Prior to the start of [[World War II]], he received his [[baccalauréat]] and went to [[Ambert]] to begin preparing for the entrance examination of a [[grande école]]. Later on, he moved from [[Ambert]] to [[Grenoble]] to complete his preparation, both places being in [[Vichy France]] during World War II. In 1941, he was admitted to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, along with {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Boiteux|fr}}. He was influenced by [[Henri Cartan]] and the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] writers. When he was about to take the final examinations in 1944, the [[Normandy landings]] occurred and he, instead, enlisted in the French army. He was transferred for training to [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and then served in the occupying French forces in Germany until July 1945. Debreu passed the Agrégation de Mathématiques exams at the end of 1945 and the beginning of 1946. By this time, he had become interested in economics, particularly in the [[general equilibrium theory]] of [[Léon Walras]]. From 1946 to 1948, he was an assistant in the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]. During these two and a half years, he made the transition from mathematics to economics. In 1948, Debreu went to the United States on a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]] which allowed him to visit several American universities, as well as those in [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Oslo University|Oslo]] in 1949–50.

Debreu married Françoise Bled in 1946 and they had two daughters, Chantal and Florence, born in 1946 and 1950 respectively.

Debreu died in Paris at the age of 83 of natural causes on [[New Year's Eve]], 2004.

==Academic career==
Debreu began working as a Research Associate and joined the [[Cowles Commission]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in the summer of 1950. He remained there for five years, returning to Paris periodically.

In 1954, he published a breakthrough paper, entitled ''Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy'', together with [[Kenneth Arrow]], in which they provided a definitive mathematical proof of the existence of a [[general equilibrium]], using [[topology|topological]] rather than [[calculus]]-based methods.

In 1955, he moved to [[Yale University]].

In 1959, he published his classical monograph, ''Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium'' (Cowles Foundation Monographs Series), which is one of the most important works in [[mathematical economics]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Debreu | first = Gérard | title = The theory of value: an axiomatic analysis of economic equilibrium | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | location = New York | year = 1959 | url = http://digamo.free.fr/debreu59.pdf | oclc = 270657 }}</ref> He also studied several problems in the theory of [[cardinal utility]], in particular the additive [[decomposition]] of a [[utility function]] defined on a [[Cartesian product]] of sets.

In this monograph, Debreu set up an [[axiom]]atic foundation for competitive markets. He also established the existence of an equilibrium using a novel approach. The main idea of his argument is to show that there exists a price system for which the [[aggregate demand|aggregate]] excess demand correspondence vanishes. He did so by proving a type of fixed-point theorem that is based on the [[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]]. In Chapter 7, Debreu introduced the concept of [[uncertainty]] and showed how it could be incorporated into the [[deterministic]] [[Economic model|model]]. Here, he introduced the notion of a [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] [[commodity]], which is a promise to deliver a good should a certain state of nature be realized. This concept is very frequently used in [[financial economics]], where it is known as the "[[Arrow–Debreu security]]".

In 1960–61, he worked at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and devoted most of his time to the complex proof that appeared in 1962 of a general theorem on the existence of an economic equilibrium.

In January 1962, he started working at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he held the titles of University Professor and Class of 1958 Professor of Economics and Mathematics Emeritus.

During his sabbaticals in the late 1960s and 1970s, he visited universities in [[Leiden University|Leiden]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]]. In 1987, he visited the [[University of Canterbury|University of Canterbury]] as an Erskine Fellow, lecturing in economic theory.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcwfyELglmc</ref>

His later studies centred mainly on the theory of [[differentiable function|differentiable]] economies, where he showed that, in general, aggregate [[excess demand function]]s vanish at a finite number of points – basically, he showed that economies have a finite number of price equilibria.

In 1976, he received the French [[Legion of Honour]]. He was awarded the 1983 Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of [[Alfred Nobel]], for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of [[general equilibrium theory]]. He was a member of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich|International Academy of Science]].

In 1990, he served as President of the [[American Economic Association]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Debreu | first = Gérard | title = The mathematization of economic theory | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | jstor = 2006785 | date = March 1991 }} [http://cruel.org/econthought/texts/method/debr91.html Full text.]</ref>
