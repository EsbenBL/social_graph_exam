She is a professor of political science at [[Colorado State University]], where she has also been the chair of the department.

She is a co-founder of the [[Earth System Governance Project]].

==Education and early work==
Betsill graduated from [[DePauw University]] in 1989, with a BA in [[French language|French]] and [[Communication studies|communication]].<ref name=profile>{{cite web |url=https://polisci.colostate.edu/author/mbetsill/ |title=Michele Betsill |publisher=Colorado State University |year=2019 |access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref> She then obtained an MA in [[international studies]] from the [[University of Denver]] in 1991.<ref name=profile/>

In 1997, Betsill received an MA in political science from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], and in 2000 she earned her PhD in political science there.<ref name=profile/><ref name=kim19>{{cite journal |title=The Political Science 400: With Citation Counts by Cohort, Gender, and Subfield |doi=10.1017/S1049096518001786 |date=April 2019 |last1=Kim |first1=Hannah June |last2=Grofman |first2=Bernard |journal=PS: Political Science & Politics |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=296–311 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C1EDBF7220760F01A5C4A685DB3B3F44/S1049096518001786a.pdf/political_science_400_with_citation_counts_by_cohort_gender_and_subfield.pdf |access-date=19 January 2020|doi-access=free }}</ref> Betsill's dissertation, called ''Greens in the Greenhouse: Environmental NGOs, Norms, and the Politics of Global Climate Change'', received the 2002 award for an Outstanding Dissertation in Transformational and Ecological Politics from the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/section-2002-Award-Recipients |title=Best Dissertation Award |publisher=American Political Science Association |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>

During the 1999–2000 academic year, Betsill was a post-doctoral fellow at the [[John F.

==Career==
Betsill has been an author or editor of 6 books. Her first book, ''Cities and Climate Change: Urban Sustainability and Global Environmental Governance'', was coauthored with [[Harriet Bulkeley]] and published in 2003. ''Cities and Climate Change'' examines the role of cities, and networks of cities, in implementing climate change policies.<ref name=mills>{{cite journal |last=Mills |first=Gerald |title=Book Review Cities and Climate Change: Urban Sustainability and Global Environmental Governance |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=883–884 |date=June 2004|bibcode=2004Holoc..14..474D |doi=10.1177/095968360401400320 |s2cid=128528902 }}</ref> Betsill and Bulkeley argued that attempts to understand the implementation of climate change policies had been limited by a focus on national governments, but that meaningful policies could also be implemented at the level of city governments or non-governmental organizations, both within and across national borders and potentially without the participation of other levels of government.<ref name=mills/> This is particularly true because of the economic output of cities, and their significant participation in energy use.<ref name=lee>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Kai N. |title=Book Review Cities and Climate Change: Urban Sustainability and Global Environmental Governance |journal=Global Environmental Politics |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=122–124 |date=November 2005 |doi=10.1162/glep.2005.5.4.122|s2cid=153694178 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/glep.2005.5.4.122 }}</ref> Focusing on the [[Cities for Climate Protection program]] and five case studies of specific cities, Betsill and Bulkeley investigate why it is difficult for networks of cities to implement meaningful [[sustainability]] policies in the context of [[urban planning]].<ref name=mills/>

Betsill was also a co-author of the 2014 book ''Transnational Climate Change Governance'', together with the other members of the [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] Network on Transnational Climate Governance.<ref name=profile/> The book empirically investigates attempts to [[climate change mitigation|combat climate change]] that are led by or conducted in collaboration with non-governmental actors, arguing that such efforts are more important and effective than is generally realized.<ref name=lindsay>{{cite journal |last=Lindsay |first=Abby |title=Review Transnational Climate Change Governance |journal=Global Environmental Politics |volume=15 |issue=4 |date=November 2015}}</ref> Abby Lindsay Ostovar situated this attempt to "analyze the evolution, constitution, and meaning of the emergent system of cross-border efforts between state and nonstate actors to address climate change" in the context that state-led efforts to combat climate change have not yet been effective, prompting voluntary initiatives to attempt to fill the gap, but with as-yet unknown results.<ref name=lindsay/>

Betsill was also a co-editor of four books: ''Palgrave Advances in International Environmental Politics'' (2006), ''NGO Diplomacy: The Influence of Nongovernmental Organizations in International Environmental Negotiations'' (2008), the second edition of ''Advances in International Environmental Politics'' (2014),<ref name=profile/> and ''Agency in Earth System Governance'' (2020).<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Michele M.
