'''Yale University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[research university]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

Originally restricted to theology and [[sacred language]]s, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the [[American Revolution]]. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research.

Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original [[Yale College|undergraduate college]], the [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the [[Yale Corporation]], each school's [[faculty (division)|faculty]] oversees its curriculum and degree programs.

===Early history of Yale College===
====Origins====
[[File:Charter for Collegiate School later Yale College 1701.jpg|thumb|Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became [[Yale College]], October 9, 1701]]

Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the [[Connecticut Colony|Colony of Connecticut]] on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers, [[Samuel Andrew]], Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of [[Increase Mather]]), Rev. James Noyes II (son of [[James Noyes]]), [[James Pierpont (Yale founder)|James Pierpont]], [[Abraham Pierson]], [[Noadiah Russell (Yale founder)|Noadiah Russell]], [[Joseph Webb]], and [[Timothy Woodbridge]], all [[alumni]] of [[Harvard]], met in the study of Reverend [[Samuel Russell (Yale co-founder)|Samuel Russell]], located in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hallett|first=Vicky C.|date=March 11, 1999|title=I'm Gonna Git YOU Sukka: Classic Stories of Revenge at Harvard|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=97832|url-status=dead|access-date=February 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215150444/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=97832|archive-date=February 15, 2006}}</ref> The group, led by [[James Pierpont (Yale founder)|James Pierpont]], is now known as "The Founders".<ref>{{cite web|title=Yale: A Short History - The Beginnings|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/Piersons/beginnings.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607235603/http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/Piersons/beginnings.html|archive-date=June 7, 2016|access-date=June 16, 2016|website=www.library.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University}}</ref>

[[File:A Front View of Yale College and the College Chapel New Haven printed by Daniel Bowen.jpg|thumb|left|A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786]]

From its origin it is known as the "Collegiate School", the institution opened in the home of its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]], [[Abraham Pierson]], who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]]). The school moved to [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Saybrook]] and then [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]]. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.

Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, [[Increase Mather]], and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in [[Ecclesiastical polity|Church polity]]. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the [[Puritan]] religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_057300_matherincrea.htm |title=Increase Mather |access-date=April 17, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211012309/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_057300_matherincrea.htm |archive-date=February 11, 2006 |url-status=live }}, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref> Rev.

====Naming and development====
[[File:Yale family chrest.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718]]

In 1718, at the behest of either Rector [[Samuel Andrew]] or the colony's Governor [[Gurdon Saltonstall]], [[Cotton Mather]] contacted the successful Boston born businessman [[Elihu Yale]] to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of [[Jeremiah Dummer]], Elihu "Eli" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the [[East India Company]] as the first president of [[Fort St. George]] (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy<ref name="hindu20050504">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/05/04/stories/2005050400441000.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507171849/http://www.hindu.com/2005/05/04/stories/2005050400441000.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 May 2005|title=Yale, India, and the failure of the 'global university'|date=4 May 2005|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref>), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to "Yale College."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Love|first=Henry Davison|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4506718&view=1up&seq=535&q1=yale|title=Indian Records Series Vestiges of Old Madras 1640-1800|publisher=[[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]]|year=1913|volume=1|location=London|pages=491}}</ref> The [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]] name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the [[Iâl]], which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of [[Llandegla]], was called.

Meanwhile, a [[Harvard]] graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oviatt|first=Edwin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKJLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA298|title=The Beginnings of Yale (1701–1726)|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1916|location=[[New Haven]]|pages=298–302|access-date=November 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723033400/https://books.google.com/books?id=JKJLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA298|archive-date=July 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the "new divinity." In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become [[Arminianism|Arminians]], and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. [[Thomas Clapp]] became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morgan|first=Edmund S.|title=American Heroes: Profiles of Men and Women Who Shaped Early America|publisher=[[W. W.

=====Connections to the slave trade=====
Yale, like many of the earliest American universities, profited off and received funding through the [[slave trade]].<ref name="Digital Histories At Yale">{{cite web|last1=Joseph|first1=Yannielli|date=November 1, 2014|title=Elihu Yale Was a Slave Trader|url=http://histi3.commons.yale.edu/2014/11/01/elihu-yale-was-a-slave-trader/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108031612/http://histi3.commons.yale.edu/2014/11/01/elihu-yale-was-a-slave-trader/|archive-date=8 November 2014|access-date=21 June 2020|website=Digital Histories At Yale|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shackled Legacy|url=https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2017/09/04/shackled-legacy|access-date=2020-07-05 |website=[[APM Reports]] |date=September 4, 2017 |last1=Smith |first1=Stephen |last2=Ellis |first2=Kate }}</ref> Founder Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George included overseeing its [[slave trade]], although he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.<ref name=Pavilonis>{{Cite web|author=Valerie Pavilonis|date=Jun 28, 2020|title="Cancel Yale"?

Yale College undergraduates follow a [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]] curriculum with departmental [[major (academic)|majors]] and is organized into a social system of [[residential colleges at Yale University|residential colleges]].

Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the [[Great Awakening]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents [[Thomas Clap]] and [[Ezra Stiles]]. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the [[Connecticut General Assembly|Connecticut legislature]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morgan|first=Edmunds S.|title=The Gentle Puritan: A Life of Ezra Stiles, 1727-1795|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=1974|isbn=978-0-8078-1231-0|location=[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tucker|first=Louis Leonard|title=Puritan Protagonist: President Thomas Clap of Yale College|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=1962|isbn=978-0-8078-0841-2|location=[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]]}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2021}}

Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as a [[classical language]], along with Greek and [[Latin]], and essential for the study of the [[Old Testament]] in the original words. The Reverend [[Ezra Stiles]], president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient [[Bible|Biblical texts]] in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים ([[Urim and Thummim]]) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of [[Brown University]], in addition to having been a minister.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morgan|first=Edmund S.|title=The Gentle Puritan: A Life of Ezra Stiles, 1727-1795|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=1974|isbn=978-0-8078-1231-0|location=[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]]|pages=205}}</ref> Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate [[Edmund Fanning (colonial administrator)|Edmund Fanning]], secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree [[LL.D.]] for his efforts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Honorary Degrees Since 1702 {{!}} Office of the Secretary and Vice President for University Life|url=https://secretary.yale.edu/programs-services/honorary-degrees/since-1702?field_degrees_value=All&field_year_value=1803&keys=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210223035452/https://secretary.yale.edu/programs-services/honorary-degrees/since-1702?field_degrees_value=All&field_year_value=1803&keys=|archive-date=February 23, 2021|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=Yale Office of the Secretary and Vice President for University Life|publisher=Yale University}}</ref>

The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: [[Crotonia (literary society)|Crotonia]] in 1738, [[Linonia]] in 1753 and [[Brothers in Unity]] in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.

The [[Yale Report of 1828]] was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike [[higher education in Europe]], there was no [[national curriculum]] for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pak|first=Michael S.|date=2008|title=The Yale Report of 1828: A New Reading and New Implications|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20462205|journal=[[History of Education Quarterly]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=30–57|doi=10.1111/j.1748-5959.2008.00125.x|jstor=20462205|s2cid=146523521|url-access=subscription|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Urofsky|first1=Melvin I.|year=1965|title=Reforms and Response: The Yale Report of 1828|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/366937|journal=History of Education Quarterly|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=5|issue=1|pages=53–67|doi=10.2307/366937|jstor=366937|url-access=subscription|via=JSTOR}}</ref> A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the [[Victorian culture]].

Until 1887, the legal name of the university was "The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven." In 1887, under an act passed by the [[Connecticut General Assembly]], Yale was renamed to the present "Yale University."<ref>{{cite web|date=1976|title=The Yale Corporation: Charter and Legislation|url=https://www.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/University-Charter.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603002044/http://www.yale.edu/about/University-Charter.pdf|archive-date=June 3, 2014|access-date=February 24, 2021|website=www.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|location=[[New Haven]]}}</ref>

====Sports and debate====
The Revolutionary War soldier [[Nathan Hale]] (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th&nbsp;century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who "regretted" that he "had but one life to lose" for his country. Western painter [[Frederic Remington]] (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man [[Frank Merriwell]] embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel ''Stover at Yale'' (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Higgs|first=Robert J.|title=Manliness and morality: Middle-class masculinity in Britain and America, 1800-1940|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=1987|isbn=978-0-7190-2240-1|editor-last=Mangan|editor-first=J.

Along with [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Yale students rejected British concepts about '[[amateurism]]' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Ronald A.|title=Sports and Freedom: The Rise of Big-Time College Athletics|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 27, 1990|isbn=978-0-19-028172-4|location=[[Oxford]]}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2021}} The [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry]] began in 1875.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[Varsity letter|athletic letters]] for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Roberta J.|date=1987|title=Muscle, Mind and "Agon": Intercollegiate Debating and Athletics at Harvard and Yale, 1892-1909|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43611556|journal=Journal of Sport History|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|volume=14|issue=3|pages=263–285|jstor=43611556|url-access=subscription|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents [[Arthur Twining Hadley|Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, [[A. Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Watterson, III|first=John S.|date=1981|title=The Football Crisis of 1909-1910: The Response of the Eastern "Big Three"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43611449|journal=Journal of Sport History|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|volume=8|issue=1|pages=33–49|jstor=43611449|url-access=subscription|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

====Expansion====
Starting with the addition of the [[Yale School of Medicine]] in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the [[Yale Divinity School]] in 1822, [[Yale Law School]] in 1822, the [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] in 1847, the now-defunct [[Sheffield Scientific School]] in 1847,<ref name="ReferenceB">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E. Sheffield]].</ref> and the [[Yale School of Art|Yale School of Fine Arts]] in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of [[Timothy Dwight V]], Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the [[Yale College|undergraduate college]]. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the [[Yale School of Music]] in 1894, the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] in 1900, the [[Yale School of Public Health]] in 1915, the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in 1916, the [[Yale School of Nursing]] 1923, the [[Yale School of Drama]] in 1955, the [[Yale School of Management]] in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.<ref name="The Future of Jackson">{{Cite web|title=The Future of Jackson|url=https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821223916/https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|archive-date=August 21, 2019|access-date=2019-08-21|website=Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs|publisher=Yale University|language=en-US}}</ref> The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.

Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [[Noah Porter]], a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021|reason=Only one historian is later mentioned here; any additional references to support the point that more than one contested (or, additionally, any of his contemporaries) Porter's decision is needed.}} Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Levesque|first=George|title=Perspectives on the History of Higher Education|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4128-0732-6|editor-last=Geiger|editor-first=Roger L.|volume=26|location=[[New York City|New York]]|chapter=Noah Porter Revisited|issn=0737-2698|chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Perspectives_on_the_History_of_Higher_Ed/czYrDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=noah%20porter}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2021}} Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.

Milton Winternitz led the [[Yale School of Medicine]] as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about "social medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the "Yale System" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Spiro|first1=Howard M.|last2=Norton|first2=Priscilla Waters|date=2003|title=Dean Milton C.

Vassar, then all-female and part of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]]—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]] when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation.

A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit [[Alexander v. Yale]]. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff [[Ann Olivarius]], now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, "A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus."<ref>{{Cite report|url=https://wff.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/1977_Report_to_the_Yale_Corporation.pdf|title=A Report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus|date=March 1977|access-date=February 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217235127/http://wff.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/1977_Report_to_the_Yale_Corporation.pdf|archive-date=December 17, 2015}}</ref> This case was the first to use [[Title IX]] to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination.

Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see ''[[numerus clausus]]''), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Kabaservice|first=Geoffrey|date=December 1999|title=The Birth of a New Institution|url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_12/admissions.html|magazine=[[Yale Alumni Magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314164351/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_12/admissions.html|archive-date=March 14, 2010|access-date=February 25, 2021}}</ref>

Similarly, the decorative [[frieze]]s on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette.

One exception is [[Harkness Tower]], {{convert|216|ft|m|0}} tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure.

====Town–gown relations====
Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the [[town and gown]] relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lafer|first=Gordon|date=2003|title=Land and labor in the post-industrial university town: remaking social geography|url=http://www1.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/~moise/Data/Books/Social/08%20part%20of%20theory/land%20and%20labor%20in%20the%20post-industrial%20university%20town%20remaking%20social%20geography.pdf|journal=[[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|volume=22|issue=1|pages=89–117|doi=10.1016/S0962-6298(02)00065-3|via=[[Google Scholar]]}}</ref>

====Campus safety====
Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sloan |first=John J. |title=Modern Campus Police: An Analysis of Their Evolution, Structure, and Function |journal=American Journal of Police |date=1991 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=85–104}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Powell |title=The Beginning—Yale Campus Police Department—1894 |journal=Campus Law Enforcement Journal |volume=24 |pages=2–5}}</ref> Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gehrand |first=Keith A. |chapter=Higher Education Policing: The New Millennium |title=IACLEA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Publication |publisher=International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators |date=2008 |pages=67–68 |chapter-url=http://iaclea.org/visitors/PDFs/IACLEA-ContentPages_67-126.pdf |access-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kurtz-Phelan |first=Daniel |title=Crossing Enemy Lines |journal=The New Journal |date=April 1, 2002 |url=http://www.thenewjournalatyale.com/2002/04/crossing-enemy-lines/ |access-date=May 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081406/http://www.thenewjournalatyale.com/2002/04/crossing-enemy-lines/ |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a [[safety escort]], and 24-hour shuttle service.

In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Connecticut locations by per capita income|poverty]] and [[violent crime]] rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.<ref>AJ Giannini.

===Collections===
[[File:Sterling Memorial Library 2, September 1, 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Yale University's [[Sterling Memorial Library]], as seen from [[Maya Lin]]'s sculpture, ''Women's Table''. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.]]

[[Yale University Library]], which holds over 15&nbsp;million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.<ref name="2013LibraryReport"/><ref>{{cite report |title=ARL Statistics 2011–2012 |date=2012 |publisher=Association of Research Libraries |page=53 |url=http://publications.arl.org/ARL-Statistics-2011-2012/ |access-date=July 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233302/http://publications.arl.org/ARL-Statistics-2011-2012/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The main library, [[Sterling Memorial Library]], contains about 4&nbsp;million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries.

Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The [[Beinecke Rare Book Library]] has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library]] includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The [[Lewis Walpole Library]] contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The [[Elizabethan Club]], technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.

Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The [[Yale University Art Gallery]], the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, [[Louis Kahn]]'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The [[Yale Center for British Art]], the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of [[Paul Mellon]] and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.

The [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The [[Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments]], affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.

The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from [[Peru]] by Yale history professor [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] in his Yale-financed expedition to [[Machu Picchu]] in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.<ref>{{Citation | last= Zorthian | first= Julia | date= November 12, 2012 | title= Yale returns final Machu Picchu artifacts | publisher= Yale Daily News | location= New Haven, Connecticut | url= https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/11/12/yale-returns-final-machu-picchu-artifacts/ | access-date= August 31, 2018 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180712093957/https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/11/12/yale-returns-final-machu-picchu-artifacts/ | archive-date= July 12, 2018 | url-status= live }}</ref>{{Infobox US university ranking

Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the [[New Criticism]] movement. Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called "[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.

In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].

==Campus life==
Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |title=Yale Factsheet |publisher=Yale.edu |access-date=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080525/http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |archive-date=April 3, 2007  }}</ref> The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.<ref name="NYT mobility index">{{cite news |last1=Aisch |first1=Gregor |last2=Buchanan |first2=Larry |last3=Cox |first3=Amanda |last4=Quealy |first4=Kevin |title=Economic diversity and student outcomes at Yale |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/yale-university |access-date=9 August 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 January 2017}}</ref>

===Residential colleges===
{{Main|Residential colleges of Yale University}}
Yale's [[residential college]] system was established in 1933 by [[Edward S. Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as "Master's Teas," but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.

Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/clubhockey/teamhistory.html |title=Yale Club Ice Hockey |publisher=Yale.edu |date=October 19, 2007 |access-date=September 16, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417115828/http://www.yale.edu/clubhockey/teamhistory.html |archive-date=April 17, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Yale athletics are supported by the [[Yale Precision Marching Band]]. "Precision" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/ypmb/faq.html|title= Yale Precision Marching Band Frequently Asked Questions|access-date= December 14, 2009|quote= "The YPMB is one of twelve scatter-style marching bands in the country....Between formations we run around wildly.|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091225104413/http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/ypmb/faq.html|archive-date= December 25, 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.

Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.

====Song====
Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as [[graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, "[[Bright College Years]]". Despite its popularity, "[[Boola Boola]]" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale [[fight song]], "Bulldog" was written by [[Cole Porter]] during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yale Fight Songs {{!}} Yale Bands|url=https://bands.yalecollege.yale.edu/yale-precision-marching-band/music/yale-fight-songs|access-date=2020-12-08|website=bands.yalecollege.yale.edu}}</ref> Additionally, two other songs, "Down the Field" by C.W. O'Conner, and "Bingo Eli Yale", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to ''College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology'' published in 1998, "Down the Field" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victory March rated No. 1 college fight song|url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/news/6427-victory-march-rated-no-1-college-fight-song/|publisher=University of Notre Dame News|access-date=September 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123021503/http://newsinfo.nd.edu/news/6427-victory-march-rated-no-1-college-fight-song/|archive-date=November 23, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Mascot====
The school mascot is "[[Handsome Dan]]," the Yale [[bulldog]], and the Yale [[fight song]] contains the [[refrain]], "Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow".
