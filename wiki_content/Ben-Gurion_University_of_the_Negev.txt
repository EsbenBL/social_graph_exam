== History ==
Ben-Gurion University was established in 1969 as the University of the Negev with the aim of promoting the development of the Negev desert that comprises more than sixty percent of Israel. The University was later renamed after Israel's founder and first prime minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], who believed that the future of the country lay in this region. After Ben-Gurion's death in 1973, the University was renamed Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The Presidents of the university have been [[Moshe Prywes]] (1973–75), [[Yosef Tekoah]] (1975–81), [[Shlomo Gazit]] (1982–85), [[Chaim Elata]] (1985–90), [[Avishay Braverman]] (1990–2006), [[Rivka Carmi]] (2006–18), and [[Daniel Chamovitz]] (2019–present).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/Former_Presidents.aspx |title=Ben-Gurion University of the Negev - Former Presidents |publisher=In.bgu.ac.il |access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/president.aspx |title=Ben-Gurion University of the Negev - BGU President - Prof. Daniel Chamovitz |publisher=In.bgu.ac.il |date=2019-01-01 |access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> The current Chairman of the Executive Council is [[Yarom Ariav]]<ref>{{cite web |title=BGU Board of Governors |url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/board.aspx |access-date=15 June 2021}}</ref>

Ben-Gurion University has five faculties with 51 academic departments and units: Faculty of Engineering Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management.

Ben-Gurion University has seven schools including the Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies, the Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School, the Leon and Mathilde Recanati School for Community Health Professions, the School of Pharmacy, the Inter-Faculty Brain Sciences School, the School for Medical Laboratory Sciences and the School of Continuing Medical Education.

In 1978 Prof. Alfred Inselberg, then with the Faculty of Mathematics, together with Dr. Sam Bergman and Dr. Avraham Melkman initiated the Computer Science program which by 1982 had attracted more than 200 students. Notably, this was the first university program in Israel where students were taught Pascal, used terminals rather than punch-card machines and where the first Computer Graphics Laboratory in Israel was established. This was the genesis of Computer Science education at Ben-Gurion University which eventually led to a separate Department of Computer Science.

====The Medical School for International Health (MSIH)====
The [[Medical School for International Health]] grew out of collaborations between faculty at Ben-Gurion University and Columbia University.<ref name=about>[http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/bgcu-md/about/index.html About MSIH, Medical School for International Health] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095604/http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/bgcu-md/about/index.html |date=December 11, 2013 }}  accessed February 20, 2008</ref> A joint global health and medical care program, it was established in 1997.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105135230/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-97414066.html "Global medicine – an Israeli speciality"], Judy Siegel-Itzkovitch, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', August 8, 2004</ref>
