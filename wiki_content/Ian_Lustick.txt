'''Ian Steven Lustick''' (born 1949) is an American [[Political science|political scientist]] and specialist on the modern history and politics of the [[Middle East]]. He currently holds the Bess W. Heyman Chair in the department of Political Sciences at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|PolSciPenn|2020}}

==Biography==
Lustick was born in 1949 in [[Syracuse, New York]]. His father was a pediatrician and, eager to get out of the 'rat race' of metropolitan life, the family moved to the northern rural area of [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]]'s [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]], where his grandfather, unusually for a Jew, was a farmer.  Lustick likened conditions there to those of a [[shtetl]], and he was occasionally the object of anti-Semitic harassment, though the family had a strong sense of patriotic attachment to the country, typical of Jewish immigrants of European background. On graduating from high school, he went on to [[Brandeis University]], arriving in 1967 just as a [[counterculture|countercultural]] wave of [[student activism]] was sweeping higher centres of learning.{{sfn|Lustick|Kreisler|2002}}

He completed his Ph.D. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1976 with a dissertation titled ''Arabs in the Jewish State: a study in the effective control of a minority population'' later adapted for a book of that title, published in 1980. He spent 1979-1980 as an [[Intelligence analysis|analyst]], specializing in the problems of [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israel's occupation]] of the [[Palestinian territories]], for the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], leaving in the summer of 1980 to return to academia.{{sfn|Lustick|2018|p=xi}} He was subsequently appointed professor of government at [[Dartmouth College]],{{sfn|Brinkley|1988|p=13}} where he taught for 15 years.{{sfn|Lustick|Wilcox|2019}} He then took up a [[Chair (academic)|Chair]] of the Political Science Department at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he held the Richard L. Simon Term Professor in the [[Social Sciences]]. At present Lustick is the Bess W. Heyman Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania.{{sfn|PolSciPenn|2020}}

He is a founder and past president of the [[Association for Israel Studies]] and past president of the [[American Political Science Association|American Political Science Association-Politics and History Section]]. Lustick became more broadly known with the publication of his book ''Trapped in the War on Terror'' (2006){{sfn|Lustick|2006}} in which he argues that the [[War on Terrorism]] is an irrational policy for fighting America's enemies.{{efn|'Seldom . .had the American government or the American political system as a whole reacted to a problem more irrationally than it has in responding to the attacks of September 11, 2001, with the War on Terror. The result has been not only waste on a colossal scale and camouflage for a host of selfish and destructive projects by well-positioned zealots but the emergence of a War on Terror that is itself a more fearsome enemy than the terrorists it was putatively designed to fight.'{{sfn|Lustick|2006|pp=1-2}}}} He argues that this policy was initially conceived of by a [[neo-conservative]] [[cabal]]{{efn|Lustick drew an historical analogy with the ''junto''(a term early used of a group dominating the [[Whig Junto|Whig party]] in Great Britain)  or cabal of politicians and activists who manoeuvered America into a [[Mexican–American War|war with Mexico]] and the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] in order to secure a further expansion of the country west and south of its established borders.{{sfn|Lustick|2006|p=49}}}} at the [[Project for a New American Century]] who were determined to shift the direction of U.S. foreign policy towards [[unilateralism]].{{sfn|Lustick|2006|pp=4-5,49ff.}} Given a number of political features unique to the US system, Lustick concluded, the War on Terror has ultimately turned into something beyond anyone's control.{{efn|'The mechanisms that power this whirlwind are nbot under the control of any group or collection of individuals.'{{sfn|Lustick|2006|p=71}}}}

He has engaged in research involving applications of evolutionary and complexity theory to the development of computer simulations using agent-based models for research and policy analysis.{{sfn|Lustick|2000}} Between 2010 and the present day, Lustick has returned to some prominence by writing articles that variously called for Israel to negotiate with Hamas over the future of the area and said that the only way to resolve the war between Israelis and Palestinians was to implement a [[one-state solution]].

He is a member of the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[Association for Israel Studies]], the [[Middle East Studies Association]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].

==Reception of his work==
In a 1989 review of his early work the [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] rabbi [[Elmer Berger (rabbi)|Elmer Berger]] called Lustick a 'first-class Zionist academic', and praised his 'meticulous scholarship'.{{sfn|Berger|1989|pp=109,114}}

In 1988 Lustick published his ''For the Land and the Lord'' a study of [[religious fundamentalism]] in Israel.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=John C. |title=For The Land And The Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism In Israel |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1988-09-01/land-and-lord-jewish-fundamentalism-israel |website=www.foreignaffairs.com |publisher=Foreign Affairs |access-date=14 August 2021}}</ref> It appeared under the imprint of a series of monographs the [[Council of Foreign Relations]] considered a 'responsible treatment(s) of a significant international topic worthy of presentation to the public.'{{sfn|Lustick|1988|p=vi}} In this work, according to [[Joel Brinkley]], he suggested that, were it not for [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel's on-going conflict]] with [[Arab–Israeli conflict|its regional neighbours]], Israel itself might find itself embroiled in a civil war between the opposing poles of [[Secularism in Israel|secular forces]] and [[Religious Zionism|fundamentalist religious Zionists]].{{efn|'Indeed, it is Ian S. Lustick's theory that if it weren't for the preoccupying regional conflict between Arabs and Jews, Israel would find itself caught in another war, this one civil.'{{sfn|Brinkley|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Lustick|1988|pp=182-183}}}} {{efn|'In the writings of one such theorist the most "vitriolic language" is not aimed at Gentiles,"but for Israeli opponents of ''Gush Emunum'', especially those who object to the fundamentalist movement on liberal democratic grounds' (p.123). Democracy as a political system has been the target of numerous attacks from the pens of fundamentalists, and the very idea of majority rule deemed foreign and subversive of Torah Judaism. Only at peril can one ignore the possibility of violence being used against Jewish opponents of the fundamentalists should they achieve a position making this feasible.'{{sfn|Sobel|1989|p=229}}}}
*Elmer Berger wrote that he knew of 'no better documented source in English for anyone interested in greater understanding of both the parties and the leading representatives of this phenomenon' (of Israeli religious fundamentalism).{{efn|'no better documented source in English for anyone interested in greater understanding of both the parties and the leading representatives of this phenomenon' and its increasing influence in a society often heralded as sharing the values of American democracy and as a bastion of liberal thought in a sea of revolutionary and unreliable Arab regimes'.{{sfn|Berger|1989|p=114}}}}  At the same time, he argued that Lustick shared shortcomings discernible in the works of Israel's [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] [[New Historians]] in that the [[Greater Israel|territorial expansionism]]  and [[Ethnocracy|racial discrimination]] documented as recent Zionist trends by the 1980s wave of young Zionist scholars - Lustick charts these traits as bursting into the secular mainstream of Israeli society with the emergence of messianic movements like [[Gush Emunim]] in the 1970s -underplayed, minimized or whitewashed tendencies that were intrinsic to Zionism from its pristine beginnings.{{sfn|Berger|1989|pp=115-116}}

In 2019 he came out with a new book ''Paradigm Lost: From Two-State Solution to One-State Reality '' analyzes the origins and implications of the disappearance of the two-state solution. 
*[[George Washington University]]'s [[Nathan J. Brown (political scientist)|Nathan Brown]] stated in his review that he found the book "accessible, forceful, and concise. Its tone will rub some readers the wrong way but strike others as admirably frank." {{sfn|Brown|2020|pp=137-138}}
