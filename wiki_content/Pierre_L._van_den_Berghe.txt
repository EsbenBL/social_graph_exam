'''Pierre L. van den Berghe''' (1933-2019) was a [[professor emeritus]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.washington.edu/people/faculty_detail.asp?UID=plvdb |title=Pierre van den Berghe |publisher=Soc.washington.edu |access-date=2012-12-10}}</ref> of sociology and anthropology at the [[University of Washington]], where he had worked since 1965. Born in the [[Belgian Congo]] to Belgian parents, and spending [[World War II]] in occupied Belgium, he was an early witness to ethnic conflict and racism, which eventually led him to become a leading authority on ethnic relations. He conducted field work in South Africa, Mexico, Guatemala, Iran, Lebanon, Nigeria, Peru, and Israel. Early in his career, he lectured at the [[University of Natal]] alongside [[Leo Kuper]] and [[Fatima Meer]].{{sfn|van den Berghe|1989|pp=158-159, 170-171}} A student of [[Talcott Parsons]] at Harvard (receiving the PhD in 1960), he nevertheless had little interest in [[structural functionalism]] and was one of the first proponents of [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] approaches to social phenomena.<ref>(van den Berghe 1990)</ref> Van den Berghe died on 6 February 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=King County deaths (02/13/2019) - seattlepi.com|date=14 February 2019|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|url=https://www.seattlepi.com/local/obits/article/King-County-deaths-02-13-2019-13616735.php|access-date=17 December 2019}}</ref>
