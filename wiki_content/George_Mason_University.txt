The [[City of Fairfax, VA|City of Fairfax]] purchased and donated {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of land just south of the city limits to the University of Virginia for the college's new site, which is now referred to as the [[George Mason University Fairfax Campus|Fairfax Campus]]. In 1959, the [[Board of Visitors]] of the University of Virginia selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Fairfax Campus began in 1962.

During the 1966 Session of the [[Virginia General Assembly]], Alexandria delegate [[James M. Thomson (Virginia politician)|James M.

The measure, known as H 33,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ahistoryofmason.gmu.edu/items/show/98 |title=A History of George Mason University – Acts of Assembly, Chapter 68 [H33] Article 8. George Mason College, March 1, 1966. |work=gmu.edu|date=March 1966 }}</ref> passed the Assembly easily and was approved on March 1, 1966 making George Mason College a degree-granting institution. During that same year, the local jurisdictions of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], and the cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to Mason to provide for a {{convert|600|acre|km2|adj=on}} Fairfax Campus with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.

Dr. [[Alan Merten|Alan G. Merten]] was appointed president in 1996. He believed that the university's location made it responsible for both contributing to and drawing from its surrounding communities—local, national, and global. George Mason was becoming recognized and acclaimed in all of these spheres. During Merten's tenure, the university hosted the World Congress of Information Technology in 1998,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wcit2014.org/history/ |title=History |work=WCIT |access-date=August 5, 2015}}</ref> celebrated a second [[Nobel Memorial Prize]]-winning faculty member in 2002, and cheered the [[George Mason Patriots#Men's Basketball|Men's Basketball]] team in their [[NCAA]] [[Final Four (college basketball)|Final Four]] appearance in 2006. Enrollment increased from just over 24,000 students in 1996 to approximately 33,000 during the spring semester of 2012, making Mason Virginia's largest public university and gained prominence at the national level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ahistoryofmason.gmu.edu/exhibits/show/presence/contents/introduction |title=A History of George Mason University – 1996–2012: Prominence : Introduction |work=gmu.edu}}</ref>

Dr. [[Ángel Cabrera (academic)|Ángel Cabrera]] officially took office on July 1, 2012. Both Cabrera and the board were well aware that Mason was part of a rapidly changing academia, full of challenges to the viability of higher education. In a resolution on August 17, 2012, the board asked Dr. Cabrera to create a new strategic vision that would help Mason remain relevant and competitive in the future. The drafting of the Vision for Mason, from conception to official outline, created a new mission statement that defines the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vision.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MasonVision.pdf |title=Mason Vision |website=vision.gmu.edu}}</ref>

On March 25, 2013, university president Ángel Cabrera held a press conference to formally announce the university's decision to leave the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] to join the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (A-10). The announcement came just days after the Board of Visitors' approval of the university's Vision document that Dr. Cabrera had overseen.

It committed to expanding the campus and replacing Original Building with a 400,000sq ft mixed use high rise which would developed in a public private partnership to allow for mixed use commercial space on lower levels. The university also announced the development of an Institute for Digital InnovAtion (IDIA) to include labs, coworking and public programming spaces, ground-floor retail, a parking garage and a public plaza

The university has said they will invest $250 million at the Arlington Campus in the next five years, adding 1,000 faculty members and enlarging the campus to 1.2 million square feet, with an emphasis on computing programs and advanced research in high-tech fields.

== Controversies ==

=== Koch Foundation funding ===
George Mason University has been subject to controversy surrounding donations from the [[Koch family foundations|Charles Koch Foundation]]. University documents revealed that the Koch brothers were given the ability to pick candidates as a condition of monetary donations.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Green|first1=Erica L.|last2=Saul|first2=Stephanie|date=2018-05-05|title=What Charles Koch and Other Donors to George Mason University Got for Their Money|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html|access-date=2020-05-18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> George Mason University altered its donor rules following the controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=George Mason tightens donor rules after uproar over Koch|url=https://apnews.com/807149f5a8044bf49e24deadffac72fd|date=2019-04-26|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

=== Sexual misconduct ===
{{original research|section|date=May 2020}}
George Mason University has been subject to many accusations of mishandling sexual assault and misconduct allegations. In 2016 a male student won an appeal overturning his suspension for sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Student Accused In BDSM Sexual Assault Case Wins Rare Legal Victory|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-mason-sexual-assault-due-process_n_56f9988de4b014d3fe23d789|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2016-03-29|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> The courts found that Brent Ericson, who had prior knowledge of this and previous cases against the student, did not give the student the ability to defend himself, as he suspended the student for prior, unrelated incidences. Brent Ericson has also been accused of sharing home addresses in a sexual misconduct case.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Letter to the Editor {{!}} Fourth Estate|url=https://gmufourthestate.com/2020/03/23/letter-to-the-editor-5/|last=A Concerned Student|date=2020-03-23|website=gmufourthestate.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

The Title IX process at George Mason University has continued to be subject to controversy. Following the hiring of [[Brett Kavanaugh]] as a visiting professor in the law school in 2019, students circulated a petition demanding not only the removal of Kavanaugh, but to increase the number of [[Title IX]] Coordinators on campus. The petition received 10,000 signatures and resulted in approval for funding for two more Title IX Coordinator positions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GMU approves funding for two added Title IX coordinators|url=http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/gmu-approves-funding-for-two-added-title-ix-coordinators/article_dbc3a0be-62db-11e9-a5a5-172f8820e14f.html|last=Times|first=Angela Woolsey/Fairfax County|website=Fairfax County Times|language=en|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> However, as of 2020, George Mason University only has one Title IX Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who Can I Speak With? {{!}} Compliance, Diversity, and Ethics|url=https://diversity.gmu.edu/title-ix/who-can-i-call|website=diversity.gmu.edu|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> At least one student has publicly alleged that George Mason University mishandles Title IX investigations.<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 2, 2020|title=SUFB 971: Protecting The Safety Of Women Within Academia With Chelsea Gray|work=Speak Up for the Blue Podcast|url=https://www.iheart.com/podcast/263-the-speak-up-for-blue-pod-27628957/episode/sufb-971-protecting-the-safety-of-58530293/|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref>

=== Name of law school ===
In 2016, George Mason's law school was briefly named the Antonin Scalia School of Law. Following the realization that this would lead to a vulgar acronym ("ASSLaw"), the school was quickly renamed to the Antonin Scalia Law School.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scalia Law School Changes Name Over NSFW Acronym|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/george-mason-renames-antonin-scalia-law-school-due-awkward-acronym-n551606|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>
