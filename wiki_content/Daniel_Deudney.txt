Deudney's book, ''Bounding Power: Republican Security Theory from the Polis to the Global Village'', is revolutionary in its field, as he seeks to carry out a profound critique of [[realism in international relations|realism]] and [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]]. He argues that realism and liberalism are both fragments of a broader tradition of republican thought. In contrast to either realism or liberalism, republican political thought is focused on negotiating the space between [[anarchy in international relations|anarchy]] and [[hierarchy]]. The book was reviewed in March/April 2007 issue of ''Foreign Affairs''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070301fabook86214/daniel-h-deudney/bounding-power-republican-security-theory-from-the-polis-to-the-global-village.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916010751/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070301fabook86214/daniel-h-deudney/bounding-power-republican-security-theory-from-the-polis-to-the-global-village.html|url-status=dead|title=Review in Foreign Affairs|archivedate=September 16, 2007}}</ref> It received the 2008 Robert Jervis and Paul Schroeder Award for the Best Book on International History and Politics, International History and Politics Section, [[American Political Science Association]], and the 2010 ISA Book of the Decade Award in International Studies, [[International Studies Association]].[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8304.html Bounding Power]

Overall, Deudney remains a liberal theorist, describing liberalism as "not the enemy of republican security theory, but its privileged... child".<ref>''Bounding Power: Republican Security Theory from the Polis to the Global Village'', p. 15</ref> He believes the liberal democratic model will prevail in the world, and without believing in the triumphalism of [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s thesis, he paraphrases him: "Liberal states should not assume that history has ended, but they can still be certain that it is on their side."<ref>''The Myth of the Autocratic Revival: Why Liberal Democracy Will Prevail''.
