The [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts colonial legislature]] authorized Harvard's founding, "dreading to leave an illiterate [[Minister (Christianity)|ministry]] to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust"; though never formally affiliated with any [[Religious denomination|denomination]], in its early years [[Harvard College]] primarily trained [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, it had emerged as the central cultural establishment among [[Boston Brahmin|the Boston elite]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Harvard and the Boston Brahmins: A Study in Institutional and Class Development, 1800–1865|last=Story|first=Ronald|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=8|issue=3 |year=1975|pages=94–121|doi=10.1353/jsh/8.3.94}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Betty G.|title=Elite Families: Class and Power in Nineteenth-Century Boston|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1593-7|publisher=State University of New York Press}}</ref>
Following the [[American Civil War]], President [[Charles William Eliot]]'s long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the [[Harvard College|college]] and affiliated professional schools into a modern [[research university]]; Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.<ref name="AAU">{{cite web |url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476|title=Member Institutions and years of Admission|publisher=Association of American Universities|access-date=August 28, 2010}}</ref> [[James B.

The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]]. [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Arts and Sciences]] offers study in a wide range of [[academic discipline]]s for undergraduates and for graduates, while the other faculties offer only graduate degrees, mostly [[professional degree|professional]].

The charter creating the [[Harvard Corporation]] was granted in 1650.

and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model{{mdashb}}many leaders in the colony had attended the [[University of Cambridge]]{{mdashb}}but conformed to the tenets of [[Puritanism]].

[[Increase Mather]] served as president from 1681 to 1701.

In the 19th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of reason and free will were widespread among [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>Gary J.

[[Charles William Eliot]], president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was the crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education but by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions influenced by [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stephen P.|last=Shoemaker|title=The Theological Roots of Charles W.

In the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the [[Harvard College|undergraduate college]] expanded. [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as the female counterpart of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.<ref name="AAU" />

The student body in the early decades of the century was predominantly "old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians." A 1923 proposal by President [[A. Lawrence Lowell]] that Jews be limited to 15% of undergraduates was rejected, but Lowell did ban blacks from freshman dormitories.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerome Karabel|title=The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&pg=PA23|year=2006|page=23|isbn=978-0-618-77355-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinberg|first1=Stephen|title=How Jewish Quotas Began|journal=Commentary|date=September 1, 1971|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-jewish-quotas-began/|access-date=September 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Dirk|title=YALE'S LIMIT ON JEWISH ENROLLMENT LASTED UNTIL EARLY 1960'S, BOOK SAYS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/nyregion/yale-s-limit-on-jewish-enrollment-lasted-until-early-1960-s-book-says.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 4, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lowell Tells Jews Limits at Colleges Might Help Them|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/06/17/109843455.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 17, 1922}}</ref>

President [[James B. Conant]] reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty to make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as at the college level. The resulting ''Report'', published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in 20th century American education.<ref>Anita Fay Kravitz, "The Harvard Report of 1945: An historical ethnography", Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1994, 367 pages; AAT 9427558</ref>

Between 1945 and 1960, admissions were opened up to bring in a more diverse group of students. No longer drawing mostly from select New England [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the [[Harvard College|undergraduate college]] became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics, or Asians.<ref>Malka A.
