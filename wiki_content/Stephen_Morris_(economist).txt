== Research contribution ==
Global coordination games belong to a subfield of [[game theory]] which gained momentum with the article by Morris and Shin (1998). Stephen Morris and [[Hyun Song Shin]] considered a stylized [[currency crises]] model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result is in stark contrast with models of [[complete information]], which feature multiple equilibria.

Morris has also made important contributions to the theory of [[mechanism design]]. In his work with Dirk Bergemann on robust mechanism design they relaxed common knowledge assumptions which were prevalent in the early mechanism design literature. By formulating the mechanism design problem more precisely, they showed that simple mechanisms arise endogeneously. This provided a theoretical justification for the relatively simple auction design employed in practice, when compared to the complexity of optimal auctions suggested by the early literature.
