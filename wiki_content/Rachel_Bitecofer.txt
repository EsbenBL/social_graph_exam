== Early life and career ==
Bitecofer graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' with honors from the [[University of Oregon]] where she earned a bachelor's degree in political science and earned her Ph.D. in political science and [[international affairs]] from the [[University of Georgia]]. In 2015 she became a lecturer at Christopher Newport University and assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy where she conducted polling. In 2019 she applied to convert her position to [[tenure track]], which would lighten her teaching responsibilities, but was denied by the university. As a result, she resigned her position and went to work for the [[Niskanen Center]], a centrist think tank in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="jones">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Matt |title=Election forecaster Rachel Bitecofer to leave CNU after denied shot at tenure |url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/education/dp-nw-rachel-bitecofer-cnu-resignation-20200324-6q3e3zpfubec5jrvh65uxgefl4-story.html |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Daily Press |date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> Bitecofer's analysis has appeared on multiple media platforms including MSNBC and The New York Times. She wrote the 2017 book '' The Unprecedented 2016 Presidential Election'' on the [[2016 United States presidential election|election of Donald Trump]] and runs a podcast titled The Election Whisperer hosted by Substack. Today she runs Strike Pac, a liberal super PAC.<ref name="msnbc.com">{{Cite web|title=New superPAC launches to battle Republican messaging|url=https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/new-superpac-launches-to-battle-republican-messaging-114285637695|access-date=2021-06-08|website=MSNBC.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Election analysis and prediction==
In 2017, Bitecofer released a book called ''The Unprecedented 2016 Presidential Election'', where she argued that the election of [[Donald Trump]] was not the result of one or two causes, but rather the product of a long process that began in the 1950s. She noted several breaks from past political reporting in the [[Media coverage of the 2016 United States presidential election#Donald Trump|media's coverage of Trump]], such as the number of days where Trump received 60% or more of all candidate coverage and his few [[Newspaper endorsements in the 2016 United States presidential primaries#Donald Trump (nominee)|newspaper endorsements]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Hillary |title=Christopher Newport University professor writes book on 2016 presidential election |url=https://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/books/dp-fea-cnu-professor-writes-book-presidential-election-20170922-story.html |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Daily Press |date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> She later criticized the media and public for characterizing Trump's 2016 performance in the [[Blue wall (politics)|blue wall]] states of [[Michigan]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wisconsin]] as a "mythic legend of invincibility"; instead, she attributed the 2016 result to complacency, depressed [[African-American]] turnout, [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference]], and dislike of [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name="bitecofer-201907">{{cite news |last1=Bitecofer |first1=Rachel |title=With 16 Months to go, Negative Partisanship Predicts the 2020 Presidential Election |url=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/2019/07/01-2020-election-forecast/ |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy |date=July 1, 2019}}</ref>

Bitecofer was recognized for predicting the size of the [[2018 United States midterm elections|"Blue Wave" in the 2018 United States midterm elections]] much more early than other forecasters.<ref name="freedlander"/> She first predicted that [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] would pick up 42 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in September 2018,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bitecofer |first1=Rachel |title=Signs, Signs, Everywhere Are Signs: Why Democrats Will Win Big in the 2018 Midterms |url=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/2018/09/26-signs-democrats-win-big/ |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy |date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> revising her forecast to 45 seats in November,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bitecofer |first1=Rachel |title= The Battle of the Bases: Negative Partisanship Will Decide Election 2018 |url=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/2018/11/02-battle-of-the-bases/ |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy |date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> just days before the election even as others were revising their estimates downwards.<ref name="freedlander"/> Democrats ultimately gained 41 seats in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|House election]], making her prediction one of the most accurate of that cycle.<ref name="capehart">{{cite news |last1=Capehart |first1=Jonathan |title='Black Americans are saving America from itself' in the Democratic primaries |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/12/black-americans-are-saving-america-itself-democratic-primaries/ |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Washington Post |date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> She then used the same theory to anticipate that Democrats would recapture the presidency more than a year out from the election.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bitecofer|first=Rachel|date=2019-01-25|title=Opinion {{!}} Why Trump Will Lose in 2020|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/opinion/trump-2020-election.html|access-date=2021-06-08|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Following the work of [[Alan Abramowitz]] on a concept called "negative partisanship" Bitecofer's main thesis is that modern elections are not decided merely by the [[swing vote]], but rather, what she calls "coalitional turnout" for each party. [[Negative partisanship]], which argues voters are increasingly motivated by dislike, hate, and fear of the other party prioritizes defeating the other side over any specific policy objective.<ref name="freedlander"/> Under this theory, shifts in [[voter turnout]] between cycles are critically important to each party's success. Along with a small swing each cycle among "pure" independents (independents that do not "lean" towards either party, another important and overlooked "swing" is what Bitecofer dubbed the "turnout swing" which comes from whether voters decide to vote at all rather than deciding who to vote for. This view has been criticized by other political analysts like [[David Wasserman]] of ''[[The Cook Political Report]]'', with others such as [[Kyle Kondik]] of The Crystal Ball and [[Sam Wang (neuroscientist)|Sam Wang]] offering more support.

Bitecofer argues that instead of ideology, Democratic candidates should "lean in" to being Democrats and abandon the preference of Democrats to nominate unobtrusive, "Blue Dogs" who run against their own party's brand. The fact that progressive favorites like [[Stacey Abrams]] and [[Beto O'Rourke]] often came much closer to winning their races in [[red state]]s in 2018 than [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog]] moderates who tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump has been held as validation for her theory.<ref name="freedlander" /> As has the successful campaigns of [[Raphael Warnock]] and [[Jon Ossoff]] in Georgia<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blanco|first=Adrian|last2=Mellnik|first2=Ted|last3=Schaul|first3=Kevin|last4=Still|first4=Ashlyn|date=2021-01-06|title=Republicans across Georgia stayed home, helping Democrats flip two Senate seats|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/06/republicans-across-georgia-stayed-home-helping-democrats-flip-least-one-senate-seat/|access-date=2021-06-08|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> and [[Mark Kelly]] in Arizona.

In July 2019 Bitecofer predicted that President Trump would lose the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]], with the Democratic candidate winning a base of at least 278 [[electoral vote]]s, correctly anticipated a Democratic sweep of three Midwest states in the Democrat's so-called Blue Wall that Trump won narrowly in 2016 <ref name="bitecofer-201907" /><ref name="rodrigo">{{cite news |last1=Rodrigo |first1=Chris Mills |title=Trump predicted to lose reelection in model that forecasted Democratic takeover of House |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/451218-trump-predicted-to-lose-reelection-in-model-that-forecast-dem-takeover-of |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=The Hill |date=July 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ress |first1=Dave |title=Regressing, to look forward: CNU's Bitecofer forecasts a Trump defeat in 2020 |url=https://www.dailypress.com/government/local/dp-nws-bitecofer-20190702-story.html |access-date=June 12, 2020 |work=Daily Press |date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> During the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic primaries]], she attributed the increased turnout and [[Joe Biden]]'s success in the primary process to the eagerness of Democrats and Democratic-leaning [[independent voter|independents]] (and in particular, black voters) to remove Trump from office.<ref name="capehart" /> Bitecofer argued the 2020 electorate would see the return of voters who, feeling assured of a Trump loss, sat out the 2016 election but were now "terrified" that Trump is seemingly unstoppable.<ref name="rodrigo" />

== Post-Academic Career ==

Following her research career, Bitecofer has launched a liberal super PAC named Strike Pac, which she describes as "a war machine for the Left." Arguing that strategy and messaging for Democrats is woefully asymmetrical to the GOP's, she asserts that going forward, Democrats must launch a "brand offensive" against Republicans.<ref name="msnbc.com"/>
