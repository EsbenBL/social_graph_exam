After serving in [[World War II]], he moved to the [[University of New Mexico]] to finish his graduate studies, becoming the University’s first doctoral candidate in anthropology in 1948. Adair than moved to [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni]] with his pregnant wife Casey and their son.  His sole purpose of moving to Zuni was to gather information that he could use in his dissertation, "The Veterans of World War II at Zuni Pueblo", which was never published.<ref name="obit" /><ref name="memorial">{{cite journal | author = Clifford Barnett| author2=Richard Chalfen |author3=James C.

[[Cornell University]] hired him in 1948.  The school asked him to teach a series of field seminars in the Southwest.  The resulting studies in the Southwest were published as the book ''First Look at Strangers'' in 1959.<ref name="memorial" />

Adair joined the Cornell-Navajo Field Health Research Project at Many Farms, located on the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo Reservation]] in [[Arizona]], working there as chief anthropologist from 1953 to 1960.  He, along with many other anthropologists, played an important role in this project.  They were asked to provide anthropological insight, perspectives, and methodologies.  Adair and two other anthropologists published a report of the project in ''The People’s Health'' in 1970 and later revised the report in 1988.<ref name="obit" />

Adair worked with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) from 1961 to 1964.  At the conclusion of his work in the NIMH, he became Professor of Anthropology at [[San Francisco State University]], where he remained until his retirement in 1978.<ref name="obit" />

He is also known for the 1972 book, ''Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film Communication and Anthropology'', which he co-authored with [[Sol Worth]].<ref name="obit" />
