'''Maffeo Pantaleoni''' ({{IPA-it|mafˈfeːo pantaleˈoːni|lang}}; [[Frascati]], 2 July 1857{{spaced ndash}}[[Milan]], 29 October 1924) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[economics|economist]]. At first he was a notable proponent of [[neoclassical economics]]. Later in his life, before and during [[World War I]], he became an ardent [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and syndicalist, with close ties to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement. He was Minister of Finance in the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro|Carnaro]] government of [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] at [[Fiume]], which lasted for fifteen months between 1919 and 1920. Shortly before his death, he was elected to the [[Italian Senate]].

==Work==
Pantaleoni was a major contributor to the Italian school of economics known as 'La Scienza delle Finanze'. His book ''Teoria della Traslazione dei Tributi'' (theory of tax shifting) is a pioneering study of [[tax incidence]].  According to [[Nobel prize]] winner [[James M. Buchanan]], Pantaleoni and his followers (such as [[Antonio De Viti De Marco]] and  [[Vilfredo Pareto]]) can be considered the intellectual forefathers of the modern [[public choice theory]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Buchanan |first= James |author-link= James M.
