==Head of state==
The [[President of Bangladesh|President]] is the [[Head of State]], a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]]. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], mainly in controlling the transition to a new government. Bangladesh has instituted a unique system of transfer of power; at the end of the tenure of the government, power is handed over to members of a civil society for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was first practiced in 1991 and adopted to the constitution in 1996.<ref name="amend13">''14th Amendment'', Constitution of Bangladesh, 1996.</ref>

As head of the state, the president can grant pardon to a man sentenced to death penalty or lessen the punishment. In some cases, it also performs some legislative and judicial functions.

[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (07).jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of Bangladesh]]]]
The legislature of Bangladesh is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]]. The 300 members are elected by [[universal suffrage]] at least every 5 years.  It consists of 350 members at present. There is universal suffrage for all citizens at the age of 18.

"On 16 May 2004, the [[Jatiya Sangsad]] (the National Parliament) passed the 14th constitutional amendment to reintroduce quotas for women (article 65). The number of seats in parliament is to be raised to 345, 45 (15%) of which will be reserved for women in the next parliament. The seats will be allocated to parties in proportion to their overall share of the vote. This quota system replaces the previous quota law which expired in 2001. Until 2001 a system of reserved seats for women was used, where 30 seats out of 330 were reserved to women (chosen by indirect election by the 300 directly elected MPs). This provision of guaranteeing women reserved seats expired in April 2001. This quota system was first introduced by the 1972 Constitution (originally providing for 15 reserved seats for women, out of 315 seats, for a period of 10 years). In 1978 a presidential proclamation enlarged the number of reserved seats to 30 and extended the period of reservation to 15 years from the date of promulgation of the constitution of the Republic in December 1972. The constitutional provision lapsed in 1987 and was re-incorporated in the constitution by an amendment in 1990 to be effective for 10 years from the first meeting of the legislature next elected. This provision also lapsed in 2001. The Parliament elected in October 2001 does not have reserved seats for women. Women's groups are lobbying for these seats to become directly elected positions and for the number of reserved seats to be increased."

The 10th Parliament had its first sitting on 25 January 2009 . Currently there are 350 members of the house of which 50 memberships are reserved for women.<ref>Bangladesh and Global Studies (NCTB)</ref>

Until recently, Chief Justice and judges were recommended by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the President. Since 1991, political parties during their tenure in government have initiated the separation of the judiciary from control by the executive branch brought about by amendment of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] in 1975. The separation by presidential promulgation acts have signed and passed. Acts on the separation of Judiciary Administration, Remuneration, Pay and Leave, etc. have all been completed.
