==Career==
Novkov remained at the University of Oregon for 10 years, from 1996-2006. In 2006, she moved to the University at Albany, SUNY.<ref name=profile/> From 2011-2017 she was the Chair of the political science department at SUNY Albany.<ref name=profile/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.albany.edu/mals/53417.php |title=Julie Novkov Profile |publisher=University at Albany, SUNY |access-date=8 January 2020}}</ref> Since 2018 she has been the Director of Undergraduate Studies in that department, and from 2008-2011 she was the Director of Graduate Studies.<ref name=profile/> She became a Collins Fellow at SUNY Albany in 2017.<ref name=profile/>

Novkov's first book, ''Constituting Workers, Protecting Women: Gender, Law, and Labor in the Progressive Era and New Deal Years'', was published in 2001. Novkov argues that gender is a crucial analytical category in the modern legal system, and specifically that "much of the doctrinal framework for the modern interventionist state arose through battles over female workers' proper relationships with the state."<ref name=storrs02>{{cite journal |first=Landon |last=R. Y. Storrs |journal=Law and History Review |title=Review of Constituting Workers, Protecting Women: Gender, Law, and Labor in the Progressive Era and New Deal Years |volume=21 |number=3 |year=2003 |pages=640–642|doi=10.2307/3595133 |jstor=3595133 }}</ref> To establish the gendered origins of modern employment laws, Novkov draws on hundreds of cases that concerned labor issues between 1873 and 1937, from both the state and federal level.<ref name=storrs02/>

In 2008, Novkov published her second book, ''Racial Union: Law, Intimacy, and the White State in Alabama, 1865-1954''. This book studies the history and use of [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|bans on interracial marriage]] in [[Alabama]], which retained language against [[interracial marriage]]s until 2000.<ref name=sullivan09>{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Kathleen |title=Review of Racial Union: Law, Intimacy, and the White State in Alabama, 1865-1954 |journal=Law & Society Review |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=445–447 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5893.2009.00378_4.x}}</ref> Novkov separates the legal history of Alamaba's anti-[[miscegenation]] law into several periods within the span 1865-1954, and uses the legal trends within each period to argue that the anti-miscegenation law was being used as a tool of state-building.<ref name=sullivan09/> This places anti-miscegenation laws at the center of developing and securing a regime of white supremacy in the state.<ref name=sullivan09/> ''Racial Union'' won the [[American Political Science Association]]'s 2009 Ralph Bunche Award, which is given "for the best scholarly work in political science published in the previous calendar year that explores the phenomenon of ethnic and cultural pluralism."<ref name=bunche>{{cite web |url=https://blog.press.umich.edu/2009/08/racial-union-wins-american-political-science-association-award/ |publisher=University of Michigan Press |date=31 August 2009 |access-date=8 January 2020 |title="Racial Union" Wins American Political Science Association Award |last=Bishop |first=Kris}}</ref>
