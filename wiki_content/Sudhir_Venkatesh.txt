===Public housing===
After earning his Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Chicago in 1997, Venkatesh went on to write an award-winning book, ''American Project: The Rise and Fall of a Modern Ghetto'', published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 2000. Based on nearly a decade of doctoral fieldwork in Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes, ''American Project'' "seeks to reexamine public housing from the inside out, and to salvage its troubled legacy."<ref>{{cite web |title=American Project—Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh - Harvard University Press |url=https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674008304}}</ref>

The following year, Venkatesh co-authored a study on [[public housing]] with Steven D. Levitt, titled "Growing Up in the Projects: The Economic Lives of a Cohort of Men who Came of Age in Chicago Public Housing," which was published in the [[American Economic Review]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levitt |first1=Steven D. |last2=Venkatesh |first2=Sudhir Alladi |title=Growing Up in the Projects: The Economic Lives of a Cohort of Men Who Came of Age in Chicago Public Housing |journal=American Economic Review |date=May 2001 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=79–84 |doi=10.1257/aer.91.2.79}}</ref>

===Gangs and underground economies===
In 2008 Venkatesh authored a book titled, ''[[Gang Leader for a Day]]: A Rogue Sociologist Takes To The Streets''. The book chronicles the life of urban poor in Chicago, particularly the Robert Taylor Homes and the gang, the Black Kings, whose leader J.T. he befriended (J.T. was renamed in the book for anonymity). He found that most foot soldiers in drug gangs make only $3.30 an hour. The year it came out, ''Gang Leader for a Day'' was awarded Best Book awards from ''The Economist'' and Slate.com. In 2015, [[Facebook]] CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] selected the book for his "A Year of Books" book club.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Book Club Gang Leader For A Day |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-book-club-gang-leader-for-a-day-2015-2}}</ref> In 2017, it was reported that AMC Networks would be developing a drama series adaptation from the book.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edward Burns & Radar Developing 'The Line Between' Thriller Novel For Television |url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/edward-burns-radar-developing-the-line-between-thriller-novel-for-television-1202538907/}}</ref>

Two years prior, Vankatesh authored another book about illegal economies in Chicago, titled ''Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor''. Published by Harvard University Press in 2006, ''Off the Books'' received a Best Book Award from Slate.com in 2006, as well as the [[C. Wright Mills Award]] in 2007.<ref name="cv">{{cite web |title=venkatesh_sudhirCV |url=http://ac4link.ei.columbia.edu/profiles/detail/226}}</ref>

In a separate research project with [[Steven Levitt]], Venkatesh hired former sex workers to track working street prostitutes in Chicago, finding that they make about $30–$35 an hour, with those working with pimps making more and suffering fewer arrests. A street prostitute was arrested about once per 450 sexual encounters ("tricks"). [[Condoms]] were used in only 20% of the contacts.<ref>{{cite news |title=In the Windy City, prostitutes sleep with police more often than get arrested by them |url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2008/01/07/in_the_windy_city_prostitutes_sleep_with_police_more_often_than_get_arrested_by_the |date=January 7, 2008}}</ref> Together, Venkatesh and Levitt co-authored two articles in 2000, "'Are We a Family or a Business?'
