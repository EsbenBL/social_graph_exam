Robinson: Vitae}}</ref> and made several contributions to [[Al Jazeera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/profile/william-i-robinson.html|title=William I. Robinson &#124; al Jazeera News &#124; Today's latest from al Jazeera}}</ref> Many of his works have been translated into Spanish.<ref>http://alainet.org/active/show_author.phtml?autor_nombre=William%20I.&autor_apellido=Robinson</ref>

==Theoretical debates==
Entire symposiums and issues of scholarly journals have focused on discussing and debating Robinson's theories on global capitalism, class, and political economy. See for example the May 2012 issue of Critical Sociology [http://crs.sagepub.com/], the April 2001 issue of Theory and Society, the debate between Robinson and noted Marxian theorist [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] in issue 15 of the journal Historical Materialism, the debate between British political economist in the 2009 volume 1(2) of the journal of the contemporary science association.

==Controversy==
In 2009 Robinson forwarded an e-mail to his "Sociology of Globalization" course, to spur class discussion, that had photos of the 2008-9 Israeli assault on Gaza paralleling photos of the German occupation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] during the Second World War. The e-mail was widely circulated and became the subject of media controversy, after it was revealed that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), a group generally considered to be pro-Israel,<ref name='adlnyt'>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/opinion/editorials/israel-bds.html |title=Curbing Speech in the Name of Helping Israel |journal=The New York Times |date=18 December 2018 }}</ref> advised university administrators to punish him. A [[Jewish]] student in the class brought a complaint against Robinson, that she was intimidated by the e-mail. The ADL criticized Robinson, considering the matter a case of academic misconduct, while [[California Scholars for Academic Freedom]] considered it a case of [[academic freedom]] and the charges without merit.<ref name="Chronicle">{{cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/temp/email2.php?id=CHBfzphdrpXJxfsyHVRgsjpfsZPswXqY |title=Head of Anti-Defamation League Urged Santa Barbara to Act Against Critic of Israel |author=Peter Schmidt |date=April 29, 2009 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] }}{{dead link|date=August 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name="Counterpunch">{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cloud04302009.html |author = Dana L.

"That's like saying if I condemn the U.S. government for the invasion of Iraq, I'm anti-American.

University officials initiated an investigation of Robinson to probe the allegations that the email Robinson had forwarded to his class was inappropriate and in violation of the faculty code of ethics.  The charges were dismissed in May 2009.<ref name="spme.net"/>
