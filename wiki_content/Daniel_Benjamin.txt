==Early life==
Benjamin grew up in [[Stamford, Conn.]], one of three sons (William Benjamin and Jonathan Benjamin) born to Burton and Susan Benjamin. His father is an [[internist]]; his late mother was a teacher, an administrator at the [[University of Connecticut]] and the head of marketing for a Manhattan law firm. They were a moderately observant Jewish family. 
Benjamin graduated from [[Harvard University]] [[magna cum laude]], where he was a 1983 [[Marshall Scholar]] at [[New College, Oxford]].<ref>[https://www.vnews.com/Daniel-Benjamin-director-Dickey-Center-Dartmouth-10035973 Dickey Center Director Writes, Speaks With Urgency of the Times]. By Nicola Smith. ''Valley News'', May 28, 2017.</ref> After college, he worked as a journalist for ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

From 2009 to 2012, Benjamin was the [[US State Department]]'s Coordinator for [[counter-terrorism]], with the rank of [[Ambassador-at-Large]].<ref name=brookings/>

==Academic work==

Benjamin was a Senior Fellow in the International Security Program at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/daniel-benjamin/|title = Daniel Benjamin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Benjamin/benjamin-con0.html|title=Conversations with History|last=Kreisler|first=Harry}}</ref> He was also named a 2004 [[Berlin prize]] fellow by the [[American Academy in Berlin]].

From December 2006 to May 2009, Benjamin served as the Director for the Center on the United States and Europe, and Senior Fellow of Foreign Policy Studies at [[The Brookings Institution]].<ref name=brookings>[http://www.brookings.edu/experts/benjamind.aspx Daniel Benjamin's Brookings Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030050031/http://www.brookings.edu/experts/benjamind.aspx |date=October 30, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2012, he was appointed the Norman E. McCulloch Jr. Director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College.<ref name= dartmouthprofile/>

==Writing==
Together with [[Steven Simon]], Benjamin wrote ''The Age of Sacred Terror'' ([[Random House]], 2002), which documents the rise of [[al Qaeda]] and religiously motivated [[terrorism]], as well as America's efforts to combat that threat. They review the history of [[Islamist]] political thought from [[ibn Taymiyya]] in the 13th century, to [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab|al-Wahhab]] (the 18th century founder of [[Wahabbism]]) down to [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]]. The danger, as they see it, is that "al Qaeda's belief system cannot be separated neatly from Islamic teachings, because it has -- selectively and perniciously -- built on fundamental Islamic ideas and principles." The second half of the book outlines the West's response. Ellen Laipson, in her review of the book, praises the authors for their study and methodology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Laipson|first=Ellen|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/58630/ellen-laipson/while-america-slept-understanding-terrorism-and-counterterrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs|title=While America Slept: Understanding Terrorism and Counterterrorism|date=Janâ€“Feb 2003|doi=10.2307/20033435|jstor=20033435|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref>

Benjamin and Simon would follow up ''The Age of Sacred Terror'' in 2005 with ''The Next Attack: The Globalization of Jihad'' (Hodder & Soughton (in Britain), 2005), a book which received high-praise from [[Bill Clinton]].

In the April 30, 2006 edition of ''Time'', Benjamin wrote a favorable profile of [[Pervez Musharraf]], with the headline, "Why Pakistan's Leader May Be The West's Best Bet for Peace."
