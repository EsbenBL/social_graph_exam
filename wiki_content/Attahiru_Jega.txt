Jega is a former president of the [[Academic Staff Union of Universities]] (ASUU), and was an opponent of the [[Ibrahim Babangida|Babangida]] military government in the early 1990s.
Politically leaning towards the left, as ASUU President he was closely associated with the [[Nigeria Labour Congress]] (NLC), and continued that connection throughout his career.

Jega was appointed a member of the Justice [[Mohammed Uwais]] Electoral Reform Committee, which submitted a report on 11 December 2008 with recommendations that included establishing commissions to deal with Electoral Offences, Constituency Delimitation and Political Parties Registration and Regulation.
The committee also recommended proportional representation and that the INEC head should be appointed by the judiciary rather than the President.

On the 28 of March 2015, under his leadership, elections were conducted in what Nigerians and the World see as free, fair and credible which declared the APC Presidential candidate General [[Muhammadu Buhari]] as winner defeating the Incumbent President [[Goodluck Jonathan]].<ref>{{cite web

==INEC nomination==

Jega's nomination as INEC chairman followed approval by a meeting of the National Council of State called by President Jonathan and attended by former heads of state [[Yakubu Gowon]], [[Muhammadu Buhari]], [[Ibrahim Babangida]], [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]], [[Ernest Shonekan]], [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] and [[Shehu Shagari]].
The Senate President [[David Mark]], Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Oladimeji Bankole]], and most of the state Governors also attended the meeting.
Unanimous approval by the council of the nominee for this critical appointment avoided controversy about whether or not the President should appoint the chairman of the INEC.<ref>{{cite web
