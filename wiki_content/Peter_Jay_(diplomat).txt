'''Peter Jay''' (born 7 February 1937) is an English economist, broadcaster and former diplomat.

==Life==
Peter Jay is the son of [[Douglas Jay, Baron Jay]], and [[Peggy Jay]], both of whom were [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politicians. He was educated at The [[Dragon School]], Oxford (the ''alma mater'' of several senior Labour politicians, including [[Hugh Gaitskell]]), followed by [[Winchester College]]<ref name=Observer>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/jun/18/life1.lifemagazine6 |title=Jay talking |newspaper=The Observer |location= London |accessdate=11 January 2011|date=18 June 2000}}</ref> (where he was Senior Commoner Prefect) and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he graduated with a [[first class honours degree]] in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]].<ref name=Observer/> In [[Trinity Term]] 1960, he was president of the [[Oxford Union]].<ref>The Papers of Peter Jay 4/2/1 - Churchill College, Cambridge<nowiki/>https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/9/resources/1770</ref> He was commissioned in the [[Royal Navy]], then worked as a [[civil servant]] at [[HM Treasury]] before becoming a [[journalist]] and, for 10 years, economics editor with ''[[The Times]]''.

Jay married [[Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington|Margaret Callaghan]], the daughter of Labour politician [[James Callaghan]], in 1961. In 1977, when his father-in-law had become Prime Minister, Jay was appointed to the post of [[United Kingdom Ambassador to the United States|Ambassador]] to the [[United States]] by the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], his friend [[David Owen]]. As Jay was just 40 years old, was not a diplomat and had never held any public office, this appointment caused some controversy and accusations of [[nepotism]].<ref name=Observer/>

He married secondly, in 1986, Emma Bettina, daughter of the museum curator and writer [[Peter Thornton]]. He has seven children.<ref>Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage 1990, ed. Patrick Montague-Smith, pg 686</ref>

==Career==
In the early 1970s, Jay became the principal presenter of the [[London Weekend Television]] Sunday news analysis programme ''[[Weekend World]]''. He co-authored, with his friend [[John Birt, Baron Birt|John Birt]], a series of articles for ''The Times'' in 1972, in which they criticised standard television journalism and developed what came to be called their "mission to explain".

As leader of a consortium of high-profile media figures, including [[Angela Rippon]], [[David Frost]], [[Michael Parkinson]] and [[Anna Ford]], he won the franchise and became the founding chairman of [[TV-am]], a breakfast TV station launched by the consortium. When the initial focus on news and current affairs did not yield economic success, he was fired by his friend and co-director [[Jonathan Aitken]].<ref name=Observer/>

Jay's career took a surprising turn when he became Chief of Staff to [[Robert Maxwell]] during his most high-profile years. His wife Margaret led Maxwell's Aids Foundation around the same time, where she met her present husband Professor Mike Adler.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Peter Jay later returned to broadcast journalism; John Birt appointed him Economics Editor of the BBC, and he presented editions of ''[[The Money Programme]]''.
 
He wrote ''The Road to Riches or the Wealth of Man'' (2000, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]) and presented a related BBC TV documentary series. He also co-wrote with Michael Stewart the speculative historical novel ''[[Apocalypse 2000: Economic Breakdown and the Suicide of Democracy]]''.

While his father was closely linked with [[Keynesian economics]], Jay increasingly identified himself with the new 'monetarian' school associated with [[Milton Friedman]], a man he was close friends with.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=Andy |title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies |date=2009 |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |page=338}}</ref> He has also debated with Friedman and [[Thomas Sowell]], including two episodes of Friedman's TV series ''[[Free to Choose]]'' (1980). Jay was credited with helping write Callaghan's speech at the 1976 [[Labour Party Conference]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meredith |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=The oratory of James Callaghan |editor1-last=Crines |editor1-first=Andrew |title=Labour Orators from Aneurin Bevan to Gordon Brown |date=2014 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=9780719089800 |pages=76â€“92}}</ref> The speech is seen as something of a turning point with Callaghan declaring 'We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession, and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists', a rejection of the previously dominant Keynesian logic and a reflection of the ascendency of [[Monetarism]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Callaghan |first1=James |title=Leader's speech, Blackpool 1976 |url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=174 |website=British Political Speeches |accessdate=21 October 2020}}</ref> Jay used his column in the Times to advocate for neoliberal policies in Britain.

He was also the moderator of the discussions in the British version of ''Free to Choose''.<ref>Milton & [[Rose Friedman]], ''Two Lucky People. Memoirs'', Chicago & London: The University of Chicago Press, 1998, p. 499;L Borders, Max (25 January 2011) [http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/139978 Who is Francis Fox Piven?], ''[[Washington Examiner]]''</ref>

He was a non-executive director of the [[Bank of England]] from June 2003 to May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Jay |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=28367636&privcapId=874036&previousCapId=877408&previousTitle=Care%20UK%20plc |title=Peter Jay: Executive Profile & Biography - Businessweek |publisher=Investing.businessweek.com |accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> He has been a governor of the [[Ditchley Foundation]] since 1982, and is a councillor on [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]] Town Council.
