The University of Minnesota was founded in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] in 1851 as a [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory school]], seven years prior to Minnesota's statehood.<ref name=":0" /> It struggled in its early years and relied on donations to stay open from donors including South Carolina Governor [[William Aiken Jr.]]<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

In 1867, the university received land grant status through the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minnpost.com/minnesota-history/2012/09/land-grant-exhibit-looks-back-150-years-u-m-history/|title=Land-grant exhibit looks back at 150 years of U of M history|date=September 10, 2012|website=MinnPost|language=en-US|access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/2467635-column-land-grant-mission-has-deep-roots-minnesota-history|title=Column: Land-grant mission has deep roots in Minnesota history|last=Reinert {{!}}|first=Roger|date=March 16, 2014|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>

==Campuses==
===Demographics: Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) campus===
''Note: The flagship University of Minnesota campus is the Twin Cities campus, which comprises grounds in St. Paul and Minneapolis, the latter divided into areas on both the east and west banks of the Mississippi River. Administratively, these are all one campus, but for purposes of simplicity, this article will apply "campus" to its component parts where necessary to avoid confusion with the names of cities.''

As the largest of five campuses across the University of Minnesota system, the Twin Cities campus has more than 50,000 students; this makes it the sixth-largest campus student body in the United States overall. It also has more than 300 research, education, and outreach centers and institutes, on everything from the life sciences to public policy and technology.<ref name="timeshighereducation.com"/>

The university offers 143 undergraduate degree programs<ref>{{cite web|title=Admissions|url=http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/admissions.php|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota|access-date=September 19, 2009}}</ref> and 200 graduate degree programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Degree Programs|url=http://twin-cities.umn.edu/academics|website=Academics webpage|publisher=University of Minnesota, Twin Cities|access-date=February 21, 2016|date=April 29, 2015}}</ref> The university has all three branches of the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC)|url=http://www.catalogs.umn.edu/ug/rotc/rotcinfo.html|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota |access-date=September 17, 2009}}</ref> The Twin Cities campus, as well as the campuses at [[University of Minnesota Crookston|Crookston]], [[University of Minnesota Duluth|Duluth]], [[University of Minnesota Morris|Morris]], and [[University of Minnesota Rochester|Rochester]], are accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/reviews/gen_institutional/accreditation_um.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 9, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505170140/http://academic.umn.edu/provost/reviews/gen_institutional/accreditation_um.html |archive-date=May 5, 2014  }}</ref>

The racial/ethnic breakdown of the student population is: 65.3% White, 12.7% International Students (that are undesignated race/ethnicity), 9.2% Asian, 4.3% Black, 3.1% Hispanic/Latino, 1.2% American/Native American Indian, and 4.2% Unknown. Among matriculants to the university, 63% are considered Minnesota residents and 37% are considered out-of-state residents.<ref>{{cite web | title = OIR : Enrollment Headcount Data: All Data | url = http://www.oir.umn.edu/student/enrollment/term/1159/current/show_all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160209025041/http://www.oir.umn.edu/student/enrollment/term/1159/current/show_all | url-status = dead | archive-date = February 9, 2016 | publisher = University of Minnesota Office of Institutional Research | access-date = January 11, 2016 }}</ref> According to the University Office of Institutional Research, as of fall 2019 there were 31,367 undergraduates at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus. Of that number, 6,278 were first-time, degree-seeking freshmen. There were 12,100 graduate students.

===Minneapolis campus===
The original Minneapolis campus overlooked the [[Saint Anthony Falls]] on the [[Mississippi River]], but it was later moved about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) downstream to its current location. The original site is now marked by a small park known as Chute Square at the intersection of {{proper name|University}} and Central Avenues. The school shut down following a financial crisis during the American Civil War, but reopened in 1867 with considerable financial help from [[John S. Pillsbury]]. It was upgraded from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] to a college in 1869.  Today, the university's Minneapolis campus is divided by the Mississippi River into an East and West Bank. The East Bank, the main portion of the campus, covers {{convert|307|acre|ha}}. The West Bank is home to the [[University of Minnesota Law School]], the [[Humphrey School of Public Affairs]], the [[Carlson School of Management]], various social science buildings, and the performing arts center.

The Minneapolis campus has several residence halls: 17th Avenue Hall, Centennial Hall, Frontier Hall, Territorial Hall, Pioneer Hall, Sanford Hall, Middlebrook Hall, and Comstock Hall.

To help ease navigation of the large campus, the university has divided the '''East Bank''' into several areas: '''the Knoll area''', '''the Mall area''', '''the Health area''', '''the Athletic area''', and '''the Gateway area'''.

'''The Knoll area''', the oldest extant part of the university, is in the northwestern corner of the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/knoll/historic.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131946/http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/knoll/historic.htm|archive-date=September 27, 2011 |title=The Campus Knoll|publisher=University of Minnesota}}</ref> Many buildings in this area are well over 100 years old, such as some of the 13 in the [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District|Old Campus Historic District]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/about.htm|title= University of Minnesota Heritage Trail |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209121242/http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/about.htm|archive-date=February 9, 2012}}</ref> Today, most [[discipline]]s in this area relate to the [[humanities]]. Burton Hall is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Development|College of Education and Human Development]]. Folwell Hall and Jones Hall are primarily used by the language departments. A residence hall, Sanford Hall, and a student-apartment complex, Roy Wilkins Hall, are in this area. This area is just south of the Dinkytown neighborhood and business area.

'''Northrop Mall''', or '''the Mall area''', is arguably the center of the Minneapolis campus. The plan for the Mall was based on a design by [[Cass Gilbert]], although his scheme was too extravagant to be fully implemented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Larry|title=AIA Guide to the Twin Cities: The Essential Source on the Architecture of Minneapolis and St. Paul|year=2007|isbn=978-0-87351-540-5 |pages=127–128}}</ref> Several of the campus's primary buildings surround the Mall area. Northrop, formerly known as [[Northrop Auditorium]], provides a northern anchor, with [[Coffman Memorial Union]] (CMU) to the south. Four of the larger buildings to the sides of the Mall are the primary [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] buildings (Vincent Hall, Tate Laboratory and Smith Hall, respectively) and [[Walter Library]]. The Mall area is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]], which is Minnesota's largest public or private college, and the [[University of Minnesota Institute of Technology|College of Science and Engineering]]. Behind CMU is another residence hall, Comstock Hall, and another student-apartment complex, Yudof Hall. The Northrop Mall Historic District was formally listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20180119.htm|title=Weekly List - National Register of Historic Places Official Website--Part of the National Park Service|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>

'''The Health area''' is to the southeast of the Mall area and focuses on undergraduate buildings for [[biological science]] students, as well as the homes of the College of [[Pharmacy]], the School of [[Nursing]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], and [[M Health Fairview]]  Hospitals and Clinics. This complex of buildings forms what is known as the [[University of Minnesota Medical Center]]. Part of the [[University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences|College of Biological Sciences]] is housed in this area.

{{anchor|Superblock}}<!--the page [[Superblock (University of Minnesota)]] redirects to this anchor.-->Across the street from the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview is an area known as the "Superblock," a four-city-block space comprising four residence halls (Pioneer, Frontier, Centennial and Territorial Halls). The Superblock is one of the most popular locations for on-campus housing because it has the largest concentration of students living on campus and has a multitude of social activities between the residence halls.

'''The Athletic area''' is directly north of the Superblock and includes four recreation/athletic facilities: the University Recreation Center, Cooke Hall, the University Fieldhouse, and the [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)#University Aquatic center|University Aquatic Center]]. These facilities are all connected by tunnels and skyways, allowing students to use one locker room facility. North of this complex is the [[Huntington Bank Stadium]], [[Williams Arena]], [[Mariucci Arena]], [[Ridder Arena]], and the Baseline Tennis Center.

'''The Gateway area''', the easternmost section of campus, is primarily composed of office buildings instead of classrooms and lecture halls. The most prominent building is [[McNamara Alumni Center]]. The university is also heavily invested in a [[biomedical|biomedical research]] initiative and has built five biomedical research buildings that form a biomedical complex directly north of Huntington Bank Stadium.

=====Notable architecture=====
[[File:Pillsbury Hall.jpg|thumb|[[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], one of the oldest buildings on campus (1889)]]
[[File:Weisman Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]]]

[[University of Minnesota Armory|The Armory]], northeast of the Mall area, is built like a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]]. It features a [[sally port|sally-port]] entrance facing Church Street and a tower that was originally intended to be the professor of [[military science]]'s residence. Since it originally held the athletics department, the Armory also features a [[gym]]nasium. Today it is home to military science classes and the university's [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]].

Several buildings in the [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District|Old Campus Historic District]] were designed by early Minnesota architect [[Leroy Buffington|LeRoy Buffington]]. One of the most notable is [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], designed by Buffington and Harvey Ellis in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style. Pillsbury Hall's [[polychromatic]] facade incorporates several sandstone varieties that were available in Minnesota during the time of construction. Buffington also designed the exterior of [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Burton Hall, 1894|Burton Hall]], considered one of the strongest specimens of [[Greek Revival architecture]] in Minnesota.

Many of the buildings on the East Bank were designed by the prolific Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston, Sr.|Clarence H. Johnston]], including the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] Folwell Hall and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] edifices of [[Northrop Auditorium]] and [[Walter Library]], which he considered the heart of the university. Johnston's son, Clarence Johnston Jr, was also an architect and designed the original [[Bell Museum of Natural History|Bell Museum]] building and [[Coffman Memorial Union]] in the 1930s.

The [[Malcolm Moos Health Sciences Tower]], which is the tallest building on the Twin Cities campus, is a noted example of [[brutalist architecture]].

In more recent years, [[Frank Gehry]] designed the [[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]. Completed in 1993, the Weisman Art Museum is a typical example of his work with curving metallic structures. The abstract structure is considered highly significant because it was built prior to the widespread use of [[computer aided design]] in architecture. It also ushered in a new era of architecture at the university, which continued with the completion of the [[McNamara Alumni Center]] in 2000 and Bruininks Hall (formerly STSS) in 2010.

Another notable structure is the addition to the Architecture building, designed by [[Steven Holl]] and completed in 2002. It won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award for its innovative design. The Architecture building was then renamed Rapson Hall after the local [[modernist architecture|modernist]] architect and School of Architecture Dean [[Ralph Rapson]].

The university also has a "Greek row" of historic [[fraternities and sororities]] located north of campus on University Avenue SE. {{main|List of Fraternities and Sororities at the University of Minnesota}}

====West Bank====
[[File:Rarig Center-20071213.jpg|thumb|Department of Theatre Arts &amp; Dance, Rarig Center]]
The '''West Bank''' covers {{convert|53|acre|ha}}. The West Bank Arts Quarter includes:

*[[Rarig Center]] (Theatre Arts & Dance)
*The Barbara Barker Center for Dance
*Ferguson Hall (School of Music)
*Ted Mann Concert Hall
*Regis Center for Art

The Quarter is home to several annual interdisciplinary arts festivals.

The Social Sciences are also on the West Bank and include the [[Carlson School of Management]], the [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]], and the [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].

Wilson Library, the largest library in the university system, is also on the West Bank, as is Middlebrook Hall, the largest residence hall on campus. Approximately 900 students reside in the building named in honor of William T. Middlebrook.<ref>Middlebrook served the University as Comptroller, VP of Business Administration, and was a longtime Secretary of the Board of Regents. He wrote a seminal text on estimating building needs for colleges and universities. Middlebrook graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1912, where he was a member of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]].</ref>

====Getting around====
[[File:Washington Ave Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the [[Minneapolis]] campus.]]
[[File:Green Line, Coffman Union, and bus stop.jpg|thumb|A [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] train after leaving the [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank Station]], heading towards [[Downtown Minneapolis]]]]
The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] crossing the Mississippi River provides access between the East and West Banks, on foot and via designated bike lanes and a free shuttle service. The bridge has two separate [[deck (bridge)|deck]]s: the lower deck for vehicles and the newly constructed light rail, and the upper deck for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. An unheated enclosed walkway runs the length of the bridge and shelters pedestrians from the weather. Walking and riding bicycles are the most common modes of transportation among students. University Police occasionally cite individuals for [[jaywalking]] or riding bicycles on restricted sidewalks in areas surrounding the university, resulting in fines as high as $250. This is often done at the beginning of a school year or after pedestrians interfere with traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pedestrians should exercise caution|work=The Minnesota Daily|date=September 29, 2006 |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/09/29/69182|access-date=December 22, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212212526/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/09/29/69182 |archive-date=February 12, 2007}}</ref>

Several pedestrian tunnels ease the passage from building to building during harsh weather; they are marked with signs reading "[[The Gopher Way]]."

The Minneapolis campus is near [[Interstate Highway System|Interstates]] [[Interstate 94|94]] and [[Interstate 35|35W]] and is bordered by the Minneapolis neighborhoods of [[Dinkytown]] (on the north), [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|Cedar-Riverside]] (on the west), [[Stadium Village]] (on the southeast), and [[Prospect Park, Minneapolis|Prospect Park]] (on the east).

Three [[Light rail in Minnesota|light-rail stations]] serve the university along the [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]]: [[Stadium Village (Metro Transit station)|Stadium Village]], [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank]], and [[West Bank (Metro Transit station)|West Bank]]. The university partnered with [[Metro (Minnesota)|Metro]] to offer students, staff, and faculty members a [[Go-To card#Campus Zone Pass|Campus Zone Pass]] that enables free travel on the three stations that pass through campus,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/pts/bus/campuszonepass.html|title=Campus Zone Pass|website=University of Minnesota Parking and Transportation|access-date=February 24, 2016|date=Spring 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109142525/http://www1.umn.edu/pts/bus/campuszonepass.html|archive-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref> as well as a discounted unlimited pass for students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pts.umn.edu/bus/upass|title=U-Pass|website=University of Minnesota Parking and Transportation|access-date=May 1, 2018|date=May 11, 2016}}</ref>

===St. Paul campus===
[[File:AerialUMN-SP012506.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of St. Paul campus, facing south]]
The St. Paul campus is in the city of [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota|Falcon Heights]], about {{convert|3|mi}} from the Minneapolis campus. The default place name for the ZIP code serving the campus is "St. Paul," but "Falcon Heights" is also recognized for use in the street addresses of all campus buildings. The [[University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences|College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences]], including the University of Minnesota Food Industry Center and many other disciplines from social sciences to [[vocational education]], are on this campus. It also includes the College of Continuing and Professional Studies,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ccaps.umn.edu/|title=COLLEGE OF CONTINUING AND PROFESSIONAL STUDIES|publisher=cce.umn.edu|access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> College of Veterinary Medicine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvm.umn.edu/ |title=College of Veterinary Medicine |publisher=cvm.umn.edu |date=May 16, 2012 |access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> and College of Biological Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.umn.edu/ |title=COLLEGE OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES |publisher=cbs.umn.edu |access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> The extensive lawns, flowers, trees,  and surrounding University research farm plots create a greener and quieter campus. It has a grassy mall of its own and can be a bit of a retreat from the more urban Minneapolis campus. Prominent on this campus is Bailey Hall, the St. Paul campus' only residence hall. Campus Connector buses run every 5 minutes on weekdays when school is in session, and every 20 minutes on weekends, allowing students easy access to both campuses.

The Continuing Education and Conference Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cce.umn.edu/Continuing-Education-and-Conference-Center/index.html|title=Continuing Education and Conference Center|publisher=University of Minnesota College of Continuing Education|access-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823100748/http://www.cce.umn.edu/Continuing-Education-and-Conference-Center/index.html|archive-date=August 23, 2012}}</ref> which serves over 20,000 conference attendees per year, is also on the St. Paul campus.

The St. Paul campus is home to the College of Design's Department of Design, Housing, and Apparel (DHA). Located in McNeal Hall, DHA includes the departmental disciplines of apparel design, graphic design, housing studies, interior design, and retail merchandising.

The St. Paul campus is known to University students and staff for the Meat and Dairy Salesroom,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fscn.cfans.umn.edu/researchandservices/dairysalesroom/|title=Dairy Salesroom|publisher=Department of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota|date=January 20, 2010|access-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523050352/http://fscn.cfans.umn.edu/researchandservices/dairysalesroom/|archive-date=May 23, 2013}}</ref> which sells animal food products (such as ice cream, cheese, and meat) produced in the university's state-certified pilot plant by students, faculty and staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansci.umn.edu/meatlab.htm|title=Meat Science|publisher=Department of Animal Science, University of Minnesota|access-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715163807/http://www.ansci.umn.edu/meatlab.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012}}</ref>

The St. Paul campus borders the [[Minnesota State Fair]]grounds, which hosts the largest [[state fair]] in the United States by daily attendance.<ref>{{cite web| title =2006 Detailed Daily Attendance| publisher =Minnesota State Fair| url =http://www.mnstatefair.org/pages/attendance.html| access-date =July 17, 2007| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083455/http://www.mnstatefair.org/pages/attendance.html| archive-date =September 28, 2007| df =mdy-all}}</ref> The fair lasts 12 days, from late August through Labor Day. The grounds also serve a variety of functions during the rest of the year.

Although the Falcon Heights [[North American Numbering Plan|area code]] is 651, the university telephone system trunk lines use Minneapolis [[Telephone exchange|exchanges]] and its 612 area code.

===Commuting between Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses===
On regular weekdays during the school year, the Campus Connectors operate with schedule-less service as often as every five minutes during the busiest parts of the school day (between 7 am and 5:30 pm), slowing to once every 15 or 20 minutes during earlier or later hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/pts/bus/connectors.html |title=Campus Connectors &#124; Parking & Transportation Services |website=Umn.edu |access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> The estimated commute time between St. Paul and the East Bank is 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pts.umn.edu/bus/campus-connectors |title=Campus Connectors &#124; Parking & Transportation Services |website=Umn.edu |date= May 11, 2016|access-date=January 27, 2018}}</ref> In 2008, the system carried 3.55 million riders. Although the shuttle service is free, it is comparatively inexpensive to operate; with an operating cost of $4.55 million in 2008, the operating subsidy was only $1.28 per passenger. Even [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]]'s busy [[METRO (Minnesota)|METRO]] [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] light rail required a subsidy of $1.44 that year, and that was with many riders paying $1.75 or more for a ride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/Evaluation2009/Evaluation2009.htm|title=2009 Transit System Performance Evaluation|publisher=Metropolitan Council|year=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519222803/http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/Evaluation2009/Evaluation2009.htm |archive-date=May 19, 2010 }}</ref>

===Campus safety===
The Step Up campaign is a program that helps students prevent excessive drinking, as well as sexual assault and other crimes, by teaching them how to intervene and prevent in a positive way.<ref name="Step Up">{{cite web|url=http://stepup.umn.edu/|title=Step Up|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref> This is done, in part, by explaining the [[bystander effect]].

In addition, the campus has nearly 200 automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and 200 yellow phones for emergency-only calls. The University Police Station has 20 Code Blue phones around campus that immediately connect people to their office. There are also over 2,000 security cameras being monitored 24 hours a day.<ref name="Creating a safe U" />

==Student life and traditions==
===Greek life, professional and honor societies===
{{main|List of fraternities and sororities at the University of Minnesota}}
The University of Minnesota has numerous fraternities and sororities. Including defunct branches, the Greek System numbers more than 200 organizations, approximately half of which operate today.<ref>For examples, see any edition of the [http://umedia.lib.umn.edu/taxonomy/term/819 Minnesota Gopher Yearbook], which featured fraternities and sororities during its century-long publication run. Website accessed June 30, 2014.</ref> The university's Greek societies include the residential [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|Academic and Social]] chapters, including non-residential multicultural groups. The Greek System includes some but not all [[Professional fraternities and sororities|Professional Fraternities]], [[Honor society|Honor Societies]], Religious and [[Service fraternities and sororities|Service Fraternities]]. Fraternities and sororities have built several historically significant "Fraternity Row" homes along University Ave. SE, 10th Ave. SE, 4th Street SE, and 5th Street SE, all in Minneapolis, or along Cleveland Ave. near the St. Paul campus.<ref name="HistoricalStudy2003">{{Cite news | title = University of Minnesota Greek Letter Chapter House Designation Study, prepared for the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission | author = Carole Zellie | location = Author's firm: Landscape Research, St. Paul, MN | date = 2003 | pages = 3–4 of 180, and throughout by chapter entry }}</ref>

As of June 2018, approximately 3,900 system members made up about 11% of the campus population. Minnesota hosts 38 academic fraternities, 20 academic sororities, 56 honors societies, 31 professional societies, and two service-focused chapters.<ref name="OFSL2017">[http://fsl.umn.edu/about-us/reports-statistics/ The University of Minnesota / Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life annual report], accessed Sep 9, 2018</ref><ref>University of Minnesota, [http://sua.umn.edu/ List of student organizations].</ref>

===Media===
[[File:Northrupmall.jpg|thumb|upright|The eastern edge of the Northrop Mall, Spring 2008]]

====Print====
''[[Minnesota Daily|The Minnesota Daily]]'' has been published twice a week during the normal school season since the fall semester 2016 .<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/u-of-m-student-newspaper-to-cut-back-print-edition-to-2-days-a-week/384877851/|title=U of M student newspaper to cut back print edition to 2 days a week|last=Maura|first=Lerner|date=June 29, 2016|work=Star Tribune|access-date=August 2, 2016}}</ref> It is printed weekly during the summer. The ''Daily'' is operated by an autonomous organization run entirely by students. It was first published on May 1, 1900. Besides everyday news coverage, the paper has also published special issues, such as the Grapevine Awards, Ski-U-Mah, the Bar & Beer Guide, Sex-U-Mah, and others.

A long-defunct but fondly remembered humor magazine, ''[[Ski-U-Mah (magazine)|Ski-U-Mah]]'', was published from about 1930 to 1950. It launched the career of novelist and scriptwriter [[Max Shulman]].

A relative newcomer to the university's print media community is ''[[The Wake Student Magazine]]'', a weekly that covers UMN-related stories and provides a forum for student expression. It was founded in November 2001 in an effort to diversify campus media and achieved student group status in February 2002.<ref name="fund">{{cite web |url=http://www.sua.umn.edu/groups/funding/fees/requests/studentorgs/thewake.pdf?PHPSESSID=1|title=2008–2009 Student Organization Student Services Fees Request|access-date=March 12, 2008|date=January 25, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> Students from many disciplines do all of the reporting, writing, editing, illustration, photography, layout, and business management for the publication. The magazine was founded by James DeLong and Chris Ruen.<ref name="dead"/> ''The Wake'' was named the nation's best campus publication (2006) by the Independent Press Association.<ref name="fund"/>

Additionally, the ''Wake'' publishes ''Liminal'', a literary journal begun in 2005. ''Liminal'' was created in the absence of an undergraduate literary journal and continues to bring poetry and prose to the university community.

''The Wake'' has faced a number of challenges during its existence, due in part to the reliance on student fees funding. In April 2004, after the Student Services Fees Committee had initially declined to fund it, the needed $60,000 in funding was restored, allowing the magazine to continue publishing.<ref name="dead">{{cite web |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/07/9112 |title=Official Restores Wake's Funding|access-date=March 12, 2008|date=April 7, 2004|first=Jens |last=Krogstad|work=The Minnesota Daily |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040625230120/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/07/9112|archive-date=June 25, 2004}}</ref> It faced further challenges in 2005, when its request for additional funding to publish weekly was denied<ref name="dead2">{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/02/18/63317|title=Wake Awaits Fees Decision |access-date=March 12, 2008|date=February 18, 2005|first=Bryce|last=Haugen|newspaper=The Minnesota Daily |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220004605/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/02/18/63317|archive-date=February 20, 2005}}</ref> and then partially restored.<ref name="dead4">{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/03/10/63664|title=Final Recommendations In|access-date=March 12, 2008|date=March 10, 2005|first=Bryce|last=Haugen|newspaper=The Minnesota Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312130639/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/03/10/63664|archive-date=March 12, 2005}}</ref>

In 2005 conservatives on campus began formulating a new monthly magazine named ''The'' ''Minnesota Republic''. The first issue was released in February 2006, and funding by student service fees started in September 2006.

====Radio====
The campus radio station, [[KUOM]] "Radio K," broadcasts an eclectic variety of [[independent music]] during the day on 770 [[kHz]] [[AM radio|AM]]. Its 5,000-watt signal has a range of {{convert|80|mi|km}}, but shuts down at dusk because of [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations. In 2003, the station added a low-power (8-watt) signal on 106.5&nbsp;MHz [[FM radio|FM]] overnight and on weekends. In 2005, a 10-watt translator began broadcasting from Falcon Heights on 100.7 FM at all times. Radio K also [[Internet radio|stream]]s its content at www.radiok.org. With roots in experimental transmissions that began before World War I, the station received the first AM broadcast license in the state on January 13, 1922, and began broadcasting as [[Radio K|WLB]], changing to the KUOM [[radio call sign|call sign]] about two decades later. The station had an educational format until 1993, when it merged with a smaller campus-only music station to become what is now known as Radio K. A small group of full-time employees are joined by over 20 part-time student employees who oversee the station. Most of the on-air talent consists of student volunteers.

====Television====
Some television programs made on campus have been broadcast on local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[KTCI]] channel 17. Several episodes of ''Great Conversations'' have been made since 2002, featuring one-on-one discussions between University faculty and experts brought in from around the world. ''Tech Talk'' was a show meant to help people who feel intimidated by modern technology, including cellular phones and computers.

===Minnesota Student Association===
The Minnesota Student Association (MSA) is the undergraduate student government at the University of Minnesota. It advocates for student interests on local, state, and federal levels, and focuses on efforts that directly benefit the student population.

"Gopher Chauffeur," originally titled the MSA Express, is a student-operated late-night ride service.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/12/13/70274|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103094323/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/12/13/70274|title=Hitch a ride with MSA |newspaper= [[Minnesota Daily]]|archive-date=January 3, 2007 }}</ref> Piloted by MSA, the 2007–2008 administration of Emma Olson and Ross Skattum began the process of transitioning the service to the university's Boynton Health Services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2008/04/17/boyntonto-run-msa-express-0|title=Boynton to run MSA Express|newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]]}}</ref> This was done to ensure its longevity.

MSA was instrumental in passing legislation in the 2013 Minnesota Legislature for medical amnesty, and has focused more heavily on legislative advocacy in recent years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/lifestyle/alcohol/2013/07/31/under-medical-amnesty-law-underage-drinkers-will-get-new-legal-protecti |title=Under medical amnesty law, underage drinkers will get new legal protections: Underage drinkers will be able to call 911 without fearing a citation. |date=July 31, 2013 |newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]] |last=Nelson |first=Cody |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727170936/http://www.mndaily.com/lifestyle/alcohol/2013/07/31/under-medical-amnesty-law-underage-drinkers-will-get-new-legal-protecti |archive-date=July 27, 2014  }}</ref>

====Graduate and Professional Student Assembly====
The Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA) was responsible for graduate and professional student governance at the University of Minnesota. It is the largest and most comprehensive graduate/professional student governance organization in the United States. GAPSA serves students in the [[Carlson School of Management]], the Dental School, the Graduate School, the [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the School of Nursing, the College of Pharmacy, the School of Public Health, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and the [[College of Education and Human Development]]. GAPSA is also a member of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.

The University of Minnesota has the second-largest number of graduate and professional students in the United States at over 16,000. All registered [[graduate student|graduate]] and [[professional students]] at UMN are members of GAPSA. It was established in 1990 as a nonprofit (IRS 501 (c)(3)) confederation of independent college councils representing all graduate and professional students at the University of Minnesota to the Board of Regents, the president of the university, the University Senate, UMN at large and the wider community. GAPSA served as a resource for member councils, as the primary contact point for administrative units, as a graduate and professional student policy-making and policy-influencing body, and as a center of intercollegiate and intracollegiate interaction among students.

In 2014, GAPSA split into two organizations and ceased to exist as such due to an increasing separation between the needs of graduate and professional students. COGS (the Council of Graduate Students) broke off from the larger body, which then renamed to PSG (Professional Student Governance).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/umnpsg/psg/mission-history |title= UMN PSG - Mission and History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Professional Student Government |publisher= Professional Student Government, University of Minnesota |access-date=2021-10-18 |quote=}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |date=2013-11-25 |title=COGS set to leave GAPSA |url= https://mndaily.com/208983/uncategorized/cogs-set-leave-gapsa/|work= Minnesota Daily|location= |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> Both units continue to fulfill the former functions of GAPSA for the respective student bodies each represents.

===Student activism===
Student activism has played an important role at the university, including campaigns to desegregate campus housing in the 1930s and 1940s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acampusdivided.umn.edu/index.php/essay/segregated-student-housing/|title = Segregated Student Housing and the Activists Who Defeated It : A Campus Divided}}</ref> Black students' take over of Morrill Hall in 1969, which led to the creation of the Department of Afro-American Studies,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnopedia.org/event/morrill-hall-takeover-university-minnesota|title = Morrill Hall Takeover, University of Minnesota &#124; MNopedia}}</ref> now known as the Department of African-American and African Studies,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cla.umn.edu/aaas/about/history|title = History &#124; African American & African Studies &#124; College of Liberal Arts}}</ref> the 1970 student strike against war,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.continuum.umn.edu/2020/06/1970-student-strike-50-years-later/|title = 1970 Student Strike–50 Years Later|date = June 25, 2020}}</ref> campaigns to keep the [[General College Truth Movement|General College]] open in the 2000s, campaigns against racism in 2014-2015 known as Whose Diversity?,<ref>https://whosediversity.weebly.com/demands.html></ref> and many graduate student unionization efforts.

===Athletics===
Minnesota's Twin Cities campus athletics teams are called the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] and are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA) in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). As of 2019, they have won 19 NCAA championships<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf |title=Championships Summary through June 26, 2019 |publisher=NCAA |date=June 26, 2019 |access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref> and claim nine national football championships.<ref>{{cite web |title=College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS |website=College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}

{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers}}
Since the 2013–14 school year, the only Minnesota team that does not compete in the Big Ten is the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|women's ice hockey team]], which competes in the WCHA. The Gophers [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey team]] was a longtime WCHA member, but left when the Big Ten began operating a [[Big Ten Conference (ice hockey)|men's ice hockey league]] with six inaugural members. The current athletic director is [[Mark Coyle]].

The Golden Gophers' most notable rivalry is the annual college football game against the [[Wisconsin Badgers]] ([[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin) for [[Paul Bunyan's Axe]]. The two universities also compete in the Border Battle, a year-long athletic competition in which each sport season is worth 40 points divided by the number of times the teams play each other (i.e. football is worth 40 points because they play each other only once, while women's ice hockey is worth 10 points per game because they play four times a year). Conference and postseason [[playoffs]] do not count in the point standings.

[[Goldy Gopher]] is the mascot for the Twin Cities campus and the associated sports teams. The [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] mascot is a tradition as old as the state, which was tabbed the "Gopher State" in 1857 after a political cartoon ridiculing the $5 million railroad loan that helped open up the West. The cartoon portrayed shifty railroad barons as striped gophers pulling a railroad car carrying the Territorial Legislature. Later, the university picked up the nickname with the first university [[yearbook]], bearing the name "Gopher Annual," appearing in 1887.

The [[Minnesota Rouser]] is university's [[fight song]]. It is commonly played and sung by the 320-member [[University of Minnesota Marching Band|Minnesota Marching Band]] at events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games. Other songs associated with the university include the [[Minnesota March]], which was composed for the university by [[John Philip Sousa]], and [[Hail! Minnesota]], the university's [[Alma mater (song)|alma mater]] and [[state song]] of Minnesota.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cla.umn.edu/music/ensembles-creative-work/marching-band/history-traditions/school-songs|title=School Songs|work=College of Liberal Arts {{!}} University of Minnesota|access-date=August 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

====Football====
{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers football}}
[[File:TCF Bank Stadium opener.jpg|thumb|right|[[Huntington Bank Stadium]] replaced the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] as the Gophers' home stadium in 2009.]]
The Minnesota Golden Gophers are one of the oldest programs in college football history. They have won seven [[national championship]]s and 18 [[List of Big Ten National Championships|Big Ten Conference Championships]]. The Golden Gophers played their first game on September 29, 1882, a 4–0 victory over [[Hamline University]], St. Paul. In 1887, the Golden Gophers played host to the Wisconsin Badgers in a 63–0 victory. With the exception of 1906, the Golden Gophers and the Badgers have played each other every year since. The 128 games played against each other make this the most played rivalry in NCAA Division I FBS college football.

In 1981, the Golden Gophers played their last game in [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. Between 1982 and 2008, the school played their home games in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in downtown Minneapolis. They moved back to campus on September 12, 2009, when their new home, TCF Bank Stadium, opened with a game against the [[2009 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force Falcons]] of the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]]. Often referred to as The Bank, the stadium was renamed [[Huntington Bank Stadium]] in June 2021 to reflect the acquisition of TCF Bank by Huntington Bank.

====Basketball====
{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball}}
