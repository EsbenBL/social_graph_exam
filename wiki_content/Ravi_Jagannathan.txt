'''Ravi Jagannathan''' is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]]. He is a chaired [[professor]] at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]]. With the exception of the period 1989–1997 when he was a professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], Jagannathan has been at Kellogg since graduate school.

Jagannathan received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[College of Engineering, Guindy]] of [[University of Madras]] in 1970, an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], India  and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

His research interests are in the areas of [[asset pricing]], [[capital markets]] and [[financial institutions]]. Along with [[Zhenyu Wang]], in 1996 he advanced a variation on the [[capital asset pricing model]] known as "conditional CAPM."  Some recent empirical work on options prices supports this model.

He is also among those known for the [[Hansen-Jagannathan bounds]] which provide a way to use security market data to restrict the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the [[stochastic discount factor]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/bes/jnlbes/v12y1994i1p57-79.html|title = Hansen-Jagannathan Bounds as Classical Tests of Asset-Pricing Models|journal = Journal of Business & Economic Statistics|year = 1994|volume = 12|issue = 1|pages = 57–79|last1 = Burnside|first1 = Craig}}</ref>
