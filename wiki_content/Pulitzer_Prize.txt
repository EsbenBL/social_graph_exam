The '''Pulitzer Prize''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʊ|l|ᵻ|t|s|ər}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/faq#q24|title=FAQ|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|quote=24.

The correct pronunciation is 'PULL it sir.'|access-date=April 15, 2019}}<br/>The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|juː|l|ᵻ|t|s|ər}} {{respell|PEW|lit|sər}}, even if considered mistaken, is quite common, and included in the major British and American dictionaries.</ref>) is an award for achievements in [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], [[online journalism]], [[literature]] and [[musical composition]] within the United States. It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of [[Joseph Pulitzer]], who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher and is administered by [[Columbia University]].<ref name=history/> Prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories. In twenty of the categories, each winner receives a certificate and a US$15,000 cash award (raised from $10,000 in 2017).<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulitzer Board raises prize award to $15,000|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/news/pulitzer-board-raises-prize-award-15000|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=January 13, 2017|date=January 3, 2017}}</ref> The winner in the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service|public service category]] is awarded a [[gold medal]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Topping|first=Seymour|author-link=Seymour Topping|year=2008|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/page/administration-prizes|title=Administration|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=January 31, 2013}} Updated 2013 by Sig Gissler.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/theMedal|title=The Medal|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=January 31, 2013}}</ref>

==Entry and prize consideration==
The Pulitzer Prize does not automatically consider all applicable works in the media, but only those that have specifically been entered. (There is a $75 entry fee, for each desired entry category.) Entries must fit in at least one of the specific prize categories, and cannot simply gain entrance for being literary or musical. Works can also be entered only in a maximum of two categories, regardless of their properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/files/entryforms/jentformnobutton.pdf|title=Entry Form for a Pulitzer Prize in Journalism|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref>

Each year, 102 jurors are selected by the Pulitzer Prize Board to serve on 20 separate juries for the 21 award categories; one jury makes recommendations for both photography awards. Most juries consist of five members, except for those for Public Service, Investigative Reporting, Explanatory Reporting, Feature Writing and Commentary categories, which have seven members; however, all book juries have at least three members.<ref name=history/> For each award category, a jury makes three nominations. The board selects the winner by majority vote from the nominations or bypasses the nominations and selects a different entry following a 75 percent majority vote. The board can also vote to issue no award. The board and journalism jurors are not paid for their work; however, the jurors in letters, music, and drama receive a $2,000 [[honorarium]] for the year, and each chair receives $2,500.<ref name=history/>

===Difference between entrants and nominated finalists===
Anyone whose work has been submitted is called an ''entrant''. The jury selects a group of ''nominated finalists'' and announces them, together with the winner for each category. However, some journalists and authors who were only submitted, but not nominated as finalists, still claim to be Pulitzer nominees in promotional material.

The Pulitzer board has cautioned entrants against claiming to be nominees. The Pulitzer Prize website's Frequently Asked Questions section describes their policy as follows: "Nominated Finalists are selected by the Nominating Juries for each category as finalists in the competition. The Pulitzer Prize Board generally selects the Pulitzer Prize Winners from the three nominated finalists in each category. The names of nominated finalists have been announced only since 1980. Work that has been submitted for Prize consideration but not chosen as either a nominated finalist or a winner is termed an entry or submission. No information on entrants is provided. Since 1980, when we began to announce nominated finalists, we have used the term 'nominee' for entrants who became finalists. We discourage someone saying he or she was 'nominated' for a Pulitzer simply because an entry was sent to us."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/page/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-date=November 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118035305/https://www.pulitzer.org/page/frequently-asked-questions|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Bill Dedman]] of NBC News, the recipient of the 1989 investigative reporting prize, pointed out in 2012 that financial journalist [[Betty Liu]] was described as "Pulitzer Prize–Nominated" in her [[Bloomberg Television]] advertising and the jacket of her book, while ''[[National Review]]'' writer [[Jonah Goldberg]] made similar claims of "Pulitzer nomination" to promote his books. Dedman wrote, "To call that submission a Pulitzer 'nomination' is like saying that [[Adam Sandler]] is an Oscar nominee if [[Columbia Pictures]] enters ''[[That's My Boy (2012 film)|That's My Boy]]'' in the [[Academy Awards]]. Many readers realize that the Oscars don't work that way—the studios don't pick the nominees. It's just a way of slipping 'Academy Awards' into a bio. The Pulitzers also don't work that way, but fewer people know that."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/journalists-please-stop-saying-were-pulitzer-prize-nominated-143519830--finance.html|title=Journalists, Please Stop Saying You Were 'Pulitzer Prize-Nominated'|work=What Matters Now|publisher=The Atlantic Wire|first=Alexander|last=Abad-Santos|date=June 26, 2012|via=news.yahoo}}</ref>

Nominally, the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] is awarded only to news organizations, not individuals. In rare instances, contributors to the entry are singled out in the citation in a manner analogous to individual winners.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2000 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Public Service: The Washington Post, notably for the work of Katherine Boo|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/washington-post-notably-work-katherine-boo|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 1996 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Public Service: The News & Observer (Raleigh, NC), for the work of Melanie Sill, Pat Stith and Joby Warrick|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/news-observer-raleigh-nc-work-melanie-sill-pat-stith-and-joby-warrick|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref> Journalism awards may be awarded to individuals or newspapers or newspaper staffs; infrequently, staff Prize citations also distinguish the work of prominent contributors.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2009 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Local Reporting: Detroit Free Press Staff, and notably Jim Schaefer and M.L.

Although certain winners with magazine affiliations (most notably [[Moneta Sleet, Jr.]]) were allowed to enter the competition due to eligible partnerships or concurrent publication of their work in newspapers, the Pulitzer Prize Advisory Board and the Pulitzer Prize Board historically resisted the admission of magazines into the competition, resulting in the formation of the [[National Magazine Awards]] at the Columbia Journalism School in 1966.

In 2015, magazines were allowed to enter for the first time in two categories (Investigative Reporting and Feature Writing). By 2016, this provision had expanded to three additional categories (International Reporting, Criticism and Editorial Cartooning).<ref>{{cite press release|date=October 26, 2015|title=Expanded eligibility for three journalism categories|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/news/expanded-eligibility-three-journalism-categories|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref> That year, [[Kathryn Schulz]] (Feature Writing) and [[Emily Nussbaum]] (Criticism) of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' became the first magazine affiliates to receive the prize under the expanded eligibility criterion.<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Pulitzer Prizes|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2016|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref>

In addition to the prizes, Pulitzer Travelling Fellowships are awarded to four outstanding students of the Graduate School of Journalism as selected by the faculty.

===Changes to categories===
Over the years, awards have been discontinued either because the field of the award has been expanded to encompass other areas; the award has been renamed because the common terminology changed; or the award has become obsolete, such as the prizes for [[telegraph]]ic reporting.<!--based on the means of reporting, & telegram simply redirects-->

An example of a writing field that has been expanded was the former Pulitzer Prize for the Novel (awarded 1918–1947), which has been changed to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, which also includes [[short story|short stories]], [[novella]]s, [[Novella|novelettes]], and poetry, as well as novels.

[[File:Columbia University, NYC (June 2014) - 01.JPG|thumb|Pulitzer Hall on the Columbia campus]]
The 19-member Pulitzer Prize Board<ref>{{cite press release|date=May 30, 2016|title=Elizabeth Alexander elected to Pulitzer Prize Board|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/news/elizabeth-alexander-elected-pulitzer-prize-board|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref> convenes semi-annually, traditionally in the Joseph Pulitzer World Room at Columbia University's Pulitzer Hall. It comprises major editors, columnists and media executives in addition to six members drawn from academia and the arts, including the [[president of Columbia University]], the dean of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] and the [[chief operating officer|administrator]] of the prizes, who serves as the Board's secretary. The administrator and the dean (who served on the Board from its inception until 1954 and beginning again in 1976) participate in the deliberations as ''[[ex officio]]'' members but cannot vote. Aside from the president and dean (who serve as permanent members for the duration of their respective appointments) and the administrator (who is re-elected annually), the Board elects its own members for a three-year term; members may serve a maximum of three terms. Members of the Board and the juries are selected with close attention "given to professional excellence and affiliation, as well as diversity in terms of gender, ethnic background, geographical distribution and size of news organization."

Former ''New York Times'' senior editor [[Dana Canedy]], who contributed to the ''Times'' staff entry that received the 2001 National Reporting Prize, served as administrator from 2017 to 2020. Canedy was the first woman and first person of color to hold the position.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/news/journalist-author-dana-canedy-elected-administrator-pulitzer-prizes|title=Journalist, Author Dana Canedy Is Elected Administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|date=July 12, 2017|access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-50|title=The 2001 Pulitzer Prize Winner in National Reporting|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref> Edward Kliment, a longtime deputy administrator, was appointed interim administrator in July 2020 when Canedy became senior vice president and publisher of [[Simon & Schuster]]'s flagship eponymous imprint.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/news/pulitzer-administrator-dana-canedy-steps-down-accept-publisher-role-simon-schuster|title=Pulitzer Administrator Dana Canedy Steps Down To Accept Publisher Role at Simon & Schuster|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|date=July 6, 2020|location=New York|access-date=July 12, 2020}}</ref> Past administrators include [[John Hohenberg]] (the youngest person to hold the position to date; 1954–1976), fellow Graduate School of Journalism professor Richard T. Baker (1976–1981), former ''[[Newsweek]]'' executive editor [[Robert Christopher]] (1981–1992), former ''New York Times'' managing editor [[Seymour Topping]] (1993–2002), former ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' editor [[Sig Gissler]] (2002–2014) and former ''[[Concord Monitor]]'' editor [[Mike Pride (writer)|Mike Pride]] (the only former Board member to hold the position to date; 2014–2017). Prior to the installation of Hohenberg, the program was jointly administered by the dean of the Journalism School and officials in Columbia's central administration, most notably longtime provost [[Frank D. Fackenthal]].

Following the retirement of [[Joseph Pulitzer Jr.]] (a grandson of the endower who served as permanent chair of the board for 31 years) in 1986, the chair has typically rotated to the most senior member (or members, in the case of concurrent elections) on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/page/biography-joseph-pulitzer|title=Biography of Joseph Pulitzer|first=Seymour|last=Topping|author-link=Seymour Topping|work=The Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=May 16, 2017}} Updated 2013 by [[Sig Gissler]].</ref>

Since 1975, the Board has made all prize decisions; prior to this point, the Board's recommendations were ratified by a majority vote of the [[Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York|trustees of Columbia University]].<ref name=history/> Although the administrator's office and staff are housed alongside the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia's Pulitzer Hall and several administrators have held concurrent full-time or adjunct faculty appointments at the School of Journalism, the Board and administration have been operationally separate from the School since 1950.<ref name=Boylan-2003>{{cite book|last=Boylan|first=James|year=2003|title=Pulitzer's School: Columbia University's School of Journalism, 1903–2003|oclc=704692556|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-50017-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ6FAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118|via=Google Books|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|121}}

Walker claimed that Haley had plagiarized from her Civil War-era novel ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966). Legal proceedings in each case were concluded late in 1978.

==Criticism and studies==
Some critics of the Pulitzer Prize have accused the organization of favoring those who support liberal causes or oppose conservative causes. Syndicated columnist [[L. Brent Bozell, Jr.|L. Brent Bozell]] said that the Pulitzer Prize has a "liberal legacy", particularly in its prize for commentary.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/guests/s_503968.html|title=Pulitzers' liberal legacy|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|date=April 22, 2007|author=Brent Bozell|access-date=October 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130131142218/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/guests/s_503968.html|archive-date=January 31, 2013

A 2012 academic study by journalism professors Yong Volz of the University of Missouri and Francis Lee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong found "that only 27% of Pulitzer winners since 1991 were females, while newsrooms are about 33% female."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Who wins the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting? Cumulative advantage and social stratification in journalism|journal=Journalism|author1=Yong Z. Volz|author2=Francis LF Lee|date=August 30, 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=587–605|doi=10.1177/1464884912455905|s2cid=145197126}}</ref> The researchers concluded female winners were more likely to have traditional academic experience, such as attendance at Ivy League schools, metropolitan upbringing, or employment with an elite publication such as ''The New York Times''. The findings suggest a higher level of training and connectedness are required for a female applicant to be awarded the prize, compared to male counterparts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-10-female-pulitzer-prize-winners-require.html|title=Female Pulitzer Prize winners require higher qualifications, study finds|work=[[Phys.org]]|publisher=[[University of Missouri]]|date=October 18, 2012|access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>
