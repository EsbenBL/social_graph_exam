'''Emil Lederer''' (22 July 1882 – 29 May 1939) was a [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]n-born [[Germany|German]] [[economist]] and [[sociologist]]. Purged from his position at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in 1933 for being [[Jews|Jewish]], Lederer fled into exile. He helped establish the "University in Exile" at the [[New School]] in [[New York City]].

==Biography==

Lederer was born in 1882 to a Jewish<ref>[http://www.jinfo.org/Economists.html [[Jew]]ish Economists<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.jinfo.org</ref> merchant family. He studied law and national economy at [[Vienna University]]. Among others, his professors were [[Heinrich Lammasch]], [[Karl Theodor von Inama-Sternegg]], [[Franz von Juraschek]], [[Carl Menger]], [[Friedrich von Wieser]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and [[Eugen von Philippovich]], while [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Felix Somary]], [[Otto Bauer]] and [[Rudolf Hilferding]] were among his fellow students.

In 1905, Lederer received ''Dr. iur.'' in Vienna, and in 1911 ''Dr. rer. pol.'' at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. The next year, he [[Habilitation|habilitated]] at [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]] with his thesis "Die Privatangestellten in der modernen Wirtschaftsentwicklung".

In 1918, he was appointed assistant professor by Heidelberg University, but Lederer remained in Austria until 1920. In early 1919, he was appointed member of the ''German Socialisation Commission'' in Vienna, along with Hilferding and Schumpeter.

At Heidelberg University, Lederer became assistant professor for social politics in 1920, and a full professor in the same year. From 1923 to 1925 he held lectures as guest professor at [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. From 1923 to 1931, Lederer and [[Alfred Weber]] were directors of the ''Institute for Social- and State Sciences''. In 1931, he succeeded [[Werner Sombart]] at the German Faculty for ''national economy'' and ''finance sciences'' at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

As was the case  with almost all so-called "Heidelberger economists", Lederer was suspended by the Nazis on 14 April 1933 according to the ''[[Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums]]'' until a final decision would be made. This affected all activities in connection with his offices. The salary was to be paid fully in the meantime.<ref>[http://www.blaetter.de/download.php?poi=zurueck&jahr=1966&ausgabe=08&pdf=koehl6608.pdf Dr. Fritz Köhler: "Zur Vertreibung humanistischer Gelehrter"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234450/http://www.blaetter.de/download.php?poi=zurueck&jahr=1966&ausgabe=08&pdf=koehl6608.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> In addition, university members apparently had denunciated Lederer for being a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (since 1925) and for being "non-[[Aryan]]".

Lederer escaped to London, afterwards coming to the United States, where (in 1933) he co-founded the "University in Exile" at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]], which would become the ''Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science''. Emil Lederer was its first Dean until his sudden death in 1939, in the aftermath of an operation.

==Work==

Lederer, who connected economics and sociology, was considered the most important supporter of interdisciplinary social sciences in Heidelberg.

His efforts as democratic socialist are reflected by his range of topics, including the ''theory of economy'' and ''class structure analysis''. Lederer, who published the social democratic theory magazine "Die Neue Zeit", was influenced by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]. He did not support an unregulated ''free market'': he examined the inefficiencies of monopolies, and partially denounced the positive effects of technical progress according to his ''stagnation theorem''.
