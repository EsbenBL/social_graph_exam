'''Herbert Mohring''' (1928 – June 4, 2012) was a [[transportation]] [[economist]] who taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1961–1994.<ref>http://www.cts.umn.edu/Publications/catalyst/2012/august/mohring</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Deep thinker Herbert Mohring had wide influence |work=Star Tribune |date=June 13, 2012 |url=http://www.startribune.com/obituary-deep-thinker-herbert-mohring-had-wide-influence/158983325/ }}</ref> He received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1959,<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Minnesota, Department of Economics: Herbert Mohring |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |url=http://www.econ.umn.edu/faculty/mohring/ |archivedate=February 8, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208235039/http://www.econ.umn.edu/faculty/mohring/ }}</ref> with a thesis on the life insurance industry supervised by [[Robert Solow]].<ref>[http://library.mit.edu/item/000734613 The life insurance industry: a study of price policy and its determinants]</ref>

He is widely known for his identification of what was dubbed the [[Mohring effect]] of [[increasing returns]] in [[public transportation]] (see: Mohring (1972) for details).

Mohring and Harwitz (1962) also showed that the revenues from the first-best [[road pricing|congestion tax]] exactly cover the capacity costs (which include depreciation and capital costs, but not investment costs) of highways when highways possess constant returns to scale.
