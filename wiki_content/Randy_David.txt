==Biography==
Randy David hails from [[Pampanga]] and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, major in Sociology, from the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] in 1965.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|author=Pepper Marcelo|title=The Wisdom of Randy David|url=http://www.planetphilippines.com/archives/2005/sep1-15-05/current/features_current/feature2.html|publisher=Planet Philippines Online Edition|year=2003|accessdate=26 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305150625/http://www.planetphilippines.com/archives/2005/sep1-15-05/current/features_current/feature2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=5 March 2008}}</ref> He also pursued doctoral studies at the [[University of Manchester]], though he opted not to complete them and chose instead to remain as socialist liberal in the Philippines during the [[martial law]] government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name=bio/>

A longtime professor in the Department of Sociology of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], David first came into widespread prominence in 1986, when he accepted an offer by the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] to host a public affairs talk show on [[DZTV-TV|IBC-13]]. The show, named ''Truth Forum'', was notable as the only public affairs talk show during its time that was conducted in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], rather than English. David later joined the newly re-established [[Associated Broadcasting Company]] as a newscaster and the host of a new talk show, ''[[Public Life with Randy David]]''. After leaving the network in 1995, David hosted ''Public Life'' for [[GMA Network]], and until 2003, ''Off the Record'' (with [[Katrina Legarda]]) for [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]], his last regular hosting stint to date. Since 1995, his newspaper column, ''Public Lives'', has appeared every Sunday on the pages of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''.<ref name=bio/>

On February 25, 2006, David was arrested in [[Quezon City|Santolan, Quezon City]] while celebrating the 20th anniversary of the first [[People Power Revolution]]. The reason for the arrest was the lack of permit to rally, President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] having revoked all permits after she declared [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|a state of national emergency]] just a few hours earlier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Professor, 2 others nabbed (2:29 p.m.)|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/02/24/professor.2.others.nabbed.(2.29.p.m.).html|publisher=Sun.Star|date=24 February 2006|accessdate=27 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Police arrest UP prof, Akbayan leader|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=30846|publisher=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]]|date=24 February 2006|accessdate=27 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224330/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=30846 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=26 September 2007}}</ref> He was later released with all charges dropped. In May 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] declared that the arrests of David and his co-detainees were invalid.<ref>{{cite web|title=''David v. Arroyo'', G.R. No. 171396, 3 May 2006|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2006/may2006/G.R.%20No.%20171396.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404132432/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2006/may2006/G.R.%20No.%20171396.htm|archive-date=4 April 2008}}</ref>

David expressed interest in running for a congressional seat in Pampanga should Gloria Macapagal Arroyo run for Congresswoman in the 2010 general elections, a fight that has been dubbed by several Senators and mediamen as "David vs. Gloriath".<ref>''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'': 26 June 2009, front page.</ref> David later chose not to run, and Arroyo was elected to the seat in May 2010.

==Personal life==
David is married to [[Karina Constantino-David]] who served until 2008 as the Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) of the [[Philippines]]. The couple has four children, including [[broadcast journalist]] [[Kara David]], UP National Institute of Geological Sciences (NIGS) professor Dr. Carlos Primo David, Nadya Melina David and Jika David. The Bishop of Kalookan, the Most Reverend Pablo Virgilio David, D.D. is his younger brother. David is also the son-in-law of the [[historian]] [[Renato Constantino]].
