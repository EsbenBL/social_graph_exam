''[[Human Events]]'' described Baskerville as both critiquing the ways the systems create individual crimes and arguing that they create patronage systems and function at times to perpetuate the high levels of divorce that require the current large staffs in the system.  It describes Baskerville's speciality as studying how public policy affects the family and working as an activist to change the policy.<ref>[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=3012 ''Human Events'' article on Baskerville from 11 Feb., 2004]</ref>  Baskerville's book ''Taken Into Custody: The War Against Fatherhood, Marriage and the Family'' (Cumberland House Publishing, 2007) was described by ''[[Touchstone Magazine]]'' as possibly his biggest contribution to public policy debates.<ref>[http://victimsoflaw.net/Touchstone%20Review%5B1%5D.pdf Review of ''Taken Into Custody'' in Touchstone]</ref>
