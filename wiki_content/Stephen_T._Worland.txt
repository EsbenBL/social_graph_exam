== Biography ==
Worland was born in [[Neoga, Illinois]] and began his education in the Neoga public schools. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Navy]] on the [[USS Idaho (BB-42)]] battleship. He held a B.A. and a Ph.D. in [[Economics]] from the [[University of Illinois]]. His dissertation, completed in 1956, was on the economic thought of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Worland held faculty appointments at [[Michigan State University]] and the [[University of Dayton]] before he joined the University of Notre Dame in 1957. He taught at Notre Dame for 30 years. In 1987, he joined the [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University]] faculty for two years as the first occupant of the Clemens Chair in Economics and the Liberal Arts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen T.

== Research ==
Worland's research and writing focus on defining and clarifying economic justice as a social and moral concept.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen T. Worland|title=Justice|pages=47–84|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-3511-3_3|series=Critical Issues in Social Justice|year=1986|isbn=978-1-4899-3513-7|chapter=Economics and Justice}}</ref>  Worland was an adherent to neoclassical welfare economics and analyzed the writing of [[Aristotle]] through the eyes of modern economics.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aristotle as a Welfare Economist: A Comment, with a Reply by Stephen T. Worland|journal=History of Political Economy|volume=18|issue=3|pages=523–529|author=Richard Temple-Smith|url=http://hope.dukejournals.org/content/18/3/523.full.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2015|doi=10.1215/00182702-18-3-523|year=1986}}</ref>

In his ''Scholasticism and Welfare Economics'' book, Worland demonstrated that welfare economics shares the philosophical premises of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] economic reasoning and helps clarify the significance of [[economic efficiency]] in the scholastic doctrine of the [[just price]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Cyril A. Zebot|title=The Roots of Welfare Economics: A Review Article|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=26|issue=2|pages=168–175|jstor=29767900|year=1968|doi=10.1080/00346766800000019}}</ref> In the ''Justice: Views from the Social Sciences'' book, to which he contributed the ''Economics and Justice'' chapter, Worland examined [[classical economics]], [[Marxism]], and [[neoclassical economics]], and concluded that [[distributive justice]] cannot be achieved in a market society without considering more than simply contributions to [[Production (economics)|production]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Emily R. Gill|title=Book Reviews: Justice: Views from the Social Sciences|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=51|issue=2|pages=439–441|jstor=2131354|year=1989|doi=10.2307/2131354}}</ref>

Worland's research often focused on [[Catholic social teaching]]. For example, his 2001 ''Just Wages'' article in the journal ''First Things'' explains the teaching of the Catholic Church regarding a [[living wage]] for workers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Worland|first1=Stephen T.|title=Just Wages|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2001/02/just-wages|publisher=First Things: A Monthly Journal of Religion and Public Life|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>  In his 1994 presentation to The Association for Christian Economics,
Worland wrote that although there should be no such thing as "Christian
Economics" or "Catholic Economics," as "Christian faith will not 
produce a body of economic knowledge different from that to be 
discovered by honest, secular scientific effort,” the Judeo-Christian 
message makes an important and unique contribution to an understanding 
of a modern market society.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Worland|first1=Stephen T.|title=The Right and the Good: And the Retrieval of Welfare Economics|url=https://www.gordon.edu/ace/pdf/Worland_RightAndGood.pdf|publisher=The Association for Christian Economics|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

== Teaching philosophy ==
Worland wrote that economics should be taught in such a way that 
students learn about the real-world problems of injustice and human 
development, and not just the theory and mathematical underpinnings of 
economics. In 1975, in ''Forum for Social Economics'', he wrote that 
at Notre Dame, where he taught, a decision was made to restructure the 
Ph.D. program to focus on socioeconomic issues and social justice, and 
to teach and research the fundamental problems of social economy that 
"should be a major concern for every economist with a truly humane 
interest in his profession."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stephen T. Worland|title=Doctoral programs in social economics and political economy — a note|journal=Forum for Social Economics|volume=5|issue=3|pages=36|doi=10.1007/BF02816081|year=1975|s2cid=154957019}}</ref>

== Honors ==
In 1987, Worland was awarded the [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]
Award, an annual award that honors a faculty member or college 
administrator whose work and life promote or exemplify social justice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reinhold Niebuhr Award|url=http://ndreport.nd.edu/archives/2008-2009/university-awards/faculty-awards/the-reinhold-niebuhr-award/|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>

In 1993, Worland was awarded the Thomas F. Divine award. Named for one of the founding fathers of the [[Association for Social Economics]],
the Thomas F. Divine Award is presented annually to an Association 
member who over a lifetime has made important contributions to social 
economics and the social economy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas F. Divine Award|url=http://socialeconomics.org/?page=awards_and_grants&side=awards&sub=thomas_f_divine|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>
