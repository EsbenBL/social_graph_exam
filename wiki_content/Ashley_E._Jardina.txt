==Career==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', a 2017 study by Jardina found that naming [[Donald Trump]] or his policies "racist" turned off some white voters, whereas describing these same behaviors as "[[white supremacy]]" did not.<ref name="newyorktimes2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/us/politics/on-politics-white-supremacy-trump.html|title=When White Nationalism Takes Center Stage|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2019-08-05}}</ref> In 2018, ''[[The Economist]]'' covered her research into the difference between general [[white identity]] and specific racism or animus against other ethnicities,<ref name="theeconomist2018">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/11/01/identity-politics-are-stronger-on-the-right-than-the-left|title=Identity politics are stronger on the right than the left|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2018-11-01}}</ref> and in 2019, when ''[[Newsweek]]'' discussed her analysis further, she said "There is a subset of people in the U.S. who feel their white race is important to them and feel the demographics are changing and the privileges and advantages that they have are under attack. That is different from 'I just don't like black people.'"<ref name="newsweek2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/2019/03/15/trump-race-democrats-identity-politics-2020-1352568.html|title=How Donald Trump Played the (White) Race Card and Reshaped the Democratic Party|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=2019-03-06}}</ref>

In March 2019, ''[[Pacific Standard]]'' reported Jardina's research that "up to 40 percent of American whites feel solidarity with, and protective of, their racial group".<ref name="pacificstandard2019">{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/ideas/how-white-identity-shapes-american-politics|title=How White Identity Shapes American Politics|work=[[Pacific Standard]]|date=2019-03-25}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-identity-politics-drives-trump-and-the-republican-party-under-him/2019/07/16/a5ff5710-a733-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html|title=White identity politics drives Trump, and the Republican Party under him|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2019-03-15}}</ref> Reviewing poll findings,<ref name="reuters2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-race-poll/for-trump-appeals-to-white-fears-about-race-may-be-a-tougher-sell-in-2020-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1V90TX|title=For Trump, appeals to white fears about race may be a tougher sell in 2020: Reuters/Ipsos poll|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2019-08-19}}</ref> Jardina drew much of her research on the topic from the [[American National Election Studies]],<ref name="newyorker2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-disturbing-surprisingly-complex-relationship-between-white-identity-politics-and-racism|title=The Disturbing, Surprisingly Complex Relationship Between White Identity Politics and Racism|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2019-01-19}}</ref> and has said that [[white Americans]] began to show patterns of this behaviour since 2000.<ref name="dukechronicle2019" /> In 2019, she authored ''White Identity Politics'' which examined the [[identity politics]] of [[white people]].<ref name="businessinsider2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/republican-voters-have-become-more-xenophobic-under-trump-2019-7|title=Republican voters have become more xenophobic as Trump has normalized racist rhetoric|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=2019-07-18}}</ref>
