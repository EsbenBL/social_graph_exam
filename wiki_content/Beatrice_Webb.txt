'''Martha Beatrice Webb, Baroness Passfield''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|size=100%|sep=,}} (née '''Potter'''; 22 January 1858 – 30 April 1943) was an English sociologist, economist, socialist, labour historian and social reformer. It was Webb who coined the term ''[[collective bargaining]]''. She was among the founders of the [[London School of Economics]] and played a crucial role in forming the [[Fabian Society]].

==Early life==
Beatrice Potter was born in [[Standish House]] in the village of [[Standish, Gloucestershire]], the last but one of the nine daughters of businessman [[Richard Potter (businessman)|Richard Potter]] and Laurencina Heyworth, a Liverpool merchant's daughter. Her paternal grandfather was [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] MP [[Richard Potter (British politician)|Richard Potter]], co-founder of the ''[[Little Circle]]'' which was key in creating the [[Reform Act 1832]].

From an early age Webb was [[autodidact|self-taught]] and cited as important influences the cooperative movement and the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sidney and Beatrice Webb {{!}} British economists |language=en |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sidney-and-Beatrice-Webb |access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref> After her mother's death in 1882 she acted as a hostess and companion for her father. In 1882, she began a relationship with twice-widowed Radical politician [[Joseph Chamberlain]], by then a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] minister in Gladstone's second government. He would not accept her need for independence as a woman and after four years of "storm and stress" their relationship failed.<ref name="Beatrice Webb 2000 p. 244">''Diaries of Beatrice Webb'' (2000), New Year's Day, 1901, p. 244.</ref> Marriage in 1892 to [[Sidney Webb]] established a lifelong "partnership" of shared causes. At the beginning of 1901, Webb wrote that she and Sidney were "still on our honeymoon and every year makes our relationship more tender and complete."<ref name="Beatrice Webb 2000 p. 244" />

She and her husband were friends with the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref name="LettersPg16">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&pg=PA16 |title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904–1969 |publisher=Open Court Publishing |year=2001 |isbn=0-8126-9449-X |editor-last=Perkins |editor-first=Ray |location=Chicago |page=16 |access-date=16 November 2007}}</ref>

=="My Creed and My Craft"==
Beatrice Webb left unfinished a planned autobiography, under the general title ''My Creed and My Craft''. At her death, aged 85, the only autobiographical work she had published was ''My Apprenticeship'' (1926). The posthumously issued ''Our Partnership'' (1948) covered the first two decades of her marriage to Sidney Webb between 1892 and 1911 and their collaboration on a variety of public issues.

In the preface to the second work,<ref>''Our Partnership by Beatrice Webb'', 1948, Longmans, Green & Co: London, New York, p. vi.</ref> its editors refer to Webb's 
<blockquote>desire to describe truthfully her lifelong pursuit of a living philosophy, her changes of outlook and ideas, her growing distrust of benevolent philanthropy as a means of redeeming 'poor suffering humanity' and her leaving of the field of abstract economic theory for the then practically unexplored paths of scientific social research.</blockquote> 
In 1926 when Webb had begun to prepare the second volume, ''Our Partnership'', only to be repeatedly distracted by other more pressing commitments, the book's editors report her finding it difficult to express "her philosophy of life, her belief in the scientific method, but its purpose guided always by religious emotion."<ref>''Our Partnership by Beatrice Webb'', 1948, Longmans, Green & Co: London, New York, p. vii.</ref>

==A pioneer in social research and policy-making==
One of Beatrice's older sisters, [[Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith|Catherine]], became a well-known social worker. After Catherine married [[Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith|Leonard Courtney]], Beatrice took over her work as a voluntary rent-collector in the [[Model Dwellings Company|model dwellings]] at [[Katharine Buildings]], [[Wapping]], operated by the [[East End Dwellings Company]].<ref>''The Diaries of Beatrice Webb'' (2000), p. 53.</ref>

[[File:Beatrice and Sidney Webb, c1895 (9259293969).jpg|220 px|thumb|left|Beatrice and [[Sidney Webb]] working together in 1895]]
The young Beatrice also assisted her cousin by marriage [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] in his [[Life and Labour of the People of London|pioneering survey of the Victorian slums of London]], work which eventually became the massive 17-volume ''Life and Labour of the People of London'' (1902–1903).

These experiences stimulated a critical attitude to current ideas of philanthropy.

In 1890 Beatrice Potter was introduced to [[Sidney Webb]], whose help she sought with her research. They married in 1892, and until her death 51 years later shared political and professional activities. When her father died in January 1892, leaving Potter an endowment of £1,000 pounds a year, she had a private income for life with which to support herself and the research projects she pursued.

The Webbs became active members of the [[Fabian Society]]. With the Fabians' support, Beatrice Webb co-authored books and pamphlets on socialism and the [[co-operative movement]] including ''The History of Trade Unionism'' (1894) and ''Industrial Democracy'' (1897). In 1895, the Fabians used part of an unexpected legacy of £10,000 from Henry Hutchinson, a solicitor from [[Derby]], to found the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].<ref>''The Diaries of Beatrice Webb'' (2000), 21 September 1894, p. 186. Kitty Muggeridge and Ruth Adam, ''Beatrice Webb: A Life, 1858-1943'', 1967, London: Secker & Warburg, pp. 151-156.</ref>

After consulting Dr. [[Andrea Rabagliati]] for health problems, Webb became a vegetarian in 1902 and shortly thereafter began a vegetarian salon for socialists. By 1908, she was a vice-president of the National Food Reform Association.<ref name="Preece 2001">{{Cite book |last=Preece |first=Rod |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brZ5o35aiaUC&pg=PA205 |title=Animal Sensibility and Inclusive Justice in the Age of Bernard Shaw |date=25 October 2011 |publisher=[[UBC Press]] |isbn=978-0774821124 |pages=205–206 |access-date=8 September 2018}}</ref> Webb was a [[Lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]], she described herself as an "anti-flesh-fish-egg-alcohol-coffee-and-sugar eater".<ref name="Preece 2001" /><ref>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

===Contributions to the theory of the co-operative movement===
Beatrice Webb made a number of important contributions to the political and [[Co-operative economics|economic]] theory of the [[Cooperatives|co-operative movement]].

In her 1891 book ''The Cooperative Movement in Great Britain'', based on her experiences in Lancashire, she distinguished between "co-operative federalism" and "co-operative individualism". She identified herself as a co-operative federalist, a school of thought which advocates [[consumer co-operative]] societies. She argued that consumers' co-operatives should be set up as [[Co-operative wholesale society|co-operative wholesale societies]] (by forming co-operatives in which all members are co-operatives, the best historical example being the English [[Co-operative Group|Co-operative Wholesale Society]]) and that these [[federal co-operatives]] should then acquire farms or factories.

Webb dismissed the idea of [[Worker cooperative|worker co-operatives]] where the people who did the work and benefited from it had some control over how it was organised, arguing that – at the time she was writing – such ventures had proved largely unsuccessful, at least in ushering in her form of socialism led by volunteer committees of people like herself.<ref>Potter, Beatrice, ''The Co-operative Movement in Great Britain'', London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1891.</ref> Examples of successful worker cooperatives did of course exist, then as now.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In some professions they were the norm. However, Webb's final book, ''The Truth About Soviet Russia'' (1942), celebrated central planning. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

It was Webb who coined the term "[[collective bargaining]]".<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Timeline of Events in Modern American Labor Relations |url=http://www.fmcs.gov/internet/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=21&itemID=15810 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802105125/http://www.fmcs.gov/internet/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=21&itemID=15810 |archive-date=2 August 2010 |access-date=31 January 2013 |publisher=[[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (United States)]] |quote=1891: The term "collective bargaining" is first used by Mrs. Sidney Webb, a British labor historian.}}</ref>

===1909 Minority report to Royal Commission===
{{main|Minority report (Poor Law)}}
For four years Beatrice Webb was a member of the [[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09]]. The [[Unionist Government 1895–1905|Conservative government]] of [[Arthur Balfour|A. J. Balfour]] established the Commission, which issued its final report to the [[Liberal Government 1905–1915|Liberal government]] of [[H. H. Asquith]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/01/2008_05_wed.shtml ''Woman's Hour'' discussion on 1909 Minority Report], BBC Radio 4.</ref><ref>Wallis,Ed (editor). ''From the Workhouse to Welfare'' Fabian Society and Webb Memorial Trust, 2009.</ref> Beatrice was the lead author of the dissenting [[Minority report (Poor Law)|minority report]]. This sketched the outlines of a [[Welfare State]] which would

<blockquote>secure a national minimum of civilised life ... open to all alike, of both sexes and all classes, by which we meant sufficient nourishment and training when young, a living wage when able-bodied, treatment when sick, and modest but secure livelihood when disabled or aged.</blockquote>

[[William Beveridge]], future author of the 1942 [[Beveridge Report]] that introduced the welfare state in the United Kingdom, worked as a researcher for the Webbs on the Minority Report.<ref>Jose Harris, "The Webbs and Beveridge", in ''From Workhouse to Welfare'' (Fabian Society, 2009).</ref> He was later appointed director (1919–1937) of the London School of Economics.

===Rivalries on the Left, 1901–1922===
[[File:Webb beatrice (middle age).jpg|220 px|thumbnail|right|Beatrice Webb]]
The influence of the Webbs on the Fabian Society and its policies was attacked by [[H.G. Wells]]. For a time he joined the Society but was critical of its cautious approach: "They permeate English society with their reputed Socialism about as much as a mouse may be said to permeate a cat."<ref>Quoted in Muggeridge and Adam, p. 168.</ref> For her part, Beatrice voiced disapproval of Wells' "sordid intrigue" with the daughter of a veteran Fabian [[Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier|Sydney Olivier]]. He responded by lampooning the couple in his 1911 novel ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' as Altiora and Oscar Bailey, a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators.

Other rivals from the [[left-wing|left]] of the Fabian Society at that time were the [[Guild Socialists]] led by the historian and economist [[G.D.H. Cole]]. Cole and his wife Margaret would later run the Fabian Research Bureau.

In 1913, the Webbs and [[Henry Devenish Harben]], husband of suffragist and fellow Fabian, [[Agnes Harben]], co-founded the ''[[New Statesman]]'', a political weekly edited by [[Clifford Sharp]] with contributions from many philosophers, economists, and politicians of the day, including [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].

The Webbs became members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in late 1914. At the end of World War I, Beatrice collaborated with her husband Sidney in his writings and policy statements such as ''Labour and the New Social Order'' (1918). She also campaigned for his successful election in 1922 to the parliamentary seat of coastal [[Seaham (UK Parliament constituency)|Seaham]], a mine-working community in [[County Durham]].

== ''Soviet Communism'' ==
In 1928, the Webbs moved to [[Liphook]] in Hampshire, where they lived until their deaths in the 1940s. Soon Sidney was a minister in the new Labour government. Observing the wider world,  Beatrice wrote of "Russian communism and Italian Fascism" as "two sides of the worship of force and the practice of cruel intolerance" and she was disturbed that "this spirit is creeping into the USA and even ... into Great Britain."<ref>Muggeridge and Adam,''Beatrice Webb: A Life'', 1967, p.225.</ref>

The frustrations and disappointments of the next few years — the election of a narrow Labour majority of MPs in May 1929, the Great Depression which began later that year, the agreement of fellow Fabian [[Ramsay MacDonald]], after the October 1931 election, to form and head a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], thereby splitting the Labour Party – partly explain why Beatrice and Sidney began to look on the USSR and its leader Stalin with different eyes.

[[File:Beatrice and Sidney Webb, 1932.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Beatrice and Sidney Webb during their trip to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932]] In 1932, Webb was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA); she was the first woman elected to the fellowship.<ref name="FBA">{{Cite journal |date=1933 |title=Current Topics |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=43 |issue=169 |pages=174–175 |jstor=2224094}}</ref> That year, Sidney and Beatrice, now in their 70s, spent two months from 21 May to late July in the [[Soviet Union]]. Their views about the Soviet economic experiment were published three years later in a massive volume, over 1,000 pages in length, entitled ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?'' (1935). Most of the text was written by Sidney Webb and based on a copious study of publications and statistics provided by the Soviet embassy in London. In 1933 he made a further "fact-finding" trip to the USSR before publication, accompanied by their niece [[Barbara Drake]], a prominent trade unionist and member of the Fabian Society, and by John Cripps, the son of their nephew [[Stafford Cripps]].

Historians have criticised the Webbs for the naive supposition that the methods they had developed in analysing and formulating social policy in Britain could be applied to the Soviet Union. Their book promoted and encouraged an uncritical view of Stalin's conduct, during agrarian centralisation in the [[first five-year plan]] (1928–1933), the creation of the [[gulag]] system, and the extensive purges of the 1930s.<ref>See, e.g., [[Robert Conquest|Conquest, Robert]], ''[[The Great Terror]]'' (1968 and subsequent editions).</ref> Trotskyist historian [[Al Richardson (historian)|Al Richardson]] later described their 1935 account of the USSR as "pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious".<ref>Al Richardson, "Introduction" to [[C. L. R. James]], ''World Revolution 1917–1936: The Rise and Fall of the Communist International''. Humanities Press, 1937 {{ISBN|0391037900}}</ref>

There also seemed to be a conscious element of deception. In the third edition of ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation'' (1941), for instance, the Webbs voiced the opinion that in 1937 "strenuous efforts had been made, both in the trade union organisation and in the Communist Party, to cut out the deadwood".<ref>Archie Brown, ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'' (2009), p. 122.</ref> This phrase was used to reassure a wider public about the grotesque accusations against former leading Bolsheviks. In her diaries Beatrice did not hide her disquiet, at the opening of the [[Moscow Trials]] in the summer of 1936,<ref>See diary entry - 28 August 1936, pp. 330-336 of archived typescripts.</ref> and after the conviction of [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in March 1938.<ref>Diary entry - 8 March 1938, pp. 36-37 of archived typescripts.</ref>

''Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?'' — in later editions the question mark was dropped, as was any public doubt the Webbs might have about the nature of the USSR — has since been roundly condemned. In the preface to an anthology of [[Left Book Club]] publications,<ref>[[Paul Laity]], ''Left Book Club Anthology'' Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2001 {{ISBN|0575072210}} (p. xvii)</ref> for instance, British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] is quoted as calling ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilization'' "the most preposterous book ever written about Russia". In the early 1930s [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], one of Beatrice's own family by marriage, and himself the son of a Fabian, told her in no uncertain terms of his horrified disapproval of the Soviet system.

She was among those listed in the German-compiled [[The Black Book (list)|"Black Book"]].<ref>Invasion, 1940: The Nazi Invasion Plan for Britain, Little Brown Book Group by [[Walter Schellenberg]], page 259</ref>

[[Ivan Maisky]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambassador to the United Kingdom during much of the [[Second World War]], was friendly with Webb. In a conversation with Webb on 10 October 1939, Maisky quoted her as stating "Churchill is not a true Englishman, you know. He has Negro blood. You can tell even from his appearance."<ref>The Maisky Diaries: Red Ambassador to the Court of St James’s, 1932-1943, edited by Gabriel Gorodetsky, Yale University Press.</ref>

==Extended family==

In 1929 Webb's husband, [[Sidney Webb]], became [[Baron Passfield]] and a member of the House of Lords. Between 1929 and 1931 he served as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and [[Secretary of State for the Dominions]] in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government. Beatrice did not refer to herself as Lady Passfield or expect others to do so.

Sidney and Beatrice Webb never had any children. In retirement, Beatrice would reflect on the success of their other progeny.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:qif604fiv/read#page/344/mode/2up|title=Beatrice Webb's typescript diary, 1 January 1935-27 December 1937|website=digital.library.lse.ac.uk}}</ref> For instance, in 1895 they had founded the [[London School of Economics]] with [[Graham Wallas]] and George Bernard Shaw:

<blockquote>In old age it is one of the minor satisfactions of life to watch the success of your children, literal children or symbolic. The London School of Economics is undoubtedly our most famous one, but the ''[[New Statesman]]'' is also creditable—it is the most successful of the general weeklies, actually making a profit on its 25,000 readers, and has absorbed two of its rivals, ''The Nation'' and the ''Week-End Review''.</blockquote>

Meanwhile, the connections by marriage of their numerous nieces and nephews made Beatrice and Sidney part of the emerging new Labour establishment. Beatrice's nephew [[Sir Stafford Cripps]], son of her sister Theresa, became a well-known Labour politician in the 1930s and 1940s. He served as British ambassador to Moscow during the Second World War and later as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[Clement Attlee]]. (His daughter [[Peggy Cripps|Peggy]] went on to marry [[Nana (title)|Nana]] [[Joe Appiah]], an African statesman and tribal [[chieftain]] who served as something of a [[founding father]] of the [[Republic of Ghana]].) Margaret, yet another Potter sister, married the Liberal politician [[Henry Hobhouse (East Somerset MP)|Henry Hobhouse]], making Beatrice Webb an aunt of peace activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] and of Liberal politician [[Arthur Hobhouse]].<ref>Hochschild, Adam, ''To end all wars: a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914-1918'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, p. 277, {{ISBN|0618758283}}.</ref> Another sister, Blanche, married surgeon [[William Harrison Cripps]], brother to Theresa's husband [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor]]. The Cripps family was a wealthy political family, originally from [[Cirencester]].

A dissonant voice entered the family after Katherine Dobbs, the daughter of Beatrice's youngest sister Rosalind, married the journalist [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. In the early 1930s, the young couple moved to Moscow, full of enthusiasm for the new Soviet system. Muggeridge's experience of reporting from the Soviet Union for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', however, made him highly critical of the Webbs' optimistic views of the Soviet Union.<ref>See Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time: Pt 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), 1981. Chapter 5, 'Who Whom?', pp. 285-299. Also his ''Winter in Moscow'' (1934).</ref> On 29 March 1933 Beatrice referred in her diary to "Malcolm's curiously hysterical denunciation of the USSR and all its works in a letter to me...."<ref>''The Diaries of Beatrice Web'' (abridged, 2000), p. 514.</ref> The following day she noted that the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' had printed "another account of the famine in Russia, which certainly bears out Malcolm's reports."<ref>''The Diaries of Beatrice Webb'' (abridged, 2000), p. 514.</ref>

Yet, wrote Muggeridge, Beatrice "went on wanting to see [[Kitty Muggeridge|Kitty]] and me." On their last visit, Beatrice showed her niece's husband a portrait of Lenin: "She had set the picture up as though it were a Velazquez, with special lighting coming from below."<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time: Pt 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), 1981. Chapter 4, 'The Pursuit of Righteousness', p. 165.</ref>

==Death and legacy==
When Beatrice Webb died in 1943, she was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]]. The casket containing her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in Passfield Corner, as she had requested. Lord Passfield's ashes were also buried there when he died four years later.

Shortly afterward, the nonagenarian [[George Bernard Shaw]] launched an ultimately successful [[petition]] to have the remains of both moved to [[Westminster Abbey]]. They now lie buried in the [[nave]] of the Abbey, close to the ashes of their Labour Party colleagues [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Ernest Bevin]].

Beatrice did not live to see the [[welfare state]] set up by the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]]. It was an enduring monument to her research and campaigning, before and after she married Sidney Webb. First outlined in the [[Minority report (Poor Law)]] of 1909, it would remain substantially intact until the 1980s. It is not certain that Beatrice Webb would have approved of the manner of its implementation and future management. As her niece Kitty commented:<ref>Kitty Muggeridge & Ruth Adams, ''Beatrice Webb: A life, 1858-1943'', London: Secker & Warburg, 1967, p. 177.</ref>

<blockquote>... although it was Beatrice herself who put the 20th-century ''zeitgeist'' into its most concrete form, in the Welfare State, something in her remained sturdily Victorian to the very end. "What has to be aimed at is not this or that improvement in material circumstances or physical comfort but an improvement in personal character," she wrote. She believed that citizens who were given benefits by the community ought to make an effort to improve themselves, or at least submit themselves to those who would improve them.</blockquote>

==Archives==
Beatrice Webb's papers, including her diaries, form part of the Passfield archive at the London School of Economics. The Webb Diaries are now digitised and available online at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]]'s Digital Library. Posts about Beatrice Webb regularly appear in the LSE Archives blog,
