'''Edward Hugh John Neale Dalton, Baron Dalton''', {{postnom|country=GBR|size=100|PC}} (16 August 1887 – 13 February 1962) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] economist and politician who served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1945 to 1947. He shaped Labour Party foreign policy in the 1930s, opposing pacifism and promoting rearmament against the German threat, and strongly [[Appeasement|opposed the appeasement policy]] of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] in 1938. Dalton served in [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition cabinet; after the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] he was Minister of Economic Warfare, and established the [[Special Operations Executive]]. As Chancellor, he pushed his policy of cheap money too hard, and mishandled the [[Anglo-American loan |sterling crisis of 1947]]. His political position was already in jeopardy in 1947 when he, seemingly inadvertently, revealed a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] accepted his resignation; Dalton later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions.

His biographer [[Ben Pimlott]] characterised Dalton as peevish, irascible, given to poor judgment and lacking administrative talent.<ref>Loades, David ed. (2003) ''The Reader's Guide to British History'' vol. 1, p. 329. {{ISBN|9781579584269}}</ref> Pimlott also recognised that Dalton was a genuine radical and an inspired politician; a man, to quote his old friend and critic [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]], "of feeling, humanity, and unshakeable loyalty to people which matched his talent."<ref>[[#Pimlott1985|Pimlott (1985)]], p. 639.</ref>

==Early life==
Hugh Dalton was born in [[Neath]], in Wales. His father, [[John Neale Dalton]], was a [[Church of England]] clergyman who became chaplain to [[Queen Victoria]], tutor to the princes [[George V|George]] (later King George V) and [[Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Albert Victor]], and a [[Dean and Canons of Windsor|canon of Windsor]].

Dalton was educated at [[Summer Fields School]] and then at [[Eton College]]. He then went up to [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he was active in student politics; his socialist views, then very rare amongst undergraduates, earned him the nickname "Comrade Hugh". Whilst at Cambridge he was President of the [[Cambridge Universities Labour Club|Cambridge University Fabian Society]]. He did not succeed in becoming President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]], despite three unsuccessful attempts to be elected Secretary.

He went on to study at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) and the [[Middle Temple]]. During the [[First World War]] he was called up into the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]], later transferring to the [[Royal Artillery]]. He served as a lieutenant on the French and Italian fronts, where he was awarded the Italian decoration, the ''Medaglia di Bronzo al Valor Militare'', in recognition of his "contempt for danger" during the retreat from [[Caporetto]]; he later wrote a memoir of the war called ''With British Guns in Italy''. Following demobilisation, he returned to the LSE and the [[University of London]] as a lecturer, where he was awarded a DSc for a thesis on the principles of public finance in 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=DALTON|title=LSE Archives}}</ref><ref>Great Britain. Committee on Industry and Trade, ''Factors in industrial and commercial efficiency'' (London: HMSO, 1927), ii.</ref>

There have been suggestions that he was homosexual, but they are rejected by his major biographer [[Ben Pimlott]], who states "no evidence exists that Dalton ever had a sexual relationship with another man, and his private life seems to have been one of blameless monogamy."<ref>[[#Pimlott1985|Pimlott (1985)]], p. 66.</ref> However he does refer to Dalton having "homosexual tendencies", mentioned below.

== Political career ==
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H8185.jpg|thumbnail|Dalton (right), Minister of Economic Warfare, and [[Colin Gubbins]], chief of the [[Special Operations Executive]], talking to a Czech officer during a visit to Czech troops near [[Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire]]
Dalton stood unsuccessfully for Parliament four times: at the [[1922 Cambridge by-election]], in [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]], in [[Cardiff East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff East]] at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]], and the [[1924 Holland with Boston by-election]], before entering Parliament for [[Peckham (UK Parliament constituency)|Peckham]] at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]].

At the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], he succeeded his wife [[Ruth Dalton]], who retired, as Labour [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]]. Widely respected for his intellectual achievements in economics, he rose in the Labour Party's ranks, with election in 1925 to the shadow cabinet and, with strong union backing, to the Labour Party [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] (NEC). He gained ministerial and foreign policy experience as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Under-Secretary]] at the Foreign Office in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s second government, between 1929 and 1931. He lost this position when he, and most Labour leaders, rejected MacDonald's [[National Government (1931)|National Government]]. As with most other Labour MPs, he lost his seat in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]]; he was elected again in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]].

Dalton published ''Practical Socialism for Britain'', a bold and highly influential assessment of a future Labour government's policy options, in 1935. The book revived updated nuts-and-bolts Fabianism, which had been out of favour, and could be used to attack the more militant Left. His emphasis was on using the state as a national planning agency, an approach that appealed well beyond Labour.<ref name=p2004>{{cite ODNB|author= Pimlott, Ben|chapter=Dalton, (Edward) Hugh Neale, Baron Dalton (1887–1962)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year= 2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32697}}
</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Turning his attention to the looming crisis in Europe, he became the Labour Party's spokesman on foreign policy in Parliament. Pacifism had been a strong element in Labour Party (and other parties as well), but the [[Spanish Civil War]] changed that, as the Left moved to support arms for the Republican ("Loyalist") cause.  However Dalton was not enthusiastic for the Labour party policy of wanting to intervene in the Spanish Civil War,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|pages=378}}</ref> later stating:

<blockquote>I was far from enthusiastic for the slogan "arms for Spain" if this meant, as some of my friends eagerly did, that we were to supply arms which otherwise we should keep for ourselves, for I was much more conscious than most of my friends of the terrible insufficiency of British armaments against the German danger.<ref name="dalton-p97">{{Cite book|last=Dalton|first=Hugh|title=The Fateful Years; Memoirs 1931-1945|publisher=Frederick Muller|year=1957|location=London|pages=97}}</ref></blockquote>

His views were different from those of Attlee, later recalling that before the Second World War he believed:

<blockquote>as Germany and Italy were potential enemies of Britain and Franco was their ally, it was in Britain's interest that Franco should not win the Spanish Civil War. It was on this proposition rather than any extravagant eulogy of the Spanish Government that I based most of my public references to this most tragic struggle.<ref name="dalton-p97" /></blockquote>

Yet Dalton admitted he was wrong in this assessment of British interests, stating that "When the Germans overran France in 1940 and reached the Pyrenees, Franco was neutral, and with remarkable skill maintained his neutrality until the end of the war. Hitler respected this and never forced his way through Spain to attack Gibraltar or crossed the Straits into Morocco." and "Hitler would not have respected the neutrality of a Spanish Republican Government. If Franco had lost the Civil War, Hitler would have occupied Spain."<ref name="dalton-p97" />

Aided by union votes, Dalton moved the party from semi-pacifism to a policy of armed deterrence and rejection of appeasement. He was a bitter enemy of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].

==Second World War==
When war came, Chamberlain's position became untenable after many Conservative MPs refused to support him in the [[Norway Debate]] in April 1940, and Dalton and other senior Labour leaders made clear they would join any coalition government ''except'' one headed by Chamberlain. After Chamberlain resigned early in May, and [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] had declined the position, [[Winston Churchill]] became Prime Minister. During Churchill's coalition government (1940–45) Dalton was [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] from 1940 to 1942. He established the [[Special Operations Executive]], and was later a member of the executive committee of the [[Political Warfare Executive]]. He became [[President of the Board of Trade]] in 1942; the future Labour leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]], drafted into the civil service during the war, was his [[Principal Private Secretary]].

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
{{Main|Political history of the United Kingdom (1945–present)}}
After the unexpected Labour victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] Dalton wished to become Foreign Secretary, but the job was instead given to [[Ernest Bevin]]. Dalton, with his skills in economics, became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Alongside Bevin, [[Clement Attlee]], [[Herbert Morrison]] and [[Stafford Cripps]], Dalton was one of the "Big Five" of the Labour government.<ref name=morgan>Morgan, Kenneth O. (1985) ''Labour in Power: 1945–1951''. Ch. 2. {{ISBN|978-0192851505}}</ref>

The [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] faced urgent problems. Half of the wartime economy had been devoted to mobilizing soldiers, warplanes, bombs and munitions; an urgent transition to a peacetime budget was necessary, while minimizing inflation. Financial aid through [[Lend Lease]] from the United States was abruptly and unexpectedly terminated in September 1945, and new loans from the United States and Canada were essential to keep living conditions tolerable. In the long run, Labour was committed to nationalization of industry and national planning of the economy, to more taxation of the rich and less of the poor, and to expanding the welfare state and creating free medical services for everyone.<ref name=p2004/>
[[File:Lord Hugh Dalton, 1962.jpg|thumb|left|Dalton in 1962]]
During the war, most overseas investments had been sold to fund the cost of its prosecution (the state thus losing the income from them), and Britain suffered severe balance of payments problems. The $3.75 billion 50-year American loan negotiated by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in 1946 (and the $1.25 billion loan from Canada) was soon exhausted. By 1947, rationing had to be tightened and the convertibility of the pound suspended. In the atmosphere of crisis, Morrison and Cripps intrigued to replace Attlee with Bevin as Prime Minister; Bevin refused to play along, and Attlee bought off Cripps by giving him Morrison's responsibilities for economic planning. Ironically, of the "Big Five" it was Dalton who ultimately fell victim to the events of that year.

Cheaper money—that is, low interest rates—was an important goal for Dalton during his Chancellorship. He wanted to avoid the high interest rates and unemployment experienced after the First World War, and to keep down the cost of nationalization. He gained support for this cheaper money policy from Keynes, as well as from officials of the [[Bank of England]] and the Treasury.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Howson, Susan |title=The Origins of Cheaper Money, 1945-7|journal=Economic History Review|year=1987|volume=40|issue=3|pages= 433–452 |jstor=2596254|doi=10.2307/2596254}}</ref>

Budgetary policy under Dalton was strongly progressive, as characterised by policies such as increased food subsidies, heavily [[Subsidized housing|subsidised rents]] to [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|council house]] tenants, the lifting of restrictions on housebuilding, the financing of [[Unemployment Assistance Board|national assistance]] and [[Child benefit|family allowances]], and extensive assistance to rural communities and Development Areas.<ref name=morgan/> Dalton was also responsible for funding the introduction of Britain's [[Family Allowances Act 1945|universal family allowances scheme]], doing so "with a song in my heart", as he later put it.<ref>Nicholas Timmins, ''The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State''</ref><ref>Francis Beckett, ''Clem Attlee''</ref> In one of his budgets, Dalton significantly increased spending on education (which included £4 million for the universities and the provision of [[Education Act 1944#School meals and milk|free school milk]]), £38 million for the start (from August 1946) of family allowances, and an additional £10 million for Development Areas. In addition, the [[National Land Fund]] was established. [[Harold Macmillan]], who inherited Dalton's housing responsibilities, later acknowledged his debt to Dalton's championing of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns]], and was grateful for the legacy of Dalton's Town Development Bill, which encouraged urban overfill schemes and the movement of industry out of cities.<ref name=p2004/>

Food subsidies were maintained at high wartime levels in order to restrain living costs, while taxation structures were altered to benefit low-wage earners, with some 2.5 million workers taken out of the tax system altogether in Dalton's first two budgets. There were also increases in [[surtax]] and [[Inheritance tax|death duties]], which were opposed by the Opposition. According to one historian, Dalton's policies as Chancellor reflected "an unprecedented emphasis by central government on the redistribution of income".<ref>Jefferys, Kevin ''The Attlee Governments 1945–1951''</ref>

===Budget-leaking and resignation===
Walking into the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to give the autumn 1947 budget speech, Dalton made an off-the-cuff remark to a journalist, telling him of some of the tax changes in the budget. The news was printed in the early edition of the evening papers before he had completed his speech, and whilst the stock market was still open. This was a scandal, and led to his resignation for leaking a budget secret.<ref>[[#Pimlott1985|Pimlott (1985)]], pp. 524–48.</ref> He was succeeded by Stafford Cripps. Though initially implicated in the allegations that led to the [[Lynskey tribunal]] in 1948, he was ultimately exonerated officially, but his reputation suffered another blow.<ref>[[#Pimlott1985|Pimlott (1985)]], pp. 558–64.</ref>

===Return to cabinet===
[[File:Black Hill (Peak District).jpg|thumb|The paved surface of the [[Pennine Way]] on [[Black Hill (Peak District)|Black Hill]] in the [[Peak District]] National Park]]

Dalton returned to the cabinet in 1948, as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], making him a minister without portfolio. He became Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1950, the position being renamed as [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government|Minister of Local Government and Planning]] the following year. An avid outdoorsman, he served a term as president of the [[Ramblers|Ramblers Association]], which promoted walking tours.<ref>{{cite book |author=Matthew Hilton |title=A Historical Guide to NGOs in Britain: Charities, Civil Society and the Voluntary Sector since 1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEAIRdj6hgYC&pg=PT187 |year=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=187 |display-authors=etal|isbn=9781137029027 }}</ref> As Chancellor in 1946 he had started the [[National Land Fund]] to resource national parks, and in 1951 he approved the [[Pennine Way]], which involved the creation of 70 additional miles of rights of way. He still had the ear of the Prime Minister, and enjoyed promoting the careers of candidates with potential, but was no longer a major political player as he had been until 1947. He left government after Labour lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]].

==Personal life==
In 1914 Dalton married Ruth with whom he had a daughter who died in infancy in the early 1920s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jefferys, Kevin |title=Labour Forces: From Ernie Bevin to Gordon Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4rcoGf4wFYC&pg=PA45 |year=2002 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |page=45|isbn=9781860647437}}</ref>

Dalton's biographer, [[Ben Pimlott]], suggests that Dalton had homosexual tendencies but concludes he never acted on them.<ref>[[#Pimlott1985|Pimlott (1985)]], p. 66</ref> [[Michael Bloch]], on the other hand, thinks that Dalton's love for [[Rupert Brooke]], whom he met at Cambridge University's Fabian Society went beyond the platonic, citing bike rides in the countryside and sleeping naked under the stars.<ref name="Bloch 2015 228–229">{{Cite book | last = Bloch | first = Michael | title = Closet Queens | pages=228–229 | publisher = Little, Brown | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1408704127}}</ref>

In 1908, Dalton also made advances at [[James Strachey]], "waving an immense steaming penis in his face and chuckling softly",<ref>{{Cite book | last = Delaney | first = Paul | title = The Neo-Pagans | pages=49–50 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1987 }}</ref> as Brooke reported to James' brother [[Lytton Strachey|Lytton]]. In later life, Dalton seem to have refrained from sexual relationships with men, though he kept a fatherly interest in the career of various young men (such as [[Hugh Gaitskell]], [[Richard Crossman]] and [[Tony Crosland]], who had been noted for their good looks and had had same-sex experiences at Oxford) and was rather touchy-feely with them.<ref name="Bloch 2015 228–229"/>

In 1951, Dalton wrote to Crossman: "Thinking of Tony, with all his youth and beauty and gaiety and charm... I weep. I am more fond of that young man than I can put into words."<ref>{{Cite book | last = Bloch | first = Michael | title = Closet Queens | page=230 | publisher = Little, Brown | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1408704127}}</ref> According to Nicholas Davenport,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Davenport | first = Nicholas | title = Memoirs of a City Radical  | page=171 | publisher = Weidenfeld | year = 1974}}</ref> Dalton's unrequited feelings for Crosland became an embarrassing joke within the Labour Party.

Dalton's papers, including his diaries, are held at the LSE Library.  His diaries have been digitised and are available on LSE's Digital Library.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hugh Dalton's Diaries|url=https://lse-atom.arkivum.net/uklse-dl1hd01|url-status=live|access-date=8 October 2021|website=LSE Digital Library}}</ref>

==Awards==
Dalton was president of the [[Ramblers' Association]] from 1948 to 1950, and Master of the [[Drapers' Company]] in 1958–59. He was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Dalton''', ''of Forest and Frith in the [[County Palatine of Durham]] on 28 January 1960.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41942 |date=29 January 1960 |page=764}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1960/feb/03/lord-dalton|title=LORD DALTON (Hansard, 3 February 1960)|website=api.parliament.uk}}</ref>

== Contributions in economics ==
Dalton substantially expanded [[Max Otto Lorenz]]'s work in the measurement of income inequality, offering both an expanded array of techniques but also a set of principles by which to comprehend shifts in an income distribution, thereby providing a more compelling theoretical basis for understanding relationships between incomes (1920).

Following a suggestion by [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Pigou]] (1912, p.&nbsp;24), Dalton proposed the condition that a transfer of income from a richer to a poorer person, so long as that transfer does not reverse the ranking of the two, will result in greater [[Equity (economics)|equity]] (Dalton, p.&nbsp;351). This principle has come to be known as the [[Pigou–Dalton principle]] (see, e.g., [[Amartya Sen]], 1973).

Dalton offered a theoretical proposition of a positive functional relationship between income and economic welfare, stating that economic welfare increases at an exponentially decreasing rate with increased income, leading to the conclusion that maximum social welfare is achievable only when all incomes are equal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=F.
