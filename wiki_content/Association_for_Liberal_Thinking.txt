Quarterly journal ''Liberal Düşünce'' (Liberal Thinking) is prestigious source for Turkish Liberal ideology and civil society. President of the Association  [[Atilla Yayla]] is also columnist in the liberal-conservative newspaper Yeni Şafak.

Projects carried out by the organisation have included 'Inter-religious Affairs: Search for A Peaceful Coexistence in a Secular and Democratic System', a 2004 project aimed at encouraging [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] which was sponsored by the [[European Commission]].

The organisation is associated with ''[[Liberte Publications|Liberte Yayınları]]'' (Liberte Publications) that publishes its journals and books by its members.
