==Work==

===''Downsizing Democracy''===
This 2002 book received serious critical attention from reviewers in major newspapers who explained, and criticized, the analysis of Ginsberg and co-author Matthew Crenson.
* A reviewer from the ''[[Associated Press]]'' elaborated that the authors commented on dwindling civic participation in America.<ref name=tws29oct09/> A newspaper chronicled a pattern of reduced interest in civic groups, using diminished [[Lions Club]] attendance from the 1970s to 2004, as an example of the "decline of mass political participation."<ref name=tws29oct09/> Ginsberg and Crenson argue that civic decline is "not simply a consequence of the decay of civil society brought on by [[television|TV]], [[suburbanization]] and busy lives;"<ref name=tws29oct09/> rather, government [[regulation|regulatory commissions]], which were supposed to have served as watchdogs on special interests, have been taken over by those interests.<ref name=tws29oct09/> As a result, "Citizens became less vigilant and involved, and interests like the [[bank]]s and [[railroads]] came to control the very commissions that were supposed to work on behalf of the public good."<ref name=tws29oct09/> Ginsberg criticizes "statutes and judicial rulings" for making advocacy by litigation commonplace, and effectively removing many issues from the political arena.<ref name=tws29oct09>{{cite news

* ''[[The Washington Post]]'' discussed how Ginsberg and Crenson charted the declining importance of [[citizenship|citizens]] to political and public life in the United States.<ref name=tws29oct10/> People are better described as [[consumer]]s, not [[citizens]].<ref name=tws29oct10/> Americans no longer embrace civic responsibility.<ref name=tws29oct10/> Many people don't bother to vote, according to one report.<ref name=tws29oct10/> The authors argue that the public has ''chosen'' to stay aloof from government which it sees as "another service provider."<ref name=tws29oct10/> Many factors are blamed for causing this shift, including fewer patronage jobs.<ref name=tws29oct10/> Candidates use [[public opinion polls|polls]] to focus on the dwindling number of persons who show up to vote.<ref name=tws29oct10/> Increasing court involvement is blamed, as well, for diminishing the role of public sentiment. The authors suggest that the 1960s [[civil rights]] movement has morphed into a litigation struggle about rights and a "middle class" prerogative.<ref name=tws29oct10/> Reviewer Kerry Lauerman suggested Ginsberg and Crenson "overstate on occasion," such as characterizing the issues of [[AIDS]], [[breast cancer]], and [[gun violence]] as "the causes of the comfortable."<ref name=tws29oct10/> The reviewer criticized the writing style as sometimes "turgid" but concluded overall that the analysis was "thoughtful and useful", but needed more analysis of the role of the [[News media|media]].<ref name=tws29oct10>{{cite news

===''The Captive Public''===
* A reviewer from ''[[The New York Times]]'' evaluated Ginsberg's ''The Captive Public: How Mass Opinion Promotes State Power'' 1986. Ginsberg argued that people think they're in control since they vote and answer [[public opinion polls]], but he argues that such control is illusory.<ref name=tws29oct07/> He thinks government used tactics such as extending rights of modern [[citizenship]] to diverse new groups, such as minorities and women, as well as encouraging [[voting]] as an alternative to more dangerous unwanted protests, such as [[strike action|striking]] or [[rioting]], to tame a wary public.<ref name=tws29oct07/> "To vote meant not to strike or riot," and the state preferred citizens to vote rather than mount more serious challenges to its power such as [[lawsuits]], [[protests]], [[union organizer|organizing]], [[parliamentary procedure]], or [[lobbying]].<ref name=tws29oct07/> Schools taught children the benefits of voting with such repetition until it became a "tenacious myth of mass control," in his view.<ref name=tws29oct07/> Since elections happen periodically, they limit citizen participation in politics to the selection of leaders and keep people away from policy formation.<ref name=tws29oct07/> Ginsberg sees public opinion polling as a "subtle instrument of power" since it renders opinions "less dangerous, less disruptive, more permissive, and, perhaps, more amenable to governmental control."<ref name=tws29oct07/> He sees policy based not on mass opinion but on managing mass opinion, a kind of giant [[public relations]] project.<ref name=tws29oct07/> Reviewer Mark Crispin Miller found Ginsberg's analysis compelling but "a bit too careful to do justice to the complex advertising mechanism that has swallowed up our politics," and found his focus "too narrow", "too simple", with a "libertarian bias."<ref name=tws29oct07/> He criticizes Ginsberg's terms as "too crude" such as using "the state" to describe regulatory agencies, and for equating agencies such as the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] with [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].<ref name=tws29oct07/> Miller criticized Ginsberg for ignoring the "subtle and extensive interrelationships" between government, corporations, advertising agencies and the mass media.<ref name=tws29oct07/> Miller thinks Ginsberg underestimated the public, and "has translated his fellow citizens into a featureless manipulated mass, without fears or desires worth taking seriously."<ref name=tws29oct07>{{cite news

===Citizenship, political parties, and polling===
Ginsberg has criticized the Washington political climate as "toxic", characterized by a "cycle of attack and counterattack" in which minor indiscretions are used as political weapons.<ref name=tws29oct08/> Ginsberg sees this as a "structural" problem.<ref name=tws29oct08>{{cite news

}}</ref> While Ginsberg sees voting as a passive and meaningless act which gives the illusion of public control over government, he sometimes criticizes both political parties as having a "resistance" to sincerely working towards increased voter participation.<ref name=tws29oct11/> One newspaper reporter, writing about low [[voter turnout]] in 1998, suggested there was a "deep-rooted resistance within both [[political parties|parties]] to expanding the national electorate," and quoted Ginsberg as saying "Politicians who have risen to power in a low-turnout political environment have little to gain and much to fear from an expanded electorate."<ref name=tws29oct11/> Ginsberg added when officeholders talk about "getting out the vote," they generally mean their own voters, not non-participants.<ref name=tws29oct11>{{cite news

He believes citizen participation in the military is good since it strengthens patriotism, which means "sacrifice and a willingness to die for one's country."<ref name=tws29oct02/> But the switch to a voluntary military eliminates "a powerful [[patriotism|patriotic]] framework" since "instead of a disgruntled army of citizen soldiers, the military seems to consist of professional soldiers and private contractors."<ref name=tws29oct02/> Ginsberg suggested that the "government learned the lessons of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and has found ways to insulate the use of military force" from society.<ref name=tws29oct02>{{cite news

===The effect of administrative bloat on universities===
Ginsberg has been an outspoken critic of the expansion in the number and pay of non-teaching university administrators on campuses throughout the world.<ref>The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters (2011) Oxford University Press</ref> As these administrators now outnumber faculty in every university in the U.S., he points out that this is the fundamental reason for rapid tuition increases despite the fact that the faculty to student ratio has remained nearly unchanged and faculty salaries generally track inflation. There is general consensus that Ginsberg's observations are correct with some studies showing that administrators not qualified to be assistant professors in their own discipline are hired to oversee faculty  at all levels.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/13583883.2016.1181198|title = Are you overpaying your academic executive team? A method for detecting unmerited academic executive compensation| journal=Tertiary Education and Management| volume=22| issue=3| pages=189–201|year = 2016|last1 = Pearce|first1 = Joshua}}</ref> These conditions have incited rage in some faculty,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/the-fall-of-the-faculty-the-rise-of-the-all-administrative-university-and-why-it-matters/418285.article | title=The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters| date=December 2011}}</ref> yet little has changed at university campuses since the publication of Ginsberg's book. Ginsberg places the blame not only on administrators but also on faculty for seceding their universities to inept administrators. Even critics have said, "Ginsberg rightly points out that numbers of administrators and professional staffers have grown far more quickly than numbers of faculty, pushing up the costs that students and their families pay without enhancing the academic side of their experience."
