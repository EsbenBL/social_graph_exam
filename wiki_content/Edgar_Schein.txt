'''Edgar Henry Schein''' (born March 5, 1928), a former [[professor]] at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], has made a notable mark on the field of [[organizational development]] in many areas, including [[career development]], group process consultation, and [[organizational culture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/detail/?id=41040|title=Edgar Schein - Faculty {{!}} MIT Sloan School of Management|website=mitsloan.mit.edu|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> He is the son of former [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Marcel Schein]].

==Model of organizational culture==
[[File:Schein's Model.JPG|thumb|300px|Illustration of Schein's model of organizational culture]]

Schein's model of organizational culture originated in the 1980s. Schein (2004) identifies three distinct levels in organizational cultures:

# artifacts and behaviours
# espoused values
# assumptions

The three levels refer to the degree to which the different cultural phenomena are visible to the observer.

* Artifacts include any tangible, overt or verbally identifiable elements in any organization.  Architecture, furniture, dress code, office jokes, all exemplify organizational artifacts. Artifacts are the visible elements in a culture and they can be recognized by people not part of the culture.
* Espoused values are the organization's stated values and rules of behavior.  It is how the members represent the organization both to themselves and to others.  This is often expressed in official philosophies and public statements of identity.  It can sometimes often be a projection for the future, of what the members hope to become.   Examples of this would be employee professionalism, or a "family first" mantra. Trouble may arise if espoused values by leaders are not in line with the deeper [[tacit assumption]]s of the culture.<ref>http://businessmate.org/Article.php?Artike1ld=36Edgar H.

* Shared basic assumptions are the deeply embedded, taken-for-granted behaviours which are usually unconscious, but constitute the essence of culture. These assumptions are typically so well integrated in the office dynamic that they are hard to recognize from within.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summary of Culture Levels - Schein. Abstract|url=http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_schein_three_levels_culture.html|website=www.valuebasedmanagement.net|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>

== Career anchors ==
A career anchor is one's self-concept and consists of one's perceptions of one's talents and abilities, one's basic values, and one's perceptions of motives and needs as they pertain to career.

Schein's original research in the mid-1970s identified five possible career anchor constructs: (1) autonomy/independence, (2) security/stability, (3) technical-functional competence, (4) general managerial competence, and (5) entrepreneurial creativity. Follow-up studies in the 1980s identified three additional constructs: (6) service or dedication to a cause, (7) pure challenge, and (8) life style.

A 2008 study distinguishes between entrepreneurship and creativity to form nine possible constructs.<ref>
