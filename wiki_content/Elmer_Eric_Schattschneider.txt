'''Elmer Eric Schattschneider''' (August 11, 1892 – March 4, 1971) was an American [[political science|political scientist]].

== Life and career ==
Schattschneider was born in [[Bethany, Minnesota]].  He received his B.A. and M.A. at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and his Ph.D. at [[Columbia University]].  He taught at Columbia, the New Jersey College for Women (now a section of [[Rutgers University]]), and [[Wesleyan University]] (1930–1960). Schattschneider was president of the [[American Political Science Association]] for 1956–1957 and is the namesake of its award for the best dissertation in the field of American politics.  He died in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]].

== Publications ==
Schattschneider's books include ''Politics, Pressures and the Tariff'' (1935), ''Party Government'' (1942), ''The Struggle for Party Government'', (1948), ''Equilibrium and Change in American Politics'' (1958), ''The Semisovereign People: A Realist's View of Democracy in America'' (1960) (for a discussion see: Mair, 1997<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mair |first1=Peter |title=EE Schattschneider's the Semisovereign People |journal=Political Studies |year=1997 |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=947–954 |doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00122|s2cid=145304768 }}</ref>), and ''Two Hundred Million Americans in Search of a Government'' (1969).

== Critique of pluralism ==
Along with the [[political scientist]] [[Theodore J. Lowi]], Schattschneider offered perhaps "the most devastating" critique of the American [[political theory]] of [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]: Rather than an essentially democratic system in which the many, competing interests of [[citizens]] are amply represented, if not advanced, by equally many competing [[Advocacy group|interest groups]], Schattschneider argued the pressure system is biased in favor of "the most educated and highest-income members of society", and showed that "the difference between those who participate in interest group activity and those who stand at the sidelines is much greater than that between voters and nonvoters."<ref>Woolley and Papa 1998, 165</ref>

In ''The Semisovereign People'', Schattschneider argued the scope of the pressure system is really quite small: The "range of organized, identifiable, known groups is amazingly narrow; there is nothing remotely universal about it" and the "business or upper-class bias of the pressure system shows up everywhere." He says the "notion that the pressure system is automatically representative of the whole community is a myth" and, instead, the "system is skewed, loaded and unbalanced in favor of a fraction of a minority."<ref>Schattschneider 1960, 30–36</ref> And "the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent."<ref>Schattschneider 1960, 35</ref>
