'''Daniel Patrick Moynihan''' (March 16, 1927&nbsp;– March 26, 2003) was an American [[politician]], [[sociologist]], and diplomat. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]].

Born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].

In 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until early 1976; later that year he won election to the Senate.

Moynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995. He also led the [[Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy|Moynihan Secrecy Commission]], which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]]. He frequently broke with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the Congressional authorization for the [[Gulf War]]. He is tied with [[Jacob K. Javits]] as the longest-serving Senator from the state of New York.<ref>[[Chuck Schumer]] will join them should he complete the term to which he was elected in 2016.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Moynihan was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the son of Margaret Ann (née Phipps), a homemaker, and John Henry Moynihan, a reporter for a daily newspaper in Tulsa.<ref name="google">{{cite journal|title=Current Biography Yearbook|author=H.W.

He was a parishioner of [[Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael (New York City)|St. Raphael's Church]], [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], and also cast his first vote in that church.<ref name=organ>[http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/SSCyrilMethodius.html NYC Organ History Website] (Accessed January 24, 2011)</ref> He and his brother, Michael Willard Moynihan, spent most of their childhood summers at their grandfather's farm in [[Bluffton, Indiana]]. Moynihan briefly worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]] to city residents.

Following a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1944. He was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Middlebury College]] from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] student at [[Tufts University]], where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']] at the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1947. Moynihan then returned to Tufts, where he completed a second undergraduate degree in [[sociology]]<ref name="nixonlibrary">{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|publisher=nixonlibrary.gov|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan|access-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170504/https://nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|archive-date=December 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''cum laude'' in 1948 and earned an [[M.A.]] from the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] in 1949.

After failing the [[Foreign Service Officer]] exam, he continued his doctoral studies at the Fletcher School as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellow]] at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1950 to 1953. During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a "[[dandy]]", cultivating "a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory" even as he maintained that "nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work." Moynihan spent two years as an RAF administrator at the American Air Base in Ruislip.<ref name="google3">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref>

He ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name="proquest">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889–1934 – ProQuest|access-date=January 26, 2017|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name="search.marquiswhoswho.com">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref>

==Political career and return to academia==
Moynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 27, 1976|last1=Dullea|first1=Georgia}}</ref>

This period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957–1958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959–1961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.

===Kennedy and Johnson administrations===
{{more references needed|section|date=June 2021}}
Moynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961–1962) and executive (1962–1963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive "Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture", which discouraged use of an official style for [[federal building]]s, and has been credited with enabling "a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture "the preferred and default style" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=February 4, 2020|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>

He was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].

They took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also "act affirmatively" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.

Moynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.

==== Controversy over the War on Poverty ====
Moynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name="dol">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor – History – The Negro Family – The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|access-date=January 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=January 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks.

===Local New York City politics and ongoing academic career===
By the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Moynihan was recognized as a political ally of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}} He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

During this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the university's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name="search.marquiswhoswho.com"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, "a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements", decided to "call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives",<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''</ref> and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.

===Nixon administration===
Connecting with [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968, Moynihan joined the [[Executive Office of the President]] in January 1969 as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and executive secretary of the Council of Urban Affairs (later the Urban Affairs Council), a forerunner of the [[Domestic Policy Council]] envisaged as an analog to the [[United States National Security Council]]. As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for "traditional budget-conscious positions" (including his proposed [[Family Assistance Plan]], a "[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name="bloomberg">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan – Bloomberg View|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>

While formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].

Although Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the university) at the end of 1970. Operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]]. This decision was instigated by [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]],<ref name="google4">{{cite book|title=The Professor and the President: Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Nixon White House|author=Hess, S.|date=2014|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815726166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2aBAAAQBAJ|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> a close friend of Ehrlichman since college and his main patron in the administration.

In 1969, on Nixon's initiative, [[NATO]] tried to establish a third civil column, establishing a hub of research and initiatives in the civil area, dealing as well with environmental topics.<ref name="Hüne"/> Moynihan<ref name="Hüne"/> named [[acid rain]] and the [[greenhouse effect]] as suitable international challenges to be dealt by NATO. NATO was chosen, since the organization had suitable expertise in the field, as well as experience with international research coordination. The German government was skeptical and saw the initiative as an attempt by the US to regain international terrain after the lost [[Vietnam War]]. The topics gained momentum in civil conferences and institutions.<ref name="Hüne">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), [[Kai F. Hünemörder]], Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 {{ISBN|3-515-08188-7}}</ref>

In 1970, Moynihan wrote a memo to President Nixon saying, "The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect'. The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides. We need a period in which [[Negro]] progress continues and racial rhetoric fades."<ref>[http://www.aol.bartleby.com/73/1579.html "1579: Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1927–2003)"]. ''Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations''. Bartleby. 1989.</ref>  Moynihan regretted that critics misinterpreted his memo as advocating that the government should neglect minorities.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Liberal? Conservative?

This supposed "misinterpretation" was perhaps understandable given the timing of the memo: it was written around- and leaked on-  March 1, 1970, soon after Nixon's announcement of the extremely racist [[G. Harrold Carswell]] as his next Supreme Court nominee, which was followed a few weeks later by the resignation of [[Leon Panetta]] and six members of his staff.</ref>

===US Ambassador===
Following the October 1969 reorganization of the White House domestic policy staff, Moynihan was offered the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] (then held by career Foreign Service Officer [[Charles Woodruff Yost]]) by Nixon on November 17, 1969; after initially accepting the president's offer, he decided to remain in Washington when the Family Assistance Plan stalled in the [[Senate Finance Committee]].<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary|author1=Moynihan, D.|author2=Weisman, S.|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586489205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm-BjcLtRwwC|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the repudiation of the Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to effect change due to static policy directives in the position, which he considered to be a tertiary role behind [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]].<ref name="books.google.com"/> Instead, he commuted from Harvard as a part-time member of the United States delegation during the ambassadorship of [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref name="books.google.com"/>

In 1973, Moynihan (who was circumspect toward the administration's "tilt" to Pakistan) accepted Nixon's offer to serve as [[United States Ambassador to India]], where he would remain until 1975. The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 "An American Original"], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The "Rupee Deal" is logged in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>

In June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976. Under President [[Gerald Ford]], Ambassador Moynihan took a hardline [[anti-communist]] stance, in line with the agenda of the White House at the time. He was also a strong supporter of Israel,<ref>[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0694/9406044.html Daniel Moynihan], WRMEA.</ref> condemning [[UN Resolution 3379]], which declared [[Zionism]] to be a form of [[racism]].<ref name="'70s 320">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/320 320]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/320|url-access= registration}}</ref> Moynihan's wife Liz later recalled being approached in the UN galleries by Permanent PLO Observer to the UN Zehdi Terzi during the controversy. He made a remark of which she later did not remember the exact phrasing, but rendered it approximately as 'you must have mixed feelings about remembering events in New Delhi', which she and biographer Gil Troy interpreted as a threatening reference to a failed assassination plan against her husband two years earlier.<ref>[[Troy, Gil]], ''Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism'' (2012), New York: Oxford University Press, page 55, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992030-3}}</ref> But the American public responded enthusiastically to his moral outrage over the resolution; his condemnation of the "Zionism is Racism" resolution brought him celebrity status and helped him win a [[US Senate]] seat a year later.<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', page 6</ref> Moynihan opposed to the resolution because he thought it was completely false and perverse.

Perhaps the most controversial action of Moynihan's career was his response, as Ambassador to the UN, to the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]] in 1975. [[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000–200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.<ref name=CAVR>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513220045/http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm|url-status=dead|title=Chega!

{{quote|The United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about. The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ON2TPWZkiCIC ''A Dangerous Place''], Little Brown, 1980, p. 247</ref>}}

Later, he said he had defended a "shameless" [[Cold War]] policy toward East Timor.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pandaemoniumethn00moyn ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics''], Oxford University Press 1993, page 153</ref>

Moynihan's thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN. In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.

Nevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[détente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as "[[Wyatt Earp]]" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an "abbreviated posting" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was "something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired."

===Career in the Senate===
In November 1976, Moynihan [[1976 United States Senate election in New York|was elected to]] the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. He also was nominated by the [[Liberal Party of New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=6301|title=Our Campaigns - NY US Senate Race - Nov 02, 1976|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref> Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 "The History of the Fisc"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website. Retrieved June 17, 2010.</ref>). Moynihan's strong support for Israel while UN Ambassador inspired support for him among the state's large [[Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan H. Levy|title=The Political Life of Bella Abzug, 1920–1976: Political Passions, Women's Rights, and Congressional Battles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kS9nAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA252|year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|page=252|isbn=9780739181652}}</ref>

In an August 7, 1978 speech to the Senate, following the jailing of [[M. A. Farber]], Moynihan stated the possibility of Congress having to become involved with securing press freedom and that the Senate should be aware of the issue's seriousness.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-moynihan-sees-need-for-bill-to-guarantee-freedom.html|title=Moynihan Sees Need For Bill to Guarantee Freedom of the Press|date=August 8, 1978|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Moynihan's strong advocacy for New York's interests in the Senate, buttressed by the ''Fisc'' reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once "slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan's office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in [[urban renewal]] over a glass of port."<ref>[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/06/02/pages/3628/index.xml?page=2& "Uncivil society: Jim Leach '64 leads an effort to restore respectful discourse to our national life, but it's tough going"], by Mark F. Bernstein, ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'', June 2, 2010. Retrieved June 17, 2010.</ref>

Moynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Select Committee on Intelligence]]. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate when he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration's hawkish tilt in the late [[Cold War]], as exemplified by its support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the administration's "consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism – which is not in fact going on." In a September 8, 1990 letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: "I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the [C]old [W]ar. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice."<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]].

Moynihan introduced Section 1706 of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], which cost certain professionals (like computer programmers, engineers, draftspersons, and designers) who depended on intermediary agencies (consulting firms) a self-employed tax status option, but other professionals (like accountants and lawyers) continued to enjoy Section 530 exemptions from payroll taxes. This change in the tax code was expected to offset the tax revenue losses of other legislation that Moynihan proposed to change the law of foreign taxes of Americans working abroad.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/nyregion/new-tax-law-threatens-high-tech-consultants.html "New Tax Law threatens high-tech consultants"] by Karla Jennings, ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1987 (p. 11 in paper).

Early in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with adamantly pro-choice, pro woman groups petitioning him and others on the issue of abortion. He challenged them saying, "you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]]."

Moynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans]]. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that "there is no health care crisis in this country."{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

On other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}} Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}} Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Public speaker==
Moynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He spoke with a slight stutter, which led him to draw out vowels. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F. Buckley: A Man of Many Words|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88397125|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=May 16, 2011}}</ref>

==Commission on Government Secrecy==
{{Main|Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy}}
{{More references needed|section|date=June 2021}}

In the post-[[Cold War]] era, the 103rd Congress enacted legislation directing an inquiry into the uses of government secrecy. Moynihan chaired the commission, which studied and made recommendations on the "culture of secrecy" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.

The commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.

After release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name="amazon">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.

==Personal life==
Moynihan was criticized after reportedly making offensive comments towards a woman of Jamaican descent at [[Vassar College]] in early 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/15/nyregion/moynihan-quits-lectureship-after-a-protest.html|title=Moynihan Quits Lectureship After A Protest|date=February 15, 1990|work=The New York Times}}</ref> During a question-and-answer session, Moynihan told Folami Grey, an official at the Dutchess County Youth Bureau, "If you don't like it in this country, why don't you pack your bags and go back where you came from". This incident caused a protest in which 100 students took over the college's main administration building in response to his comments.

Moynihan's daughter, Maura Moynihan, was also criticized for racism. She was recorded on a cell phone camera in March 2021 berating a [[Korean-American]] couple in New York City. She told the couple to "go back to Communist China" and "you do not belong here" during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=EDT|first=Aila Slisco On 3/18/21 at 8:55 PM|date=2021-03-18|title=Maura Moynihan, daughter of late NY Senator, allegedly told Asian couple to leave U.S. in viral video|url=https://www.newsweek.com/maura-moynihan-daughter-late-ny-senator-allegedly-told-asian-couple-leave-us-viral-video-1577247|access-date=2021-04-27|website=Newsweek|language=en}}</ref> His son, John Moynihan,  a writer, died in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=2011-09-29|title=A Young Man at Sea, Searching for Himself|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/books/john-moynihans-voyage-of-the-rose-city-review.html|access-date=2021-05-19|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Career as scholar==
As a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.

Moynihan coined the term "professionalization of reform", by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>

In 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Award given by the [[American Political Science Association]] "in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor [[George F. Will]], to remark that Moynihan "wrote more books than most senators have read." After retiring from the Senate, he rejoined the faculty of the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]], where he began his academic career in 1959.

Moynihan's scholarly accomplishments led [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], writing in  ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' to describe the senator as "the nation's best thinker among politicians since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and its best politician among thinkers since [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics 2000 |last=Barone |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |work=National Journal |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 1090–1091] |quote=Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson, now approaches the end of a long career in public office. |url=https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 }}</ref> Moynihan's 1993 article, "Defining Deviancy Down",<ref>''The American Scholar'', vol. 62, no. 1, winter 1993, pp. 17–3</ref> was notably controversial.<ref name="sunysuffolk">{{cite web|url=http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|publisher=www2.sunysuffolk.edu|title=Defining Deviancy|access-date=January 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128102459/http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|archive-date=January 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="barrypopik">{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/defining_deviancy_down_daniel_patrick_moynihan|publisher=barrypopik.com|title=The Big Apple: "Defining deviancy down" (Daniel Patrick Moynihan)|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Writer and historian Kenneth Weisbrode describes Moynihan's book ''Pandaemonium'' as uncommonly prescient.<ref>"[https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163802 Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Amazing and Grim Prophecy]"</ref>

* (In response to the question: "Why should I work if I am going to just end up emptying slop jars?") "That's a complaint you hear mostly from people who don't empty slop jars. This country has a lot of people who do exactly that for a living. And they do it well. It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work. There's nothing the matter with doing it.

It reverberates, and I can say more about it. But in the main, American liberalism—[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]], one of the conspicuous examples—got it wrong. We were on the side of the people who denied this, and a president who could have changed his rhetoric, explained it, told the American people, didn't know the facts, they were secret, and they were kept from him."<br />– ''Secrecy: The American Experience'', October 1998<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/114123-1 |title=Secrecy: The American Experience |last1=Moynihan |first1=Daniel |date=October 21, 1998 |publisher= C-SPAN |at=44:34 to 45:40 minute mark |location= City University of New York Graduate School |access-date= February 5, 2014}}</ref><!-- first broadcast October 31, 1998 -->
