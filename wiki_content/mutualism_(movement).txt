'''Mutualism''', also known as the '''movement of mutuals''' and the '''mutualist movement''', is a [[social movement]] that aims at creating and promoting [[mutual organization]]s, [[mutual insurance]]s and [[mutual fund]]s. According to the prominent mutualist Gene Costa, the movement encourages and assists the provision of mutual benefits against risks to those accessing its funds and or the elevation of their material and spiritual living standards by regular payment or contribution.<ref>Johnston Birchall (2001).

[https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=0qZ25M52KEYC&dq ''Charity and Mutual Aid in Europe and North America ince 1800'']. Routledge. 250 pp.</ref> Institutionalized through mutual funds, mutualism has been universally recognized as a generator or embryo of classical [[forecasting|forecast]] and modern [[social security]] systems and currently coexists with them.<ref>Martin Gorsky; John Mohan; Tim Willis (2006). [https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=tDvqCN5aUdUC&dq ''Mutualism and Health Care: British Hospital Contributory Schemes in the Twentieth Century'']. Manchester University Press. 243 pp.</ref> Although the fall in the popularity of mutual funds in many social environments coincided with the start of public social security system in the early decades of the 20th century, in Europe and other parts of the world mutualism continues to be an important player in the social economy. Mutuals providing healthcare coverage are united in an [[AIM - Association Internationale de la Mutualité|international association]] of benefit societies.

Originating from an adaptation of [[guild system]] at the 18th century (see [[guild]] and [[mount of piety]]) and widespread at the 19th century, today there are many mutualist associations worldwide integrated into modern society. Nowadays, mutualism is linked to [[Financial institution|financial firms]], [[insurer]]s, [[Trade union|union]]s, entities to promote [[solidarity economics]], [[trade association]]s and [[religious movement]]s. The characteristic sign of mutual movement is its institutional [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] about political, religious, racial and union affiliations of its members. Mutuals movement and [[cooperative]]s movement have many points in common, around the idea of professional [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].<ref>Yves Demers.

Building on the mutualist movement of the 18th century, [[Sara Horowitz]], founder and executive director of [[Freelancers Union]], has identified a series of related phenomena that she calls "new mutualism".<ref>[http://nycppnews.com/directory/freelancers-union/ "New Mutualism: Mutual Support for the Information Age"].</ref> For example, Horowitz and Costa both point to the 40 million Americans currently freelancing as a means of promoting entrepreneurship to more of the middle class.
