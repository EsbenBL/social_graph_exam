=== Manic episodes ===
[[File:A woman diagnosed as suffering from hilarious mania. Colour Wellcome L0026687.jpg|thumb|left|An 1892 color lithograph depicting a woman diagnosed with ''hilarious mania'']]

Also known as a manic episode, mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood, which can range from euphoria to [[delirium]]. The core symptom of mania involves an [[Psychomotor agitation|increase in energy of psychomotor activity]]. Mania can also present with increased self-esteem or [[grandiosity]], [[racing thoughts]], [[Pressure of speech|pressured speech]] that is difficult to interrupt, decreased need for sleep, disinhibited social behavior,<ref name=akiskalsadock/> increased [[goal-oriented]] activities and impaired judgement, which can lead to exhibition of behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as [[hypersexuality]] or excessive spending.<ref name="Barnett2009" /><ref name="Tarr2011">{{cite journal|vauthors=Tarr GP, Glue P, Herbison P|date=November 2011|title=Comparative efficacy and acceptability of mood stabilizer and second generation antipsychotic monotherapy for acute mania—a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=J Affect Disord|volume=134|issue=1–3|pages=14–19|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2010.11.009|pmid=21145595}}</ref><ref name="Beentjes2012">{{cite journal|vauthors=Beentjes TA, Goossens PJ, Poslawsky IE|date=October 2012|title=Caregiver burden in bipolar hypomania and mania: a systematic review|journal=Perspect Psychiatr Care|volume=48|issue=4|pages=187–197|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2012.00328.x|pmid=23005586}}</ref> To fit the definition of a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work.<ref name="Barnett2009" /><ref name="Beentjes2012" /> If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Titmarsh S | title = Characteristics and duration of mania: implications for continuation treatment | journal = Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry | date = May–June 2013 | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 26–27 | doi = 10.1002/pnp.283 | s2cid = 144883133 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In severe manic episodes, a person can experience [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms, where thought content is affected along with mood.<ref name="Beentjes2012" /> They may feel unstoppable, or as if they have a special relationship with God, a great mission to accomplish, or other grandiose or delusional ideas.<ref name="Knowles2011">{{cite journal |vauthors=Knowles R, McCarthy-Jones S, Rowse G | title = Grandiose delusions: a review and theoretical integration of cognitive and affective perspectives | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 684–696 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21482326 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.02.009 }}</ref> This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient [[psychiatric hospital]].<ref name="Tarr2011" /><ref name="Beentjes2012" /> The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the [[Young Mania Rating Scale]], though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Furukawa TA | title = Assessment of mood: Guides for clinicians | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–589 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20488276 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.05.003 }}</ref>

[[Hypomania]] is the milder form of mania, defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania,<ref name="Beentjes2012" /> but which does not cause a significant decrease in the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as [[delusions]] or [[hallucinations]], and does not require psychiatric hospitalization.<ref name="Barnett2009" /> Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some.<ref name="Bowins2013" /> Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full-blown manic episodes.<ref name="Bowins2013" /> Some people who experience hypomania show increased creativity,<ref name="Beentjes2012" /><ref name="pmid20936438">{{cite journal|vauthors=Srivastava S, Ketter TA|date=December 2010|title=The link between bipolar disorders and creativity: evidence from personality and temperament studies.|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=12|issue=6|pages=522–530|doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0159-x|pmid=20936438|s2cid=1880847}}</ref> while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment.<ref name="Bobo2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bobo WV | title = The Diagnosis and Management of Bipolar I and II Disorders: Clinical Practice Update | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 92 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1551 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28888714 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.06.022 | type = Review | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Hypomania may feel good to some individuals who experience it, though most people who experience hypomania state that the stress of the experience is very painful.<ref name="Beentjes2012" /> People with bipolar disorder who experience hypomania tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them.

The precise mechanisms that cause bipolar disorder are not well understood. Bipolar disorder is thought to be associated with abnormalities in the structure and function of certain brain areas responsible for cognitive tasks and the processing of emotions.<ref name="Chen2011"/> A neurologic model for bipolar disorder proposes that the emotional circuitry of the brain can be divided into two main parts.<ref name="Chen2011"/> The ventral system (regulates emotional perception) includes brain structures such as the [[amygdala]], [[Insular cortex|insula]], ventral [[striatum]], ventral [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref name="Chen2011"/> The dorsal system (responsible for emotional regulation) includes the [[hippocampus]], dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and other parts of the prefrontal cortex.<ref name="Chen2011"/> The model hypothesizes that bipolar disorder may occur when the ventral system is overactivated and the dorsal system is underactivated.<ref name="Chen2011"/> Other models suggest the ability to regulate emotions is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder and that dysfunction of the ventricular prefrontal cortex (vPFC) is crucial to this disruption.<ref name="Chen2011"/>

The DSM and the ICD characterize bipolar disorder as a spectrum of disorders occurring on a continuum. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 lists three specific subtypes:<ref name=DSM5 /><ref name=":0" />

* [[Bipolar II disorder]]: No manic episodes and one or more hypomanic episodes and one or more major depressive episodes.<ref name="Renk2014" /> Hypomanic episodes do not go to the full extremes of mania (''i.e.'', do not usually cause severe social or occupational impairment, and are without psychosis), and this can make bipolar II more difficult to diagnose, since the hypomanic episodes may simply appear as periods of successful high productivity and are reported less frequently than a distressing, crippling depression.

When relevant, specifiers for ''peripartum onset'' and ''with rapid cycling'' should be used with any subtype. Individuals who have subthreshold symptoms that cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but do not meet full criteria for one of the three subtypes may be diagnosed with other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder. Other specified bipolar disorder is used when a clinician chooses to explain why the full criteria were not met (e.g., hypomania without a prior major depressive episode).<ref name=DSM5 /> If the condition is thought to have a non-psychiatric medical cause, the diagnosis of ''bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition'' is made, while ''substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder'' is used if a medication is thought to have triggered the condition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Angst J | title = Bipolar disorders in DSM-5: strengths, problems and perspectives | journal = International Journal of Bipolar Disorders | volume = 1 | issue = 12 | pages = 12 |year = 2013 | pmid = 25505679 | doi = 10.1186/2194-7511-1-12 | pmc = 4230689 }}</ref>

=== Elderly ===
Bipolar disorder is uncommon in older patients, with a measured lifetime prevalence of 1% in over 60s and a 12-month prevalence of 0.1 to 0.5% in people over 65. Despite this, it is overrepresented in psychiatric admissions, making up 4 to 8% of inpatient admission to aged care psychiatry units, and the incidence of mood disorders is increasing overall with the aging population. Depressive episodes more commonly present with sleep disturbance, fatigue, hopelessness about the future, slowed thinking, and poor concentration and memory; the last three symptoms are seen in what is known as [[pseudodementia]]. Clinical features also differ between those with late-onset bipolar disorder and those who developed it early in life; the former group present with milder manic episodes, more prominent cognitive changes and have a background of worse psychosocial functioning, while the latter present more commonly with mixed affective episodes,<ref name=Forlenza16/><!-- cites all previous in para --> and have a stronger family history of illness.<ref name=Vasudev2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vasudev A, Thomas A | title = 'Bipolar disorder' in the elderly: what's in a name? | journal = Maturitas | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–235 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20307944 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.02.013 }}</ref> Older people with bipolar disorder suffer cognitive changes, particularly in executive functions such as abstract thinking and switching cognitive sets, as well as concentrating for long periods and decision-making.<ref name=Forlenza16>{{cite journal |vauthors=Forlenza O, Valiengo L, Stella F |title=Mood disorders in the elderly: Prevalence, functional impact, and management challenges |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |year=2016 |volume=12 |pages=2105–2114 |doi=10.2147/NDT.S94643|pmid=27601905 |pmc=5003566 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Attempts at [[Prevention of mental disorders|prevention of bipolar disorder]] have focused on stress (such as [[Childhood trauma|childhood adversity]] or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miklowitz DJ, Chang KD | title = Prevention of bipolar disorder in at-risk children: theoretical assumptions and empirical foundations. | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 881–897 | date = Summer 2008 | pmid = 18606036 | doi=10.1017/s0954579408000424 | pmc=2504732}}</ref> Longitudinal studies have indicated that full-blown manic stages are often preceded by a variety of prodromal clinical features, providing support for the occurrence of an at-risk state of the disorder when an early intervention might prevent its further development and/or improve its outcome.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vieta|first1=Eduard|last2=Salagre|first2=Estela|last3=Grande|first3=Iria|last4=Carvalho|first4=André F.|last5=Fernandes|first5=Brisa S.|last6=Berk|first6=Michael|last7=Birmaher|first7=Boris|last8=Tohen|first8=Mauricio|last9=Suppes|first9=Trisha|date=2018-05-01|title=Early Intervention in Bipolar Disorder|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=175|issue=5|pages=411–426|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17090972|issn=1535-7228|pmid=29361850|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Faedda|first1=Gianni L.|last2=Baldessarini|first2=Ross J.|last3=Marangoni|first3=Ciro|last4=Bechdolf|first4=Andreas|last5=Berk|first5=Michael|last6=Birmaher|first6=Boris|last7=Conus|first7=Philippe|last8=DelBello|first8=Melissa P.|last9=Duffy|first9=Anne C.|last10=Hillegers|first10=Manon H.

A naturalistic study in 2003 by [[Mauricio Tohen|Tohen and coworkers]] from the first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. Within two years, 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status).

There are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings. Prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity. In addition, diagnoses (and therefore estimates of prevalence) vary depending on whether a categorical or [[spectrum approach]] is used. This consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Phelps J |title=Bipolar Disorder: Particle or Wave?

===Creativity===
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness#Bipolar disorder}}
A link between mental illness and professional success or creativity has been suggested, including in accounts by [[Socrates]], [[Seneca the Younger]], and [[Cesare Lombroso]]. Despite prominence in popular culture, the link between creativity and bipolar has not been rigorously studied. This area of study also is likely affected by [[confirmation bias]]. Some evidence suggests that some heritable component of bipolar disorder overlaps with heritable components of creativity. [[Proband]]s of people with bipolar disorder are more likely to be professionally successful, as well as to demonstrate temperamental traits similar to bipolar disorder. Furthermore, while studies of the frequency of bipolar disorder in creative population samples have been conflicting, full-blown bipolar disorder in creative samples is rare.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Akiskal |first1=Hagop |last2=Akiskal |first2=Kareen |editor1-last=Lakshmi |editor1-first=Yatham | name-list-style = vanc |title=Bipolar Disorder: Clinical and Neurobiological Foundations |pages=83–89 |publisher=Wiley |chapter=The Genius-Insanity Debate: Focus on Bipolarity, Temperament, Creativity and Leadership|doi=10.1002/9780470661277.ch9 |isbn = 9780470661277|year=2010 }}</ref>

==Research==
Research directions for bipolar disorder in children include optimizing treatments, increasing the knowledge of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the pediatric disorder and improving diagnostic criteria.<ref name=Lei2008 /> Some treatment research suggests that [[psychosocial]] interventions that involve the family, psychoeducation, and skills building (through therapies such as [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]], [[Dialectical behavior therapy|DBT]], and [[Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy|IPSRT]]) can benefit in addition to pharmocotherapy.<ref name="Fristad">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fristad MA, MacPherson HA | title = Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for child and adolescent bipolar spectrum disorders | journal = Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 339–355 |year = 2014 | pmid = 23927375 | pmc = 3844106 | doi = 10.1080/15374416.2013.822309 }}</ref>
