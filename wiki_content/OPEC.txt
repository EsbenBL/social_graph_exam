The '''Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries''' ('''OPEC''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|p|ɛ|k}} {{respell|OH|pek}}) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] or [[cartel]] of {{As of|2021|July|alt=13|lc=y|since=y|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm}} countries. Founded on 14 September 1960 in [[Baghdad]] by the first five members ([[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Venezuela]]), it has since 1965 been headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], although Austria is not an OPEC member state. {{As of|September 2018}}, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of [[List of countries by oil production|global oil production]] and 81.5 percent of [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|the world's "proven" oil reserves]], giving OPEC a major influence on [[Price of oil|global oil prices]] that were previously determined by the so-called "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]" grouping of multinational oil companies. 

The stated mission of the organization is to "coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular [[Energy supply|supply]] of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/23.htm |title=Our Mission |work=OPEC |access-date=16 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211030346/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/23.htm |archive-date=11 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce [[Competition (economics)|market competition]], but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of [[State immunity|state immunity under international law]]. The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market. 

The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward [[Nationalization of oil supplies|national sovereignty over natural resources]], and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and [[Petroleum politics|international relations]]. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or [[civil disorder]]s lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, [[1970s energy crisis|restrictions in oil production]] led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the [[World economy|global economy]]. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting [[Production quota|production targets]] for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.

{{As of|2018|June|alt=The current OPEC members are the following|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm|post=:}} [[Algeria]], [[Angola]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Venezuela]].

==History and impact==
===Post-WWII situation===
In 1949, [[United States of Venezuela|Venezuela]] and [[Pahlavi Iran|Iran]] took the earliest steps in the direction of OPEC, by inviting [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] to improve communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from [[World War&nbsp;II]].<ref name="open">{{Cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/GenInfo.pdf |title=General Information |date=May 2012 |work=OPEC |access-date=13 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413233306/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/GenInfo.pdf |archive-date=13 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the time, some of the world's largest [[List of oil fields|oil fields]] were just entering production in the Middle East. The United States had established the [[Interstate Oil Compact Commission]] to join the [[Texas Railroad Commission]] in limiting overproduction. The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; and the world market was dominated by a group of [[multinational companies]] known as the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s original [[Standard Oil]] monopoly. Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and [[economic power]].<ref name="prize" />

===1959–1960 anger from exporting countries===
In February 1959, as new supplies were becoming available, the multinational oil companies (MOCs) unilaterally reduced their posted prices for Venezuelan and Middle Eastern crude oil by 10 percent. Weeks later, the [[Arab League]]'s first [[Arab Petroleum Congress]] convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist [[Wanda Jablonski]] introduced Saudi Arabia's [[Abdullah Tariki]] to Venezuela's observer [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo]], representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union. Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an "Oil Consultation Commission" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against "[[absentee landlord]]ism" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil.<ref name="open"/><ref name="prize">{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |author-link=Daniel Yergin |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1991 |isbn=978-0671502485 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/prize00dani/page/499 499–503] |title-link=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Painter |first=David S. |year=2012 |title=Oil and the American Century |journal=[[The Journal of American History]] |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=24–39 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jas073 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&pg=PA7 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry |first=M.S. |last=Vassiliou |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0810862883 |page=7}}</ref>

The following month, during 10–14 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, Pérez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], whose country had skipped the 1959 congress.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U_sWfvgToQC&pg=PA74 |last=Styan |first=David |title=France and Iraq: Oil, Arms and French Policy Making in the Middle East |publisher=I.B.

In 1971, an accord was signed between major oil companies and members of OPEC doing business in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] region, called the ''Tripoli Agreement''.  The agreement, signed on 2 April 1971, raised oil prices and increased producing countries' profit shares.<ref name="OPEC_1971_Tripoli_Agreement">[[Marius Vassiliou]] (2009).

The 1973–1974, oil embargo had lasting effects on the United States and other industrialized nations, which established the [[International Energy Agency]] in response, as well as national [[Global strategic petroleum reserves|emergency stockpiles]] designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil [[Energy conservation|conservation]] efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] cars and appliances, year-round [[daylight saving time]], reduced usage of [[HVAC|heating and air-conditioning]], better [[building insulation]], increased support of [[mass transit]], and greater emphasis on [[coal]], [[natural gas]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and other [[alternative energy]] sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption rose only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while [[real GDP]] rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil could be used as both a political and economic weapon against other nations, at least in the short term.<ref name="Maugeri2006"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/energy-crisis |title=Energy Crisis (1970s) |publisher=[[The History Channel]] |year=2010 |access-date=25 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624152753/http://www.history.com/topics/energy-crisis |archive-date=24 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.envirothonpa.org/documents/The1973OilCrisis.pdf |title=The 1973 Oil Crisis |publisher=Pennsylvania Envirothon |first=Sarah |last=Horton |date=October 2000 |access-date=16 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711030710/http://www.envirothonpa.org/documents/The1973OilCrisis.pdf |archive-date=11 July 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.socialismtoday.org/51/opec.html |title=Oil Shock: The role of OPEC |journal=Socialism Today |issue=51 |date=October 2000 |access-date=30 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216024014/http://www.socialismtoday.org/51/opec.html |archive-date=16 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/twilight-the-petrostate-16235?page=show |title=Twilight of the Petrostate |first1=Petr |last1=Aven |first2=Vladimir |last2=Nazarov |first3=Samvel |last3=Lazaryan |journal=The National Interest |date=17 May 2016 |access-date=2 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522201053/http://nationalinterest.org/feature/twilight-the-petrostate-16235?page=show |archive-date=22 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The embargo also meant that a section of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] saw power as a source of hope for their [[developing countries]]. The Algerian president [[Houari Boumédiène]] expressed this hope in a speech at the UN's sixth Special Session, in April 1974:

{{quote|The OPEC action is really the first illustration and at the same time the most concrete and most spectacular illustration of the importance of raw material prices for our countries, the vital need for the producing countries to operate the levers of price control, and lastly, the great possibilities of a union of raw material producing countries.

===1975 hostage siege===

{{Main|OPEC siege}}
On 21 December 1975, Saudi Arabia's [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]], Iran's [[Jamshid Amuzegar]], and the other OPEC oil ministers were taken hostage at their semi-annual conference in [[Vienna, Austria]]. The attack, which killed three non-ministers, was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan militant "[[Carlos the Jackal]]", and which included [[Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann]] and [[Hans-Joachim Klein]]. The self-named "Arm of the Arab Revolution" group declared its goal to be the liberation of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and hold for ransom all eleven attending oil ministers, except for Yamani and Amuzegar who were to be executed.<ref name=jackal/>

Carlos arranged bus and plane travel for his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]], planning to fly eventually to [[Baghdad]], where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian president [[Houari Boumédienne]], who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.<ref name=jackal/>

Some time after the attack, Carlos's accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by [[Wadie Haddad]], a founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of Libya, itself an OPEC member. Fellow militants [[Bassam Abu Sharif]] and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between 20&nbsp;million and US$50&nbsp;million from "an Arab president". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was "diverted en route and lost by the Revolution".<ref name=jackal>{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/jackal/12.html |title=Carlos the Jackal: Trail of Terror |publisher=truTV |first=Patrick |last=Bellamy |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107125703/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/jackal/12.html |archive-date=7 January 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t5jtM2faD8C&pg=PA102 |title=Jackal: The Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal |first=John |last=Follain |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=978-1559704663 |page=102 |access-date=13 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503194550/https://books.google.com/books?id=3t5jtM2faD8C&pg=PA102 |archive-date=3 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was finally captured in 1994 and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/carlos-the-jackal-jailed-over-1974-paris-grenade-attack-10816476 |title='Carlos the Jackal' jailed over 1974 Paris grenade attack |first=Gary |last=Anderson |publisher=Sky News |date=28 March 2017 |access-date=22 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328141244/http://news.sky.com/story/carlos-the-jackal-jailed-over-1974-paris-grenade-attack-10816476 |archive-date=28 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Widespread insurgency and sabotage occurred during the 2003–2008 height of the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)#Sabotage|American occupation of Iraq]], coinciding with rapidly increasing oil demand from [[China]] and [[Commodity market|commodity]]-hungry investors, recurring [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|violence against the Nigerian oil industry]], and dwindling spare capacity as a cushion against [[Peak oil|potential shortages]].

On 10 September 2008, with oil prices still near US$100/bbl, a production dispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of a negotiating session where rival members voted to reduce OPEC output. Although Saudi delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that they would not observe them. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted one such delegate as saying: "Saudi Arabia will meet the market's demand. We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil.

During 2014–2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, US oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading "[[swing producer]]" volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial long-term improvement and spread of [[tight oil|shale]] "[[fracking]]" technology in response to the years of record oil prices. These developments led in turn to a plunge in US oil import requirements (moving closer to [[U.S. energy independence|energy independence]]), a record volume of worldwide oil inventories, and a collapse in oil prices that continued into early 2016.<ref name=basketprice/><ref>{{cite news |title=US Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=3 November 2014 |access-date=13 December 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216205651/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |archive-date=16 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=glut/>

In spite of global oversupply, on 27 November 2014 in Vienna, Saudi oil minister [[Ali Al-Naimi]] blocked appeals from poorer OPEC members for production cuts to support prices. Naimi argued that the oil market should be left to rebalance itself competitively at lower price levels, strategically rebuilding OPEC's long-term market share by ending the profitability of high-cost US shale oil production.<ref name=PriceWar>{{cite news |title=Inside OPEC room, Naimi declares price war on US shale oil |work=Reuters |date=28 November 2014 |access-date=13 January 2016 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-opec-meeting-idUKKCN0JB0M420141128 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211162226/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-opec-meeting-idUKKCN0JB0M420141128 |archive-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> As he explained in an interview:<ref name=MEES>{{cite journal |url=http://oilpro.com/post/9223/mees-interview-saudi-oil-minister-ali-naimi |title=Interview With Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi |journal=[[Middle East Economic Survey]] |volume=57 |issue=51/52 |date=22 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221021005/http://oilpro.com/post/9223/mees-interview-saudi-oil-minister-ali-naimi |archive-date=21 December 2015 }}</ref>

<blockquote>Is it reasonable for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while the producer of poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We want to tell the world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [roughly US$60/bbl] do not support all producers.</blockquote>

A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the organization had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2&nbsp;million barrels per day despite [[Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|war-torn Libya]] pumping 1&nbsp;million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as $40, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions]], hundreds of world leaders at the [[Paris Climate Agreement]] were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and [[Solar power#Economics|solar technologies]] were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016.<ref name=FT2015>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1f84e444-9ceb-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74.html |title=OPEC discord fuels further oil price drop |newspaper=Financial Times |date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |first1=Grant |last1=Smith |first2=Angelina |last2=Rascouet |first3=Wael |last3=Mahdi |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328111428/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |archive-date=28 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |title=Country Analysis Brief: Libya |publisher=US Energy Information Administration |date=19 November 2015 |access-date=22 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223160212/http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |archive-date=23 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |title=Despite Climate Concerns, OPEC Plans to Keep Pumping Oil While It Can |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 December 2015 |access-date=11 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128123133/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |archive-date=28 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&menu=yes |title=OPEC ceiling falls in |publisher=Argus Media |date=7 December 2015 |access-date=7 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208105422/http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&menu=yes |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |title=Iran Says Post-Sanctions Crude Output Boost Won't Hurt Prices |first1=Hashem |last1=Kalantari |first2=Mohammed |last2=Sergie |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2 January 2016 |access-date=18 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115230602/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |archive-date=15 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.<ref name=basketprice>{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |title=OPEC Basket Daily Archives |work=OPEC |access-date=21 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121231540/http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |archive-date=21 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2017–2020 production cut and OPEC+===
As OPEC members grew weary of a multi-year supply-contest with [[diminishing returns]] and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1&nbsp;million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, [[#Spare capacity|spare capacity]], and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another "temporary suspension" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then.<ref name=LeavingAgain/><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts | title= OPEC Agrees to Cut Production in Drive to End Record Glut | publisher= Bloomberg News | date= 30 November 2016 |access-date= 30 November 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020159/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts |archive-date= 1 December 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |title= OPEC 171st Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=30 November 2016 |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015438/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |title=The World's Biggest Oil Kingdom Reverses Course |first=Javier |last=Blas |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406180755/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |archive-date=6 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |title=OPEC agrees on need for output cut |first=Neil |last=Hume |newspaper=Financial Times |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928201057/https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |archive-date=28 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |title=Russian Energy Minister Says Oil Cuts to Start in January |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=11 December 2016 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213115632/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |archive-date=13 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=May2017Vienna/> Longtime oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] "described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |title=OPEC Said to Break Bread With Shale in Rare Show of Detente |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=7 March 2017 |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307220233/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to as ''OPEC+''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where OPEC+ Oil Production Stands Now – Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/opec-production-targets/ |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=OPEC Is Dead, Long Live OPEC+ |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2018/06/29/opec-is-dead-long-live-opec/#5abfd30b2217 |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

===2020 Saudi-Russian price war===
{{main|2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war}}
In early March 2020, OPEC officials presented an ultimatum to Russia to cut production by 1.5% of world supply. Russia, which foresaw continuing cuts as American [[shale oil]] production increased, rejected the demand, ending the three-year partnership between OPEC and major non-OPEC providers.<ref name=NYT_9March2020>{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Stanley |title=How a Saudi-Russian Standoff Sent Oil Markets into a Frenzy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/business/energy-environment/oil-opec-saudi-russia.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=9 March 2020 |date=9 March 2020}}</ref> Another factor was [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|weakening global demand]] resulting from the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mufson |first1=Steven |last2=Englund |first2=Will |title=Oil price war threatens widespread collateral damage |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/oil-price-war-threatens-widespread-collateral-damage/2020/03/09/3e42c9e2-6207-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html |website=The Washington Post |access-date=9 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> This also resulted in 'OPEC plus' failing to extend the agreement cutting 2.1&nbsp;million barrels per day that was set to expire at the end of March. Saudi Arabia, which has absorbed a disproportionate amount of the cuts to convince Russia to stay in the agreement, notified its buyers on 7 March that they would raise output and discount their oil in April. This prompted a Brent crude price crash of more than 30% before a slight recovery and [[Black Monday (2020)|widespread turmoil in financial markets]].<ref name=NYT_9March2020/>

In April 2020, OPEC and a group of other oil producers, including [[Russia]], agreed to extend production cuts until the end of July.

For countries that export petroleum at relatively low volume, their limited negotiating power as OPEC members would not necessarily justify the burdens imposed by OPEC [[production quota]]s and membership costs. [[Ecuador]] withdrew from OPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota at the time.<ref name=Ecuador/> Ecuador then rejoined in October 2007 before leaving again in January 2020.<ref name="eqrleave">{{cite web

The OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organization, and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries. The chief executive of the organization is the [[List of Secretaries General of OPEC|OPEC Secretary General]]. The Conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary. It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and "one member, one vote", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget.<ref name=statute>{{cite web |work=OPEC |title=Statute |year=2012 |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/OPEC_Statute.pdf |access-date=12 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021084736/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/OPEC_Statute.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional [[swing producer]] to balance the global market, it serves as "OPEC's de facto leader".<ref name=FT2015/>

===International cartel===
At various times, OPEC members have displayed apparent anti-competitive [[cartel]] behavior through the organization's agreements about oil production and price levels.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-P/WP318.pdf |title=Is OPEC a Cartel?

{{quote|International commodity agreements covering products such as coffee, sugar, tin and more recently oil (OPEC: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) are examples of ''international cartels'' which have publicly entailed agreements between different national governments.}}

OPEC members strongly prefer to describe their organization as a modest force for market stabilization, rather than a powerful anti-competitive cartel. In its defense, the organization was founded as a counterweight against the previous "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]" cartel of multinational oil companies, and non-OPEC energy suppliers have maintained enough market share for a substantial degree of worldwide competition.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/OB06_072012.pdf |title=The Global Energy Scene |journal=OPEC Bulletin |volume=43 |number=5 |date=June–July 2012 |pages=24–41 |access-date=9 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909221208/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/OB06_072012.pdf |archive-date=9 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Moreover, because of an economic "[[prisoner's dilemma]]" that encourages each member nation individually to discount its price and exceed its production quota,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.wiley.com/college/browning/0471389161/pdf/ |chapter-url=http://www.wiley.com/college/browning/0471389161/pdf/ch14 |chapter=The Prisoner's Dilemma and Cheating by Cartel Members |title=Microeconomics: Theory & Applications |edition=8th |first1=Edgar K. |last1=Browning |first2=Mark A. |last2=Zupan |publisher=Wiley |date=2004 |access-date=5 September 2016 |isbn=978-0471678717 |pages=394–396 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915032256/http://www.wiley.com/college/browning/0471389161/pdf/ |archive-date=15 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> widespread cheating within OPEC often erodes its ability to influence global oil prices through [[Collective action problem|collective action]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Colgan |first=Jeff |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/06/16/opec-the-phantom-menace/ |title=OPEC, the Phantom Menace |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=16 June 2014 |access-date=9 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110043953/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/06/16/opec-the-phantom-menace/ |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Van de Graaf |first=Thijs |title=Is OPEC dead?

OPEC often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances.<ref name=MEES/><ref name=discordant/> Indeed, over the course of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the "[[Resource curse#Political effects|natural resource curse]]".<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/198/40112.html |title=Lifting the Natural Resource Curse |first=Thomas I. |last=Palley |journal=[[Foreign Service Journal]] |date=December 2003 |access-date=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520023419/https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/198/40112.html |archive-date=20 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Michael L. |date=May 2015 |title=What Have We Learned about the Resource Curse? |journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]] |volume=18 |pages=239–259 |doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-052213-040359 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt8tp5x1hb/qt8tp5x1hb.pdf?t=qay04b |doi-access=free }}</ref> A further complication is that [[Religious war|religion-linked]] [[List of conflicts in the Middle East|conflicts in the Middle East]] are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-middle-easts-conflicts-are-about-religion-15205?page=show |title=The Middle East's Conflicts Are About Religion |first=Oren |last=Kessler |journal=The National Interest |date=13 February 2016 |access-date=17 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326124531/http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-middle-easts-conflicts-are-about-religion-15205?page=show |archive-date=26 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/defending-the-faith-in-the-middle-east.html |title='Defending the Faith' in the Middle East |first=David |last=Motadel |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 May 2015 |access-date=17 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908005002/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/defending-the-faith-in-the-middle-east.html |archive-date=8 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the [[Six-Day War]] (1967), [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973), a [[OPEC siege|hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants]] (1975), the [[Iranian Revolution]] (1979), [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988), [[Gulf War|Iraqi occupation of Kuwait]] (1990–1991), [[September 11 attacks]] by mostly Saudi hijackers (2001), [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|American occupation of Iraq]] (2003–2011), [[Conflict in the Niger Delta]] (2004–present), [[Arab Spring]] (2010–2012), [[Libyan Crisis]] (2011–present), and international [[Embargo against Iran]] (2012–2016).

==Market information==
As one area in which OPEC members have been able to cooperate productively over the decades, the organization has significantly improved the quality and quantity of information available about the international oil market. This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.

===Publications and research===
[[File:Jodi-circle-logo.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Logo for [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative|JODI]], in which OPEC is a founding member.]]
In April 2001, OPEC collaborated with five other international organizations ([[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Eurostat]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], {{interlanguage link|Latin American Energy Organization|es|Organización Latinoamericana de Energía|lt=OLADE}}, [[United Nations Statistics Division|UNSD]]) to improve the availability and reliability of oil data. They launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 was joined by [[International Energy Forum|IEF]] and renamed the [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative]] (JODI), covering more than 90% of the global oil market. [[Gas Exporting Countries Forum|GECF]] joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global market for natural gas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jodidata.org/about-jodi/history.aspx |title=History of the Joint Organisations Data Initiative |work=JODI |access-date=23 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012051500/https://www.jodidata.org/about-jodi/history.aspx |archive-date=12 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Crude oil benchmarks===
{{See also|Benchmark (crude oil)}}
[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumb|alt=refer to caption|[[Sulfur]] content and [[API gravity]] of different types of crude oil.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Brent shown as sweeter than WTI, yet most sources claim the opposite. That and other claims in image probably need checking and sourcing. Example: http://www.petroleum.co.uk/benchmarks}}]]
A "crude oil benchmark" is a standardized [[Petroleum#Classification|petroleum]] product that serves as a convenient reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil, including standardized contracts in major [[futures markets]] since 1983. Benchmarks are used because oil prices differ (usually by a few dollars per barrel) based on variety, grade, delivery date and location, and other legal requirements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/904748.stm |title=Oil markets explained |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2007 |access-date=6 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913114404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/904748.stm |archive-date=13 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603911468739482147/pdf/multi-page.pdf |title=The new era of petroleum trading: spot-oil, spot-related contracts, and futures markets |first=Hossein |last=Razavi |publisher=The World Bank |date=April 1989 |isbn=978-0-8213-1199-8 |pages=65–69 |access-date=4 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205095734/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603911468739482147/pdf/multi-page.pdf |archive-date=5 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[OPEC Reference Basket|OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes]] has been an important benchmark for oil prices since 2000. It is calculated as a [[weighted average]] of prices for petroleum blends from the OPEC member countries: Saharan Blend (Algeria), Girassol (Angola), Djeno (Republic of the Congo)<!--New Zafiro? (Equatorial Guinea),--> Rabi Light (Gabon), Iran Heavy (Islamic Republic of Iran), Basra Light (Iraq), Kuwait Export (Kuwait), Es Sider (Libya), Bonny Light (Nigeria), Arab Light (Saudi Arabia), Murban (UAE), and Merey (Venezuela).<ref name=basket>{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/40.htm |title=OPEC Basket Price |work=OPEC |access-date=4 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501131417/https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/40.htm |archive-date=1 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Brent Crude|North Sea Brent Crude Oil]] is the leading [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for Atlantic basin crude oils, and is used to price approximately two-thirds of the world's traded crude oil. Other well-known benchmarks are [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI), [[Dubai Crude]], [[DME Oman Crude Oil Futures Contract|Oman Crude]], and [[Urals oil]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/8429184/Brent-crude-and-other-oil-price-benchmarks.html |title=Brent crude and other oil price benchmarks |agency=Reuters |date=5 April 2011 |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925075958/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/8429184/Brent-crude-and-other-oil-price-benchmarks.html |archive-date=25 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Spare capacity===
The US Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the [[US Department of Energy]], defines spare capacity for crude oil market management "as the volume of production that can be brought on within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days&nbsp;... OPEC spare capacity provides an indicator of the world oil market's ability to respond to potential crises that reduce oil supplies."<ref name="EIA_2014" />

In November 2014, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that OPEC's "effective" spare capacity, adjusted for ongoing disruptions in countries like Libya and Nigeria, was {{convert|3.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} and that this number would increase to a peak in 2017 of {{convert|4.6|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Effective' OPEC Spare Capacity: Reality-Based Data |url=http://www.iea.org/media/ieajournal/Issue7_WEB.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502040956/http://www.iea.org/media/ieajournal/Issue7_WEB.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=IEA Energy |issue=7 |page=13 |date=November 2014 |archive-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> By November 2015, the IEA changed its assessment{{how much|date=March 2020}} "with OPEC's spare production buffer stretched thin, as Saudi Arabia – which holds the lion's share of excess capacity – and its [Persian] Gulf neighbours pump at near-record rates."<ref>{{cite journal |title=3 billion barrel cushion |journal=Oil Market Report |url=https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/reports/2015/1115/ |date=13 November 2015 |access-date=15 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222164633/https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/reports/2015/1115/ |archive-date=22 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>
