'''Jane Jebb Mansbridge''' (born November 19, 1939) is an American [[political scientist]]. She is the Charles F. Adams [[Professor]] of Political Leadership and Democratic Values in the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].

In April 2018, Mansbridge was announced to be the 24th laureate of the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]].

==Early life and education==
Mansbridge received her B.A. from [[Wellesley College]] in 1961, her M.A. in [[history]] from [[Harvard]] in 1966, and her Ph.D. in government from [[Harvard]] in 1971.

==Career==
Mansbridge previously taught at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Northwestern University]].

Mansbridge is particularly known for the distinction between unitary and adversary democracy (based on common and conflicting interests respectively), and for her concepts of gyroscopic representation (based on inner motivation), the selection model of representation, and surrogate representation (representation of others outside one's district).<ref name="dovi" /> She is currently working on the necessity for legitimate coercion created by our need for "free use" (or "free access") goods.<ref name="whatis" />
