'''George Joseph Stigler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɪ|g|l|ər}}; January 17, 1911 – December 1, 1991) was an American [[economist]], the 1982 laureate in [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] and a key leader of the [[Chicago School of Economics]].

== Early life and education ==
Stigler was born in [[Seattle, Washington]], the son of Elsie Elizabeth (Hungler) and Joseph Stigler.<ref>{{cite book |author1=National Academy of Sciences |author2=Office of the Home Secretary |title=Biographical Memoirs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4D-OIyTLoO0C&pg=PA342 |date=1 May 1999 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-06434-7 |pages=342–}}</ref> He was of German descent and spoke [[German language|German]] in his childhood.<ref>{{citation |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Sowell |title=Migrations and Cultures: A World View |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |place=[[New York City|New York]] |year=1996 |page=82 |isbn=978-0465045891 |quote=...it may be indicative of how long German cultural ties endured [in the United States] that the German language was spoken in childhood by such disparate twentieth-century American figures as famed writer [[H. L. Mencken]], baseball stars [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]], and by the Nobel Prize-winning economist George Stigler.}}</ref> He graduated from the [[University of Washington]] in 1931 with a BA and then spent a year at [[Northwestern University]] from which he obtained his MBA in 1932. It was during his studies at Northwestern that Stigler developed an interest in economics and decided on an academic career.<ref name="Friedman" />

== Career ==
After he received a tuition scholarship from the [[University of Chicago]], Stigler enrolled there in 1933 to study economics and went on to earn his [[Ph.D.]] in economics there in 1938. He taught at [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] from 1936 to 1938. He spent much of [[World War II]] at [[Columbia University]], performing mathematical and statistical research for the [[Manhattan Project]]. He then spent one year at [[Brown University]]. He served on the Columbia faculty from 1947 to 1958.

At Chicago, he was greatly influenced by [[Frank Knight]], his dissertation supervisor. [[Milton Friedman]], a friend for over 60 years, commented that it was remarkable for Stigler to have passed his dissertation under Knight, as only three or four students had ever managed to do so in Knight's 28 years at Chicago. Stigler's influences included [[Jacob Viner]] and [[Henry Calvert Simons|Henry Simons]] as well as students [[W. Allen Wallis]] and Friedman.

Stigler is best known for developing the ''Economic Theory of Regulation'', also known as [[regulatory capture|capture]], which says that interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them. This theory is a component of the [[public choice]] field of economics but is also deeply opposed by public choice scholars belonging to the "Virginia School," such as Charles Rowley.<ref>[[Filip Palda|Palda, Filip]]. A Better Kind of Violence: The Chicago School of Political Economy, Public Choice, and the Quest for and Ultimate Theory of Power. Cooper-Wolfling Press. 2016.</ref> He also carried out extensive research in the [[history of economic thought]].

Stigler's most important contribution to economics was published in his landmark article, "The Economics of Information."<ref>George J. Stigler (1961). "The Economics of Information," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 69(3), pp. [http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/waldfogj/987/readings/stigler.pdf 213–25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621165108/http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/waldfogj/987/readings/stigler.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}.</ref> According to Friedman, Stigler "essentially created a new area of study for economists." Stigler stressed the importance of information: "One should hardly have to tell academicians that information is a valuable resource: knowledge is power. And yet it occupies a slum dwelling in the town of economics."<ref name="Friedman">Milton Friedman (1992). [http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/gstigler.html "George Joseph Stigler January 17, 1911 – December 1, 1991,"] ''Biographical Memoirs''. National Academy of Sciences.</ref>

His 1962 article "Information in the Labor Market" developed the theory of [[frictional unemployment|search unemployment]].<ref>George J. Stigler (1962a). "Information in the Labor Market." ''Journal of Political Economy'', 70(5), Part 2,  Oct., pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1829106 94]–105.</ref> In 1963 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.</ref>

He was known for his sharp sense of humor, and he wrote a number of spoof essays. In his book ''The Intellectual and the Marketplace'', for instance, he proposed ''Stigler's Law of Demand and Supply Elasticities'': "all demand curves are [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] and all supply curves are inelastic too." The essay referenced studies that found many goods and services to be [[inelastic]] over the long run and offered a supposed theoretical proof; he ended by announcing that his next essay would demonstrate that the price system does not exist.

Another essay, "A Sketch on the Truth in Teaching," described the consequences of a (fictional) set of court decisions that held universities legally responsible for the consequences of teaching errors.<ref>George J. Stigler, 1973. "A Sketch of the History of Truth in Teaching," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 81(2, Part 1), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1830533 pp. 491]–95.</ref> The [[Stigler diet]] is also named after him.

Stigler wrote numerous articles on the history of economics, published in the leading journals and republished 14 of them in 1965. The ''American Economic Review'' said, "many of these essays have become such well-known landmarks that no scholar in this field should be unfamiliar with them... The lucid prose, penetrating logic, and wry humor... have become the author's trademarks."<ref>Thomas Sowell, review in ''American Economic Review'' (June, 1965)  p. 552</ref><ref>George J. Stigler, ''Essays in the history of economics'' (U. of Chicago Press, 1965)</ref>

Stigler was a founding member of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] and was its president from 1976 to 1978. He was a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]/[[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Rise, Decline, and Reemergence of Classical Liberalism {{!}} Belmont University {{!}} Nashville, TN|url=https://www.belmont.edu/lockesmith/liberalism_essay/the_decline.html|access-date=2021-05-26|website=www.belmont.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=STIGLER, GEORGE J.
