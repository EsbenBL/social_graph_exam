Waltz was one of the original founders of [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], or structural realism, in [[international relations theory]] and later became associated with the school of [[defensive realism|defensive neorealism]].

==Early life, education, and military service==
Waltz was born on June 8, 1924, in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/> He grew up and attended high school there. He then attended [[Oberlin College]], where he started out majoring in mathematics.<ref name="conv-background"/>  That was interrupted to serve in the [[Army of the United States]] from 1944 to 1946 during World War II,<ref name="whos-84">{{cite book | title=Who's Who in America 1984–1985 Volume 2 | edition=43rd | publisher=[[Marquis Who's Who]] | location=Chicago | year=1984 | page=3394}}</ref> when he rose in rank from private to first lieutenant. Waltz served in the Pacific theater of the war and was stationed in Japan during the U.S. occupation of Japan.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Waltz|first1=Kenneth|last2=Fearon|first2=James|date=2012-06-15|title=A Conversation with Kenneth Waltz|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-020511-174136|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-020511-174136|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref>

He graduated from Oberlin with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree in 1948,<ref name="whos-84" /> having switched his major to economics.<ref name="conv-background" /> He was a [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref name="whos-84" /> and also named an Amos Miller Scholar.

In 1949, he married Helen Elizabeth Lindsley,<ref name="whos-84" /> known as "Huddie". They had three children together.<ref name="whos-84" /> After attending [[Columbia University]] to obtain an upper graduate degree in economics, he switched to political science because [[political philosophy]] was more interesting to him.<ref name="conv-background">{{cite web|title=Theory and International Politics: Conversation with Kenneth N.

Returning to Columbia, he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] under [[William T. R. Fox]] in 1954.<ref name="whos-84" /> During his PhD studies, Waltz was most interested in political theory, but gravitated towards international relations due to the academic job market and the pressure of his dissertation advisor.<ref name=":0" /> While preparing for his comprehensive exams, Waltz came up with the ideas that would ultimately become his dissertation and his 1959 book ''Man, the State and War''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="nyt-obit" />

==Academic career==
Waltz became a lecturer and then assistant professor at Columbia from 1953 to 1957.<ref name="whos-84"/> He became one of the early group of scholars at Columbia's [[Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies|Institute of War and Peace Studies]] and acted as a [[research assistant]] from 1952 to 1954 and a [[research associate]] from 1954. Later saying that he and his wife had been unsettled by the prospect of raising small children in New York City,<ref name="cu-award"/> Waltz left Columbia for [[Swarthmore College]], where he was an assistant professor and then a professor from 1957 to 1966.<ref name="whos-84"/> He then moved on to [[Brandeis University]] for a stint from 1966 to 1971, the last four years of which he held the [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai E. Stevenson]] Professor of International Politics chair.<ref name="whos-84"/>

In 1971, Waltz joined [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was appointed the Ford Professor of Political Science.<ref name="whos-84"/> Meanwhile, Waltz held a number of additional research positions. He was affiliated with the Institute of War and Peace Studies until 1964. He was a fellow of Columbia University in Political Theory and International Relations from 1959 to 1960 in London. He was a research associate at [[Center for International Affairs]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1963 to 1964, 1968, 1969, and 1972. He held a [[National Science Foundation]] grant from 1968 to 1971<ref name="whos-84" /> to develop a theory of international politics. He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] for 1976 to 1977<ref name="whos-84" /> and a fellow at the Institute for the Study of World Politics in 1977. He was a fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in 1979–1980.<ref name="whos-84" /> He then became a research associate with the [[Department of War Studies, King's College London]].<ref name="siwps" /> Waltz taught at [[Peking University]] for two months in 1982,<ref name="whos-84" /> and he later taught at [[Fudan University]] as well.<ref name="siwps" /> He lectured at a number of institutions in the US, including the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]],<ref name="siwps" /> the [[National War College]], the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], and the [[Naval War College]]. Similarly, he lectured at many other institutions around the world, including the [[London School of Economics]], the [[Australian National University]], and the [[University of Bologna]].<ref name="siwps" />

Waltz retired from his position at Berkeley and returned to Columbia University in 1997.<ref name="siwps"/><ref name="cu-award"/> There, he became an [[Professors in the United States#Adjunct professor|adjunct professor]] as well as a senior research scholar at the Institute of War and Peace Studies.<ref name="siwps"/>

Waltz served as Secretary of the [[American Political Science Association]] in 1966 to 1967<ref name="whos-84"/> and then as its president in 1987 to 1988.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> He was President of the New England Section of the [[International Studies Association]] in 1966 to 1967.<ref name="whos-84"/> He was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]<ref name="whos-84"/> and served stints on the boards of editors of several scholarly journals{{which|date=February 2017}}. He has described [[Hans Morgenthau]] as a strong influence on his work.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schouten|first=Peer|title=Theory Talk #40 - Kenneth Waltz|url=http://www.theory-talks.org/2011/06/theory-talk-40.html|access-date=2021-08-10}}</ref>

===Levels of analysis===
Waltz's initial contribution to the field of international relations was his influential 1959 book, ''[[Man, the State, and War]]''.<ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Dan|date=2015|title=Should We Leave Behind the Subfield of International Relations?|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-053013-041156|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=481–499|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-053013-041156|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref> It classified theories of the causes of war into three categories, or levels of analysis.<ref name="cu-award"/><ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=120|language=en}}</ref> He referred to those levels of analysis as "images" and used the writings of one or more classic political philosophers to outline the major points of each image. Each image was given two chapters: the first used the classical philosopher's writings mainly to describe what that image says about the cause of war, and the second usually had Waltz analyze the strengths and weaknesses of that image. Waltz's wife was essential in contributing the research that became the basis for the book.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XL5ICQAAQBAJ&q=kenneth+waltz+images+wife&pg=PA32|title=Kenneth Waltz's Life and Thought. An Interview|last=Beyer|first=Anna Cornelia|date=2015-02-04|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-312-88970-5|language=en}}</ref>

The first image argued that wars are often caused by the nature of particular statesmen and political leaders such as state leaders, like [[Napoleon]], or by human nature more generally. That is basically consistent with [[classical realism (international relations)|classical realism]], which then dominated the international relations discipline, but Waltz would contest it more fully in his next book, [[Theory of International Politics|''Theory of International Politics''.]]

Theories of war that fall under the rubric of Waltz's second image contended that wars are caused by the domestic makeup of states. A prime example that Waltz referred to is [[Lenin]]'s theory of [[imperialism]], which posits that the main cause of war is rooted in the need for capitalist states to continue opening up new markets in order to perpetuate their economic system at home. Today, a more familiar example in the Western world is the notion that nondemocratic states, because of their internal composition, start wars.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Waltz next assessed the first two images as being less influential in general than the third image but as ultimately necessary in understanding the causes of war. The third image posits that the cause of war is found at the systemic level and the anarchic structure of the international system is the root cause of war. In that context, "[[anarchy (international relations)|anarchy]]" was defined not as a condition of chaos or disorder but one in which no sovereign body governs the interactions between autonomous nation-states. In other words, in domestic society, citizens can theoretically rely on law enforcement agencies to protect their persons and property, but if a state is invaded and calls "[[9-1-1]]," it cannot be sure that anyone will answer.

Similarly, when two citizens have a dispute, they can appeal to the courts to render a verdict and, more importantly, the law enforcement agencies to enforce the court's ruling, there is no body above nation-states that can establish rules or laws for all the states, decide how they apply in specific cases, and compel the states to honor the court's ruling. As a result, if an issue at stake is important enough to a state, it can achieve a satisfactory outcome only by using its power to impose its will on another state(s). The realization that any state can resort to armed force anytime forces each state to be always prepared for that contingency.

Those themes were fleshed out more fully in ''Theory of International Politics'', which, as the title suggests, explained a theory for international politics as a whole, rather than the narrower focus on what causes war.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Neorealism===
{{Main|Neorealism (international relations)}}
{{International relations theory sidebar}}
Waltz's key contribution to the realm of political science is in the creation of neorealism (or ''structural realism'', as he calls it), a theory of international relations that posits that the interaction of [[sovereign states]] can be explained by the pressures exerted on them by the anarchic structure of the international system, which limits and constrains their choices. Neorealism thus aims to explain recurring patterns in international relations, such as why [[History of Sparta|relations between Sparta and Athens]] resembled those between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] in some important ways.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Waltz emphasizes repeatedly in the book and elsewhere that he is not creating a theory of [[foreign policy]], which aims to explain the behavior or actions of a particular state at a specific time or throughout a period. For Waltz, neorealism is divided into two branches: defensive and offensive neorealism. Although both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete for power, [[defensive realism]] posits that most states seek a status quo and limit themselves to concentrate on maintaining the balance of power. Revisionist states are said to be the only states that seek to alter the balance. [[Offensive neorealism]], in contrast to Waltz, asserts that nations seek local hegemony over neighboring states to assert authority in local relations with rival states.

Waltz argues that contemporary geopolitics exists in a state of international affairs comparable to that of perpetual international [[anarchy (international relations)|anarchy]]. He distinguishes the anarchy of the international environment from the order of the domestic one. In the domestic realm, all actors may appeal to and be compelled by a central authority, "the state" or "the government," but in the international realm, no such source of order exists. The anarchy of international politics, with its lack of a central enforcer, means that states must act in a way that ensures their security above all, or they otherwise risk falling behind. He wrote that is a fundamental fact of political life faced by democracies and dictatorships alike. Except in rare cases, they cannot count on the good will of others to help them and so they must always be ready to fend for themselves. Waltz's usage of the term "anarchy" led to a fundamental discursive transformation in international relations, as scholars wrestled with Waltz's ideas. A 2015 study by Jack Donnelly found that the term "anarchy" occurred on average 6.9 times in international relations books prior to 1979 but 35.5 times in those afterward.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The discourse of anarchy in IR|journal = International Theory|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 1752-9727|pages = 393–425|volume = 7|issue = 3|doi = 10.1017/S1752971915000111|first = Jack|last = Donnelly|s2cid = 143360196}}</ref>

Like most other neorealists, Waltz accepted that [[globalization]] poses new challenges to states, but he did not believe that states are being replaced because no other non-state actor can equal the capabilities of the state.  Waltz suggested that globalization is a fad of the 1990s, and if anything, the role of the state has expanded its functions in response to global transformations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Kenneth|date=December 1999|title=Globalization and Governance - The James Madison Lecture|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=32|issue=4|pages=693–700|jstor=420158|doi=10.1017/S1049096500056535}}</ref>

Neorealism was Waltz's response to what he saw as the deficiencies of classical realism. Although both terms are sometimes used interchangeably, neorealism and realism have a number of fundamental differences. The main distinction between the two theories is that classical realism puts human nature, or the urge to dominate, at the center of its explanation for war, but neorealism stakes a reduced claim on human nature and argues instead that the pressures of anarchy tend to shape outcomes more directly than the human nature of statesmen and diplomats or domestic governmental preferences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Kenneth|date=2000|title=Structural realism after the Cold War|journal=International Security|volume=25|pages=5–41|doi=10.1162/016228800560372|s2cid=57560180}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Waltz's theory, as he explicitly states in ''[[Theory of International Politics]]'', is not a theory of foreign policy and does not attempt to predict specific state actions, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union.<ref>Dall'Agnol, Augusto C.  {{Cite journal|title = Balancing in unipolarity: who is afraid of balance of power?|url = https://www.academia.edu/37951607|journal = Brazilian Journal of International Relations|last1 = Dall&#39|first1 = Augusto César}} Vol. 7, No. 3 (2018), pp. 494–515, for further discussions that Waltz's main predictions still applies after the Cold War.</ref> The theory explains only general principles of behavior that govern relations between states in an anarchic international system, rather than specific actions. The recurring principles of behavior include [[balancing (international relations)|balancing of power]] (the theory was refined by [[Stephen Walt]], who modified the "balance of power" concept to "balance of threat"), entering individually-competitive arms races, and exercising restraint in proportion to relative power. In ''[[Theory of International Politics]]'' (1979:6) Waltz suggested that explanation, rather than prediction, is expected from a good social science theory since social scientists cannot run the controlled experiments that give the natural sciences so much predictive power.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

As a teacher, Waltz trained numerous prominent international relations scholars, including Stephen Walt, Barry Posen, Stephen Van Evera, Bob Powell, Avery Goldstein, Christopher Layne, Benny Miller, Karen Adams, Shibley Telhami, James Fearon, William Rose, Robert Gallucci, and Andrew Hanami.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Walt|first=Stephen M.|title=Kenneth N.

Columbia University colleague [[Robert Jervis]] has said of Waltz, "Almost everything he has written challenges the consensus that prevailed at the time"<ref name="cu-award" /> and "Even when you disagree, he moves your thinking ahead."<ref name="nyt-obit" /> [[Leslie H. Gelb]] has considered Waltz one of the "giants" who helped define the field of international relations as an academic discipline.<ref name="nyt-obit" />

===Review===
*In ''Man, the State, and War'', Waltz proposes a three-images view of looking at international relations behavior.  The first image was the individual and human nature; the second image the nation-state, and the third image the [[international relations|international system]].
*In ''Theory of International Politics'', Waltz elaborates many of the core principles of neorealist international relations theory, adopting a structural perspective that sets him apart from earlier (classical) realists like [[E.H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]], and later giving rise to the Neoclassical realist movement ([[Randall Schweller]], [[Fareed Zakaria]], [[William Wohlforth|William C. Wohlforth]], Thomas J. Christensen, etc.) which tries to incorporate a structural component while emphasizing the state-society relationship that mitigates structural forces. (This book also popularized the term [[bandwagoning]].)
*In ''The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed'', Waltz argues for the virtues of a world with more nuclear weapon states because of their power in [[nuclear deterrence]]. Sagan argued against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. See [[nuclear peace]].
