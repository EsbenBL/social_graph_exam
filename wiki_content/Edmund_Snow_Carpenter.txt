{{Anthropology}}
'''Edmund''' "'''Ted'''" '''Snow Carpenter''' (September 2, 1922 – July 1, 2011<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/arts/edmund-carpenter-archaelogist-and-anthropologist-dies-at-88.html?ref=deathsobituaries|title=Edmund Carpenter, {{Sic|nolink=y|Archae|logist}} and Anthropologist, Dies at 88|author=[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 7, 2011}}</ref>) was an American [[anthropologist]] best known for his work on [[tribal art]] and [[visual media]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Rochester, New York]] to the artist and educator Fletcher Hawthorne Carpenter (1879–1954) and Agnes "Barbara" Wight (1883–1981), he was one of four children.<ref>[http://www.askart.com/askart/c/f_letcher_h_carpenter/f_letcher_h_carpenter.aspx "Fletcher H. Carpenter (1879–1954)"], ''AskART.com''</ref>

He was a fraternal twin with Collins W. "Connie" Carpenter, later of [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]].<ref name="PRINSANDBISHOP2002">Prins and Bishop 2002</ref><ref name="CONNIEOBITA2008">[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/democratandchronicle/obituary.aspx?n=collins-w-carpenter-connie&pid=116463032 "Dr. Collins W. (Connie) Carpenter - Obituary"], ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'', Rochester, New York, August 25, 2008</ref><ref name="CONNIEOBITB2008">Sherwood, Julie, [http://www.mpnnow.com/x392056493/In-Memory-of-Craftsman-doctor-civic-leader "In Memory of Craftsman, doctor, civic leader: Dr. Connie Carpenter will be remembered for his many talents and his caring nature"], ''[[Daily Messenger]]'', Canandaigua, New York, August 31, 2008</ref>

He was a descendant of William Carpenter (1605 England - 1658/1659 [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]]) the founder of the [[Rehoboth Carpenter family]] who came to America in the mid-1630s.<ref name=Carpenters>''Carpenters' Encyclopedia of Carpenters 2009'' (DVD format), Subject is RIN 128585; this work contains updates to the 1898 Carpenter Memorial by Amos B. Carpenter</ref>

Edmund Carpenter began his anthropology studies under [[Frank Speck|Frank G. Speck]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1940. After completing his semester in early 1942, he volunteered to serve his country during [[World War II]].

==World War II==
He joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] in early 1942, fighting in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] for the duration of the war especially in [[New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Marianas]], and [[Iwo Jima]]. After the war ended, he was assigned to oversee hundreds of Japanese prisoners, putting them to work on an archaeological dig in [[Tumon, Guam|Tumon]], [[Guam]].<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref>Cf. "Skeletons, Pottery, Tools Found on Sites of Ancient Villages" in ''THE NAVY NEWS'', (United States Navy), February 10, 1946, page 5.</ref>

==Post war==
Discharged as a captain in 1946, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania using his [[G.I. Bill]], was awarded a bachelor's degree, and earned his doctorate four years later in 1950. His doctoral dissertation was on the pre-history of the Northeast, entitled ''Intermediate Period Influences in the Northeast''.<ref name="NYTobit"/>

Carpenter began teaching anthropology at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1948, taking side jobs such as radio programming for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC). In 1950, he started fieldwork among the [[Aivilingmiut]], returning to these [[Inuit]] in [[Nunavut]] in the famine winter of 1951–52, and again in 1955.

When public television took off in Canada with the launching of [[CBC Television|CBC-TV]] in 1952, Carpenter began producing and hosting a series of shows.

Moving back and forth between Toronto's broadcasting studios and Arctic hunting camps, Carpenter collaborated on the theoretical ideas in development by [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. He and McLuhan co-taught a course, and together hatched core ideas about the agency of modern media in the process of culture change.

In 1953, after a well-received proposal written by Carpenter, he and McLuhan received a [[Ford Foundation]] grant for an interdisciplinary media research project, which funded both the Seminar on Culture and Communication (1953–1959) and their co-edited periodical ''Explorations'' throughout the 1950s.<ref name="PRINSANDBISHOP2002"/> Meanwhile, Carpenter continued his programs on CBC-TV, including a weekly show also titled "Explorations" (which started as a radio program).

Together with [[Harold Innis]], [[Eric A. Havelock]], and [[Northrop Frye]], McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the [[Toronto School of communication theory]]. In his famous article "The New Languages" (1956), Carpenter offers a succinct analysis of modern media based on years of participant observation in different cultures, academic and popular print publishing, and radio and television broadcasting.

==Visual media==
In 1959, Carpenter joined anthropologist [[Raoul Naroll]] at San Fernando Valley State College ([[California State University-Northridge]]) and was appointed an assistant professor and founder of an experimental interdisciplinary program of Anthropology and Art, where students were trained in visual media, including filming.<ref>Naroll, Raoul (ed.) [http://www.csus.edu/org/swaa/newsletters/v02.pdf “News of Institutions.”]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Northridge, CA: Southwestern Anthropological Association Newsletter, v. 2, n.1, Spring 1959. P. 2–3.</ref><ref name="VSS1960">''Valley State Sentinel'', San Fernando Valley State College newspaper, March 17, 1960</ref><ref>[http://www.culturalequity.org/alan-lomax/friends/carpenter Profile of Edmund Carpenter, Association for Cultural Equity]</ref> As the only faculty member in the new department, Carpenter went on to hire more faculty. In 1960, he was promoted to the rank of associate professor.<ref name="VSS1960"/> In 1961, he was made chairman of the anthropology department.<ref>Cal State Northridge faculty affairs records for Edmund S. Carpenter, per Naomi Bishop</ref>

With award-winning filmmaker Robert Cannon, he made an innovative documentary about "[[surrealist]]" [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Kuskokwim Eskimo]] masks. Carpenter also co-authored ''Georgia Sea Island Singers'' (1964), a film documenting six traditional African-American songs and dances by [[Gullah]]s of [[St. Simon Island]], based on fieldwork by [[Alan Lomax]]. And with [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], he collaborated on ''Buck Dancer'' (1965), a short film featuring Ed Young, an [[African-American]] musician-dancer from [[Mississippi]]. In 1967, however, just when visual anthropology began to take institutional form as an academic enterprise, the program was closed.

During this period, Carpenter worked with McLuhan on the latter's book ''Understanding Media'' (1964).<ref name="NYTobit" /> In 1967 McLuhan was awarded  the Schweitzer Chair at [[Fordham University]], and he brought Carpenter (on a sabbatical from Northridge), [[Harley Parker]], and [[Eric McLuhan]] to be on his research team.<ref name="NYT1967McL">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/home/mcluhan-magazine.html |title=Understanding McLuhan (In Part)|last=Kostelanetz|first=Richard|date=29 January 1967|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref>

On leave from his faculty position at Northridge, Carpenter subsequently held the Carnegie Chair in anthropology at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (1968–69), and then took a research professorship at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]], officially having resigned his position at Northridge. Joined by photographer Adelaide de Menil (who later became his wife), he journeyed to remote mountain areas where indigenous Papua had "no acquaintance" yet with writing, radios, or cameras. They took numerous [[Instant film|Polaroid]] and 35mm photographs, made sound recordings, and shot some 400,000 feet of 16mm film in black and white, as well as color and [[infrared]] film.

During the next dozen years, Carpenter taught at various universities, including [[Adelphi University]] (c. 1970–1980), [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[New School University]], and [[New York University]] (c. 1980–1981). In addition to numerous other publications, he also completed art historian [[Carl Schuster]]'s massive cross-cultural study on traditional art motifs, ''Materials for the Study of Social Symbolism in Ancient and Tribal Art: A Record of Tradition and Continuity'', published privately in three volumes, with a much-abbreviated one-volume version published in 1996 by Abrams under the title ''Patterns That Connect''.

In 2008, Carpenter guest-curated an important Eskimo traditional and prehistoric art exhibit ''Upside Down: Les Arctiques'' at the [[Musée du quai Branly]], the ethnographic art museum in Paris, France. This exhibit was re-installed in 2011 as ''Upside Down: Arctic Realities'' at The [[Menil Collection]], an art museum in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], which, since 1999, also houses his permanent exhibit ''Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision.''

== Personal life ==
On June 14, 1946, Edmund Carpenter married a fellow student at the University of Pennsylvania, Florence Ofelia Camara, and had two children with her, sons Stephen and Rhys.<ref name=Carpenters/> Their marriage united two of the earliest English and Spanish families to settle in the New World: the Camaras were a Spanish [[Conquistador]] family who settled in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of Mexico. They served under [[Francisco de Montejo]], the [[Adelantado]] and Capitan General of Yucatán, and after that under his son, [[Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo)]], conqueror of the Yucatán.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ9oAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover ''The Hispanic American Historical Review''], Volume 1, James Alexander Robertson, Board of Editors of the Hispanic American Review, 1918.

On September 6, 1961, in [[Yorkville, Michigan]], Carpenter married Virginia York Wilson, of Toronto,  the daughter of the well-known Canadian artist [[York Wilson|Ronald York Wilson]].  This marriage produced a third son, Ian Snow Carpenter.  This marriage also ended in divorce.

In the late 1960s, Carpenter met Adelaide de Menil, the daughter of [[Dominique de Menil]] and [[John de Menil]] of [[Houston]], Texas. Adelaide was a professional photographer who had worked for the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and who joined Carpenter in [[New Guinea]] when he took a professorship there in 1969. Their collaborations and subsequent marriage lasted until his death in 2011.<ref>Cf. Prins & Bishop (2001), p.124-125</ref>

== Memorial service ==
A memorial service for Edmund Carpenter, attended by 400 people, was held on October 29, 2011, at the LeFrak Theater of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. It was followed by a celebration of his life at the [[Metropolitan Pavilion]], 125 West 18th Street.<ref>[http://www.easthamptonstar.com/?q=Obituaries/20111020/Ted-Carpenter "For Ted Carpenter"], ''[[The East Hampton Star]]'' newspaper, October 20, 2011</ref>
