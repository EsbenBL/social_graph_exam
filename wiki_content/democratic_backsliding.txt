Political scientist [[Nancy Bermeo]] argues that blatant forms of democratic backsliding, such as classic, open-ended [[coups d'état]] and [[Electoral fraud|election-day fraud]], have declined since the end of the [[Cold War]], while more subtle and "vexing" forms of backsliding have increased. The latter forms of backsliding entail the debilitation of democratic institutions from within. These subtle forms are especially effective when they are [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimized]] through the very institutions that people expect to protect democratic values.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Bermeo|first=Nancy|date=January 2016|title=On Democratic Backsliding|url=https://sites.unimi.it/carbone/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Democratic-backsliding-Bermeo-JOD-2016.pdf|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=27|issue=1|pages=5–19|doi=10.1353/jod.2016.0012|s2cid=155798358|issn=1086-3214}}</ref>

During national crises, there are unique risks of democratic backsliding. It can occur when leaders impose autocratic rules during [[states of emergency]] that are either disproportionate to the severity of the crisis or remain in place after the situation has improved.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pandemic Backsliding |publisher= V-Dem|url=https://www.v-dem.net/en/our-work/research-projects/pandemic-backsliding/|access-date=23 January 2021|website=www.v-dem.net}}</ref>

==Manifestations==
Democratic backsliding occurs when essential components of [[democracy]] are threatened. Examples of democratic backsliding include:<ref name="DemDigest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.demdigest.org/democratic-backsliding-happens/|title=How democratic backsliding happens|work=Democracy Digest|date=21 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Waldner|first1=David|last2=Lust|first2=Ellen|date=11 May 2018|title=Unwelcome Change: Coming to Terms with Democratic Backsliding|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=93–113|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Forms ==
Democratic backsliding can occur in several common ways. Backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, who use "incremental rather than revolutionary" tactics."<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://institute.global/sites/default/files/articles/The-Populist-Harm-to-Democracy-An-Empirical-Assessment.pdf|title=The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment|last1=Kyle|first1=Jordan|last2=Mounk|first2=Yascha|date=December 2018|publisher=Tony Blair Institute for Global Change}}</ref> As emphasized by [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Daniel Ziblatt]], it is difficult to pinpoint a single specific moment at which a government is no longer democratic, given that this process of decline manifests "slowly, in barely visible steps".<ref name=":1" /> [[Ozan Varol]] uses the phrase ''stealth authoritarianism'' to describe the practice of an authoritarian leader (or a potential authoritarian leader) using "seemingly legitimate legal mechanisms for anti-democratic ends  ... concealing anti-democratic practices under the mask of law."<ref name="Varol">{{Cite encyclopedia|author=[[Ozan Varol|Ozan O.Varol]]|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Constitutional_Democracy_in_Crisis/e5WRDwAAQBAJ|title=Stealth Authoritarianism in Turkey|work=Constitutional Democracy in Crisis? |editor=Mark A. Graber |editor2=Sanford Levinson |editor3=Mark V.

Problems of democratic transition and consolidation. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, p.38."</ref> Levitsky and Ziblatt developed and agreed upon their "litmus test", which includes what they believe to be the four key indicators of authoritarian behavior. These four factors are: rejection (or weak commitment to) democratic rules of the game, denial of the legitimacy of political opponents, toleration or encouragement of violence, and readiness to curtail civil liberties of opponents, including media. Varol describes the manipulation of libel laws, electoral laws, or "terrorism" laws as tools to target or discredit political opponents, and the employment of democratic rhetoric as a distraction from anti-democratic practices, as manifestations of stealth authoritarianism.<ref name="Varol" /> In addition to these key signs derived from the behavior of leaders, [[Samuel P. Huntington]] also describes culture as a main contributor to democratic backsliding, and goes on to argue that certain cultures are particularly hostile to democracy, but they don’t necessarily prohibit democratization.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6REC58gdt2sC&pg=PA23 |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |date=2005 |title=Democracy's Third Wave |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=23|isbn=9780806125169 }}</ref>

===Promissory coups===
In a promissory coup, an incumbent elected government is deposed in a [[coup d'etat]] by coup leaders who claim to defend democracy and promise to hold elections to restore democracy. In these situations, coup-makers emphasize the temporary and necessary nature of their intervention in order to ensure democracy in the future.<ref name=":02" /> This is unlike the more open-ended coups that occurred during the Cold War. Political scientist Nancy Bermeo says that "The share of successful coups that falls into the promissory category has risen significantly, from 35 percent before 1990 to 85 percent afterward."<ref name=":02" /> Examining 12 promissory coups in democratic states between 1990 and 2012, Bermeo found that "Few promissory coups were followed quickly by competitive elections, and fewer still paved the way for improved democracies."<ref name=":02" />

===Executive aggrandizement===
This process contains a series of institutional changes by the elected executives, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government and hold it to account. The most important feature of executive aggrandizement is that the institutional changes are made through legal channels, making it seem as if the elected official has a democratic mandate.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=How Democracies Die|last1=Levitsky|first1=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|publisher=Crown|year=2018|location=United States|pages=76–78}}</ref> Some examples of executive aggrandizement are the decline of media freedom and the weakening of the [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restraints on the government), such as when judicial autonomy is threatened.<ref name=":02" />[[File:Enabling Act in colour.jpg|thumb|315x315px|[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] gives a speech to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] in support of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]].

===Strategic harassment and manipulation during elections===
This form of democratic backsliding entails the impairment of [[free and fair elections]] through tactics such as blocking media access, disqualifying opposition leaders, or harassing opponents. This form of backsliding is done in such a way that the elections do not appear to be rigged and rarely involves any apparent violations of the law, making it difficult for international [[election monitoring]] organizations to observe or criticize these misconducts.<ref name=":02" />

==Causes and characteristics of democratic backsliding==

===Populism===
[[Pippa Norris]] of the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and the [[University of Sydney]] argues that the two "twin forces" pose the largest threat to [[Western world|Western]] [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]: "sporadic and random [[terrorist attack]]s on domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and the rise of [[populist]]-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] forces, which feed parasitically upon these fears."<ref name="Norris">{{Cite web |url=http://journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/media/Journal%20of%20Democracy%20Web%20Exchange%20-%20Norris_0.pdf |title=Is Western Democracy Backsliding? Diagnosing the Risks |last=Norris |first=Pippa |author-link=Pippa Norris |date=April 2017 |website=Journal of Democracy |series=Online Exchange on "Democratic Deconsolidation" |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |language=en |type=Scholarly response to column published online |access-date=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411111001/https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/media/Journal%20of%20Democracy%20Web%20Exchange%20-%20Norris_0.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Norris defines populism as "a governing style with three defining features":
#A rhetorical emphasis on the idea that "legitimate political authority is based on [[popular sovereignty]] and majority rule";
#Disapproval of, and challenges to the legitimacy of, established holders of "political, cultural, and economic power";
#Leadership by "maverick outsiders" who claim "to speak for the ''[[vox populi]]'' and to serve ordinary people."<ref name="Norris"/> 
Some, but not all, populists are also authoritarian, emphasizing "the importance of protecting [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional]] lifestyles against perceived threats from 'outsiders', even at the expense of civil liberties and [[minority rights]]."<ref name="Norris"/> According to Norris, the reinforcement of the insecurities from the "twin forces" has led to more support for populist-authoritarian leaders, and this latter risk is especially pronounced in the United States during the [[presidency of Donald Trump]]. For example, Norris argues that Trump has benefited from the mistrust of "[[the establishment]]" and that he continuously seeks to undermine faith in the legitimacy of the media and the [[Judicial independence|independence of the court]]s.<ref name="Norris"/>

In 2017, [[Cas Mudde]] and Cristóbal Rovire Kaltwasser wrote that:

<blockquote>Populism does not have the same effect in each stage of the democratization process. In fact, we suggest that populism tends to play a positive role in the promotion of electoral or minimal democracy, but a negative role when it comes to fostering the development of a full-fledged liberal democratic regime. Consequently, while populism tends to favor the democratization of authoritarian regimes, it is prone to diminish the quality of liberal democracies. Populism supports popular sovereignty, but it is inclined to oppose any limitations on majority rule, such as judicial independence and  minority rights. Populism-in-power has led to processes of de-democratization (e.g., [[Viktor Orban|[Viktor] Orbán]] in Hungary or [[Hugo Chavez|[Hugo] Chávez]] in Venezuela) and, in some extreme cases, even to the breakdown of the democratic regime (e.g., [[Alberto Fujimori|[Alberto] Fujimori]] in Peru).<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Cristóbal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp.95-96. {{isbn|978-0-19-023487-4}}</ref></blockquote>

A 2018 analysis by political scientists [[Yascha Mounk]] and Jordan Kyle links populism to democratic backsliding, showing that since 1990, "13 right-wing populist governments have been elected; of these, five brought about significant democratic backsliding. Over the same time period, 15 left-wing populist governments were elected; of these, the same number, five, brought about significant democratic backsliding."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/hard-data-populism-bolsonaro-trump/578878/|title=What Populists Do to Democracies|last=Kyle|first=Yascha Mounk, Jordan|date=26 December 2018|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>

A December 2018 report by the [[Tony Blair Institute for Global Change]] concluded that populist rule, whether left- or right-wing, leads to a significant risk of democratic backsliding. The authors examine the effect of populism on three major aspects of democracy: the quality of democracy in general, [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] on executive power and citizens' right to politically participate in a meaningful way. They conclude that populist governments are four times more likely to cause harm to democratic institutions than non-populist governments. Also, more than half of populist leaders have amended or rewritten the countries' constitution, frequently in a way that eroded checks and balances on executive power. Lastly, populists attack individual rights such as freedom of the press, civil liberties, and political rights.<ref name=":3" />

In a 2018 journal article on democratic backsliding, scholars Licia Cianetti, James Dawson, and Seán Hanley argued that the emergence of populist movements in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], such as [[Andrej Babiš]]'s [[ANO 2011|ANO]] in the [[Czech Republic]], are "a potentially ambiguous phenomenon, articulating genuine societal demands for political reform and pushing issues of good governance centre stage, but further loosening the weak checks and balances that characterise post-communist democracy and embedding private interests at the core of the state."<ref name="Cianetti"/>

In a 2019 paper, presented to the International Society of Political Psychologists, [[Shawn Rosenberg]] argues that right-wing populism is exposing a vulnerability in democratic structures and that "democracy is likely to devour itself."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy Devouring Itself: The Rise of the Incompetent Citizen and the Appeal of Right-Wing Populism|last=Rosenberg, S|date=1 January 2019|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1055900632}}</ref>

===Economic inequality and social discontent===
Many [[political economy]] scholars, such as [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]], have investigated the effect of income inequality on the democratic breakdown.<ref name=":2" /> Studies of democratic collapse show that [[economic inequality]] is significantly higher in countries that eventually move towards a more authoritarian model.<ref name=":4" /> Hungary is an example of a country where a large group of unemployed, low-educated people were dissatisfied with the high levels of inequality, especially after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. [[Viktor Orbán]] used this dissatisfaction of a relatively large segment of the population to his advantage, winning popular support by using national-populist rhetoric.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greskovitz|first=Béla|date=2015|title=The Hollowing and Backsliding of Democracy in East-Central Europe|journal=Global Policy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=28–37|doi=10.1111/1758-5899.12225}}</ref>

=== Personalism ===
A 2019 study found that personalism had an adverse impact on democracy in Latin America: "presidents who dominate their own weakly organized parties are more likely to seek to concentrate power, undermine horizontal accountability, and trample the rule of law than presidents who preside over parties that have an independent leadership and an institutionalized bureaucracy."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rhodes-Purdy|first1=Matthew|last2=Madrid|first2=Raúl L.|date=27 November 2019|title=The perils of personalism|journal=Democratization|volume=27|issue=2|pages=321–339|doi=10.1080/13510347.2019.1696310|s2cid=212974380|issn=1351-0347}}</ref>

The 2019 Annual Democracy Report of the V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]] identified three challenges confronting global democracy: (1) "Government manipulation of media, civil society, rule of law, and elections"; (2) rising "toxic polarization", including "the division of society into distrustful, antagonistic camps"; diminishing "respect for opponents, factual reasoning, and engagement with society" among political elites; and increasing use of [[hate speech]] by political leaders; and (3) foreign disinformation campaigns, primarily digital, and mostly affecting Taiwan, the United States, and former [[Soviet bloc]] nations such as [[Latvia]].<ref name="2019VDem">{{Cite report|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf|title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges: V-Dem Annual Democracy Report 2019|publisher=V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]]|date=May 2019}}</ref>

====Poland====
{{see also|2015–present Polish constitutional crisis|Judiciary of Poland#Reforms of late 2010s and consequences}}
In the Polish case, the [[European Commission]] stated in December 2017 that in the two preceding years, the Polish legislature had adopted "13 laws affecting the entire structure of the justice system in Poland" with the "common pattern [that] the executive and legislative branches [were] systematically enabled to politically interfere in the composition, powers, administration, and functioning of the judicial branch."<ref name="CE_20171220" /> In February 2020, [[Věra Jourová]], [[Vice President of the European Commission]] for Values and Transparency, described the disciplining of judges in Poland as "no longer a targeted intervention against individual black sheep, similar to other EU member states, but a case of carpet bombing. ... This is no reform, it's destruction."<ref name="ThomReut_PL_carpet_bombing" /> In late September 2020, 38 European and other law professors called on the [[President of the European Commission]] to take action in Poland, stating:

<blockquote>Polish authorities continue to openly abuse, harass and intimidate judges and prosecutors who are seeking to defend the rule of law. In addition, Polish authorities continue to openly defy the authority of the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] by refusing to follow its judgments. ... judges who are attempting to apply EU law are being threatened and punished while those who flaunt violations of EU law are being rewarded. ... The rule of law in Poland is not merely being attacked. It is being destroyed in plain sight.<ref name="RuleOfLawPl_OpenLetter_Leyer" /></blockquote>

====Romania====
The [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) has been repeatedly accused of democratic backsliding while in power in Romania, initially during the tenure of Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]], who led the country during the [[2012 Romanian constitutional crisis]], when Ponta engaged in several unconstitutional actions in an attempt to impeach President [[Traian Băsescu]].<ref>{{cite book|page=553|first=Christine|last=Hassenstab|year=2019|title=Central and Southeast European Politics Since 1989}}</ref> Ponta's conduct was criticized by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303292204577516994036559110|title=Romanian Court Clears President's Impeachment|date=9 July 2012}}</ref>

Ponta was accused of restricting voting among the Romanian diaspora in the [[2014 Romanian presidential election]], during which Ponta was running as the PSD presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/thousands-of-romanians-locked-outside-london-embassy-denied-their-right-to-vote-9834568.html|title=Hundreds of Romanians locked outside London Embassy 'denied their right to vote'|work=The Evening Standard|date=3 November 2021|first=Anna|last=Dubuis|accessdate=28 May 2021}}</ref> Following the election, which Ponta lost, his close ally, Sebastian Ghiță, was indicted for offering illegal incentives to Moldovans with Romanian citizenship to vote for Ponta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/world/europe/romania-from-frying-pan-to-legal-fire.html|title=Romania: From Frying Pan to Legal Fire|work=The New York Times|date=24 June 2015|accessdate=28 May 2021}}</ref> Ghiță subsequently fled the country for Serbia, due to his good relationship with Serbian President [[Aleksandar Vučić]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romania-insider.com/sources-runaway-romanian-investor-sebastian-ghita-seen-serbia/|title=Sources: Runaway Romanian investor Sebastian Ghita, seen in Serbia|work=Romania Insider|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=28 May 2021}}</ref> Ponta also left Romania for Serbia from 2016 to 2018, receiving Serbian citizenship and serving as an advisor to Vučic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-ocs.com/former-romanian-prime-minister-victor-ponta-acquitted-of-corruption/|title=Former Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta acquitted of corruption|work=EU-OCS|date=10 May 2018|accessdate=28 May 2021}}</ref>

After facing a corruption investigation in 2015, Ponta initially refused to resign as Prime Minister, prompting the [[2015 Romanian political crisis]].

In 2017, PSD Prime Minister [[Sorin Grindeanu]]'s government passed new legislation decriminalising misconduct by officials, which was condemned by President [[Klaus Johannis]] as a "day of mourning for the rule of law" in Romania.

In 2019, Romania indicted [[Laura Codruța Kövesi]], the former chief prosecutor of the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]], who was running for [[European Public Prosecutor's Office|European Chief Prosecutor]] at the time, leading EU authorities to condemn Romania for backsliding on the rule of law.

[[Freedom House]]'s annual ''Nations in Transit'' report in 2020 reported that, due to democratic backsliding, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] in the [[Balkans]] were no longer democracies (as they had been classified since 2003) but had instead become [[hybrid regime]]s (in the "gray zone" between "democracies and pure autocracies").<ref name=NoLongerDem>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/hungary-serbia-montenegro-longer-democracies-report-200506161223889.html|title=Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro 'no longer democracies': Report|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=6 May 2020}}</ref> The reported cited "years of increasing [[state capture]], abuse of power, and strongman tactics employed" by Serbian President [[Aleksandar Vučić]] and Montenegrin President [[Milo Đukanović]].<ref name=NoLongerDem/> Shortly after that report was published, the opposition won the [[2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election]] and [[Zdravko Krivokapić]] was appointed to the office of [[Prime Minister of Montenegro|Prime Minister]], marking the first time since independence that the opposition has controlled the country's government.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

====Slovakia====
The tenure of [[Vladimír Mečiar]] as Slovak Prime Minister and President in the 1990s has been described by political scientists Elisabeth Bakke and Nick Sitter as a period of democratic backsliding, due to Mečiar's control over state media and centralisation of executive power.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Democratic Backsliding in the European Union|year=2019|first1=Elisabeth|first2=Nick|last1=Bakke|last2=Sitter|encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics}}</ref>

Widespread protests in 2018 following the [[murder of Ján Kuciak]] have been described by some scholars as "helping to stave off democratic backsliding" by causing the resignation of [[Robert Fico]], who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2010 and 2012 to 2018.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Milada|last=Vachudova|title=Ethnopopulism and democratic backsliding in Central Europe|journal=East European Politics|year=2020|volume=36|issue=3}}</ref> However, Bakke and Sitter have disputed allegations of democratic backsliding against Fico, noting that Fico often emphasized "his commitment to pluralistic democracy", which contrasted with the Polish and Hungarian leadership during that time period and Slovakia under Mečiar.<ref name=bakke>{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives on Politics|title=The EU's Enfants Terribles : Democratic Backsliding in Central Europe since 2010|year=2020|first1=Elisabeth|last1=Bakke|first2=Nick|last2=Sitter|pages=1–16|doi=10.1017/S1537592720001292|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/10CE615BAD56E79125E828D321641C0A/S1537592720001292a.pdf/the-eus-enfants-terribles-democratic-backsliding-in-central-europe-since-2010.pdf|doi-access=free}}</ref>

====Slovenia====
Prime Minister [[Janez Janša]] has been criticised by Žiga Faktor of the [[EUROPEUM Institute for European Policy]] for overseeing democratic backsliding in Slovenia.

====Ukraine====
Several Ukrainian governments have faced accusations of democratic backsliding.

Prior to the removal of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], Ukraine was described by political scientist Eleanor Knott as experiencing democratic backsliding and "soft authoritarianism".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Perpetually "partly free": lessons from post-soviet hybrid regimes on backsliding in Central and Eastern Europe|journal=East European Politics|year=2018|volume=34|first=Eleanor|last=Knott|issue=3|pages=355–376|doi=10.1080/21599165.2018.1493993|s2cid=158640439|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/88675/1/Knott_Perpetually%20Partly%20Free_Accepted.pdf}}</ref>

The [[Atlantic Council]]'s Maxim Eristavi claimed in 2017 that "Ukrainian democracy is in danger" following President [[Petro Poroshenko]]'s attempts to arrest his former ally and opposition figure [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], and calls by Poroshenko's party for criminal investigations into another political opponent, [[Yulia Tymoshenko]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eristavi |first1=Maxim |title=Opinion {{!}} Forget Saakashvili's political career.

=== India ===
{{main|Democratic backsliding in India}}
The [[V-Dem Institute]] (Varieties of Democracy) claims that democratic backsliding is taking place in India under Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and the ruling [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], citing the passage of the [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019|2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act]] and the government's subsequent response to the [[Citizenship Amendment Act protests]]. It also accused the Indian government of attempting to "stifle critics in the media and academia".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[V-Dem Institute]]|url=https://www.v-dem.net/en/news/democratic-backsliding-india-worlds-largest-democracy/|date=24 February 2020|title=Democratic Backsliding in India, the World's Largest Democracy}}</ref>

In 2020, the V-Dem Institute identified India as one of five severe cases of democratic backsliding, relating to disproportionate limitations being placed upon the role of the legislature through measures responding to COVID-19. This, they asserted, may lead to an 'increased danger of power abuse by the executive'.<ref name="COVID">{{cite web|author=Edge|first=Amanda B|date=30 June 2020|title=An Update on Pandemic Backsliding: Democracy Four Months After the Beginning  of the Covid-19 Pandemic|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/b9/2e/b92e59da-2a06-4d2e-82a1-b0a8dece4af7/v-dem_policybrief-24_update-pandemic-backsliding_200702.pdf|work=Policy Brief #24|publisher=[[V-Dem Institute]]}}</ref>

Indian lawyer [[Gautam Bhatia (lawyer)|Gautam Bhatia]] asserts that the Indian government has taken advantage of 'vaguely worded' legislative clauses, some of a 'colonial vintage', to effectively bypass the 'deliberative organ' (the legislative) in relation to COVID-19. Some of these laws, he further asserted, technically hold 'formal statutory backing', making it more difficult for the legislature to oppose executive power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://verfassungsblog.de/an-executive-emergency-indias-response-to-covid-19/|title=An Executive Emergency: India’s Response to Covid-19}}</ref>

A number of scholars and commentators have identified [[Israel]] in the late 2010s under the premiership of [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] as facing a crisis of [[liberal democracy]] and a risk of [[right-wing populism]]-fueled democratic decline, undermining its traditional status as a [[Jewish and democratic state|democratic state]].<ref name=Roznai>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Yaniv Roznai|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Constitutional_Democracy_in_Crisis/e5WRDwAAQBAJ|date=2018|title=Israel: A Crisis of Liberal Democracy?|work=Constitutional Democracy in Crisis? |editor=Mark A.

Israeli legal scholar Aeyal Gross wrote that while Netanyahu's early premiership embraced a U.S.-style [[neoconservative]] approach, his later tenure "increasingly resembled the model of right wing populism with authoritarian tendencies" in the mode of Trump, Orbán, and Bolsanaro.<ref name=Gross>Aeyal Gross, [https://verfassungsblog.de/does-the-end-of-the-netanyahu-government-mark-the-end-of-democratic-backsliding-in-israel/ Does the End of the Netanyahu Government Mark the End of "Democratic Backsliding" in Israel?], ''[[Verfassungsblog]]'' (June 14, 2021).</ref> Yaniv Roznai of the [[Radzyner Law School]] at [[Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya]] wrote in 2018 that while Israel remained "a vibrant democracy with strong and effective judicial and democratic institutions", its liberal democracy was at risk "incremental erosion of Israel's democratic institutions through countless initiatives to prevent antigovernment criticism, to weaken the judiciary, to infringe minority rights, and to modify the democratic rules of the game."<ref name=Roznai/> Various scholars and commentators have cited as examples of democratic risks in Israel the "rise of [[ethno-nationalist]] populism"'<ref name=WittesMizrahi-Arnaud/> the passage of the [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People|Nation-State Law]];<ref name=RottingInside/><ref name=Wolf/><ref name=Gross/> the use of [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and exclusionary rhetoric by Netanyahu and his [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]] ministers;<ref name=Wolf/><ref name=WittesMizrahi-Arnaud/><ref name=Gross/> including comments during the [[2015 Israeli legislative election|2015 election]] campaign delegitimizing [[Arab Israeli]] voters<ref name=Roznai/><ref name=Wolf/> and comments labeling opponents and left-wing critics as traitors and tools of outside forces;<ref name=WittesMizrahi-Arnaud/> proposals to change Israeli law to modify the [[Status of territories occupied by Israel in 1967|status]] of (or [[Proposed Israeli annexation of the West Bank|unilaterally annex]]) the [[West Bank]];<ref name=Roznai/><ref name=RottingInside/> Netanyahu's effort to grant himself [[immunity from prosecution]] on [[Trial of Benjamin Netanyahu|charges of corruption]];<ref name=RottingInside/> legislative proposals to limit the powers and independence of the [[Israeli Supreme Court]], including the scope of its [[judicial review]] competence;<ref name=Roznai/> overtly racist or fear-mongering campaign advertisements by some parties of the populist right;<ref name=WittesMizrahi-Arnaud/> and efforts to exert greater control over the media<ref name=Roznai/><ref name=RottingInside/> and [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]].<ref name=RottingInside/> In a 2019 report, Tamara Cofman Wittes and Yael Mizrahi-Arnaud of the [[Brookings Institution]] argue that Israeli politics has "sources of resilience" that offer "pathways away from illiberal populism" including structural features of the Israeli political system (such as norms of liberal democracy and a fragmented [[parliamentary system]] that leads to competing populist parties) and cultural features of the Israeli society (such as a burgeoning women's movement that spans "secular-religious, Ashkenazi-Mizrachi, and Jewish-Arab divides").<ref name=WittesMizrahi-Arnaud/>

In 2019 and 2020, four national elections were held. The first three resulted in a tie, essentially deadlocking between pro- and anti-Netanyahu forces. The [[2021 Israeli legislative election|March 2021 election]] resulted in Netanyahu's ouster and the formation of a broad-based coalition government consisting of right-wing anti-Netanyahu parties, centrist, center-left, left-wing, and Arab parties.<ref name=Gross/> Scholars discussed whether the change in power would mark the end of democratic backsliding that had occurred under Netanyahu.<ref name=Gross/><ref>Ayala Panievsky & Julius Maximilian Rogenhofer, [https://www.populismstudies.org/benjamin-netanyahu-likud-and-the-uncertain-fate-of-israels-democracy/ Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud and the uncertain fate of Israel's democracy], ''Populism Studies'' (February 2, 2021).</ref>

===African nations===
Various countries in Africa have experienced democratic backsliding. [[Christopher Fomunyoh]], a longtime Africa expert with the U.S.-based [[National Democratic Institute]], said in 2020 testimony to the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Global Human Rights|U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Global Human Rights]] that there were strong democratic advances in Africa (especially [[West Africa]]) occurred between the late 1980s to the late 2010s, but that by 2019, democratic trends had reversed, with the result being "there are now fewer democracies in Africa" in 2021 than in 1991.<ref name=Fomunyoh>Christopher Fomunyoh, [https://www.ndi.org/publications/christopher-fomunyoh-facing-democratic-backsliding-africa-reversing-trend Facing Democratic Backsliding in Africa & Reversing the Trend], ''Democratic Backsliding in Sub-Saharan Africa'', House Foreign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations (September 30, 2020).</ref> Fomunyoh noted that in the first 20 years of the 21st century, about a dozen countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] weakened or abolished constitutional [[term limit]]s for presidents; these moves weakened [[constitutionalism]] to benefit incumbents, removed one method of facilitating "the peaceful and orderly renewal of political leadership" and led to "excessive fragmentation and polarization of the polity, and, in some cases outright violence, and the further shrinking of political space."<ref name=Fomunyoh/>

[[Tanzania]] has experienced democratic backsliding since 2016, and [[Ethiopia]] since 2018.<ref name=Fomunyoh/> Other examples of democratic backsliding in Africa in the 2010s and 2020s include the [[2021 Malian coup d'état|coups in Mali in 2020]] and [[2020 Malian coup d'état|2021]]<ref name=Fomunyoh/> and [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|persecution of dissidents and civil society activists in Zimbabwe]].<ref name=Fomunyoh/>

===Philippines===
Under the rule of President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], the Philippines has been described as undergoing democratic backsliding.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jürgen|last=Rüland|title=Democratic backsliding, regional governance and foreign policymaking in Southeast Asia: ASEAN, Indonesia and the Philippines|journal=Democratization|volume=28|year=2021|pages=237–257|doi=10.1080/13510347.2020.1803284|s2cid=225373459}}</ref> 

David Timberman of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] has argued that the Duterte government has "run roughshod over human rights, its political opponents, and the country’s democratic institutions", citing intimidation of political opponents, institutions and the media, increased [[extrajudicial killings]], and suggestions of implementing [[martial law]].<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|work=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]|title=Philippine Politics Under Duterte: A Midterm Assessment|date=10 January 2019|url=https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/10/philippine-politics-under-duterte-midterm-assessment-pub-78091|first=David|last=Timberman}}</ref> Duterte has claimed to have looked to [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Donald Trump]] as a role model to do more democratic backsliding.<ref name="auto1"/>

In 5 May 2020 the network met its fate when the National Telecommunications Commission [[ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy|issued a cease and desist order against to the network due to its expired franchise]]. Duterte also told the media that he would not sign the network's franchise even if the congress agrees to renew the franchise of the TV network.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Duterte won't recognize any new ABS-CBN franchise granted by Congress|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-will-not-recognize-any-new-abs-cbn-franchise-granted-congress|access-date=2021-07-10|website=Rappler|language=en}}</ref>

===Russia===
Under 20 years of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s leadership, Russia has experienced democratic backsliding. Putin became president in 1999 and he was able to use "public and elite dissatisfaction with the instability of the 90s" to consolidate power in his hands, while overseeing a decade of economic growth.<ref name=Oliker>{{cite journal |last1=Oliker |first1=Olga |title=Putinism, populism and the defence of liberal democracy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1282669|journal=Is Putinism a Thing? |date=31 January 2017 |volume=59 |issue=1|pages=7–24 |doi=10.1080/00396338.2017.1282669 |s2cid=157503681 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The centralization of power under Putin weakened power of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] and [[State Duma]] (Parliament), and led to a return to more autocratic rule seen during the Soviet era. In the late 1990s when [[Boris Yeltsin]] was president, [[Freedom House]] gave Russia a score of 4 for "freedom, civil liberties and political rights".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gerber |first1=Theodore |title=Public opinion on human rights in Putin-era Russia: Continuities, changes, and sources of variation|journal=Journal of Human Rights|date=28 July 2017 |volume=16 |issue=3|pages=314–331 |doi=10.1080/14754835.2016.1258550 |pmid=30100817 |pmc=6082807 }}</ref>

Following subsequent de-democratization, experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing purges and jailing of the regime's political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections. After serving four years as prime minister, [[2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia|Putin was able to change the constitution to allow him to be president for two consecutive terms]], leaving little constraint on his power.<ref name=Oliker/> Putin's 2012 "[[Russian foreign agent law|foreign agents law]]" targeted NGOs and furthered the crackdown on internal dissent.<ref name=Oliker/><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

The 2019 annual democracy report of the V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]] found that the U.S. under Trump was among the world's liberal democracies experiencing "democratic erosion" (but not full-scale "democratic breakdown").

A rapid increase in crude oil prices around 2003 fueled economic growth in the country, allowing Chávez and his party to further entrench their dominance.<ref name=":32" /> By 2004, Chávez had gained full authority over the democracy-sustaining institutions, diminishing [[checks and balances]] and the power of the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]].<ref name=":32" /> Accusing traditional parties of causing the initial economic distress through exploitation of the country, he justified the weakening of non-executive branches by arguing that those branches were dominated by the traditional parties, and therefore unreliable.<ref name=":32" /> After Chávez' death in 2013, his successor [[Nicolás Maduro]] continued an authoritarian style of governance.<ref name=":42" /><ref name=":52">{{Cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2020: Venezuela|url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/venezuela/freedom-world/2020|date=2020|publisher=Freedom House}}</ref><ref name=":62">{{Cite web|title=EIU Democracy Index 2019 - World Democracy Report|url=https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index|website=www.eiu.com|access-date=15 May 2020}}</ref> After the Venezuelan opposition won a majority of the [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] in the [[2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election|2015 elections]], Maduro and his allies retained control of the other key levers of power, including the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela|military]], [[PDVSA|state-run oil company]], [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Court]], and [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]].<ref name=WOLA>{{Cite report|url=https://www.wola.org/analysis/human-rights-trends-2010s-venezuela-decline/|publisher=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|title=Human Rights Trends of the 2010s: Venezuela's Decline|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> In 2017, Maduro and his allies, moved to circumvent the opposition-controlled National Assembly by creating a [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent National Assembly]], dominated by government loyalists,<ref name=WOLA/> and declaring it the supreme organ of state power.<ref name=Landau/> This move further intensified Venezuela's democratic backsliding.<ref name=WOLA/> Currently, Venezuela is an [[authoritarian regime]],<ref name=":52" /><ref name=":62" /> and had even been described as a personal dictatorship.<ref name=":42" />

====Brazil====
Political scientist [[Robert Muggah]] argued in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' that Brazil was undergoing backsliding under President [[Jair Bolsonaro]], noting Bolsonaro's criticisms of the judiciary and the electoral system, and his participation in anti-democratic rallies.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|title=Bolsonaro Is Following Trump's Anti-Democracy Playbook|date=14 January 2021|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/14/bolsonaro-brazil-trump-anti-democracy-elections/}}</ref> Bolsonaro has often used [[Rodrigo Duterte]] and [[Donald Trump]] as a model to effect democratic backsliding in Brazil.<ref name="auto"/>

In July 2021, Bolsonaro threatened to cancel the [[2022 Brazilian general election]], claiming election fraud would take place unless the electoral system was reformed.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-brazil-1c789f876515a64aa67f918f0d8d5fff|title=Brazil’s Bolsonaro warns 2022 vote will be clean or canceled}}</ref>

In August 2021, Bolsonaro described "three alternatives for [his] future", which he said were "being arrested, killed or victory" in the 2022 election.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/29/election-victory-death-or-prison-bolsonaros-names-his-three-alternatives-for-2022|title=Election victory, death or prison: Bolsonaro names his three alternatives for 2022|date=29 August 2021}}</ref>

====El Salvador====
El Salvador has been described as undergoing democratic backsliding after the election of President [[Nayib Bukele]], particularly following the [[2020 Salvadoran political crisis|2020 crisis]], when Bukele sent soldiers into the [[Salvadoran Legislative Assembly]] to pressure and intimidate members of the Assembly.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Reuters]]|title=El Salvador president's power play stokes democracy concerns|date=10 February 2020|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-elsalvador-politics-idUSKBN2042M4}}</ref> In a June 2020 report, the [[V-Dem Institute]] wrote that El Salvador was "at high risk of pandemic backsliding" and that the country was one of several countries with "severe" violations of democratic standards of emergency measures, including: [[arbitrary detention|arbitrary mass arrests]] by security forces of persons deemed to violate social distancing rules (in contravention of a number of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]]).<ref name="COVID"/>

In 2021, the Legislative Assembly supporter of Bukele dismissed El Salvador's judges of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General. The [[Organization of American States]] condemned the dismissals, declaring that they were undermining democratic principles.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=La OEA rechaza destitución de jueces de la Corte Suprema y del fiscal general en El Salvador {{!}} DW {{!}} 02.05.2021|url=https://www.dw.com/es/la-oea-rechaza-destituci%C3%B3n-de-jueces-de-la-corte-suprema-y-del-fiscal-general-en-el-salvador/a-57405562|access-date=2021-05-11|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|language=es}}</ref>

==Effects of judicial independence==
A 2011 study examined the effects of [[judicial independence]] in preventing democratic backsliding. The study, which analyzed 163 nations from 1960 to 2000, concluded that established independent judiciaries are successful at preventing democracies from drifting to authoritarianism, but that states with newly formed courts "are positively associated with regime collapses in both democracies and nondemocracies".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douglas M. Gibler |author2=Kirk A.
