== Early life and education ==
Irving Kenneth Zola, born in 1935, in  [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. He came from a working class Jewish family. His mother was of Polish origin and his father Russian, both arriving in the US as immigrants as young children.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Gareth|date=1996|title=Irving Kenneth Zola, (1935–1994): An appreciation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9566.ep10934421|journal=Sociology of Health & Illness|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=107–125|doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep10934421|issn=1467-9566}}</ref> He graduated from [[Boston Latin School]] and went on to enroll at [[Harvard College]] in 1956, and four years later went on to receive his Ph.D. in Sociology from Harvard University Department of Social Relations.

== Personal life ==
He married Leonora Katz in 1957. Their marriage ended in a divorce after 16 years.

== Health ==
At the age of 16, Irving Zola contracted polio, after which he used canes to facilitate mobility. He also was injured in an automobile accident at the age of 19, which caused further health complications and disabilities. His personal experiences led him to a career in championing people with disabilities, stating that "until we own our disability as an important part, though not necessarily all, of our identity, any attempt to create a meaningful pride, social movement or culture is doomed."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Peter|last2=Brown|first2=Phil|last3=Bell|first3=Susan|title=Irving Kenneth Zola (1935–1994)|journal=Social Science & Medicine|volume=41|issue=2|pages=v–vi|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(95)90003-9|year=1995}}</ref>

He is survived by wife [[Judy Norsigian]], son Warren Keith Zola, and daughters Amanda Beth Mosola and Kyra Zola Norsigian.

==Career==
In 1982 Zola and a group of American academics founded the [[Society for Disability Studies]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Disability studies|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/disability-studies|access-date=2020-10-11|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> and the first editor of ''[[Disability Studies Quarterly]]''.

Soon after receiving his Ph.D. he briefly worked at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] as a research sociologist before joining the [[Brandeis University]] Department of Sociology the next year in 1963, where he was the Mortimer Gryzmish Professor of Human Relations and taught until his death in 1994.<ref name=":0" /> During his time at Brandeis University, he worked with [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett C. Hughes]], an American sociologist, who had a great impact on Zola's sociological perspective.

During the thirty years that he spent in the department, Zola held the position of chairman three different times over a span of eleven years. For fifteen years, he held a joint appointment in the Florence Heller Graduate School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis.

Zola was one of the co-founders of Boston Self Help Center, an organization that is focused on advocating and counseling people with diseases and disabilities. From 1982 to 1987, he also served on the center's board as executive director.

He also held the chairman position of the [[American Sociological Association]] medical sociology section, a consultant position of the [[World Health Organization]], a member of President Clinton's transition team, and a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/obituaries/irving-kenneth-zola-dies-at-59-sociologist-aided-the-disabled.html|title=Irving Kenneth Zola Dies at 59; Sociologist Aided the Disabled|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=December 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref>
