'''János Kornai''' (21 January 1928 – 18 October 2021) was a Hungarian [[economist]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Andreff |first=Wladimir |date=2020 |title=Janos Kornai: a non-mainstream pathway from economic planning to disequilibrium economics |journal=Public Choice |language=en |doi=10.1007/s11127-020-00813-6 |s2cid=219459436 |issn=1573-7101}}</ref> noted for his analysis and criticism of the [[planned economy|command economies]] of [[Eastern Europe]]an [[communist state]]s. He also covered [[macroeconomy|macroeconomic]] aspects in countries undergoing post-Soviet transition. He was emeritus professor at both [[Harvard University]] and [[Corvinus University of Budapest]]. Kornai was known to have coined the term [[shortage economy]] to reflect perpetual shortages of goods in the centrally-planned command economies of the [[Eastern Bloc]].

==Biography==
Kornai was born János Kornhauser on 21 January 1928 in [[Budapest]] in a well-to-do Hungarian-Jewish family.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kornai |first=János |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kz8nMnNZsKMC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PR14&dq=By+Force+of+Thought&hl=en |title=By Force of Thought: Irregular Memoirs of an Intellectual Journey |date=26 September 2008 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-61224-1 |language=en}}</ref> The family spent time in an [[Internment Camp|internment camp]] during the [[Occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany (disambiguation)|Nazi occupation of Hungary]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->.

Kornai gained his knowledge of [[economics]] on his own, and later held a [[Candidate (degree)|candidate degree]] in the field from the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He wrote that he chose to be an economist after reading [[Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name="Fejto">{{in lang|fr}} [[François Fejtő]], "Les Mémoires politiques et intellectuels d'un grand économiste hongrois", ''Sociétal'', Q1 2008, p. 110 ff.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sen |first=Amartya |date=19 August 2020 |title=Marx after Kornai |journal=Public Choice |language=en |doi=10.1007/s11127-020-00838-x |issn=1573-7101}}</ref> He started working on ''Szabad Nép,'' the Hungarian Communist Party newspaper, and rose to be editor for news related to the economy, but he was fired for lack of [[Communist]] convictions in April 1955.<ref name="Fejto"/>

From 1958 onwards, Kornai received many invitations to visit foreign institutions, but was denied a [[passport]] by the Hungarian authorities and forbidden to travel until 1963, after political restrictions had begun to ease.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier |date=1 September 1999 |title=An Interview with János Kornai |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231792802_An_Interview_with_Janos_Kornai |journal=Macroeconomic Dynamics |volume=3 |pages=427–450}}</ref>

From 1967 to 1992, Kornai was a research professor at the Institute of Economics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He became a corresponding member (1976), then a full member (1982) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Kornai joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in 1986 and was named the Allie S. Freed Professor of Economics in 1992.

Retiring from Harvard in 2002, he remained a Distinguished Research Professor at [[Central European University]], and later became a Professor Emeritus at [[Corvinus University of Budapest]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=János Kornai 1928 – 2021, Economist {{!}} Central European University |url=https://www.ceu.edu/article/2021-10-20/janos-kornai-1928-2021-economist#:~:text=J%C3%A1nos%20Kornai%20was%20a%20member,the%20Swedish,%20and%20other%20academies.&text=From%201947%20till%201955,%20at,Communist%20Party%20daily,%20Szabad%20N%C3%A9p. |access-date=2021-10-25 |website=www.ceu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=János Kornai |url=https://economics.harvard.edu/people/janos-kornai |access-date=2021-10-25 |website=economics.harvard.edu |language=en}}</ref> He was a Member of the Board of the [[Hungarian National Bank]] (central bank) until 2001.

==Work==
In the late 1950s, he was among those who initiated the use of [[mathematical]] methods in economic planning. He elaborated the [[theory of two-level planning]] with [[Tamás Lipták]] and directed the first large-scale, economy-wide, multi-level planning project. Professor Kornai's early work ''Overcentralization'' (1953) created a stir in the West and conveyed for the first time his disillusionment with communist [[central planning]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roland |first=Gérard |date=2021-10-23 |title=Economics of socialism and transition: The life and work of János Kornai, 1928-2021 |url=https://voxeu.org/article/j-nos-kornai-1928-2021 |access-date=2021-10-25 |website=VoxEU.org}}</ref>{{Additional citation needed|date=October 2021}}

His 1971 book ''Anti-Equilibrium'' criticizes [[neoclassical economics]], particularly [[general equilibrium|general equilibrium theory]]. His 1980 book ''Economics of Shortage'' is perhaps his most influential work. It argues that the chronic shortages seen throughout [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 1970s and continuing in the 1980s were not the consequences of planners' errors or wrong pricing, but of systemic flaws. In his 1988 book ''The Socialist System, The Political Economy of Communism'', he argued that the command economy based on unchallenged control by a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[communist party]] leads to a predominance of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic administration]] of state firms, through [[centralized planning]] and management, and the use of [[administrative pricing]] to eliminate the effects of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This brings individual responses to the incentives of the system, culminating in observable and inescapable economic phenomena known as the [[shortage economy]]. Kornai remained highly sceptical of efforts to create [[market socialism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} His later works, including ''The Road to a Free Economy'' (1990), ''Highway and Byways'' (1995), ''Struggle and Hope'' (1997) and ''[[Welfare, Choice and Solidarity in Transition|Welfare in Transition]]'' (2001), deal with [[macroeconomy|macroeconomic]] aspects and the interaction between politics and economic policy in the period of economic transition in the [[post-Soviet states]]. He later led a comprehensive research project, ''Honesty and Trust in the Light of Post-Socialist Transition'' at Collegium Budapest.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Kornai was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-19 |title=János Kornai, Professor Emeritus of Corvinus University, has passed away - Budapesti Corvinus Egyetem |url=https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/hir/janos-kornai-professor-emeritus-of-corvinus-university-has-passed-away/?lang=en |access-date=2021-10-25 |website=www.uni-corvinus.hu |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2016 he was elected as a foreign associate of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/may-3-2016-NAS-Election.html |title=National Academy of Sciences Members and Foreign Associates Elected |department=News from the National Academy of Sciences |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |date=3 May 2016 |access-date=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506052951/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/may-3-2016-NAS-Election.html |archive-date=6 May 2016 |url-status=dead}}.</ref>

In 2007 Kornai published a book of memoirs, ''By Force of Thought'', covering his research and the social and political environments in which he did his work.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kornai |first=János |translator=McLean, Brian |title=By Force of Thought: Irregular Memoirs of an Intellectual Journey |publisher=MIT Press |year=2006 |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England |isbn=9780262113021 |hdl=2027/heb.32491}}</ref> New editions of some of Kornai's major works appeared in Hungarian from a [[Bratislava]] publisher in 2012.<ref>Balázs Hámori: "János válogatott művei sorozat a pozsonyi Kalligram kiadásában" (Series of selected works by János Kornai published by Kalligram of Bratislava).
