The [[History of Poland|history]] of human [[Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|activity on Polish soil]] spans thousands of years. Throughout the [[late antiquity]] period it became extensively diverse, with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast [[North European Plain|Central European Plain]]. However, it was the [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]] who dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]]. The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to 966, when the pagan [[Mieszko I of Poland|ruler]] of a realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland embraced [[Christianity]] and converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]].<ref name="A Concise History of Poland" /> The [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] was founded in 1025 and in 1569 cemented its longstanding [[Polish–Lithuanian union|political association]] with [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] by signing the [[Union of Lublin]].

Poland was developing as a [[feudalism|feudal]] state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful [[landed nobility]].

The [[Great Sejm]] (1788–1792) convened by Stanislaus Augustus successfully adopted in 1791 the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|3 May Constitution]], the first set of modern supreme national laws in Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Butterwick|2021|p=260}}</ref> However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's aristocracy and conservatives as well as from Catherine, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's eastern frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|Polish–Russian War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Butterwick|2021|p=310}}</ref>

The defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation, hoping to save the country. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the reemergence of a Polish state, understanding, that despite the current influence they still cannot control the country, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence. In 1795, following the failed [[Kościuszko Uprising]], the Commonwealth was [[Third Partition of Poland|partitioned one last time]] by all three of its more powerful neighbours, and with this, effectively ceased to exist.<ref name="gierowski3" /> The 18-century British statesman and philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] summed up the partitions: "No wise or honest man can approve of that partition, or can contemplate it without prognosticating great mischief from it to all countries at some future time".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/when-poland-was-nowhere-foreigners-reflect-on-the-partitions-a-stateless-nation |title=When Poland Was Nowhere: Foreigners Reflect on the Partitions & a Stateless Nation |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=3 August 2017 |website=culture.pl |access-date=11 July 2020 }}</ref>

Poles [[List of wars involving Poland|rebelled several times against the partitioners]], particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in 1794 during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]], where a popular and distinguished general [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], who had several years earlier served under [[George Washington|Washington]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]], led Polish insurrectionists. Despite the victory at the [[Battle of Racławice]], his ultimate defeat ended Poland's independent existence [[Third Partition of Poland|for 123 years]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Monica Mary |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27882/27882-h/27882-h.htm#CHAPTER_VII |title=The Rising of Kościuszko (Chapter VII) |work=Kościuszko: A Biography |publisher=G.

In 1807, [[Napoleon I of France]] temporarily recreated a Polish state as the satellite [[Duchy of Warsaw]], after a successful [[Greater Poland Uprising (1806)|1806 uprising]] against Prussian rule. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Tilsit]], the duchy was ruled by his ally, [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]]. The Polish troops and generals aided Napoleon throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]], particularly those under [[Józef Poniatowski]], who became the only foreign [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal of the French Empire]] shortly before his death at the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholls |first=David |date=1999 |title=Napoleon |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Napoleon/PmCdv91zPS0C?hl=en&gbpv=0 |location=Oxford |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=204 |isbn=978-0-87436-957-1}}</ref> In the aftermath of Napoleon's exile, Poland was again split between the victorious powers at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lukowski |first1=Jerzy |last2=Zawadzki |first2=W.H. |ref=Lukowski2001 |title=A Concise History of Poland |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=313 |location=Cambridge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-521-55917-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpMxTvBuWHYC&q=1807&pg=PA115}}</ref> The eastern part was ruled by the Russian [[tsar]] as [[Congress Poland]], which temporarily held a [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland|liberal constitution]]. The Prussian-controlled territory of western Poland came under increased [[Germanization]]. Thus, in the 19th century, only Habsburg-ruled [[Austrian Poland]] and the [[Free City of Kraków]] in the south, allowed free Polish culture to flourish.

During the European [[Spring of Nations]], Poles took up arms in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1848]] to resist the Prussians. Initially, the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the Prussian military was sent in to pacify the region. Subsequently, the uprising was suppressed and the semi-autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], created from the Prussian partition of Poland, was incorporated into Prussia, and in 1871 into the [[German Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YUuGSKXsFUC&q=1848+prussia+uprising+posen&pg=PA140|title=Paths of Integration: Migrants in Western Europe (1880–2004)|first1=Leo|last1=Lucassen|first2=David|last2=Feldman|first3=Jochen|last3=Oltmer|date=6 September 2006|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5356-883-5|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In 1863, a new Polish uprising against Russia began. The [[January Uprising]] started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against [[conscription]] into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish–Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Consequently, the Poles resorted to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement. Congress Poland was rapidly [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] towards the end of the 19th century, and successively transformed into the Empire's wealthiest and most developed subject.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKR8DwAAQBAJ&q=january+uprising+economic&pg=PA181|title=Poland From Partitions to EU Accession: A Modern Economic History, 1772–2004|first=Piotr|last=Koryś|date=29 November 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-97126-1|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=op5AAQAAIAAJ&q=congress+poland+richest+part|title=Zionism|first=Getzel|last=Kressel|date=6 September 1973|publisher=Keter Books|isbn=978-0-7065-1326-4|via=Google Books}}</ref>

=== Second Polish Republic ===
{{Main|History of Poland (1918–39)|Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Second Polish Republic}}
[[File:Józef Piłsudski (-1930).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] was a hero of the Polish independence campaign and the nation's premiere statesman from 1918 until his death on 12 May 1935.]]

Following [[World War I]] all the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed in Point 13 of his [[Fourteen Points]]. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Shortly after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice with Germany in November 1918]], Poland regained its independence as the [[Second Polish Republic]] (''II Rzeczpospolita Polska''). It reaffirmed its independence after [[List of wars involving Poland|a series of military conflicts]], the most notable being the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–21) when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Red Army]] at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], an event which is considered to have halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced [[Vladimir Lenin]] to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism. The event is often referred to as the "Miracle at the Vistula".<ref name="Głos" />

During this period, Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state. Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a major seaport, [[Gdynia]], was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]]. Also, the Polish government embarked on the creation of the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]] (''Centralny Okręg Przemysłowy''). The project's goal was to create an industrial center in the middle of the country that included steel mills, power plants and factories.

[[File:RzeczpospolitaII.png|thumb|left|Map of Poland during the [[Interwar period]], 1921–39]]

The inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zachęta]] Gallery in Warsaw by a painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]].<ref name="bitter" />

In 1926, a [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup]], led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]], turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan [[Sanacja]] (''Healing'') movement in an effort to prevent radical political organizations on both the left and the right from destabilizing the country.{{efn|1=The Polish word "sanacja" is defined identically as "ł[aciński]: ''uzdrowienie'' (''L[atin]'':  healing) in ''Słownik wyrazów obcych'' [''Dictionary of Foreign Expressions''], 1918 (8 years before Piłsudski's  May Coup);<ref>''Słownik wyrazów obcych'' [''Dictionary of Foreign Expressions''], New York, Polish Book Importing Co., 1918, p. 701.</ref> and in ''M.

[[World War II]] began with the [[Nazi German]] [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, followed by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September. On 28 September 1939, [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw fell]]. As agreed in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Poland was split into two zones, [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|one occupied by Nazi Germany]], the other by [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]. In 1939–41, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. The Soviet [[NKVD]] executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (inter alia [[Katyn massacre]]) ahead of the [[Operation Barbarossa]].<ref name="bbc" /> German planners had in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction of all Poles" and their fate as outlined in the genocidal ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Geyer|title=Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IcB3oASHnkAC&pg=PA152|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89796-9|pages=152–153}}</ref>

Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution in Europe{{efn|1=Numerous sources state that Polish Army was the Allies' fourth biggest fighting contingent. [[Steven J.

The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|wartime resistance movement]], and the [[Armia Krajowa]] (''Home Army''), fought against German occupation. It was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war,{{efn|1=Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during World War II. The confusion often stems from the fact that as the war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger – and other diminished. Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944–45, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces in Poland (although the [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Several sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. [[Norman Davies]] wrote: "Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance";<ref name="google12" /> [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote "Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe";<ref name="google13" /> [[Mark Wyman]] wrote "Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe".<ref name="google14" /> Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941. After that point, the numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] begun growing rapidly. The numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] quickly caught up and were similar to that of the Polish resistance.<ref name="historiographical" /><ref name="Vukšić2003" /> The numbers of Tito's [[Yugoslav partisans]] were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–42), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).<ref name="Vukšić2003">{{cite book|author=Velimir Vukšić|title=Tito's partisans 1941–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLix5hc4WRgC&pg=PA11|access-date=1 March 2011|year=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-675-1|pages=11–}}</ref><ref name="ac" />}} and encompassed a range of clandestine activities, which functioned as an [[Polish Underground State|underground state]] complete with [[Education in Poland during World War II|degree-awarding universities]] and [[Special Courts|a court system]].<ref name="Salm42" /> The resistance was loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 it initiated [[Operation Tempest]], of which the [[Warsaw Uprising]] that begun on 1 August 1944 is the best known operation.<ref name="Lerski1996-2" /><ref name="Soviets_and_AK" />

[[File:Solidarity poster 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|''At [[High Noon]], 4 June 1989'' — political poster featuring [[Gary Cooper]] to encourage votes for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] party in the [[Contract Sejm|1989 elections]]]]

At the insistence of [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in London. This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over Poland was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.

Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name="indianapolis" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lwów]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterize the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.

The new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Bolesław Bierut]], the régime of [[Władysław Gomułka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1989)|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name="PWN_historia" />

Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union "[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]" ("''Solidarność''"), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War. [[Lech Wałęsa]], a Solidarity candidate, eventually [[1990 Polish presidential election|won the presidency in 1990]]. The Solidarity movement heralded the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communist regimes and parties across Europe]].

[[File:EU and PL flags.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poland became a member state of the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004.]]

A [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] programme, initiated by [[Leszek Balcerowicz]] in the early 1990s, enabled the country to transform its socialist-style planned economy into a [[market economy]]. As with other post-communist countries, Poland suffered temporary declines in social and economic standards,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Kowalik | first = Tadeusz | year = 2011 | title = From Solidarity to Sell-Out: The Restoration of Capitalism in Poland | location = New York, NY | publisher = Monthly Review Press}}</ref> but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 GDP levels, which it achieved by 1995 thanks largely to its booming economy.<ref name="WHY POLAND?" />

Most visibly, there were numerous improvements in human rights, such as [[freedom of speech]], [[Internet censorship by country|internet freedom]] (no censorship), civil liberties (1st class) and political rights (1st class), as ranked by [[Freedom House]] non-governmental organization. In 1991, Poland became a member of the [[Visegrád Group]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visegradgroup.eu/about|title=The Visegrad Group: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia &#124; About the Visegrad Group|first=Webra International|last=Kft|date=15 August 2006|website=www.visegradgroup.eu}}</ref> and joined the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance in 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.pl/web/national-defence/poland-in-nato-20-years|title=Poland in NATO - more than 20 years - Ministry of National Defence - Gov.pl website|website=Ministry of National Defence}}</ref> along with the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]].

Poland joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krakowpost.com/909/2008/01|title=Poland joins Schengen as border-free Europe expands|first=Michal|last=Wojtas|date=10 January 2008}}</ref> as a result of which, [[Borders of Poland|the country's borders]] with other member states of the European Union have been dismantled, allowing for [[Freedom of movement#European Union|full freedom of movement]] within most of the EU.<ref name="Europe's border-free zone expands" /> In contrast to this, a section of Poland's eastern border now constitutes the external EU border with [[Belarus]], Russia and Ukraine. That border has become increasingly well protected, and has led in part to the coining of the phrase [[Fortress Europe#Modern times|'Fortress Europe']], in reference to the seeming 'impossibility' of gaining entry to the EU for citizens of the [[former Soviet Union]].

In an effort to strengthen military cooperation with its neighbors, Poland set up the [[Visegrád Battlegroup]] with Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, with a total of 3,000 troops ready for deployment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299394519|title=Visegrad Four EU Battlegroup: Meaning and Progress|website=ResearchGate}}</ref> Also, in eastern Poland, it formed the [[Lithuanian–Polish–Ukrainian Brigade|LITPOLUKRBRIG]] battle groups with Lithuania and Ukraine.

Poland's vast territory covers approximately {{convert|312696|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, of which 98.52% is dry land and 1.48% is water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/ludnosc/ludnosc/powierzchnia-i-ludnosc-w-przekroju-terytorialnym-w-2018-roku,7,15.html|title=Powierzchnia i ludność w przekroju terytorialnym w 2018 roku|website=stat.gov.pl}}</ref> Extending across several geographical regions, the country is the [[List of European countries by area|9th-largest by area in Europe]] and [[List of countries and dependencies by area|69th largest in the world]].

In the north-west is the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seacoast spanning from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gdańsk Bay|Gulf of Gdańsk]]. The coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and [[Sand dunes|dunes]].<ref>https://1001miejsc.pl/odkryj-cuda-natury-w-polsce-9-najciekawszych/3/#:~:text=Mierzeja%20Helska,Kaszubi%2C%20silnie%20kultywuj%C4%85cy%20swoje%20tradycje.</ref> The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]].

The central and northern parts of the country lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], notably the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]].<ref name="auto6">{{Cite web|url=https://regiony-projekt.gozych.edu.pl/strony/pojezierza.html|title=Podróż przez regiony geograficzne Polski|website=regiony-projekt.gozych.edu.pl}}</ref> The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea.<ref name="auto6"/>

South of the Northern European Plain are the regions of [[Lusatia]], [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/European-Plain|title=European Plain &#124; plain, Europe|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> The extreme south of Poland is mountainous; it runs from the [[Sudetes]] in the west to the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the east.

The geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of Europe and Africa over the past 60&nbsp;million years and, more recently, by the [[Quaternary]] glaciations of northern Europe.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53447-7.00023-4 |chapter=Quaternary Glaciations in Poland |title=Quaternary Glaciations - Extent and Chronology - A Closer Look |series=Developments in Quaternary Sciences |year=2011 |last1=Marks |first1=Leszek |volume=15 |pages=299–303 |isbn=978-0-444-53447-7 }}</ref> Both processes shaped the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains.

This continual [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons, such as [[Łebsko Lake]] in the Słowiński National Park.

The largest spits are [[Hel Peninsula]] and the [[Vistula Spit]]. The coast line is varied also by [[Szczecin Lagoon|Szczecin]] and [[Vistula Lagoon]]s and several lakes, including [[Jamno (lake)|Jamno]].

Poland has historically been home to rare species of animals, as well as the two largest European mammals: the [[European bison|wisent]] (''żubr'') and [[aurochs]] (''tur''). The last aurochs of Europe became extinct in 1627 in the Polish [[Jaktorów|Jaktorów Forest]], while the wisent survived until the 20th century only at [[Białowieża Forest|Białowieża]].

Game animals such as [[red deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[wild boar]] are found in most woodlands. Eastern Poland abounds in ancient woods, like the Białowieża Forest, that have not been disturbed by human or industrial activity. There are also large forested areas in the mountains, [[Greater Poland]], Pomerania, [[Lubusz Land]], and [[Lower Silesia]]. The [[Lubusz Voivodeship]] is currently the most arboraceous province in the country; 52% of its territory is occupied by forests.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.portalsamorzadowy.pl/polityka-i-spoleczenstwo/gus-w-polsce-przybywa-lasow,91459.html |title=GUS: W Polsce przybywa lasów |website=Portal Samorzadowy |date=21 Mar 2017}}</ref>

The climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] in the north-west and becomes gradually warmer and [[continental climate|continental]] towards the south-east. Summers are generally warm, with average temperatures between {{convert|18|and|30|°C|°F|1}} depending on the region. Winters are rather cold, with average temperatures around {{convert|3|°C|°F|1}} in the northwest and {{convert|-6|°C|°F}} in the northeast.

The president appoints the cabinet according to the proposals of the prime minister, typically from the majority coalition in the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]]. The president is elected by popular vote every five years. The current [[President of the Republic of Poland|president]] is [[Andrzej Duda]] and the [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister]] is [[Mateusz Morawiecki]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/kornel-morawiecki-funeral-mass-held-in-warsaw-7939|title=Kornel Morawiecki funeral mass held in Warsaw|website=www.thefirstnews.com}}</ref>

Polish voters elect a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament consisting of a 460-member lower house (Sejm) and a 100-member Senate ([[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senat]]). The Sejm is elected under [[proportional representation]] according to the [[d'Hondt method]], a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems. The Senat, on the other hand, is elected under the [[first-past-the-post voting]] method, with one senator being returned from each of the 100 constituencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/3198/|title=IFES Election Guide &#124; Elections: Poland Senate|website=www.electionguide.org}}</ref>

[[File:Zgromadzenie Narodowe 4 czerwca 2014 Kancelaria Senatu 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Sejm]] is the [[lower house]] of the [[parliament of Poland]].]]

With the exception of ethnic minority parties, only candidates of [[List of political parties in Poland|political parties]] receiving at least 5% of the total national vote can enter the Sejm. When sitting in a joint session, members of the Sejm and Senat form the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] (the ''Zgromadzenie Narodowe''). The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: when a new president takes the [[oath of office]]; when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the State Tribunal (''Trybunał Stanu''); and when a president's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health is declared. To date, only the first instance has occurred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/Sejm8.nsf/page.xsp/zn|title=Zgromadzenie Narodowe|website=www.sejm.gov.pl|access-date=12 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107140429/https://www.sejm.gov.pl/Sejm8.nsf/page.xsp/zn|archive-date=7 November 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] plays an important role in decision-making. Its major institutions include the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] (''Sąd Najwyższy''); the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny''); the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] (''Trybunał Konstytucyjny''); and the [[State Tribunal (Poland)|State Tribunal]] (''Trybunał Stanu''). On the approval of the Senat, the Sejm also appoints the [[Polish Ombudsman|ombudsman]] or the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection (''Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich'') for a five-year term. The ombudsman has the duty of guarding the observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish citizens and residents, of the law and of principles of community life and social justice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wosna5.pl/trybunal_konstytucyjny_i_trybunal_stanu|title=Trybunał Konstytucyjny i Trybunał Stanu|website=www.wosna5.pl}}</ref>

The [[Constitution of Poland]] is the enacted supreme law, and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. The current [[Democracy|democratic]] constitution was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Poland]] on 2 April 1997; it guarantees a [[multi-party state]] with freedoms of religion, speech and assembly, prohibits the practices of forced [[medical experimentation]], torture or [[corporal punishment]], and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form [[trade union]]s, and the right to [[Strike action|strike]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Poland|website=www.sejm.gov.pl}}</ref>

Historically, the most significant Polish legal act is the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], the first modern constitution in Europe.<ref name="Davies 699" /> Instituted as a [[Government Act]], it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the [[federation|federative]] [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and its [[Golden Liberty]]. Previously, only the [[Henrician Articles]] (1573) signed by each of Poland's elected monarchs could perform the function of a set of basic laws. The new Constitution introduced political equality between [[townspeople]] and the [[nobility]] (''[[szlachta]]''), and placed the [[peasant]]s under the protection of the government. It abolished pernicious parliamentary policies such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which permitted any deputy to rescind all the legislation passed in the interest of a foreign power. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[reactionary]] [[magnate]]s, with a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and democratic [[constitutional monarchy]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Poland}}

Poland's current [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at the voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by that assembly.

The voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland has 16 voivodeships, 380 powiats (including 66 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.

Tourist attractions in Poland vary, from the mountains in the south to the sandy beaches in the north, with a trail of nearly every architectural style. The most visited city is [[Kraków]], which was the former capital of Poland and serves as a relic of the [[Polish Golden Age]] and the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]]. Kraków also held [[Royal coronations in Poland|royal coronations]] of [[List of Polish monarchs|most Polish kings and monarchs]] at [[Wawel]], the nation's chief historical landmark. Among other notable sites in the country is [[Wrocław]], one of the oldest cities in Poland which was a model for the founding of Kraków. Wrocław is famous for its [[Wrocław's dwarfs|dwarf statues]], a large [[Market Square, Wrocław|market square]] with two [[Ratusz|town halls]], and the oldest [[Wrocław Zoo|Zoological Gardens]] with one of the world's largest number of animal [[species]]. The Polish capital [[Warsaw]] and its historical [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] were entirely reconstructed after [[Destruction of Warsaw|wartime destruction]]. Other cities attracting countless tourists include [[Gdańsk]], [[Poznań]], [[Lublin]], [[Toruń]] as well as the site of the [[Germany|German]] [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in [[Oświęcim]]. A notable highlight is the 13th-century [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] with its labyrinthine tunnels, a [[Underground lake|subterranean lake]] and chapels carved by miners out of [[rock salt]] beneath the ground.

=== Energy ===
{{Main|Energy in Poland|Coal mining in Poland}}
[[File:Bełchatów Elektrownia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bełchatów Power Station]] is a [[lignite]]-fired [[Steam-electric power station|power station]] that produces 27–28 TWh of electricity per year or twenty per cent of the total power generation in Poland.]]

The electricity generation sector in Poland is largely [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]]–based. Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in the production of their energy. In 2013, Poland scored 48 out of 129 states in the Energy Sustainability Index.<ref name="Energy Sustainability Index" /> The three largest Polish coal mining firms ([[Węglokoks]], [[Kompania Węglowa]] and [[Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa|JSW]]) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually.

[[Renewable energy|Renewable forms of energy]] account for a smaller proportion of Poland's full energy generation capacity.<ref name="EU Commission – Energy factsheet P74" /> However, the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland (the share of energy from renewable sources in the gross final energy consumption in 2019 was – 12,18%). Increasing the share of energy from renewable sources and a significant reduction in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO2 emissions]] to be achieved with the help of [[biofuel]]s, [[photovoltaics]], construction of [[wind farm]]s on the land and the [[Baltic Sea]], [[hydroelectric]] stations and [[nuclear power plant]].

Poland has around 164,800,000,000 m<sup>3</sup> of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] ("the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]"), [[PGNiG]]. However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland are insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population and industry.  Consequently, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas. Therefore, since the second decade of the 21st century, Poland has been strongly developing the so-called North Gate in which the most important components are the [[Baltic Pipe]], the [[Świnoujście LNG terminal]] and Floating Storage and Regasification Unit in [[Port of Gdańsk]].

The five largest companies supplying Poland electricity are [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna|PGE]], [[Tauron Group|Tauron]], [[Enea SA|Enea]], [[:pl:Energa|Energa]] and [[Innogy|Innogy Poland]].

Transport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|marine shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel]]. The country is part of EU's [[Schengen Area]] and is an important transport hub along neighbouring [[Germany]] due to its strategic position in [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paih.gov.pl/poland_in_figures/transport|title=PAIH &#124; Transport|website=www.paih.gov.pl}}</ref> Some of the longest European routes, including the [[European route E40|E40]], run through Poland.

The country has a good network of [[Highways in Poland|highways]], composed of [[Limited-access road|express roads]] and [[Controlled-access highway|motorways]]. At the start of 2020, Poland had {{cvt|4146.5|km}} of highways in use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gddkia.gov.pl/pl/926/autostrady|title=Autostrady :: Generalna Dyrekcja Dróg Krajowych i Autostrad – Serwis informacyjny|website=www.gddkia.gov.pl}}</ref> In addition, all local and regional roads are monitored by the National Road Rebuilding Programme, which aims to improve the quality of travel in the countryside and suburban localities.<ref name="National Road Rebuilding Program (Polish)" />

In 2017, the nation had {{convert|18513|km}} of railway track, the third longest in Europe after [[Germany]] and [[France]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/451500/length-of-railway-lines-in-use-in-europe/|title=Length of the rail network in Europe 2017, by country|website=Statista}}</ref> The [[Polish State Railways]] (PKP) is the dominant railway operator in the country. In December 2014, Poland began to implement [[High-speed rail in Poland|high–speed rail routes]] connecting major Polish cities,<ref name="dec23" /> and started passenger service using the [[New Pendolino]] train, operating at 200&nbsp;km/h on the [[PKP rail line 4|Central Rail Line]] (CMK). Polish regulations allow trains without [[European Train Control System|ETCS]] to travel at speeds up to 160&nbsp;km/h, trains with ETCS1 up to 200&nbsp;km/h, and trains with ETCS2 at over 200&nbsp;km/h. Most inter-regional connections rail routes in Poland are operated by [[PKP Intercity]], whilst regional trains are run by a number of private operators, the largest of which is [[Polregio]]. The largest passenger [[train station]] in terms of the number of travelers is [[Wrocław Główny railway station|Wrocław Główny]].

[[File:LOT Polish Airlines Boing 787-8 SP-LRD NRT (24747512573).jpg|thumb|right|[[LOT Polish Airlines]] is Poland's [[flag carrier]], originally established in 1928.]]

The air and maritime transport markets in Poland are largely well developed. Poland has a number of international airports, the largest of which is [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]], the primary global hub for [[LOT Polish Airlines]]. It was established in 1928 from a merger of [[Aerolloyd]] (1922) and [[Aero (Polish airline)|Aero]] (1925). Other major airports with international connections include [[John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice]], [[Copernicus Airport Wrocław]], [[Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport]]. Poland has begun preparations for a construction that can handle 100 million passengers of the [[New Central Polish Airport|Central Communication Port]].

Seaports exist all along Poland's Baltic coast, with most freight operations using [[Port of Świnoujście|Świnoujście]], [[Port of Police|Police]], [[Port of Szczecin|Szczecin]], [[Port of Kołobrzeg|Kołobrzeg]], [[Port of Gdynia|Gdynia]], [[Port of Gdańsk|Gdańsk]] and [[Elbląg]] as their base.
Passenger ferries link Poland with [[Scandinavia]] all year round; these services are provided from Gdańsk and Świnoujście by [[Polferries]], [[Stena Line]] from Gdynia and [[Unity Line]] from the Świnoujście. The [[Port of Gdańsk]] is the only port in the [[Baltic Sea]] adapted to receive oceanic vessels.

In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a flourishing centre of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] (with [[Stefan Banach]], [[Stanisław Mazur]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Stanisław Ulam]]) and [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]] (with [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and [[Antoni Zygmund]]).

Artists from Poland, including famous musicians such as [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Artur Rubinstein|Rubinstein]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]] and [[Henryk Wieniawski|Wieniawski]], and traditional, regionalized [[folk music|folk composers]] create a lively and diverse music scene, which even recognizes its own music genres, such as [[sung poetry]] and [[disco polo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Individuals and Their Social Context |date=31 December 2018 |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Individuals_and_Their_Social_Contexts/T2YLEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |location=Poland |publisher=Institute of Political Studies Polish Academy of Sciences |page=160 |isbn=978-83-65972-34-7}}</ref>

The origins of Polish music can be traced to the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in [[Stary Sącz]] containing [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions related to the Parisian [[Notre Dame School]]. Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and ''[[God Is Born]]'' (a coronation [[Polonaise (dance)|polonaise tune]] for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Mikołaj z Radomia|Nicholas of Radom]], lived in the 15th century. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III; he not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe but blended them with native folk music.<ref name="The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas" />

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers wrote [[liturgical music]] and secular compositions such as [[concerto]]s and [[sonata]]s for voices or instruments. At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]. [[Wojciech Bogusławski]] is accredited with composing the first Polish national [[opera]], titled ''[[:pl:Krakowiacy i Górale|Krakowiacy i Górale]]'', which premiered in 1794.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolff |first=Larry |date=9 January 2012 |title=The Idea of Galicia; History and Fantasy in Habsburg Political Culture |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/The_Idea_of_Galicia/tgjQYHn7BTkC?hl=en&gbpv=0 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=57 |isbn=978-0-8047-7429-1}}</ref>

Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts. All of Chopin's [[List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin|works]] involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the [[musical form]] known as the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ballade]] and made major innovations to the [[piano sonata]], [[mazurka]], [[waltz]], [[nocturne]], [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], [[étude]], [[impromptu]] and [[prelude (music)|prélude]], he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Several Polish composers such as [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] drew inspiration from Chopin's folk-influenced style. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Downes |first=Stephen |date=9 March 2016 |title=The Szymanowski Companion |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/The_Szymanowski_Companion/AHu1CwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=89 |isbn=978-1-317-01444-7}}</ref>

Poland today has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]] created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Poland has also become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillain |first=Charlotte |date=2012 |title=Poland |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Poland/PlF8Xr90I1cC?hl=en&gbpv=0 |publisher=Raintree |page=29 |isbn=978-1-4062-2826-7}}</ref>

{{main|Architecture of Poland}}

Polish cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of European architectural styles. [[Romanesque architecture]] is represented by [[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków]], and [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk]], is characteristic for the [[Brick Gothic]] style found in Poland. Richly decorated [[attic style|attics]] and [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] [[loggia]]s are the common elements of the Polish Renaissance architecture,<ref name="szydlowiec" /><ref name="RENAISSANCE CULTURAL BACKGROUND" /> as evident in the [[Poznań City Hall|City Hall]] in Poznań. For some time the late renaissance style known as [[mannerism]], most notably in the [[Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce|Bishop's Palace]] in [[Kielce]], coexisted with the early baroque style, typified in the [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków|Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kraków]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Miłobędzki |first=Adam |date=1994 |title=The architecture of Poland : a chapter of the European heritage |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Architektura_Ziem_Polski/QAMtAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0&bsq=pa%C5%82ac%20biskup%C3%B3w%20kielce%20manieryzm |location=Poland |language=pl |publisher=International Cultural Centre-Międzynarodowe Centrum Kultury w Krakowie |pages=52–56 |isbn=978-83-85739-14-2}}</ref>

History has not been kind to Poland's architectural monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures have survived: castles, churches, and stately homes, often unique in the regional or European context. Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like [[Wawel Castle]], or completely reconstructed, including the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] and [[Royal Castle in Warsaw|Royal Castle]] of Warsaw and the Old Town of [[Gdańsk]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Centroni |first=Alessandra |date=3 January 2016 |title=Restauro e ricostruzione |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Restauro_e_ricostruzione/vXJTCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |location=Italy |publisher=Gangemi Editore |page=51 |isbn=978-88-492-9191-9}}</ref>

The architecture of Gdańsk is mostly of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] variety, a Gothic style common among the former trading cities along the [[Baltic Sea]] and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of [[Wrocław]] is mainly representative of German architecture since it was for centuries located within the Holy Roman Empire. The centres of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] and [[Sandomierz]] on the [[Vistula]] are good examples of well-preserved medieval towns. Poland's ancient capital, [[Kraków]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spirou |first=Costas |date=13 January 2011 |title=Urban Tourism and Urban Change |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Urban_Tourism_and_Urban_Change/1dOsAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=64 |isbn=978-1-136-85903-8}}</ref>

The second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, such as those of [[Branicki Palace, Białystok|Branicki Palace]] in Białystok, are typical for the Polish baroque. The classical [[Silesian architecture|Silesian baroque]] is represented by the [[University of Wrocław|University in Wrocław]]. The profuse decorations of the [[Branicki Palace, Warsaw|Branicki Palace]] in Warsaw are characteristic of the [[rococo]] style. The centre of Polish classicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king [[Stanisław II Augustus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=John|year=2004|title=Reviewed Work: Literary Activities and Attitudes in the Stanislavian Age in Poland (1764–1795): A Social System? by Jan I.J. van der Meer|journal=Canadian Slavonic Papers|volume=46|issue=1/2|pages=226–229|jstor=40870954}}</ref>

[[File:Kazimierz Dolny Market Square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazimierz Dolny]], the town exemplifies traditional provincial Polish folk architecture.]]

Traditional folk architecture in the villages and small towns scattered across the vast Polish countryside was characterized by its extensive use of wood and [[brick|red brick]] as primary building materials, common for Central Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rączka |first=Jan Władysław |date=2001 |title=Walka o polski styl narodowy w architekturze |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Walka_o_polski_styl_narodowy_w_architekt/zb8VAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0&bsq=architektura%20polski%20drewno%20ceg%C5%82a |location=Poland |language=pl |publisher=Politechnika Krakowska |isbn=978-83-7242-153-1}}</ref> Some of the best preserved and oldest structures include ancient stone temples in [[Silesia]] and fortified wooden [[Wooden churches of Southern Lesser Poland|churches]] across southeastern Poland in the [[Beskids]] and [[Bieszczady Mountains|Bieszczady]] regions of the Carpathian mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1053|title=Wooden Churches of Southern Małopolska|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1424|title=Wooden Tserkvas of the Carpathian Region in Poland and Ukraine|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref> Numerous examples of secular structures such as [[Dwór (manor house)|Polish manor houses]] (''dworek''), [[farmhouses]] ([[:pl:chata|''chata'']]), [[Granary|granaries]], [[Gristmill|mills]], [[barn]]s and country inns ([[:pl:karczma|''karczma'']]) can still be found in some Polish regions.

{{Main|Polish literature|History of philosophy in Poland}}

The earliest examples of [[Polish literature]] date to the 12th century,<ref name="LIT01" /> when Poland's official language was [[Latin]], and early published works were predominantly written by foreigners. [[Gallus Anonymus]], a [[monk]] of disputed origin, was the first chronicler who meticulously described Poland's culture, language and territories in ''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'' (c. 1112–1118).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pamiecpolski.archiwa.gov.pl/objects/the-zamojski-codex|title=The Chronicle of Gallus Anonymus.

Historically, Polish literature concentrated extensively around the themes of true [[drama]] and [[Poem|poetic]]-expressive romanticism than on [[Literary fiction|fiction]]. [[Patriotism]], [[spirituality]] and [[aphorism]]s were paramount and political or social [[allegory|allegories]] were common [[moral]] narratives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Polish-literature|title=Polish literature – Romanticism|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCRm0K8Y-2sC&q=polish+literature+patriotic+morals&pg=PA184|title=Values in the Polish Cultural Tradition|first=Leon|last=Dyczewski|date=29 July 2002|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-142-7|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The particular clothing styles in Poland evolved with each century. In the 1600s high-class [[Szlachta|noblemen]] and [[magnate]]s developed a strong 
sympathy for [[Orientalism]], which was also common in other parts of Europe and became known as [[Sarmatism]].<ref name="visegradinsight.eu" /> The attire mediated between [[Western world|Western]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] styles<ref name="visegradinsight.eu">{{cite web |author=Miltiades Varvounis |date=26 February 2015 |url=http://visegradinsight.eu/sarmatism-and-polands-national-consciousness26022015/ |title="Sarmatism" and Poland's national consciousness |website=Visegrad Insight |access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref> and outfits included a [[żupan]], [[delia]], [[kontusz]], [[Pas kontuszowy|pas]], decorative [[karabela]] swords and less often [[turbans]] brought by foreign merchants. The period of Polish Sarmatism eventually faded in the wake of the 18th century.

The Polish national dress as well as the fashion and etiquette of Poland also reached the royal court at [[Versailles]] in the 1700s. French dresses inspired by Polish attire were called ''à la polonaise'', meaning "Polish-styled". The most famous example is the ''[[Polonaise (clothing)|robe à la polonaise]]'', a woman's garment with draped and swagged [[overskirt]], worn over an underskirt or [[petticoat]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/polonaise-dress |title=Polonaise |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref> Another notable example is the [[Witzchoura]], a long mantle with collar and hood, which was possibly introduced by [[Napoleon]]'s Polish mistress [[Maria Walewska]]. The scope of influence also entailed furniture; rococo [[Polish bed]]s with [[Canopy bed|canopies]] became commonplace in French palaces during the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twGT8P_68lEC&q=lit+a+polonaise+marie+leszczynska&pg=PA586|title=The Wrightsman Collection.

Several Polish designers and stylists left a lifelong legacy of beauty inventions and [[cosmetics]], most notable being [[Maksymilian Faktorowicz]] and [[Helena Rubinstein]]. Faktorowicz created a line of cosmetics company in [[California]] known as [[Max Factor]] and coined the term "make-up" based on the verb phrase "to make up" one's face, now widely used as an alternative for describing cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kobieta.interia.pl/uroda/news-maks-faktorowicz-polak-ktory-stworzyl-kosmetyczne-imperium,nId,930672 |title=Maks Faktorowicz: Polak, który stworzył kosmetyczne imperium |language=pl |trans-title=Maks Faktorowicz: A Pole who created a cosmetic empire |website=Interia Kobieta |access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref> Faktorowicz also raised to fame by inventing modern [[eyelash extensions]] and by providing services to [[Hollywood]] artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/10/501/Artykul/1245535,Maksymilian-Faktorowicz-czlowiek-ktory-dal-nam-sztuczne-rzesy |title=Maksymilian Faktorowicz – człowiek, który dał nam sztuczne rzęsy |language=pl |trans-title=Maksymilian Faktorowicz – a man who gave us false eyelashes |website=Polskie Radio |access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Stella Rose Saint Clair |url=https://www.beautylish.com/a/vxspr/the-history-of-max-factor |date=12 February 2014 |title=Makeup Masters: The History of Max Factor |website=Beautylish |access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Andrzej Wajda 1974.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrzej Wajda]] was one of the greatest Polish film directors, and the recipient of a [[Honorary Oscar]], the [[Palme d'Or]], as well as Honorary [[Golden Lion]] and [[Golden Bear]] Awards.]]

The history of Polish cinema is as long as the history of [[cinematography]] itself. Over the decades, Poland has produced outstanding directors, film producers, cartoonists and actors that achieved world fame, especially in [[Hollywood]]. Moreover, Polish inventors played an important role in the development of world cinematography and modern-day television. Among the most famous directors and producers, who worked in Poland as well as abroad are [[Roman Polański]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the [[Warner Brothers|Warner brothers]] ([[Harry Warner|Harry]], [[Albert Warner|Albert]], [[Sam Warner|Sam]], and [[Jack L. Warner|Jack]]), [[Max Fleischer]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Agnieszka Holland]] and [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tzvetkova |first=Juliana |date=12 October 2017 |title=Pop Culture in Central Europe |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Pop_Culture_in_Europe/Zk83DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=188 |isbn=978-1-4408-4466-9}}</ref>

In the 19th century, throughout partitioned Poland, numerous amateur inventors, such as [[Kazimierz Prószyński]], were eager to construct a film projector. In 1894, Prószyński was successful in creating a [[Pleograph]], one of the first cameras in the world. The invention, which took photographs and projected pictures, was built before the [[Lumière brothers]] lodged their patent.<ref name="culture.pl">{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/a-foreigners-guide-to-polish-cinema|title=A Foreigner's Guide to Polish Cinema |publisher=Culture.pl|access-date=6 April 2018}}</ref> He also patented an [[Aeroscope]], the first successful hand-held operated film camera. In 1897, [[Jan Szczepanik]], obtained a British patent for his [[Telectroscope]]. This prototype of television could easily transmit image and sound, thus allowing a live remote view.<ref name="culture.pl" />

Polish cinema developed rapidly in the [[interwar period]]. The most renowned star of the [[silent film]] era was Polish actress [[Pola Negri]]. During this time, the [[Yiddish cinema]] also evolved in Poland. Films in the [[Yiddish language]] with Jewish themes, such as ''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk]]'' (1937), played an important part in pre-war Polish cinematography. In 1945 the government established '[[Film Polski]]', a state-run film production and distribution organization, with director [[Aleksander Ford]] as the head of the company. Ford's ''[[Knights of the Teutonic Order (film)|Knights of the Teutonic Order]]'' (1960) was viewed by millions of people in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and France.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phil.muni.cz/dedur/?lang=1&id=964|title=Film Culture: Brno 1945–1970.

Wajda's 1975 film ''[[The Promised Land (1975 film)|The Promised Land]]'' was nominated at the [[48th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/16644-the-promised-land-review|title=The Quietus – Film – Film Reviews – Peasant Company Excepted: Andrzej Wajda's The Promised Land|website=The Quietus|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, ''[[Ida (film)|Ida]]'' by [[Paweł Pawlikowski]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ida-a-film-masterpiece|title="Ida": A Film Masterpiece|first=David|last=Denby|date=27 May 2014|access-date=6 April 2018|via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref> In 2019, Pawlikowski received an [[Academy Award for Best Director]] nomination for his historical drama ''[[Cold War (2018 film)|Cold War]]''.

Poland has a number of major media outlets, chief among which are the national television channels. [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] is Poland's [[public broadcasting]] corporation; about a third of its income comes from a [[television licence|broadcast receiver licence]], while the rest is made through revenue from [[television advertisement|commercials]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]]. State television operates two mainstream channels, TVP 1 and TVP 2, as well as regional programs for each of the country's 16 [[voivodeship]]s (as [[TVP3|TVP 3]]).
