'''Yūjirō Motora''' (December 5, 1858 – December 13, 1912<ref name="birthdate">[https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%85%83%E8%89%AF%E5%8B%87%E6%AC%A1%E9%83%8E-142578#E6.9C.9D.E6.97.A5.E6.97.A5.E6.9C.AC.E6.AD.B4.E5.8F.B2.E4.BA.BA.E7.89.A9.E4.BA.8B.E5.85.B8 朝日日本歴史人物事典の解説「生年：安政5.11.1(1858.12.5)」] 元良勇次郎とは - コトバンク</ref>), sometimes also known as '''Yuzero Motora''', was one of the earliest Japanese psychologists. He was known for conducting research on the attention spans of school-aged children, and he set up the first psychological laboratory in Japan.

Born in [[Sanda, Hyōgo]], Motora studied at [[Boston University]] and completed a Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Johns Hopkins University]], but his studies also included significant work on [[physiological psychology]] with [[G. Stanley Hall]]. After graduate school, he returned to Japan, where he served on the faculty of the [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], later known as the University of Tokyo. There he taught a number of students who became influential psychologists and academics. 

A practitioner of [[Zazen|Zen meditation]], he wrote that understanding meditation should be based on a participant's own interpretation rather than the ideas of a Zen master. He also translated the works of eminent Western psychologists into Japanese and conducted early work in [[clinical psychology]]. Motora was still an active researcher and professor when he contracted a fatal case of [[erysipelas]] in his mid-fifties.

==Early life==
Motora was born into a [[samurai]] caste in [[Sanda, Hyōgo]] to Yutaka Sugita and Suga (Motoyama) Sugita, and he had an older brother.<ref name=Alumni/><ref name=Sato/> As a child, Motora was interested in the West and studied English in school.<ref name="Baker">{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=David B.|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology: Global Perspectives|date=2012| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199710652|pages=347–365|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5FoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA350|language=en}}</ref> He was attracted to psychology after reading a textbook written by physiologist [[William Benjamin Carpenter]].<ref name=Alumni/> In 1879, Motora became a teacher at the Tokyo Eiwa School.<ref name=Baker/> Two years later, he married Yone Motora, and her family adopted him. He took up her religion, converting from the Congregational Church to Methodism. When he joined his wife's family, his social status changed from samurai class to commoner.<ref name="McVeigh">{{cite book |last1=McVeigh |first1=Brian J. |title=The History of Japanese Psychology: Global Perspectives, 1875–1950 |date=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4742-8310-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVOjDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA76 |language=en}}</ref> 

In 1883, Motora came to the United States to study philosophy and theology.<ref name=Baker/> He studied at [[Boston University]], a choice influenced by the Tokyo Eiwa School's being established as a [[mission school]] of Boston University.<ref name=Sato/> In late 1885, Motora spoke at two churches in [[Decatur, Illinois]], telling the congregations that he hoped his education in Boston would prepare him to return to Japan and convert people to Christianity. The Decatur newspaper, which referred to Motora as "the Jap. preacher", said that the churches collected money to defray Motora's educational expenses.<ref name="Preacher">{{cite news |title=The Jap. preacher |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/6975137/ |work=Decatur Daily Republican |date=November 2, 1885 |language=en}}</ref>

==Work with G. Stanley Hall==
Dissatisfied with his education in Boston, Motora went to [[Johns Hopkins University]] to study under experimental psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]].<ref name=Sato/> Around that time, Hall's laboratory was home to several students who went on to become prominent academics, including [[Edmund Sanford]], [[Clifton F. Hodge]], and [[James H. Hyslop]].<ref name=AJP/> When Motora applied to Johns Hopkins, he indicated a particular interest in [[physiological psychology]].<ref name=Sato/> However, his interests shifted once he got to the school. While he still studied under Hall, he majored in [[philosophy]]. His thesis was titled ''Exchange: Considered as the Principles of Social Life''.<ref name="Sternberg">{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=International Handbook of Intelligence|date=2004|publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521004022|pages=303–305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbNLJl_L6MMC&pg=PA305|language=en}}</ref>

Beginning in the mid-1880s, Motora translated new theories of Western psychology – such as the [[James–Lange theory]] and [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s three-dimensional theory of feelings – for publication in Japan.<ref name="Arakawa">{{cite journal|last1=Arakawa|first1=Ayumu|title=Psychology of feelings and emotions: Its history in Japan|journal=Japanese Psychological Research|date=May 1, 2005|volume=47|issue=2|pages=106–114|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5884.2005.00278.x|language=en|issn=1468-5884|doi-access=free}}</ref> Though he had translated Wundt's work, Motora came to believe that emotion was a product of only one dimension: pleasure versus displeasure.<ref name=Arakawa/>

Despite his emphasis on philosophy, Motora maintained some interest in physiological psychology. When Japanese psychologist Sho Watase visited Motora in the U.S., he and two of Motora's colleagues were given helmets with electrical wires on them. The men wore the helmets to bed for several nights in an attempt to share the electrical output of their brains with one another. Motora thought that this might cause the men to experience the same dreams. "It was our opinion that the fault might not be with the doctor's theory, but rather with ourselves, for the helmets often came off while we were asleep as we were restless," Watase said, adding that Motora never brought up such an experiment to him again.<ref name=AJP/> 

Motora and Hall collaborated on an 1888 study of the skin's sensitivity to changes in pressure; their paper was published in the first issue of the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]''. Hall later remembered Motora as a modest and reserved student who seemed to have few interests outside of his studies in philosophy and psychology.<ref name="AJP">{{cite journal|title=Professor Yuzero Motora|journal=American Journal of Psychology|date=July 1, 1913|volume=24|issue=3|pages=441–443|jstor=1413045}}</ref> Motora earned a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1888.<ref name="Alumni">{{cite news|title=Necrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyQwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA354|issue=4|work=Johns Hopkins Alumni Magazine|date=June 1913|language=en|last1 = Wroth|first1 = Lawrence Counselman}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Coming back to Japan after his doctoral studies, Motora became principal of the Tokyo Eiwa School. Shortly thereafter, he also took a part-time faculty position at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1889, Motora presented a lecture on [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] at the Tokyo Eiwa School, but the lecture ran afoul of their religious tradition established by Methodist missionaries. Motora resigned from the school, devoting his attention to lecturing full-time at Tokyo Imperial University.<ref name=Baker/> By 1890, Motora authored ''Psychology'', the first Japanese scientific textbook in his field. The same year, Motora was promoted to the rank of professor at Tokyo Imperial University, though there was not a full psychology department at the time. He was named the chair of psychology, ethics and logic three years later.<ref name=Baker/>

In 1895, Motora kept a journal of a week-long period practicing [[Zazen|Zen meditation]] at [[Engaku-ji]], a Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Zen meditation involves the use of a [[koan|kōan]], a prompt that can be used to assess a student's progress in Zen. Motora's kōan was [[Koan#The sound of one hand|"What is the sound of clapping with only one hand?"]] Motora required 16 attempts and a hint from the Zen master before he was able to provide an answer that satisfied the Zen master. He later wrote that Zen should be understood through personal interpretation rather than through a Zen master, and this became an influential thought in early Japanese psychology.<ref name="Zen">{{cite journal|last1=Kato|first1=Hiroki|title=Zen and psychology|journal=Japanese Psychological Research|date=2005|volume=47|issue=2|pages=125–136|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5884.2005.00280.x|url=http://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/Zen-and-psychology.pdf|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 1903, with the assistance of one of his former students, [[Matatarō Matsumoto]], Motora set up Japan's first formal laboratory in experimental psychology at the university.<ref name="Sato">{{cite journal|last1=Sato|first1=Tatsuya|last2=Sato|first2=Takao|title=The early 20th century: Shaping the discipline of psychology in Japan1|journal=Japanese Psychological Research|date=May 1, 2005|volume=47|issue=2|pages=52–62|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5884.2005.00273.x|language=en|issn=1468-5884| url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-5884.2005.00273.x}}</ref> They had a spare room in Motora's office building that could have been used for research, but the acoustics of the room created too much noise for psychological experiments, and soon Motora and Matsumoto converted a 12-room house from the school's pathology department into a psychology lab.<ref name=Sato/> 

While working with school-aged children who were thought to be mentally retarded, Motora found that students who had difficulties with academic achievement were much more likely to be suffering from attention span problems than mental retardation.<ref name=Sternberg/> Motora invented a device that would help children sustain their concentration.<ref name=Sato/> He authored the first descriptions in the Japanese literature of a condition consistent with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].<ref name="Takeda">{{cite journal|last1=Takeda|first1=Toshinobu|last2=Ando|first2=Mizuho|last3=Kumagai|first3=Keiko|title=Attention deficit and attention training in early twentieth-century Japan|journal=ADHD: Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders|date=December 16, 2014|volume=7|issue=2|pages=101–111|doi=10.1007/s12402-014-0157-7|pmid=25512142|s2cid=36845664|language=en|issn=1866-6116}}</ref>

Motora was named a member of the [[Japan Academy|Imperial Academy of Sciences]] and was awarded the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], Second Class.<ref name=Alumni/> He was selected to give a presentation at the 1905 International Congress of Psychology, where he read a paper on the concept of the self based on his experience with meditation.<ref name="Bulletin">{{cite journal|last1=Sato|first1=Tatsuya|last2=Hidaka|first2=Tomo|last3=Takasuna|first3=Miki|title=Psychology in Japan: History and future trends in Japanese psychology|journal=Bulletin of the International Union of Psychological Science|date=July 2014|volume=6|issue=7|page=7|url=http://www.iupsys.net/dotAsset/bab7a539-2222-4d0e-8127-2ffdf7ed390a.pdf}}</ref>

==Protégés==
Several of Motora's students became prominent academics. In 1906, Matsumoto established the psychological laboratory at [[Kyoto University]], which was the second formal psychology lab in Japan.<ref name=Imada/> He later succeeded Motora as psychology faculty at Tokyo Imperial University.<ref name="Emergence">{{cite book|last1=Embleton|first1=Sheila M.|last2=Joseph|first2=John Earl|last3=Niederehe|first3=Hans-Josef|title=The Emergence of the Modern Language Sciences: Historiographical perspectives|date=1999|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-1556197598|page = 284 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Emergence_of_the_Modern_Language_Sci/MFsZa_uvmBQC?hl=en&gbpv=1|url-access=registration|language=en}}</ref> [[Chen Daqi]], who came from China to study under Motora, was later responsible for the first Chinese psychology laboratory and psychology textbook.<ref name="Baker2">{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=David B.|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology: Global Perspectives|date=2012|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195366556|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uRnGeBAaRMC&pg=PA98|language=en}}</ref>

Yoshihide Kubo studied with Motora at Tokyo Imperial University before going to [[Clark University]], where Hall had become president. When he joined the faculty at [[Hiroshima University]], Kubo adapted the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Binet-Simon intelligence test]] for Japanese use. His study of intelligence was furthered by another Motora pupil, Tohru Watanabe, who created Japan's first [[group intelligence]] test.<ref name="Imada">{{cite book|last1=Imada|first1=Hiroshi|title=Origin and Development of Scientific Psychology in Different Parts of the World: Retrospect and Prospect at the Turn of the Century|date=2002|publisher= Psychology Press |isbn=9781841692890|page=400|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSmfU7RbE7YC&pg=PA400|language=en}}</ref> [[Hiroshi Hayami]], who also studied under Motora, brought word of [[behaviorism]] to Japan. Later, Hayami became president of [[Keijō Imperial University]].<ref name=Sato/>

[[Thoughtography#Tomokichi Fukurai|Tomokichi Fukurai]], another of Motora's students, attained short-lived recognition in the field but is mostly known for his discredited work in [[parapsychology]]. Fukurai was hired to teach [[abnormal psychology]] at Tokyo Imperial University.<ref name=Arakawa/> Gradually, he became more interested in studying psychical phenomena such as [[clairvoyance]].<ref name=Sato/> In the United States, scholars had already taken dismissive attitudes toward paranormal research, but Fukurai was apparently unaware of this since he had studied only in Japan. In 1910, when Fukurai insisted that he had identified three clairvoyant women, Motora tried to convince him to drop this line of research. Fukurai did not publicize his interest in the paranormal until after Motora's death in 1912. The year after Motora died, Fukurai published a controversial book about clairvoyance. Matsumoto had taken over as the department chair, and he asked Fukurai to take a leave of absence. Fukurai's employment was automatically terminated once his two-year leave expired.<ref name="Affair">{{cite journal |last1=Takasuna |first1=Miki |title=The Fukurai affair: Parapsychology and the history of psychology in Japan |journal=History of the Human Sciences |date=April 2012 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=149–164 |doi=10.1177/0952695111426659 |s2cid=143833240 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254096783}}</ref> To prevent further damage to the department's reputation, Matsumoto removed all abnormal psychology lectures from the curriculum, focusing the department's teaching and research on psychological phenomena that could be measured through objective means. The other [[Imperial Universities]] also deemphasized the teaching of abnormal psychology through the 1930s.<ref name=Affair/> Thus, "the Fukurai affair" led to a change in focus that delayed the development of [[clinical psychology]] in Japan until after World War II.<ref name=Sato/>   

Motora did not conduct research in fine arts or aesthetics, but a number of alumni from his department became known for their work in this area. For example, while Matsumoto is better known as the founding president of the Japanese Psychological Association, he also became president of the [[Kyoto City University of Arts|Kyoto Prefectural School of Art and Crafts]]. [[Naoteru Ueno]] was the director of the [[Osaka Municipal Museum of Art]] and the first president of [[Tokyo University of the Arts]]. Mantaro Kido combined his interests in psychology and [[calligraphy]], researching the application of the arts to [[educational psychology]].<ref name="Arakawa2">{{cite journal |last1=Arakawa |first1=Ayumu |title=Japanese history of the psychology of fine arts and aesthetics |journal=Japanese Psychological Research |date=2016 |volume=58 |issue=S1 |pages=56–69 |doi=10.1111/jpr.12119 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jpr.12119 |language=en |issn=1468-5884|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Marra">{{cite book |last1=Marra |first1=Michael F. |title=A History of Modern Japanese Aesthetics |date=2001 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-2399-3 |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_P330pBK2PoC&pg=PA156 |language=en}}</ref>

==Death==
Motora died in Tokyo on December 13, 1912. He had been sick with [[erysipelas]] for several months but had remained active in psychological research until just before his death.<ref name="Scholar">{{cite news |title=Death of noted scholar |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Japan_Times_Mail/bIQ-AQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1 |work=The Japan Times |date=December 21, 1912 |page=539}}</ref> He and his wife had five children.<ref name=Alumni/>
