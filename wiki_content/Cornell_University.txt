'''Cornell University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] and [[Statutory college|statutory]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]], based in [[Ithaca, New York]].

The university is organized into seven [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] colleges and seven [[graduate school|graduate]] divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its specific admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite campuses, one in [[New York City]] and one in [[Education City]], [[Qatar]].

Cornell is one of the few private [[land-grant university|land grant universities]] in the United States.{{NoteTag|The others are the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the publicly funded but "privately governed" [[University of Delaware]].}} Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are [[statutory college|state-supported statutory or contract colleges]] through the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school. Of Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. As a land grant college, Cornell operates a [[cooperative extension]] outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions.<ref name="Spitzer 2005"/> The main campus of Cornell University in [[Ithaca, New York]] spans 745 acres (more than 4,300 acres when the [[Cornell Botanic Gardens]] and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.fs.cornell.edu/about/faq.cfm#CP_JUMP_5682| title=Cornell University Facilities Services FAQ|access-date=March 25, 2014}}</ref>

Alumni and affiliates of Cornell have reached many notable and influential positions in politics, media, and science. As of September 2021, 61 Nobel laureates, four Turing Award winners and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Cornell.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Cornell University}}

Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865; the [[New York State|New York State (NYS) legislature]] authorized the university as the state's [[land-grant university|land grant]] institution. Senator [[Ezra Cornell]] offered his farm in [[Ithaca, New York]], as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Fellow senator and educator [[Andrew Dickson White]] agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and [[faculty (university)|faculty]].<ref name="founding">{{cite book |last = Becker |first = Carl L. |author-link = Carl L.

Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research to its own campus and to outreach efforts. For example, in 1883, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered [[dynamo]] to light the grounds.<ref name=chp>{{cite web |url = http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html |title = The Early History of District Energy at Cornell University |access-date=November 24, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704140529/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html |archive-date=July 4, 2007 }}</ref> Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;<ref>{{cite book |last=Gelber |first= Sidney |year=2001 |title = ''Politics and Public Higher Education in New York State: Stony Brook: A Case History'' |location=New York |publisher=P.

{{anchor|At What Cost?, Cornell}}A [[Graduate school|graduate student]] group, At What Cost?, formed at Cornell in August 2002 to oppose a [[graduate student unionization]] drive run by an organization called CASE/UAW that was affiliated with the [[United Auto Workers]].

The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic [[architectural style]]s, including ornate [[Collegiate Gothic]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] buildings, and the more spare [[international style (architecture)|international]] and [[modern architecture|modernist]] structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate [[World War II]].

These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus.

On December 19, 2011, Cornell and the [[Technion-Israel Institute of Technology]] won a competition for rights to claim free city land and $100&nbsp;million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1&nbsp;million square foot state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on [[Roosevelt Island]], on the site of the former [[Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital]].  Instruction began in the fall of 2012, in a temporary location in Manhattan ([[111 Eighth Avenue]]), in space donated by [[Google]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec11/NYCcover.html|title='Game-changing' tech campus goes to Cornell, Technion|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=December 17, 2011}}</ref> [[Thom Mayne]], of the architecture firm [[Morphosis]], has been selected to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island.

Cornell consists of nine privately endowed and four publicly supported "[[statutory college]]s": the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. These statutory colleges received $131.9&nbsp;million in [[State University of New York|SUNY]] appropriations in 2010–2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, which makes them accountable to SUNY trustees and other state agencies. The budget also includes $3.9&nbsp;million of state funds for Cornell Cooperative Extension that is matched by the federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suny.edu/GovtRelations/state/pdf/BudgetDocument.pdf|title=State University of New York 2010-2011 Budget|access-date=December 19, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60ExSq6zT?url=http://www.suny.edu/GovtRelations/state/pdf/BudgetDocument.pdf|archive-date=July 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Ramanujan>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April07/2007StateBudget.kr.html|title=State budget pleases CU administrators |last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna |date=April 17, 2007|work=The Cornell Chronicle|access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Graffeo 2005">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/search/display.html?terms=&url=/nyctap/I05_0016.htm|title=3 No. 14: In the Matter of Jeremy W.

Cornell is [[decentralized]], with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own [[college admissions|admissions]] and advising programs, and confers its own [[academic degree|degrees]]. The only university-wide requirements for a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degree are to pass a [[human swimming|swimming]] test, take two [[physical education]] courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.cornell.edu/studying.html|title=Studying Computing and Information Science|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=September 20, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828233933/http://www.cis.cornell.edu/studying.html|archive-date=August 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://biology.cornell.edu/academics/|title=Cornell Biology: Intro to the Major|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=September 20, 2010}}</ref> All academic departments are affiliated with at least one college; the last department without such an affiliation, the [[Cornell Africana Studies and Research Center]], merged with the College of Arts and Sciences in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2010/12/02/day-hall-merges-africana-center-arts-college-director-resigns-protes |title=Day Hall Merges Africana Center Into Arts College; Director Resigns in Protest |first1=Lawrence |last1=Lan |first2=Ben |last2=Gitlin |work=Cornell Daily Sun |date=December 2, 2010 |access-date=December 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043314/http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2010/12/02/day-hall-merges-africana-center-arts-college-director-resigns-protes |archive-date=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>

In the early 1980s, Cornell deployed the first [[IBM 3090]]-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. In 1984, the [[National Science Foundation]] began work on establishing five new [[supercomputer]] centers, including the [[Cornell Theory Center|Cornell Center for Advanced Computing]], to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. As an NSF center, Cornell deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software and deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell deployed Red Cloud, one of the first cloud computing services designed specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National Science Foundation [[Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment]] (XSEDE) supercomputing program, providing coordination for XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cac.cornell.edu/about/history.aspx|title=Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing History and Awards|date=April 2012|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>

Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as [[Hans Bethe]], contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] (see also: [[List of Cornell Manhattan Project people]]). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second [[cyclotron]] in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study [[synchrotron radiation]]. During the 1990s, the [[Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source|Cornell Electron Storage Ring]], located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/42/1/11|title=Cornell's laboratory is at the crossroads|work=CERN Courier |access-date=May 23, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lns.cornell.edu/accelphys/cesr.shtml|title=Accelerator Physics: Cornell Electron Storage Ring|publisher=Cornell University |access-date=July 4, 2006}}</ref> After building the synchrotron at Cornell, [[Robert R.

Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of ''Alpha-series'' chapters. The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was designed by [[John Russell Pope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx |title=The Cornell Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity |publisher=Alphadeltaphi.org |date=February 11, 1929 |access-date=August 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826152136/http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx |archive-date=August 26, 2016 }}</ref> Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 21,668 [[community service]] and [[advocacy]] hours and raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic efforts.<ref name=Greek/> Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards. As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's [[justice system]].<ref name="Greek"/>

===Press and radio===<!-- Any publications discussed here should pertain chiefly to Student life -- Scholarly publications belong in the Press and scholarly publications section above -->
The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. Student-run newspapers include ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', an independent daily; ''[[The Cornell Review]]'', a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and ''[[The Cornell Progressive]]'', a liberal newspaper published every month.

Other press outlets include ''[[The Cornell Lunatic]]'', a campus humor magazine; the ''[[Cornell Chronicle]]'', the university's newspaper of record; and ''[[Kitsch (magazine)|Kitsch Magazine]]'', a [[feature story|feature magazine]] published in cooperation with [[Ithaca College]]. ''The Cornellian'' is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&q=&id=225 |title=Cornellian |publisher=Cornell University|access-date=April 22, 2010}}</ref> Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on [[WVBR]], an independent commercial [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station owned and operated by Cornell students.

===Housing===
[[File:Cornell footbridge.jpg|thumb|right|One of several [[footbridge]]s that span Cornell's [[gorge]]s and ease commuting from housing to academic buildings on campus]]
University housing is broadly divided into three sections: [[Cornell North Campus|North Campus]], [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]], and Collegetown. Cornell began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential advisors (RAs) within the campus system.  In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus, including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen as well as sorority and fraternity houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ri.campuslife.cornell.edu/Ri_article_page_view.asp?action=article&ID=2318|title=The Residential Initiative: North Campus|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=January 1, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111114439/http://ri.campuslife.cornell.edu/Ri_article_page_view.asp?action=article&ID=2318|archive-date=November 11, 2005}}</ref>

The options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program houses and co-op houses.

{{Main|Cornelliana}}
Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include [[Slope Day]], a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and [[Dragon Day]], which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts Quad and then set afire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55|title=History of Dragon Day|publisher=Cornell University|access-date = May 23, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909042704/http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=September 9, 2006}}</ref>

According to legend, if a virgin crosses the [[Arts Quad]] at midnight, the statues of [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fs.cornell.edu/tours/default.cfm?tour_id=41 |title=Fall Creek Gorge: Suspension Bridge Virtual Tour|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7&nbsp;m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27&nbsp;kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/pumpkin_tale.html|title=Pumpkin Tale| publisher=Cornell News Service|access-date=June 5, 2006}}</ref> The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1067490000|title=Ask Uncle Ezra|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=December 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621021015/http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1067490000|archive-date=June 21, 2010}}</ref> The clock tower also plays music.

The school colors are [[carnelian (color)|carnelian]] (a shade of red) and white, a play on "Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White.
