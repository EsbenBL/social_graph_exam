The '''Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Верхо́вна Ра́да Украї́ни|translit=|Verkhovna Rada Ukrayiny|translation=Supreme Council of Ukraine}}, Ukrainian abbreviation ''ВРУ''), often simply '''Verkhovna Rada''' or just '''Rada''',<ref>started with capitalized letter. Don't confuse with the TRK "Rada" ({{lang-uk|ТРК "Рада"}})- the official TV channel and production studio of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.</ref> is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[parliament]] of [[Ukraine]]. The Verkhovna Rada is composed of 450 [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]], who are presided over by a [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|chairman]] ([[speaker (politics)|speaker]]). The Verkhovna Rada meets in the [[Verkhovna Rada building]] in Ukraine's capital [[Kyiv]]. The deputies elected in the 21 July [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] were inaugurated on 29 August 2019.<ref>[https://112.international/ukraine-top-news/first-session-of-new-verkhovna-rada-to-be-held-on-august-29-42498.html First session of new Verkhovna Rada to be held on August 29], [[112 Ukraine]] (9 August 2019)</ref>

The Verkhovna Rada was transformed out of the system of republican representative body known in the [[Soviet Union]] as [[Supreme Soviet]] (Supreme Council)<ref name="history">[http://history.org.ua/?termin=Verkhovna_Rada_Ukrainy Verkhovna Rada] in the [[Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine]]</ref> that was first established 26 June 1938 as a type of legislature of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] after the dissolution of the [[All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets|Congress of Soviets of the Ukrainian SSR]].

In the last elections to the Verkhovna Rada, a [[Parallel voting|mixed voting]] system is used. 50% of seats are distributed under party lists with a 5% [[election threshold]] and 50% through [[first-past-the-post]] in [[single-member constituency|single-member constituencies]].<ref name="newUKRelectionlawof171111IFU">{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.com.ua/ukr/main/85997/|script-title=uk:ВР ухвалила закон про вибори народних депутатів|trans-title=VR adopted law on the election of MPs to parliament|language=uk|publisher=[[Interfax Ukraine]]|date=18 November 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108075020/http://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/85997.html|archive-date=8 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="newUKRelectionlawof171111">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/117151/ Parliament passes law on parliamentary elections], [[Kyiv Post]] (17 November 2011)</ref> The method of 50/50 mixed elections was used in the 2002, 2012, 2014 and 2019 elections; however, in 2006 and 2007, the elections were held under a proportional system only.<ref name="backtopast">[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/126521/ Ukrainian communists to seek return to proportional electoral system], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 November 2012)</ref> According to the election law that became valid on 1 January 2020 the [[2023 Ukrainian parliamentary election|next election to the Verkhovna Rada (set for 2023)]]<ref name="chesno.org/post/3402EFGH"/> again will be held under a proportional scheme.<ref name="633561ElectoralCodeVR"/>

==Name==
The name ''[[Rada]]'' ({{lang-uk|Рада}}) means "council", "rede". The institution originated in the time of [[Kyivan Rus]], and then represented a council of [[boyar]]s and of higher [[clergy]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Padokh|first= Y.|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\B\O\BoyarCouncil.htm|title= Boyar Council|access-date= 2007-10-13|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref> In the 17th and 18th centuries the [[Dnieper Cossacks]] used the term to refer to the meetings where major decisions were made; the Cossacks elected new councils by popular vote.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\G\E\GeneralMilitaryCouncil.htm|title= General Military Council|access-date= 2007-10-13|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref>

The [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] between 17 March 1917 and 29 April 1918 had a [[Central Rada]].<ref>
{{cite encyclopedia

}}
</ref>
The [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the Ukrainian government-in-exile each had a UNRada (Ukrainian National Rada).

''Verkhovna'', the feminine form of the adjective {{lang|uk|"верховний"}} meaning ''supreme'', derives from the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] word {{lang|uk|"верх"}} meaning "top".

Another name, used less often, is the ''Parliament of Ukraine'' ({{lang-uk|Парламент України}}).

{{see also|Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian National Council}}
The [[Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR]] replaced the [[All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets]] and was a type of legislative authority of Soviet Ukraine according to the 1937 [[Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets had already been renamed the Supreme Council in 1927.<ref>[[Serhy Yekelchyk]] '"Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-19-530546-3}}, page 89''</ref> The Congress of Soviets was initiated by its [[All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee|Central Executive Committee]], which it elected and held accountable. The last chairman of the committee was [[Hryhoriy Petrovsky]] (also known as Grigoriy Petrovskiy in Russian transliteration).

The [[1938 Ukrainian Supreme Soviet election|first elections]] to the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR took place on 26 June 1938. The first session of the parliament took place in Kyiv from 25 July through to 28 July 1938. The first Chairman of the council was [[Mykhailo Burmystenko]] who later died during [[World War II]]. In 1938, a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Presidium]] was elected by the council that was chaired by [[Leonid Korniyets]]. The Presidium represented the council whenever it was not in session.

During the war the Presidium was evacuated to the city of [[Saratov]] in the [[Russian SFSR]]. On 29 June 1943, the Presidium issued an order postponing elections for the new convocation for one year while extending the first convocation. On 8 January 1944, the [[Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR]] in agreement with the Communist Party decided to relocate the Presidium of the Supreme Council from Kharkiv to Kyiv. New elections were scheduled for 9 February 1947 for the Council.

The twelfth convocation of the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR issued the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine]] on 16 July 1990, and declared [[Act of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] on 24 August 1991, at approximately 6 p.m. local time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Rres_Declaration_Independence_rev12.htm|title=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Resolution On Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|access-date=2007-10-11|work=Official website of the Verkhovna Rada|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930203430/http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Rres_Declaration_Independence_rev12.htm|archive-date=2007-09-30}}</ref> At the time, the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]] was [[Leonid Kravchuk]].

Members of the Verkhovna Rada are known officially as ''People's deputies of Ukraine''.

===Chairman and deputy chairmen===
[[File:«С. Р. А. председатель Верховной рады.png».png|thumb|207x207px|Chairman of the Rada, [[Ruslan Stefanchuk]]]]
{{Main|Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada}}
The Verkhovna Rada elects from among its ranks a Chairman ([[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]; {{lang-uk|Голова Верховної Ради}}), a First Deputy Chairman, and a Second Deputy Chairman.<ref name="Rada Leaders offi site">[http://gska2.rada.gov.ua/site/eng/kerivnytstvo.htm Leaders of The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine], Official website of the Verkhovna Rada.</ref>

Before the Chairman of a newly convoked Rada is elected, [[parliamentary session]]s are presided over by members of a temporary presidium of the first session ({{lang-uk|тимчасова президія першої сесії}}). The temporary presidium is composed of five deputies, representing the four largest parliamentary fractions plus the chairman of a preparatory deputy group of the first parliamentary session, however the Rada may enact an ''[[ad hoc]]'' deviation from this composition rule.

The Chairman presides over parliamentary sessions, signs bills and sends them to the [[President of Ukraine|President]] for [[promulgation]], signs and promulgates parliamentary acts (other than bills), organises staff work, etc.<ref name="c-88">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_88|title=Article 88|access-date=2007-10-11|work=[[Wikisource]]}}</ref> The Chairman is also empowered to call [[special session]]s of parliament,<ref name="c-83">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_83|title=Article 83|access-date=2007-10-11|work=[[Wikisource]]}}</ref> enact bills [[veto]]ed by the [[President of Ukraine|President]] when the Verkhovna Rada votes to overturn a veto by a [[Supermajority#Two-thirds majority|two-thirds majority]], and participate in meetings of the [[National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine|National Security and Defence Council]].<ref name="c-107">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_107|title=Article 107|access-date=2007-10-11|work=[[Wikisource]]}}</ref>

In circumstances where the post of President of Ukraine becomes vacant, the Chairman of the Rada becomes acting head of state with limited authority.<ref name="c-112">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_112|title=Article 112|access-date=2007-10-11|work=[[Wikisource]]}}</ref> The Chairman in duties of the President may dissolve parliament, appoint or submit for parliamentary approval candidates for key official posts, grant military ranks or state orders, and exercise the right of [[pardon]].<ref name="c-112"/> The Constitution and Ukrainian legislation contain no provision for presidential succession in cases where the posts of President and Chairman of the Rada are vacant simultaneously.

===Presidium===
{{main|Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada}}

The Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada is a collective name that was adapted for the Chairman and his or her deputies out of tradition. Before the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], it was an official office that was elected at the first session of each convocation of the Supreme Soviet. Originally it consisted of a chairman, the chairman's two deputies, a secretary, and 19 additional members. Later compositions of the Presidium changed. The Presidium was regulated by Section 106 of the 1978 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR. Since independence the institution has been discontinued, but the term is used for the leadership of parliament that includes the current Chairman and his or her deputies and may include faction leaders.

The first session of every newly elected parliament is headed by a temporary presidium that consists of six members of parliament according to Article 18 of the Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada.

===Ceremonial opening and first session of new convocation===
One of the most important sessions of the parliament is the first session of each newly elected parliament. The preparation for the session is conducted by the Preparation deputy group with support from the Office of the Verkhovna Rada. The formation of the group out of the newly elected People's Deputies is conducted by the Chairman of the previous convocation or his/her deputy chairpersons (Article 13, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada). The group elects its own chairperson, his or her deputy and a secretary on principles for establishing the temporary special commission. The group terminates its activity with establishment of parliamentary committees.

Before the opening of the first session of each newly elected parliament, all newly elected People's Deputies of Ukraine are gathered for a special ceremonial meeting to take the oath of office (article 14, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada). An Invitation to take the oath is given by the Chairperson of the previous convocation who grants the leading word to the oldest member of the parliament who asks the members of parliament to rise and reads the oath out-loud. Every member of parliament signs a copy of the oath that is held in the archives of the Verkhovna Rada.

The [[plenary session|plenary meetings]] of the first session reviews the following matters: formation of the provisional presidium of the first session, establishment and registration of the factions, the situation concerning legislation pending before parliament with the Chairman of the previous convocation, election of the Counting Commission, election of the Chairman, election of the Chairman's deputies, hearing of extraordinary messages on domestic and foreign affairs by the President of Ukraine, hearing and discussion of the Preparation deputy group report, about the parliamentary committees, about Conciliation board of deputy factions in the Verkhovna Rada and about media coverage of the activities and sessions held by the Verkhovna Rada.

=== Office of the Verkhovna Rada ===
[[File:Logo of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.svg|thumb|Logo of the Verkhovna Rada used before 2020]]
The Office of the Verkhovna Rada is an internal supporting department of the Verkhovna Rada that provides organizational, legal, social, analytical and other support to parliament, its other departments and members of the parliament. The Office is apolitical in its role, and exists mainly to provide secretarial help.

Before the first session of each newly elected parliament the Office provides to members of parliament various documents among which are copies of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada, the official results of election from the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]], the Law of Ukraine on the status of People's Deputies, among others (Article 12, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada).

===Office of the Ombudsman===
The Office of the Ombudsman at the Verkhovna Rada was established in 1998 and was led by [[Nina Karpachova]] until 2012. The Office has its own secretariat and advisory council. The current Ombudsman is [[Lyudmyla Denisova]] who replaced [[Valeriya Lutkovska]] in 2017.

===Committees===
{{main|Committees of the Supreme Council of Ukraine}}
The Verkhovna Rada establishes parliamentary committees composed of various deputies.<ref name="Commitees1212">[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/rada-approves-composition-of-all-committees-318139.html Rada approves composition of all committees], [[Kyiv Post]] (25 December 2012)</ref> On 4 December 2014, the current parliament formed 27 committees and 2 special control commissions.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/238036.html Rada sets up 27 committees, 2 special control commissions], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 December 2014)</ref> The previous parliament (2012-2014) had 29 committees and an ad hoc supervisory board.<ref name=Commitees1212/> The sixth session of the Rada (2007–2012) had 28 committees, including the Budget Committee, the Special Control Commission of the Verkhovna Rada on Privatization and the Committee on Transportation and Communications. There are no permanent or [[standing committee]]s; instead, committees are reformed from one convocation to another. One of the most significant for the work of the Verkhovna Rada is the Budget Committee.

===Investigative commissions===
Members of the Verkhovna Rada are permitted to create temporary investigative commissions. To create such a commission requires one third of the constitutional composition of parliament, 150 members. Before a draft on creation of such a commission may be scheduled for voting, it has to be approved by a relevant committee, the Committee on Regulations, deputy ethics, and ensuring the work of the Verkhovna Rada.

==Elections==

[[File:Выборы на Украине 2007 (2).jpg|thumbnail|A woman with [[ballot]] during [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election]]]]
Political developments in Ukraine have led to repeated changes in the electoral system used for parliamentary elections. Each [[convocation]] of the Verkhovna Rada has been elected under a different set of laws gradually evolving from the purely majoritarian scheme inherited from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era to a purely [[Proportional representation|proportional scheme]], effective from 2006 until 2010. The [[2023 Ukrainian parliamentary election|next election to the Verkhovna Rada (set for 2023)]]<ref name="chesno.org/post/3402EFGH">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.chesno.org/post/3402/ Early to rejoice? Regular parliamentary elections may take place under Yanukovych's law], [[Civil movement "Chesno"]] (11 July 2019)</ref> again will be held under a proportional scheme.<ref name="633561ElectoralCodeVR"/>

In the [[1990 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1990]] and [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994]] elections, all 450 MPs were elected in [[Simple majority voting|single-member districts]]. Ukraine was therefore divided at the time into 450 electoral districts. Each district sent one member to parliament. In order to win a seat, a candidate needed more than 50% of the votes. If no candidate had 50%, then the two leading candidates participated in a run-off vote.

In the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2002]] elections,<ref name=backtopast/> 225 MPs were elected in single-member districts as earlier (with the exception that the candidate needed only a simple majority to win). The remaining 225 MPs were elected on a [[Proportional representation|proportional basis]]. These seats were divided between the parties who passed a 4% electoral threshold.

In the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2006]] and [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2007]] elections, all deputies were elected on a proportional basis. All seats were divided between the parties who passed a 3% electoral threshold. For the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2007 election]], the threshold percentage was not changed, but some amendments to the election process were made. In the [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2012]], [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2014]] and [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2019]] elections<ref name="dateset">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/95986/ Parliament mulls 3 Feb vote to amend Constitution], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (31 January 2011)<br />[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96077/ Parliament sets parliamentary elections for October 2012, presidential elections for March 2015], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (1 February 2011)<br />[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96081/ Ukraine sets parliamentary vote for October 2012], [[Kyiv Post]] (1 February 2011)<br />[http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100125/157671733.html Early parliamentary elections may take place in May - Ukraine's Yanukovych], [[RIA Novosti]] (25 January 2010)</ref> a mixed voting system was again used (50% under party lists and 50% under simple-majority [[constituencies]])<ref name=newUKRelectionlawof171111IFU/> with a 5% [[election threshold]].<ref name="newUKRelectionlawof171111"/>
