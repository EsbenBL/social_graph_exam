==History==
===1916–1979===
[[File:Robert S. Brookings.jpg|thumb|Founder [[Robert S. Brookings]] (1850–1932)]]
Brookings was founded in 1916 as the Institute for Government Research (IGR), with the mission of becoming "the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.brookings.edu/about/history|title=Brookings Institution History|publisher=Brookings Institution| website= Brookings.edu|access-date=February 11, 2017|date=2001-11-30}}</ref>

The Institution's founder, philanthropist [[Robert S. Brookings]] (1850–1932), originally created three organizations: the Institute for Government Research, the Institute of Economics (with funds from the [[Carnegie Corporation]]), and the Robert Brookings Graduate School affiliated with [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. The three were merged into the Brookings Institution on December 8, 1927.<ref name=RSB/><ref name=Critchlow>{{cite book|last=Critchlow|first=Donald T.| title= The Brookings Institution, 1916–1952: Expertise and the Public Interest in a Democratic Society |url=https://archive.org/details/brookingsinstitu00crit|url-access=registration|location= DeKalb, Illinois|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780875801032}}</ref>

During the [[Great Depression]], economists at Brookings embarked on a large-scale study commissioned by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to understand its underlying causes. Brookings's first president, Harold Moulton, and other Brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose Roosevelt's [[National Recovery Administration]] because they thought it impeded economic recovery.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.brookings.edu/lib/depression.htm|title=Brookings History: The Depression|publisher=Brookings Institution| website= Brookings.edu|access-date=February 11, 2017| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070712105512/http://www.brookings.edu/lib/depression.htm|archive-date=July 12, 2007}}</ref>

With the U.S. entry into [[World War II]] in 1941, Brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization. In 1948, Brookings was asked to submit a plan for administering the European Recovery Program. The resulting organization scheme assured that the [[Marshall Plan]] was run carefully and on a businesslike basis.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.brookings.edu/lib/war.htm|title=Brookings History: War and Readjustment| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070712105725/http://www.brookings.edu/lib/war.htm|archive-date=July 12, 2007}}</ref>

In 1952, Robert Calkins succeeded Moulton as president of the Brookings Institution. He secured grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] that put Brookings on a strong financial basis. He reorganized it around the Economic Studies, Government Studies, and Foreign Policy Programs. In 1957, Brookings moved from Jackson Avenue to a new research center near [[Dupont Circle]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/lib/academic.htm|title=Brookings History: Academic Prestige| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814201129/http://www.brookings.edu/lib/academic.htm|archive-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>

[[Kermit Gordon]] assumed the presidency of Brookings in 1967. He began a series of studies of program choices for the federal budget in 1969 titled "Setting National Priorities." He also expanded the Foreign Policy Studies Program to include research in national security and defense. After [[Richard Nixon]] was elected president in 1968, the relationship between Brookings and the White House deteriorated; at one point Nixon's aide [[Charles Colson]] proposed a firebombing of the institution.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Woodward |first1= Bob| last2= Bernstein |first2=Carl |date=June 1974 |title= All the President's Men |url=https://archive.org/details/allpresidentsme00bern |url-access=registration |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page= [https://archive.org/details/allpresidentsme00bern/page/324 324]}}</ref> Yet throughout the 1970s, Brookings was offered more federal research contracts than it could handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/lib/doubts.htm|title=Brookings History: National Doubts and Confusion| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814201228/http://www.brookings.edu/lib/doubts.htm|archive-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>

After Gordon died in 1976, [[Gilbert Y. Steiner]], director of the governmental studies program, was appointed the fourth and acting president of the Brookings Institution by the board of trustees.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Derthick|first=Martha|last2=Nivola|first2=Pietro S.|date=July 2006|title=Gilbert Yale Steiner|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/gilbert-yale-steiner/04796F1F2BF34965C8DE9BB21D750113|journal=PS: Political Science & Politics|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=551–554|doi=10.1017/S1049096506210813|issn=1537-5935|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Dews|first=Fred|date=November 6, 2017|title=Profiles of Brookings’s leaders since 1927|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/11/06/profiles-of-brookings-leaders-since-1927/|access-date=July 6, 2021|website=Brookings Institution}}</ref> As director of the governmental studies program, Steiner brought in numerous scholars whose research ranges from administrative reform to urban policy, not only enhancing the visibility and influence of the Brookings program in Washington and nationally, but also producing works that have survived as classics in the field of political science.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=March 11, 2021|title=Gilbert Steiner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2006/03/11/gilbert-steiner/870c45b3-13c7-4514-bf91-feed3858534e/|access-date=July 6, 2021|website=The Washington Post}}</ref>

==Political stance==
As a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization, Brookings describes itself as independent and nonpartisan.

''The Times'' published documents showing that Brookings accepted grants from [[Norway]] with specific policy requests and helped it gain access to U.S. government officials, as well as other "deliverables".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/07/us/07thinktank-docs5.html|title= Longstanding Partners: Norway and Brookings|date=September 6, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/07/us/07thinktank-docs6.html| title= The High North, Climate Change and Norway|date=September 6, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 17, 2014}}</ref> In June 2014, Norway agreed to make an additional $4 million donation to Brookings.<ref name=":0"/> Several legal specialists who examined the documents told the paper that the language of the transactions "appeared to necessitate Brookings filing as a foreign agent" under the [[Foreign Agent Registration Act]].<ref name=":1"/>

The Qatari government, named by ''The New York Times'' as "the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings", reportedly made a $14.8 million, four-year contribution in 2013. A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said that "he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers".<ref name=":0"/> Brookings officials denied any connection between the views of their funders and their scholars' work, citing reports that questioned the Qatari government's education reform efforts and criticized its support of militants in Syria. But Brookings officials reportedly acknowledged that they meet with Qatari government officials regularly.<ref name=":0"/>

In 2018, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Brookings accepted funding from [[Huawei]] from 2012 to 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/08/chinese-companys-surprising-ties-brookings-institution/|title=Huawei's surprising ties to the Brookings Institution|last=Stone Fish|first=Isaac|date=December 7, 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=August 4, 2019}}</ref> A report by the [[Center for International Policy]]'s [[Center for International Policy#Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative|Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative]] of the top 50 think tanks on the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program#Global Go To Think Tank Index|Global Go-To Think Tanks]] rating index found that between 2014 and 2018, Brookings received the third-highest amount of funding from outside the United States compared to other think tanks, with a total of more than $27 million.<ref>{{cite report|last=Freeman|first=Ben|date=January 2020|title=Foreign Funding of Think Tanks in America|publisher=[[Center for International Policy]] |page=12 |url=https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_4f06e99f35d4485b801f8dbfe33b6a3f.pdf|access-date=September 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200901175135/https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_4f06e99f35d4485b801f8dbfe33b6a3f.pdf|archive-date=September 1, 2020|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Buildings==
The main building of the Institution was erected in 1959 on 1775 Massachusetts Avenue. In 2009, Brookings acquired a building across the street, a former mansion built by the Ingalls family in 1922 on a design by [[Jules Henri de Sibour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2farchive%2frealestate%2f1979%2f11%2f24%2ftrusting-in-preservation%2ff2ca6c36-5cff-4812-aeb5-4cbd0fc0c460%2f%3f|title=Trusting in Preservation |date=November 24, 1979 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> This extension now houses the office of the President of the Brookings Institution.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
