'''Richard David Wolff''' (born April 1, 1942) is an American [[Marxian economist]], known for his work on [[economic methodology]] and [[class analysis]]. He is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], and currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the [[New School]] in New York. Wolff has also taught economics at [[Yale University]], [[City University of New York]], [[University of Utah]], [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University|University of Paris I (Sorbonne)]], and [[Brecht Forum|The Brecht Forum]] in New York City.

In 1988 Wolff co-founded the journal ''[[Rethinking Marxism]]''. In 2010 he published ''Capitalism Hits the Fan: The Global Economic Meltdown and What to Do About It'', also released on DVD. In 2012 he released three new books: ''Occupy the Economy: Challenging Capitalism'', with [[David Barsamian]] (San Francisco: [[City Lights Books]]), ''Contending Economic Theories: Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian'', with [[Stephen Resnick]] (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London: MIT University Press), and ''Democracy at Work'' (Chicago: [[Haymarket Books]]). In 2019 he released his book ''Understanding Marxism'' (Democracy at Work).<ref>{{cite web|last=Rampell|first=Ed|title=Understanding “Wolff-ism”: Prof. Richard Wolff's Take on Karl Marx in New Text|url=https://hollywoodprogressive.com/understanding-marxism/|access-date=May 23, 2019|publisher=[[Hollywood Progressive]]|date=May 22, 2019|archive-date=June 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604012633/https://hollywoodprogressive.com/understanding-marxism/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Wolff hosts the weekly 30-minute-long program Economic Update, which is produced by the non-profit Democracy at Work, which he co-founded. Economic Update is on YouTube, FreeSpeech TV, [[WBAI-FM]], New York City ([[Pacifica Radio]]), CUNY TV ([[WNYE-TV|WNYE-DT3]]), and available as a podcast. Wolff is featured regularly in television, print, and internet media. ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' has named him "America's most prominent Marxist economist".<ref name=davidson>{{cite news|last=Davidson|first=Adam|title=It Is Safe to Resume Ignoring the Prophets of Doom ...

== Early life and education ==
To escape [[Nazism]], Wolff's parents emigrated from Europe to the United States during [[World War II]]. His father, a French lawyer working until that point in [[Cologne|Cologne, Germany]], gained employment as a steelworker in [[Youngstown, Ohio]] (in part because his European certification was not recognized in the United States), and the family eventually settled outside New York City. His mother was a German citizen.<ref name=demos>{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Amy|title=Democracy Now!

Wolff states that his European background influenced his world view: 
<blockquote>"[E]verything you expect about how the world works probably will be changed in your life, that unexpected things happen, often tragic things happen, and being flexible, being aware of a whole range of different things that happen in the world, is not just a good idea as a thinking person, but it's crucial to your survival. So, for me, I grew up convinced that understanding the political and economic environment I lived in was an urgent matter that had to be done, and made me a little different from many of my fellow kids in school who didn't have that sense of the urgency of understanding how the world worked to be able to navigate an unstable and often dangerous world. That was a very important lesson for me."<ref name=demos /></blockquote>

Wolff earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in history from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1963 and moved on to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]—he attained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in economics in 1964—to study with [[Paul A. Baran]]. Baran died prematurely from a [[heart attack]] in 1964 and Wolff transferred to [[Yale University]], where he received an MA in economics in 1966, MA in history in 1967, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[economics]] in 1969. As a graduate student at Yale, Wolff worked as an instructor.<ref name="CV">{{Cite web | last = Wolff | first = Richard D. | title = Wolff C.V. | url = http://www.umass.edu/resnick-wolff/Wolff_curriculum_vitae.pdf | access-date = October 5, 2011 | archive-date = January 1, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101114054/http://www.umass.edu/resnick-wolff/Wolff_curriculum_vitae.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> His [[Thesis|dissertation]], "Economic Aspects of British Colonialism in Kenya, 1895–1930",<ref>{{oclc|682061093}}</ref> was eventually published in book form in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Richard D.|title=Economics of Colonialism: Britain and Kenya, 1870–1930|year=1974|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-01639-0}}</ref>

== Career ==
Wolff taught at the [[City College of New York]] from 1969 to 1973. Here he started his lifelong collaboration with fellow economist [[Stephen Resnick]], who arrived in 1971 after being denied tenure at Yale for signing an anti-war petition.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=Rajesh |last2=Seda-Irizarry |first2=Ian J. |title=Re-centering Class in Critical Theory: A Tribute to Stephen A.

Wolff retired in 2008 but remains professor emeritus and that year joined [[The New School]] as a visiting professor.

The first co-authored academic publication by Wolff and Resnick was "The Theory of Transitional Conjunctures and the Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism,"<ref>Resnick, S. and Wolff, R. (1979). "The Theory of Transitional Conjunctures and the Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism," ''Review of Radical Political Economics'', 11:3, 3–22 and 32–36.</ref> which laid out the pillars of the framework that they have worked on ever since. They formulated a non-[[Determinism|determinist]], class-analytical approach for understanding the debates regarding the transition from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]]. Their topics have included Marxian theory and value analysis, [[overdetermination]], radical economics, international trade, [[business cycles]], social formations, the [[Soviet Union]], and comparing and contrasting Marxian and non-Marxian economic theories.

Wolff's work with Resnick took [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Étienne Balibar]]'s ''[[Reading Capital]]'' as its point of departure and developed a subtle reading of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' Volumes II and III in their influential ''Knowledge and Class''. For the authors, Marxian class analysis entails the detailed study of the conditions of existences of concrete forms of performance, appropriation, and distribution of [[surplus labor]]. While there could be an infinite number of forms of surplus appropriation, the Marxist canon refers to ancient (independent), slave, feudal, capitalist, and communist class processes.

{{Rquote|right|Marx used the word "exploitation" to focus analytical attention on what capitalism shared with feudalism and slavery, something that capitalist revolutions against slavery and feudalism never overcame.|Richard D.

''[[Truthout]].'' Retrieved May 27, 2015.</ref>}}

In 1989, Wolff joined efforts with a group of colleagues, ex- and then current students to launch ''[[Rethinking Marxism]]'', an academic journal that aims to create a platform for rethinking and developing Marxian concepts and theories within economics as well as other fields of social inquiry. For more than two decades, he served as a member of the editorial board of the journal. Currently, he continues to serve as a member of the advisory board of the journal.

Wolff was a visiting professor in spring 1994 at [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]]. Wolff continues to teach graduate seminars and undergraduate courses and direct dissertation research in economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and, most recently, in the graduate program in international affairs (GPIA) at [[The New School]].

One of his students, [[George Papandreou]], became [[Prime Minister of Greece]] serving from 2009 to 2011. Wolff remembers Papandreou as a student who "sought then to become both a sophisticated and a socialist economist."<ref>[http://www.rdwolff.com/content/interview-vima-newspaper-greek-publication Interview in "To Vima" Newspaper - Greek Publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315072700/http://rdwolff.com/content/interview-vima-newspaper-greek-publication |date=March 15, 2013 }}, January 24, 2011, translated by and uploaded on RDWolff.com</ref> However, [[City University of New York|CUNY]] Economics professor [[Costas Panayotakis]] observed that "after being elected Greek prime minister in the fall of 2009 on a platform that excoriated [[austerity]] as the wrong kind of policy to be adopted at a time of deep [[economic crisis]], George Papandreou has reversed himself and, faced with a debt crisis, called in the [[International Monetary Fund]] and imposed the most brutal [[austerity]] program the country has ever seen."<ref name=costas>[http://postcapitalistproject.org/node/100 "Capitalism, Socialism, and Economic Democracy: Reflections on Today's Crisis and Tomorrow's Possibilities"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105000633/http://postcapitalistproject.org/node/100 |date=November 5, 2016 }}, by Costas Panayotakis, ''Envisioning a Post-Capitalist Order'', December 2010</ref>
