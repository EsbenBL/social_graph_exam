The book highlighted issues of sharp political divisions, recurrent armed conflicts, and periodic foreign interventions.<ref name="Insurrection">{{cite book|last=Tutino|first=John|title=From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750-1940|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|pages=130|isbn=0-691-02294-1}}</ref> Molina Enríquez focused particularly on two aspects, [[land reform]] and the rights of the indigenous people and their place in society socially. Molina Enríquez was arrested by the government of [[Francisco León de la Barra]] on August 25, 1911 for publishing the document, which has later been described as highly influential on the eve of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name="Hacienda">{{cite book|last=Young|first=Eric Van|title=Hacienda and Market in Eighteenth-Century Mexico: The Rural Economy of the Guadalajara Region, 1675-1820|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2006|pages=xxi|isbn=0-7425-5356-6}}</ref><ref name="Absence">{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Peter V.

Certain prominent personalities within the Mexican liberal tradition such as [[Melchor Ocampo]], [[Ignacio Ramírez (politician)|Ignacio Ramírez]], [[Ponciano Arriaga]], José María del Castillo Velasco, and Isidoro Olvera had always had a "social" element to their liberalism inspired by French radicalism and utopian socialism, and this strand of thought influenced Molina Enríquez and other participants in the Mexican Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Witker Velásquez |first1=Jorge |title=El Constitucionalismo Económico en la Carta de Querétaro 1917-2017 |date=2016 |publisher=Cámara de Diputados |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Raat |first1=William Dirk |title=Mexico, from Independence to Revolution, 1810-1910 |date=1982 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |pages=140}}</ref>

===Indigenous rights===
Molina Enríquez argued indigenous people suffered because of position on national social structure. In order to resolve the suffering of the indigenous people, and create equality, Molina Enríquez believed they had to be integrated into the national state, this idea would be central to the indigenist movement when it went international.<ref name="Indigenous">{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Andrew|title=Indigenous Rights and Development: Self-determination in an Amazonian|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=1997|pages=50|isbn=1-57181-875-8}}</ref> Molina Enríquez has been cited as arguing that the only true Mexicans were the [[mestizos]] and that they would be the inheritors of Mexico, classifying the other social group in Mexico as [[Criollo (people)|Criollos]], who were [[Spanish people|Spanish]]/[[French people|French]] in their thinking and ways, the mestizos to Molina Enríquez, were a new race, with a new culture of their own and the majority of Mexicans.<ref name="Word">{{cite book|last=De Mente|first=Boye Lafayette|title=There's a Word for It in Mexico|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1998|pages=xxix|isbn=0-8442-7251-5}}</ref> Molina Enríquez believed that the "liberales mestizos" were the group most capable of carrying out the modernization of the country.<ref name="Saladino" /> In ''La Reforma y Juárez'' (1906), he praised [[Benito Juárez]] and the Reform Era as a time of political virtues in contrast to the corruption of the Porfiriato.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Jane-Dale |title=Cuatro cuestiones de la cuestión agraria decimonónica |date=1997 |publisher=Universidad Iberoamericana |pages=105-106}}</ref>

===Land reform===
Molina Enríquez believed land reform was needed. In August 1911, he issued the Plan de Texcoco as a prelude to revolt, in which he called for establishing a [[dictatorship]] committed to land reform.<ref name="Absence" /> A version of the Plan de Texcoco was published in the newspaper ''El Imparcial'', which condensed the land reform section, with the Decree over the breaking up of large properties saying <blockquote>It is declared that on the basis of public utility, from the date of this decree [August 23, 1911], the partial expropriation of all the rural estates with a surface area that exceeds two thousand hectares. Popular action may denounce the real estate that should be expropriated in keeping with this law. The denouncer has the right to choose the best part of the land suitable for expropriation.<ref>Plan de Texcoco by Andres Molina Enríquez published in ''El Imparcial'', translation by Stanley F. Shadle. Shadle, ''Andrés Molina Enríquez'', Appendix. p. 114.</ref></blockquote> The role of the dictatorship would be to parcel out large [[hacienda]]s to individual, not communal claimants. Molina Enríquez would eventually go on to be a key adviser to the committee which drafted [[Mexican constitution#Article 27|article 27]] of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution]] and a member of the National Agrarian Commission.<ref>Stanley Shadle, ''Andrés Molina Enríquez: Mexican Land Reformer of the Revolutionary Era''.
