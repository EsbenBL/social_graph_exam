Plekon has had a long career as an academic, [[theologian]] and clergy member. Since 1977, Plekon has taught at [[Baruch College]], first as an Assistant Professor, and eventually as a Professor within the [[Weissman School of Arts and Sciences]] since 1998. In addition to his academic work, he has served as an Associate Priest as St. Gregory Orthodox Church in [[Wappingers Falls, New York]] since 1996. Ordained in 1983 in the Lutheran Church in America (LCA), later the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) Plekon was later received into the Orthodox Church in America (OCA). For almost 40 years, he has served as a parish pastor, alongside teaching and research. He is writing about his pastoral experiences and is examining the importance of community, not only for church but for meaning and depth in one's life in a book in progress. This work also deals with our need, in a diverse America,  to cross into other cultures and religious traditions with respect, learning from them and becoming deeper persons from this encounter. This was something he experienced in his own family's ecumenical sensitivity.<ref name="The Department of Sociology and Anthropology: Michael Plekon">{{cite web|url=http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/anthropology/mplekon.htm|title=Michael Plekon biography|publisher=Baruch College|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Eastern Christian Books">{{cite web|url=http://easternchristianbooks.blogspot.com/2011/07/authorial-interview-fr-michael-plekon.html|title=Authorial Interview: Fr.

==Biography==

Plekon's interest in studying religion began early on when he chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in [[Sociology]] and [[Philosophy]] from the [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1970. He later obtained a [[master’s degree]] and a doctorate in Sociology and Religion from [[Rutgers University]] in New Jersey. Plekon's [[doctoral advisor]] was renowned sociologist of religion and theologian [[Peter L. Berger]], who mentions Plekon in his memoir among his students of interest as an "expert in the Orthodox (Christian) diaspora in the West.".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY}}</ref>

Plekon met his wife Jeanne through a long-time friend while she was pursuing a master's in [[art history]] and [[museum studies]] at The Clark Institute, Williams College. They have been married since 1976 and have two children, Paul and Hannah.
