'''Piaget's theory of cognitive development''' is a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human [[intelligence]]. It was originated by the Swiss [[developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980). The theory deals with the [[epistemology|nature of knowledge]] itself and how humans gradually come to acquire, construct, and use it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyse/cognitive_development/0|title=Cognitive Development - Encyclopedia of Special Education: A Reference for the Education of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Disabilities and Other Exceptional Individuals - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}</ref> Piaget's theory is mainly known as a [[Developmental stage theories|developmental stage theory]]. 

In 1919, while working at the Alfred Binet Laboratory School in Paris, Piaget "was intrigued by the fact that children of different ages made different kinds of mistakes while solving problems".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Psychology|last=Franzoi|first=Stephen|isbn=978-1-5178014-2-7|pages=119}}</ref> His experience and observations at the Alfred Binet Laboratory were the beginnings of his theory of cognitive development.<ref>{{Citation|last=Piaget|first=Jean|title=Jean Piaget.|date=1952|url=http://content.apa.org/books/11154-011|work=A History of Psychology in Autobiography, Vol IV.|pages=237–256|editor-last=Boring|editor-first=Edwin G.|place=Worcester|publisher=Clark University Press|language=en|doi=10.1037/11154-011|access-date=2021-02-28|editor2-last=Werner|editor2-first=Heinz|editor3-last=Langfeld|editor3-first=Herbert S.|editor4-last=Yerkes|editor4-first=Robert M.}}</ref>

Piaget believed that children are not like "little adults" who may know less; children just think and speak differently. By thinking that children have great cognitive abilities, Piaget came up with four different cognitive development stages, which he put out into testing. Within those four stages he managed to group them with different ages. Each stage he realized how children managed to develop their cognitive skills. For example, he believed that children experience the world through actions, representing things with words, thinking logically, and using reasoning.

To Piaget, [[cognitive development]] was a progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. He believed that children construct an understanding of the world around them, experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment, then adjust their ideas accordingly.<ref name=McLeod>{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S. A.|title=Piaget {{!}} Cognitive Theory|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|publisher=Simply Psychology|access-date=18 September 2012}}</ref> Moreover, Piaget claimed that cognitive development is at the center of the human organism, and language is contingent on knowledge and understanding acquired through cognitive development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/edinburghthinkl/jean_piaget/0|title=JEAN PIAGET - Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}</ref> Piaget's earlier work received the greatest attention.

Child-centered classrooms and "[[open education]]" are direct applications of Piaget's views.<ref>Great Lives from History: The Twentieth Century; September 2008, p1–3</ref> Despite its huge success, Piaget's theory has some limitations that Piaget recognized himself: for example, the theory supports sharp stages rather than continuous development ([[horizontal and vertical décalage]]).<ref name="go.galegroup.com2"/>

==Nature of intelligence: operative and figurative==
Piaget noted that [[reality]] is a dynamic system of continuous change. Reality is defined in reference to the two conditions that define dynamic systems. Specifically, he argued that reality involves transformations and states.<ref>Piaget, J. (1977). The role of action in the development of thinking. In ''Knowledge and development'' (pp. 17–42). Springer US.</ref> ''Transformations'' refer to all manners of changes that a thing or person can undergo. ''States'' refer to the conditions or the appearances in which things or persons can be found between transformations. For example, there might be changes in shape or form (for instance, liquids are reshaped as they are transferred from one vessel to another, and similarly humans change in their characteristics as they grow older), in size (a toddler does not walk and run without falling, but after 7 yrs of age, the child's sensory motor anatomy is well developed and now acquires skill faster), or in placement or location in space and time (e.g., various objects or persons might be found at one place at one time and at a different place at another time). Thus, Piaget argued, if human [[intelligence]] is to be adaptive, it must have functions to represent both the transformational and the static aspects of reality.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX1562500095&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=15311e6ee67b398da4f1a1967f58503d|title=Constructivism|first=Garance|last=Maréchal|date=30 November 2009|journal=Encyclopedia of Case Study Research|volume=1}}</ref> He proposed that operative intelligence is responsible for the representation and manipulation of the dynamic or transformational aspects of reality, and that figurative intelligence is responsible for the representation of the static aspects of reality.<ref>Piaget, J., & Inhelder, B. (1973). ''Memory and intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.</ref>

''Operative intelligence'' is the active aspect of intelligence. It involves all actions, overt or covert, undertaken in order to follow, recover, or anticipate the transformations of the objects or persons of interest.<ref name="Furth, H. G. 1977">Furth, H. G. (1977). The operative and figurative aspects of knowledge in Piaget's theory. B. A. Geber (Ed.). London, England: Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> ''Figurative intelligence'' is the more or less static aspect of intelligence, involving all means of representation used to retain in mind the states (i.e., successive forms, shapes, or locations) that intervene between transformations. That is, it involves [[perception]], [[imitation]], [[mental image]]ry, drawing, and language.<ref name="go.galegroup.com1">{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3407100185&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=b71fd57e9d31971ea40106f27e199015|title=Piaget, Jean (1896-1980)|first=Howard E.|last=Gruber|date=30 November 2003|journal=Learning and Memory}}</ref> Therefore, the figurative aspects of intelligence derive their meaning from the operative aspects of intelligence, because states cannot exist independently of the transformations that interconnect them. Piaget stated that the figurative or the representational aspects of intelligence are subservient to its operative and dynamic aspects, and therefore, that understanding essentially derives from the operative aspect of intelligence.<ref name="Furth, H. G. 1977"/>

At any time, operative intelligence frames how the world is understood and it changes if understanding is not successful. Piaget stated that this process of understanding and change involves two basic functions: ''assimilation'' and ''accommodation''.<ref name="go.galegroup.com1"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3406000055&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=174d9bd2c42c2e8475446e5c13301c8d|title=Assimilation|date=30 November 2000|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300066&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=ed09320c311b0c0e856cb2ce7c4cd810|title=Assimilation|first=Jill Englebright|last=Fox|date=30 November 2005|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1|doi=10.4135/9781412952484.n54|isbn=9781412904759}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3403200491&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=8de3eeb14aba519a97e788201dd42234|title=Piaget, Jean (1896&ndash;1980)|first=DAVID|last=ELKIND|date=30 November 2001|journal=Encyclopedia of Education|volume=5}}</ref>

===Assimilation and accommodation===
Through his study of the field of education, Piaget focused on two processes, which he named [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|assimilation]] and [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|accommodation]]. To Piaget, assimilation meant integrating external elements into structures of lives or environments, or those we could have through experience.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1522/030181265|title=connaissance de l'objet d'étude avec la connaissance du sujet étudiant entre assimilation et accommodation|last2=Dantier|first2=Bernard|date=2011|publisher=J.-M. Tremblay|isbn=978-1-4123-7505-4|location=Chicoutimi|doi=10.1522/030181265}}</ref> ''Assimilation'' is how humans [[Perception|perceive]] and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to new information. It is the process of fitting new information into pre-existing cognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]].<ref name=Stassen_p44>{{cite book|first1=Kathleen Stassen|last1=Berger|title=The developing person through the life span|publisher=Worth|isbn=9780716760801|date=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/developingperson0000berg_d0w9/page/44 44]|edition=7th|url=https://archive.org/details/developingperson0000berg_d0w9/page/44}}</ref> Assimilation in which new experiences are reinterpreted to fit into, or assimilate with, old ideas and analyzing new facts accordingly.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Kathleen Stassen|last1=Berger|title=The developing person through the life span|publisher=Worth|isbn=9780716760801|date=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/developingperson0000berg_d0w9/page/45 45]|edition=7th|url=https://archive.org/details/developingperson0000berg_d0w9/page/45}}</ref> It occurs when humans are faced with new or unfamiliar information and refer to previously learned information in order to make sense of it. In contrast, ''accommodation'' is the process of taking new information in one's environment and altering pre-existing schemas in order to fit in the new information. This happens when the existing schema (knowledge) does not work, and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation.<ref name="simplypsychology.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|title=Jean Piaget - Cognitive Theory - Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org}}</ref> Accommodation is imperative because it is how people will continue to interpret new concepts, schemas, frameworks, and more.<ref>"Block, Jack"  "Assimilation, Accommodation, and the Dynamics of Personality Development"</ref> Piaget believed that the human brain has been programmed through [[human evolution|evolution]] to bring equilibrium, which is what he believed ultimately influences structures by the internal and external processes through assimilation and accommodation.<ref name=Stassen_p44 />

Piaget's understanding was that assimilation and accommodation cannot exist without the other.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = Jack | year = 1982 | title = Assimilation, accommodation, and the dynamics of personality development | journal = Child Development | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 281–295 | doi=10.2307/1128971| jstor = 1128971 }}</ref> They are two sides of a coin. To assimilate an object into an existing mental schema, one first needs to take into account or accommodate to the particularities of this object to a certain extent. For instance, to recognize (assimilate) an apple as an apple, one must first focus (accommodate) on the contour of this object. To do this, one needs to roughly recognize the size of the object. Development increases the balance, or equilibration, between these two functions. When in balance with each other, assimilation and accommodation generate mental schemas of the operative intelligence. When one function dominates over the other, they generate representations which belong to figurative intelligence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etec512learningconference-piaget.weebly.com/theory.html|title=Theory|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref>

==Four stages of development==
In his theory of [[cognitive development]], Jean Piaget proposed that humans progress through four developmental stages: the ''sensorimotor'' stage, ''preoperational'' stage, ''concrete operational'' stage, and ''formal operational'' stage.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Kathleen Stassen|last1=Berger|title=The developing person through the life span|publisher=Worth|isbn=9780716760801|date=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/developingperson0000berg_d0w9/page/43 43]|edition=7th|url=https://archive.org/details/developingperson0000berg_d0w9/page/43}}</ref>

===Sensorimotor stage===

The first of these, the '''sensorimotor stage'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--> "extends from birth to the acquisition of language".<ref>Tuckman, Bruce W., and David M. Monetti. ''Educational Psychology''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2010. Print</ref> In this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) from physical interactions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping).<ref>Bernstein, Penner, and Clarke-Stewart, Roy. ''Psychology Study Guide''</ref> Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/sensorimotor.html|title=Sensorimotor Stage}}</ref> They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought toward the end of the stage.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Children learn that they are separate from the environment. They can think about aspects of the environment, even though these may be outside the reach of the child's senses. In this stage, according to Piaget, the development of ''[[object permanence]]'' is one of the most important accomplishments.<ref name=Stassen_p44 /> Object permanence is a child's understanding that an object continues to exist even though they cannot see or hear it.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> [[Peekaboo|Peek-a-boo]] is a game in which children who have yet to fully develop object permanence respond to sudden hiding and revealing of a face.   By the end of the sensorimotor period, children develop a permanent sense of self and object and will quickly lose interest in Peek-a-boo.<ref name="Santrockk"/>

|"Coordination of sensation and action through reflexive behaviors".<ref name="Santrockk"/> Three primary reflexes are described by Piaget: sucking of objects in the mouth, following moving or interesting objects with the eyes, and closing of the hand when an object makes contact with the palm ([[palmar grasp]]). Over the first six weeks of life, these reflexes begin to become voluntary actions. For example, the palmar reflex becomes intentional grasping.<ref name="Gruber">{{cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |year=1977 |title=The essential Piaget |url=https://archive.org/details/essentialpiaget0000piag |url-access=registration |editor1-first=H.E. |editor1-last=Gruber |editor2-first=J.J. |editor2-last=Voneche |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>

|Development of [[habit (psychology)|habits]]. "Infants become more object-oriented, moving beyond self-preoccupation; repeat actions that bring interesting or pleasurable results".<ref name="Santrockk"/> This stage is associated primarily with the development of [[Motor coordination|coordination]] between [[Visual perception|vision]] and [[Prehensility|prehension]]. Three new abilities occur at this stage: intentional grasping for a desired object, secondary circular reactions, and [[Inductive reasoning aptitude|differentiations]] between ends and means. At this stage, infants will intentionally grasp the air in the direction of a desired object, often to the amusement of friends and family. Secondary circular reactions, or the repetition of an action involving an external object begin; for example, moving a switch to turn on a light repeatedly. The differentiation between means and ends also occurs. This is perhaps one of the most important stages of a child's growth as it signifies the dawn of [[logic]].<ref name="Gruber"/>

This is an extremely important stage of development, holding what Piaget calls the "first proper [[intelligence]]". Also, this stage marks the beginning of [[goal-oriented|goal orientation]], the deliberate planning of steps to meet an [[Goal|objective]].<ref name="Gruber"/>

|}

===Preoperational stage===
By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate the second stage of his theory, the pre-operational stage. He said that this stage starts towards the end of the second year. It starts when the child begins to learn to speak and lasts up until the age of seven. During the pre-operational stage of cognitive development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/piagetstheory/p/preoperational.htm|title=What Is the Preoperational Stage of Cognitive Development?|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref> Children's increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children's play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved.

The pre-operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs ([[magical thinking]]). The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still [[Egocentrism|egocentric]], meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into ''two'' substages: the symbolic function substage, and the [[Intuition|intuitive]] thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of "why?" and "how come?" This stage is when children want to understand everything.<ref name="Santrock8">Santrock, John W. (2004). ''Life-Span Development (9th Ed.)''. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill College – Chapter 8</ref>

====Symbolic function substage====
At about two to four years of age, children cannot yet manipulate and transform information in a logical way. However, they now can think in images and symbols. Other examples of mental abilities are language and pretend play. Symbolic play is when children develop imaginary friends or role-play with friends. Children's play becomes more social and they assign roles to each other. Some examples of symbolic play include playing house, or having a tea party. The type of symbolic play in which children engage is connected with their level of creativity and ability to connect with others.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Russ|first=S. W.|title=Pretend play, affect, and creativity|journal=New Directions in Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts, Foundations and Frontiers in Aesthetics|year=2006|pages=239–250}}</ref> Additionally, the quality of their symbolic play can have consequences on their later development. For example, young children whose symbolic play is of a violent nature tend to exhibit less prosocial behavior and are more likely to display [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] tendencies in later years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Judy|author2=Hughes, Claire|title="I Got Some Swords And You're Dead!": Violent Fantasy, Antisocial Behavior, Friendship, And Moral Sensibility In Young Children|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00292|pmid=11333080|volume=72|issue=2|pages=491–505|year=2001}}</ref>

In this stage, there are still limitations, such as egocentrism and precausal thinking.

[[File:Egocentrism1.Musfica.png|thumb|Egocentrism]]
[[Egocentrism]] occurs when a child is unable to distinguish between their own perspective and that of another person. Children tend to stick to their own viewpoint, rather than consider the view of others. Indeed, they are not even aware that such a concept as "different viewpoints" exists.<ref>Piaget, A Child's Conception of Space, Norton Edition, 1967; p. 178</ref> Egocentrism can be seen in an experiment performed by Piaget and Swiss developmental psychologist [[Bärbel Inhelder]], known as the [[three mountain problem]]. In this experiment, three views of a mountain are shown to the child, who is asked what a traveling doll would see at the various angles. The child will consistently describe what they can see from the position from which they are seated, regardless of the angle from which they are asked to take the doll's perspective. Egocentrism would also cause a child to believe, "I like ''[[Sesame Street]]'', so Daddy must like ''Sesame Street'', too."

Similar to preoperational children's egocentric thinking is their structuring of a [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationships. Piaget coined the term "precausal thinking" to describe the way in which preoperational children use their own existing ideas or views, like in egocentrism, to explain cause-and-effect relationships. Three main concepts of causality as displayed by children in the preoperational stage include: [[animism]], artificialism and [[Transduction (psychology)|transductive]] reasoning.<ref name="Rathus 2006">{{cite book|last=Rathus|first=Spencer A.|title=Childhood: voyages in development|url=https://archive.org/details/childhoodvoyages0000rath|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|location=Belmont, CA}}</ref>

Animism is the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities. An example could be a child believing that the sidewalk was mad and made them fall down, or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy. Artificialism refers to the belief that environmental characteristics can be attributed to human actions or interventions. For example, a child might say that it is windy outside because someone is blowing very hard, or the clouds are white because someone painted them that color. Finally, precausal thinking is categorized by transductive reasoning. Transductive reasoning is when a child fails to understand the true relationships between cause and effect.<ref name="Santrock8"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage2.htm | title=Preoperational Stage | access-date=February 2, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728114723/http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage2.htm | archive-date=July 28, 2013 }}</ref> Unlike [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] or [[inductive reasoning]] (general to specific, or specific to general), transductive reasoning refers to when a child reasons from specific to specific, drawing a relationship between two separate events that are otherwise unrelated. For example, if a child hears the dog bark and then a balloon popped, the child would conclude that because the dog barked, the balloon popped.

====Intuitive thought substage====
At between about the ages of 4 and 7, children tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence in the interest of reasoning and wanting to know why things are the way they are. Piaget called it the "intuitive substage" because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. [[Centration]], [[conservation (psychology)|conservation]], [[Irreversible process|irreversibility]], class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.
Centration is the act of focusing all attention on one characteristic or dimension of a situation, whilst disregarding all others. Conservation is the awareness that altering a substance's appearance does not change its basic properties. Children at this stage are unaware of conservation and exhibit centration. Both centration and conservation can be more easily understood once familiarized with Piaget's most famous experimental task.

In this task, a child is presented with two identical beakers containing the same amount of liquid. The child usually notes that the beakers do contain the same amount of liquid. When one of the beakers is poured into a taller and thinner container, children who are younger than seven or eight years old typically say that the two beakers no longer contain the same amount of liquid, and that the taller container holds the larger quantity (centration), without taking into consideration the fact that both beakers were previously noted to contain the same amount of liquid. Due to superficial changes, the child was unable to comprehend that the properties of the substances continued to remain the same (conservation).

Irreversibility is a concept developed in this stage which is closely related to the ideas of centration and conservation. Irreversibility refers to when children are unable to mentally reverse a sequence of events. In the same beaker situation, the child does not realize that, if the sequence of events was reversed and the water from the tall beaker was poured back into its original beaker, then the same amount of water would exist. Another example of children's reliance on visual representations is their misunderstanding of "less than" or "more than". When two rows containing equal numbers of blocks are placed in front of a child, one row spread farther apart than the other, the child will think that the row spread farther contains more blocks.<ref name="Santrock8"/><ref name="Preoperational Stage - Egocentrism">McLeod, S. A. (2010). ''Simply Psychology''</ref>

Class inclusion refers to a kind of conceptual thinking that children in the preoperational stage cannot yet grasp. Children's inability to focus on two aspects of a situation at once inhibits them from understanding the principle that one category or class can contain several different subcategories or classes.<ref name="Rathus 2006"/> For example, a four-year-old girl may be shown a picture of eight dogs and three cats. The girl knows what cats and dogs are, and she is aware that they are both animals. However, when asked, "Are there more dogs or animals?" she is likely to answer "more dogs". This is due to her difficulty focusing on the two subclasses and the larger class all at the same time. She may have been able to view the dogs as dogs ''or'' animals, but struggled when trying to classify them as both, simultaneously.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Glenda |author2=Graeme S. Halford |author3=Karen Murphy |author4=Kathy Knox|title=Integration Of Weight And Distance Information In Young Children: The Role Of Relational Complexity|journal=Cognitive Development|year=2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=49–60|doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2008.07.005|hdl=10072/29392 |hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Branco|first=J. C|author2=Lourenco, O|title=Cognitive and linguistic aspects in 5- to 6-year-olds' class inclusion reasoning|journal=Psicologia Educacao Cultura|year=2004|volume=8|issue=2|pages=427–445}}</ref> Similar to this is concept relating to intuitive thought, known as "transitive inference".

Transitive inference is using previous knowledge to determine the missing piece, using basic logic. Children in the preoperational stage lack this logic. An example of transitive inference would be when a child is presented with the information "A" is greater than "B" and "B" is greater than "C". This child may have difficulty here understanding that "A" is also greater than "C".

===Concrete operational stage===<!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Piaget]]. -->
The '''concrete operational stage'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--> is the third stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development. This stage, which follows the preoperational stage, occurs between the ages of 7 and 11&nbsp;(middle childhood and preadolescence) years,<ref>Herbert Ginsburg and Sylvia Opper (1979), ''Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Development'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-675140-7}}, p. 152.</ref> and is characterized by the appropriate use of logic. During this stage, a child's thought processes become more mature and "adult like". They start solving problems in a more logical fashion. Abstract, [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] thinking is not yet developed in the child, and children can only solve problems that apply to concrete events or objects. At this stage, the children undergo a transition where the child learns rules such as [[Conservation (psychology)|conservation]].<ref>Concrete Operations [Video file]. (1993). Davidson Films, Inc. Retrieved October 6, 2014, from Education in Video: Volume I.</ref> Piaget determined that children are able to incorporate [[inductive reasoning]]. Inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences from observations in order to make a [[generalization]]. In contrast, children struggle with [[deductive reasoning]], which involves using a generalized principle in order to try to predict the outcome of an event. Children in this stage commonly experience difficulties with figuring out logic in their heads. For example, a child will understand that "A is more than B" and "B is more than C". However, when asked "is A more than C?", the child might not be able to logically figure the question out mentally.

Two other important processes in the concrete operational stage are logic and the elimination of egocentrism.

Egocentrism is the inability to consider or understand a perspective other than one's own. It is the phase where the thought and morality of the child is completely self focused.<ref>SCOTT, J., & MARSHALL, G. (2009). ''A dictionary of sociology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> During this stage, the child acquires the ability to view things from another individual's perspective, even if they think that perspective is incorrect. For instance, show a child a comic in which Jane puts a doll under a box, leaves the room, and then Melissa moves the doll to a drawer, and Jane comes back. A child in the concrete operations stage will say that Jane will still think it's under the box even though the child knows it is in the drawer. (See also [[False-belief task]].)

Children in this stage can; however, only solve problems that apply to actual (concrete) objects or events, and not abstract concepts or hypothetical tasks. Understanding and knowing how to use full common sense has not yet been completely adapted.

Piaget determined that children in the concrete operational stage were able to incorporate inductive logic. On the other hand, children at this age have difficulty using deductive logic, which involves using a general principle to predict the outcome of a specific event. This includes mental reversibility. An example of this is being able to reverse the order of relationships between mental categories. For example, a child might be able to recognize that his or her dog is a Labrador, that a Labrador is a dog, and that a dog is an animal, and draw conclusions from the information available, as well as apply all these processes to hypothetical situations.<ref name="Santrock2">Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life Span Development'' (pp.221–223). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref>

The abstract quality of the adolescent's thought at the formal operational level is evident in the adolescent's verbal problem solving ability.<ref name=Santrock2/> The logical quality of the adolescent's thought is when children are more likely to solve problems in a trial-and-error fashion.<ref name=Santrock2/> Adolescents begin to think more as a scientist thinks, devising plans to solve problems and systematically test opinions.<ref name=Santrock2/> They use hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which means that they develop hypotheses or best guesses, and systematically deduce, or conclude, which is the best path to follow in solving the problem.<ref name=Santrock2/> During this stage the adolescent is able to understand love, logical proofs and values. During this stage the young person begins to entertain possibilities for the future and is fascinated with what they can be.<ref name=Santrock2/>

Adolescents also are changing cognitively by the way that they think about social matters. One thing that brings about a change is egocentrism. This happens by heightening self-consciousness and giving adolescents an idea of who they are through their personal uniqueness and invincibility. Adolescent egocentrism can be dissected into two types of social thinking: [[imaginary audience]] and [[personal fable]]. Imaginary audience consists of an adolescent believing that others are watching them and the things they do. Personal fable is not the same thing as imaginary audience but is often confused with imaginary audience. Personal fable consists of believing that you are exceptional in some way. These types of social thinking begin in the concrete stage but carry on to the formal operational stage of development.

====Testing for concrete operations====
Piagetian tests are well known and practiced to test for concrete operations. The most prevalent tests are those for conservation. There are some important aspects that the experimenter must take into account when performing experiments with these children.

One example of an experiment for testing conservation is the water level task. An experimenter will have two glasses that are the same size, fill them to the same level with liquid, and make sure the child understands that both of the glasses have the same amount of water in them. Then, the experimenter will pour the liquid from one of the small glasses into a tall, thin glass. The experimenter will then ask the child if the taller glass has more liquid, less liquid, or the same amount of liquid. The child will then give his answer. There are three keys for the experimenter to keep in mind with this experiment. These are justification, number of times asking, and word choice.
* ''Justification'': After the child has answered the question being posed, the experimenter must ask why the child gave that answer. This is important because the answers they give can help the experimenter to assess the child's developmental age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FjIso13i20|title=Classic Piaget Volume 1|last=Davidson Films, Inc.|date=10 August 2010|via=YouTube}}</ref>
* ''Number of times asking'': Some argue that a child’s answers can be influenced by the number of times an experimenter asks them about the amount of water in the glasses. For example, a child is asked about the amount of liquid in the first set of glasses and then asked once again after the water is moved into a different sized glass. Some children will doubt their original answer and say something they would not have said if they did not doubt their first answer..<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/concrete-operational.html|title=Concrete Operational Stage - Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org}}</ref>
* ''Word choice'': The phrasing that the experimenter uses may affect how the child answers. If, in the liquid and glass example, the experimenter asks, "Which of these glasses has more liquid?", the child may think that his thoughts of them being the same is wrong because the adult is saying that one must have more. Alternatively, if the experimenter asks, "Are these equal?", then the child is more likely to say that they are, because the experimenter is implying that they are.
*'''<big>Classification</big>''':-
*As children’s experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schemata and are able to organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses.  
*'''<u>Identity</u>''': One feature of concrete operational thought is the understanding that objects have qualities that do not change even if the object is altered in some way. For instance, mass of an object does not change by rearranging it. A piece of chalk is still chalk even when the piece is broken in two.  
*'''<u>Reversibility</u>''': The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to their original state. Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again; however, eggs cannot be unscrambled. Children use reversibility a lot in mathematical problems such as: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 – 3 = 2.
*'''<u>Conservation</u>''': Remember the example where children in the pre-operational stage think that a tall beaker filled with 8 ounces of water had more water than a short, wide bowl also filled with 8 ounces of water? This example shows the concept of conservation. Concrete operational children can understand conservation and know that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, they understand that there is the same amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.
*'''<u>Decentration</u>''': Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object (such as the height of the glass). Children can start to consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width of the glass). Decentration allows for conservation to occur.
*'''<u>Seriation</u>''': Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can logically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length. Younger children not yet in the concrete stage approach a similar task in a haphazard way.
*These new cognitive skills increase the child’s understanding of the physical world. However, according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in systematic scientific ways. For example, most children under age twelve would not be able to come up with the variables that influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc. Even if they were given weights they could attach to strings in order to do this experiment, they would not be able to draw a clear conclusion (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).

===Formal operational stage===<!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Piaget]]. -->
The final stage is known as the '''formal operational stage'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--> (adolescence and into adulthood, roughly ages 12 to adulthood): Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts. This form of thought includes "assumptions that have no necessary relation to reality."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Intelligence|last = Piaget|first = Jean|publisher = Littlefield|year = 1972|location = Totowa, NJ}}</ref> At this point, the person is capable of hypothetical and deductive reasoning. During this time, people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts.

Piaget stated that "[[hypothetico-deductive reasoning]]" becomes important during the formal operational stage. This type of thinking involves hypothetical "what-if" situations that are not always rooted in reality, i.e. [[counterfactual thinking]]. It is often required in science and mathematics.

* [[Abstract thought]] emerges during the formal operational stage. Children tend to think very concretely and specifically in earlier stages, and begin to consider possible outcomes and consequences of actions.
* [[Metacognition]], the capacity for "thinking about thinking" that allows adolescents and adults to reason about their thought processes and monitor them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnett|first=Jeffrey Jensen|title=Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood|year=2013|publisher=Person Education Inc.|location=NJ|isbn=978-0-205-89249-5|pages=64–65}}</ref>
* [[Problem-solving]] is demonstrated when children use trial-and-error to solve problems. The ability to systematically solve a problem in a logical and methodical way emerges.
Children in primary school years mostly use [[inductive reasoning]], but adolescents start to use [[deductive reasoning]]. Inductive reasoning is when children draw general conclusions from personal experiences and specific facts. Adolescents learn how to use deductive reasoning by applying logic to create specific conclusions from abstract concepts. This capability results from their capacity to think hypothetically.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|location = New York}}</ref>

"However, research has shown that not all persons in all cultures reach formal operations, and most people do not use formal operations in all aspects of their lives".<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnett|first=Jeffrey|title=Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood: A Cultural Approach|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New York|page=91|edition=5th|chapter=3}}</ref>

====Experiments====
Piaget and his colleagues conducted several experiments to assess formal operational thought.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The growth of logical thinking from childhood to adolescence: An essay on the construction of formal operational structures|last1 = Inhelder|first1 = Barbel|publisher = Basic Books|year = 1958|location = New York|last2 = Piaget|first2 = Jean}}</ref>

In one of the experiments, Piaget evaluated the cognitive capabilities of children of different ages through the use of a scale and varying weights. The task was to balance the scale by hooking weights on the ends of the scale. To successfully complete the task, the children must use formal operational thought to realize that the distance of the weights from the center and the heaviness of the weights both affected the balance. A heavier weight has to be placed closer to the center of the scale, and a lighter weight has to be placed farther from the center, so that the two weights balance each other.<ref name=":0" /> While 3- to 5- year olds could not at all comprehend the concept of balancing, children by the age of 7 could balance the scale by placing the same weights on both ends, but they failed to realize the importance of the location. By age 10, children could think about location but failed to use logic and instead used trial-and-error. Finally, by age 13 and 14, in early adolescence, some children more clearly understood the relationship between weight and distance and could successfully implement their hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The psychology of the child|url = https://archive.org/details/psychologyofchil00piag|url-access = registration|last1 = Piaget|first1 = Jean|publisher = Basic Books|year = 1969|last2 = Inhedler|first2 = Bärbel}}</ref>

===The stages and causation===
Piaget sees children's conception of [[Causality|causation]] as a march from "primitive" conceptions of cause to those of a more scientific, rigorous, and mechanical nature. These primitive concepts are characterized as [[Magic (paranormal)|supernatural]], with a decidedly non-natural or non-mechanical tone. Piaget has as his most basic assumption that babies are [[Phenomenalism|phenomenists]]. That is, their knowledge "consists of assimilating things to schemas" from their own action such that they appear, from the child's point of view, "to have qualities which, in fact, stem from the organism". Consequently, these "subjective conceptions," so prevalent during Piaget's first stage of development, are dashed upon discovering deeper [[empirism|empirical]] truths.

Piaget gives the example of a child believing that the moon and stars follow him on a night walk. Upon learning that such is the case for his friends, he must separate his self from the object, resulting in a theory that the moon is immobile, or moves independently of other [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]].

The second stage, from around three to eight years of age, is characterized by a mix of this type of magical, [[Animism|animistic]], or "non-natural" conceptions of causation and mechanical or "naturalistic" causation. This conjunction of natural and non-natural causal explanations supposedly stems from experience itself, though Piaget does not make much of an attempt to describe the nature of the differences in conception. In his interviews with children, he asked questions specifically about [[natural phenomena]], such as: "What makes clouds move?", "What makes the stars move?", "Why do rivers flow?" The nature of all the answers given, Piaget says, are such that these objects must perform their actions to "fulfill their obligations towards men". He calls this "moral explanation".<ref name=Piaget1928>{{cite journal | last1 = Piaget | first1 = J | year = 1928 | title = La causalité chez l'enfant | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 276–301 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1928.tb00466.x}}</ref>

==Postulated physical mechanisms underlying schemas and stages==	 
−	In 1967, Piaget considered the possibility of [[RNA]] molecules as likely embodiments of his still-abstract [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s (which he promoted as units of action)—though he did not come to any firm conclusion.<ref>Piaget, J. (1967/1971). ''Biologie et connaissance: Essai sur les relations entre les régulations organiques et les processus cognitifs''. Gallimard: Paris — ''Biology and Knowledge''. Chicago University Press; and Edinburgh University Press.</ref> At that time, due to work such as that of Swedish biochemist Holger Hydén, RNA concentrations had, indeed, been shown to correlate with learning.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

==Practical applications==
Parents can use Piaget's theory in many ways to support their child's growth.<ref name=". So Young, and So Gadgeted">BUCKLEITNER, W. (2008, June 12). ''New York Times.''</ref> Teachers can also use Piaget's theory to help their students. For example, recent studies have shown that children in the same grade and of the same age perform differently on tasks measuring basic addition and subtraction accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramos-Christian|first=Vanessa|author2=Robert Schleser|author3=Mary E.

The stage of cognitive growth of a person differ from another. Cognitive development or thinking is an active process from the beginning to the end of life. Intellectual advancement happens because people at every age and developmental period look for cognitive equilibrium. To achieve this balance, the easiest way is to understand the new experiences through the lens of the preexisting ideas. Infants learn that new objects can be grabbed in the same way of familiar objects, and adults explain the day's headlines as evidence for their existing worldview.<ref>Berger, Kathleen Stassen. (2011). ''The Developing Person Through the Life Span'' (8th ed., pp. 45–46). Worth Publishers.</ref>

However, the application of standardized Piagetian theory and procedures in different societies established widely varying results that lead some to speculate not only that some cultures produce more cognitive development than others but that without specific kinds of cultural experience, but also formal schooling, development might cease at certain level, such as concrete operational level. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Babakr, Mohamedamin, Kakamad|first=Zana, Pakstan, Karwan|date=2019|title=Piaget's Cognitive Developmental Theory: Critical Review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335219854|journal=Asian Institute of Research|volume=2|pages=517|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> A procedure was done following methods developed in Geneva (i.e. water level task). Participants were presented with two beakers of equal circumference and height, filled with equal amounts of water. The water from one beaker was transferred into another with taller and smaller circumference. The children and young adults from [[Nonliterate|non-literate]] societies of a given age were more likely to think that the taller, thinner beaker had more water in it. On the other hand, an experiment on the effects of modifying testing procedures to match local cultural produced a different pattern of results. In the revised procedures, the participants explained in their own language and indicated that while the water was now "more", the quantity was the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileycs/culture_and_cognitive_development/0|title=Culture and Cognitive Development - Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}</ref> Piaget's water level task has also been applied to the [[elderly]] by [[Anton Formann|Formann]] and results showed an age-associated non-linear decline of performance.<ref name="Tran, U.

==Relation to psychometric theories of intelligence==

Researchers have linked Piaget's theory to Cattell and Horn's theory [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|theory of fluid and crystallized abilities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Papalia|first1=D.|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=J.|last3=Hooper|first3=F. H.|year=1971|title=Piagetian Theory and the Aging Process: Extensions and Speculations|journal=The International Journal of Aging and Human Development|volume=2|pages=3–20|doi=10.2190/AG.2.1.b|s2cid=143590129}}</ref><ref name="Schonfeld'">{{cite journal|last1=Schonfeld|first1=I.S.|year=1986|title=The Genevan and Cattell-Horn conceptions of intelligence compared: The early implementation of numerical solution aids|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=gc_pubs|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–212|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.2.204}}</ref> Piaget's operative intelligence corresponds to  the Cattell-Horn formulation of fluid ability in that both concern logical thinking and the "eduction of relations" (an expression Cattell used to refer to the inferring of relationships). Piaget's treatment of everyday learning corresponds to the Cattell-Horn formulation of crystallized ability in that both reflect the impress of experience. Piaget's operativity is considered to be prior to, and ultimately provides the foundation for, everyday learning,<ref name="Furth, H. G. 1977"/> much like fluid ability's relation to crystallized intelligence.<ref name="Schonfeld'" />

Piaget's theory also aligns with another psychometric theory, namely the psychometric theory of [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'']], general intelligence. Piaget designed a number of tasks to assess hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences and they have no equivalent in [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] intelligence tests. Notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. ''g'' is thought to underlie performance on the two types of tasks. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'']] as standard IQ tests.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Humphreys | first1 = L.G. | last2 = Rich | first2 = S.A. | last3 = Davey | first3 = T.C. | year = 1985 | title = A Piagetian Test of General Intelligence | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 872–877 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.5.872}}</ref><ref>Lautrey, J.

==Challenges to Piagetian stage theory==
Piagetian accounts of development have been challenged on several grounds. First, as Piaget himself noted, development does not always progress in the smooth manner his theory seems to predict. ''Décalage'', or progressive forms of cognitive developmental progression in a specific domain, suggest that the stage model is, at best, a useful approximation.<ref name="go.galegroup.com2">{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300160&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=b6bd1ae3a4e93016b772396b5848a349|title=Concrete Operational Period|first=Karen E.|last=Singer-Freeman|date=30 November 2005|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1|doi=10.4135/9781412952484.n148|isbn=9781412904759}}</ref> Furthermore, studies have found that children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease (Lourenço & Machado, 1996, p.&nbsp;145).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lourenço | first1 = O. | last2 = Machado | first2 = A. | year = 1996 | title = In defense of Piaget's theory: A reply to 10 common criticisms | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2dece70e2b917d7e3f846db9285878811d1ddbe3| journal = Psychological Review | volume = 103 | issue = 1| pages = 143–164 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.143 | s2cid = 32390745 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych406-5.3.2.pdf Kay C. Wood, Harlan Smith, and Daurice Grossniklaus. "Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development". pp. 6] Retrieved May 29, 2012</ref> More broadly, Piaget's theory is "[[Domain-general learning|domain general]]," predicting that cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains of knowledge (such as mathematics, logic, and understanding of [[physics]] or language).<ref name="go.galegroup.com2"/> Piaget did not take into account variability in a child's performance notably how a child can differ in sophistication across several domains.

During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive developmentalists were influenced by [[Psychological nativism|"neo-nativist"]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] ideas. These ideas de-emphasized domain general theories and emphasized [[domain specificity]] or [[modularity of mind]].<ref name="Callaghan, T. C. 2005 pp. 204-209">{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX1311100053&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=c822fe0523f5b1258756f6e7855acc8d|title=Cognitive Development Beyond Infancy|first=Tara C.|last=Callaghan|date=30 November 2004|journal=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Child Development}}</ref> Modularity implies that different cognitive faculties may be largely independent of one another, and thus develop according to quite different timetables, which are "influenced by real world experiences".<ref name="Callaghan, T. C. 2005 pp. 204-209"/> In this vein, some cognitive developmentalists argued that, rather than being domain general learners, children come equipped with domain specific theories, sometimes referred to as "core knowledge," which allows them to break into learning within that domain. For example, even young infants appear to be sensitive to some predictable regularities in the movement and interactions of objects (for example, an object cannot pass through another object), or in human behavior (for example, a hand repeatedly reaching for an object has that object, not just a particular path of motion), as it becomes the building block of which more elaborate knowledge is constructed.

Piaget's theory has been said to undervalue the influence that culture has on cognitive development. Piaget demonstrates that a child goes through several stages of cognitive development and come to conclusions on their own, however, a child's sociocultural environment plays an important part in their cognitive development. Social interaction teaches the child about the world and helps them develop through the cognitive stages, which Piaget neglected to consider.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|title=Children and Their Development|url=https://archive.org/details/childrentheirdev0004kail|url-access=registration|date=2007|publisher=Pearson|edition=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejournal1.com/journals_n/1433324999.pdf|title=Assan, E.

More recent work from a newer dynamic systems approach has strongly challenged some of the basic presumptions of the "core knowledge" school that Piaget suggested. Dynamic systems approaches harken to modern [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] research that was not available to Piaget when he was constructing his theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bjorklund|first=David F.|date=1 November 2018|title=A Metatheory for Cognitive Development (or "Piaget is Dead" Revisited)|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cdev.13019|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=89|issue=6|pages=2288–2302|doi=10.1111/cdev.13019|pmid=29336015|via=}}</ref> This brought new light into research in psychology in which new techniques such as brain imaging provided new understanding to cognitive development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bjorklund|first=David F.|date=1 November 2018|title=A Metatheory for Cognitive Development (or "Piaget is Dead" Revisited)|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cdev.13019|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=89|issue=6|pages=2288–2302|doi=10.1111/cdev.13019|pmid=29336015|via=}}</ref>  One important finding is that domain-specific knowledge is constructed as children develop and integrate knowledge.

==Post-Piagetian and neo-Piagetian stages==
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
In recent years, several theorists attempted to address concerns with Piaget's theory by developing new theories and models that can accommodate evidence which violates Piagetian predictions and postulates.

* The [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], advanced by Robbie Case, [[Andreas Demetriou]], Graeme S. Halford, [[Kurt W. Fischer]], [[Michael Commons|Michael Lamport Commons]], and Juan Pascual-Leone, attempted to integrate Piaget's theory with cognitive and differential theories of cognitive organization and development. Their aim was to better account for the cognitive factors of development and for intra-individual and inter-individual differences in cognitive development. They suggested that development along Piaget's stages is due to increasing [[working memory]] capacity and processing efficiency by "biological maturation".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3027800184&v=2.1&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=5fee96b9c6312e2ec80a2b957d08d51e|title=Neo-Piagetian Theories of Development|date=30 November 2008|journal=Psychology of Classroom Learning|volume=2}}</ref> Moreover, [[Andreas Demetriou|Demetriou]]'s theory ascribes an important role to hypercognitive processes of "self-monitoring, self-recording, self-evaluation, and self-regulation", and it recognizes the operation of several relatively autonomous domains of thought (Demetriou, 1998; Demetriou, Mouyi, Spanoudis, 2010; Demetriou, 2003, p.&nbsp;153).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adesignmedia.com/OnlineResearch/sp_Mind%20Self%20and%20Personality.pdf|title=Demetriou, A.

* Piaget's theory stops at the formal operational stage, but other researchers have observed the thinking of adults is more nuanced than formal operational thought.
