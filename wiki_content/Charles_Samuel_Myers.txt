==Biography==

===Family background===

Myers was born in [[Kensington]], London on 13 March 1873,<ref>Obituary in ''The Times'', Monday, 14 October 1946; pg. 7; Issue 50581; col E</ref> the eldest son of Wolf Myers, a merchant, and his wife, Esther Eugenie Moses.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-35175|title=Myers, Charles Samuel (1873–1946), psychologist|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35175|isbn=978-0-19-861412-8}}</ref> His family was [[Jewish]].<ref>[[William D.

===Education===

He attended the [[City of London School]] where he studied sciences. Of this experience he wrote:

{{cquote|My science master at school knew little biology and less physiology, and in the private tuition which he gave me I used to find him reading my textbook in physiology <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]]'s<nowiki>]</nowiki> so as to keep just ahead of me. I left school in 1890 and joined a year's course in elementary biology, chemistry, and physics at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Thus, hurriedly and poorly equipped, I gained an entrance exhibition, and soon after a foundation scholarship at Caius.

===Travels and study of ethnic music===
In 1898 he joined [[W. H. R.

===Early career===
Between 1901 and 1902 Myers was involved in the collection of [[anthropometry|anthropometric]] measurements of [[Egyptians]].<ref>[library.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtl039771.pdf "Manuscripts Collection if the ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN & IRELAND, 50 Fitzroy Street, LONDON W1P 5HS" at wellcome.ac.uk]</ref>
 
On his return to England he was appointed house physician at St Bartholomew's. In 1902 he returned to Cambridge to help Rivers teach the physiology of the special senses.

In 1904 Myers married Edith Babette, youngest daughter of [[Isaac Seligman]], a merchant in London; they had three daughters and two sons. Myers remained in Cambridge to become, in succession, demonstrator, lecturer, and, in 1921, reader in [[experimental psychology]]. From 1906 to 1909 he was also professor in experimental psychology at [[London University]].

In 1909, when W.H.R. Rivers resigned a part of his Lectureship, Myers became the first lecturer at Cambridge University whose whole duty was to teach experimental psychology. For this he received a [[stipend]] of £50 a year. He held this position until 1930.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120715084746/http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=MRS891CS&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50] Venn, J & J.A, Alumni Cantabrigienses</ref><ref name="ajop">{{cite journal

From 1911 Myers co-edited the ''[[British Journal of Psychology]]'' with Rivers. In 1914 he took over as sole editor, continuing in this post until 1924.

In 1912, Myers used his enthusiasm and ability to raise funds to establish the first English laboratory especially designed for experimental psychology at Cambridge. He became the laboratory's first Director and held this position until 1930.  (The Cambridge Laboratory of Experimental Psychology).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/pages/about.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215024857/http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/pages/about.html|url-status=dead|title=Cambridge Laboratory of Experimental Psychology|archivedate=15 February 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20120715084746/http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=MRS891CS&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50] Venn, J & V.A., Alumni Cantabrigienses ]</ref>

===First World War===

In 1915 Myers was given a commission in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and in 1916 he was appointed consultant psychologist to the British armies in France with a staff of assistants at [[Le Touquet]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pear | first1 = T.H. | year = 1947 | title = Charles-Samuel Myers: 1873–1946 | journal = The American Journal of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 289–296 }}</ref> In 1915 Myers was the first to use the term "[[shell shock]]" in an article in ''[[The Lancet]]'',<ref>Myers, C.S.

He became frustrated with opposition to his views during his time in the military,<ref>Jones, E. (2008) [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/information/publications/articles/historical/Doctors%20at%20War%20Lancet%20Jones.pdf "The art of medicine: Doctors at war"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610124919/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/information/publications/articles/historical/Doctors%20at%20War%20Lancet%20Jones.pdf |date=10 June 2011 }}, ''The Lancet'', 371, 1658–1859.</ref> particularly the view that shell-shock was a treatable condition. His efforts have been called "a pioneering but frustrating struggle to get psychological evidence and applied psychology accepted"<ref>[http://www.shpltd.co.uk/wilson-experimental.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070801175627/http://www.shpltd.co.uk/wilson-experimental.pdf |date=1 August 2007 }}</ref> He was so upset by the rejection of his ideas by the military authorities that he refused to give evidence to the Southborough Committee on shell-shock because, as he wrote in 1940, "the recall of my past five years' work proved too painful for me."<ref>MYERS, C. S. (1940) "Shell-Shock in France 1914–1918, Based on a War Diary kept by C. S.

In the last year of the war he devised tests and supervised their application for the selection of men suited to [[hydrophone]] work for detecting enemy submarines.

===Postwar career===

After the war, Myers returned to his Cambridge position. But here too he was deeply dissatisfied, wanting wider opportunities for the development of his more practical interests, and feeling that official and academic circles showed little genuine interest in psychology. From 1922 Myers devoted himself to the development of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) which he had founded with Henry John Welch in 1921. He was also involved in what became the Industrial Health Research Board.

Later, when the advisory committee on personnel selection was set up by the War Office, he was appointed a member.

He delivered the Bradshaw Lecture at the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1933 on "A Psychological Regard for Medical Education".<ref>{{cite journal|url= |title = Obituary – C.S.Myers CBE, FRS|journal = BMJ|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4477.628|pmc = 2054570|volume=2|issue=4477|page=628|year=1946 | last1 = McAlpine | first1 = D.}}</ref>

He died at his home in [[Winsford, Somerset|Winsford]], near [[Minehead]], Somerset in 1946.<ref name="RS"/>

The Charles Myers Library was set up by the National Institute of Industrial Psychology and is currently incorporated into the [[Wellcome Library]].

===Myers and the British Psychological Society===

Myers was one of the ten founding members of The Psychological Society in 1901 which would later become the [[British Psychological Society]] in 1906. In January 1904, Myers became the first Secretary of the Society. In 1919 Myers suggested that membership should be opened up to "all those interested in various branches of psychology".<ref>Edgell, B. (2001). [http://www.bps.org.uk/downloadfile.cfm?file_uuid=E2480979-1143-DFD0-7E7F-BC26EE30572A&ext=pdf The British Psychological Society], ''British Journal of Psychology,'' 92, 3–22 (Original work published 1947)</ref>

He was elected as the first President of the Society, following its enlargement and held this position between 1920 and 1923.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bps.org.uk/hopc/history-of-the-british-psychological-society/presidents-of-the-british-psychological-society.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205060116/http://www.bps.org.uk/hopc/history-of-the-british-psychological-society/presidents-of-the-british-psychological-society.cfm|url-status=dead|title=Presidents – BPS|archivedate=5 December 2008}}</ref>

In 1920, Myers represented the BPS on the board of management of a new journal, ''Discovery'', which dealt with the recent advances in scientific knowledge. Myers was also the Society's representative on the committee formed to consider a memorial to the W. H. R. Rivers. A fund was raised for the furtherance of the sciences to which Rivers had been interested, in particular anthropology and psychology.
