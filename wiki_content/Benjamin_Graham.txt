After graduating from [[Columbia University]] at age 20, he started his career on Wall Street, eventually founding the Graham-Newman Partnership. After employing his former student [[Warren Buffett]], he took up teaching positions at his ''[[alma mater]],'' and later at [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

His work in [[managerial economics]] and investing has led to a modern wave of value investing within mutual funds, hedge funds, diversified holding companies, and other investment vehicles. Throughout his career, Graham had many notable disciples who went on to receive substantial success in the world of investment, including [[Irving Kahn]] and [[Warren Buffett]], the latter going on to describe him as the second most influential person in his life after his own father.<ref name="WarrenBuffetPreface">Warren Buffett, "Preface to the Fourth Edition", in Benjamin Graham, "The Intelligent Investor", 4 ed., 2003.</ref> Another one of Graham's famous students was Sir [[John Templeton]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Scott A. |date=2019-08-20 |title=Empower Your Investing |url=https://www.chapmaninvestment.com/posts/empower-your-investing-adopting-best-practices-of-john-templeton-peter-lynch-and-warren-buffett |publisher=[[Post Hill Press]] |page=41 |isbn=978-1-64293-238-6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106020314/https://www.chapmaninvestment.com/posts/empower-your-investing-adopting-best-practices-of-john-templeton-peter-lynch-and-warren-buffett |archive-date=2020-01-06 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berryessa |first1=Norman |last2=Kirzner |first2=Eric |title=Global Investing: The Templeton Way |date=1988-12-22 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |page=125 |isbn=978-1556238734}}</ref>

The family changed their name from Grossbaum to Graham in a desire to assimilate into American society and avoid anti-Semitic and anti-German sentiments.<ref name=Carlen2012/>

After the death of his father, who owned and managed a successful furniture store, the family experienced poverty which Graham said later influenced his investing theories by inspiring an early appreciation of buying low-priced bargains.<ref name=Carlen2012/> Graham became a good student, graduating as [[salutatorian]] of his class at Columbia. He declined an offer to teach English, mathematics, and philosophy, choosing instead to take a job on [[Wall Street]], where he eventually started his Graham-Newman Partnership. Early on, Graham made a name for himself with "The Northern Pipeline Affair", an early case of [[shareholder activism]] involving [[John D. Rockefeller]].<ref>Bloomberg, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-17/how-benjamin-graham-revolutionized-shareholder-activism.html How Benjamin Graham Revolutionized Shareholder Activism]. May 17th, 2013.</ref> Graham's research indicated Northern Pipeline Co. held vast cash and bond assets that he believed were not being put to good use, and bought enough shares to force a [[proxy vote]] to distribute these assets to shareholders.

Humbling Lessons From Parties Past By BURTON G. MALKIEL

http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/security-analysis/author/benjamin-graham/sortby/1/n/200000080/page-1/
“Just as value investing never goes out of style, neither does the value investor's bible, 'Security Analysis,' by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, which has withstood the test of time as well or better than any investment book ever published.”</ref> In ''Security Analysis'', he proposed a clear definition of investment that was distinguished from what he deemed speculation. It read, "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."<ref>Benjamin Graham, ''The Intelligent Investor'', 4th ed., 2003, chapter 1, page 18.</ref>

[[Warren Buffett]] describes ''The Intelligent Investor'' (1949) as "the best book about investing ever written."<ref  name="WarrenBuffetPreface" /> Graham exhorted the stock market participant to first draw a fundamental distinction between [[investment]] and [[speculation]]. 
[[File:Theintelligentinvestor.jpg|thumb|An early copy of Graham's ''Intelligent Investor'']]
Graham wrote that the owner of equity stocks should regard them first and foremost as conferring part ownership of a business. With that perspective in mind, the stock owner should not be too concerned with erratic fluctuations in stock prices, since in the short term the [[stock market]] behaves like a voting machine, but in the long term it acts like a weighing machine (i.e. its true value will be reflected in its stock price in the long run). Graham distinguished between the passive and the active investor. The passive investor, often referred to as a defensive investor, invests cautiously, looks for value stocks, and buys for the long term.  The active investor, in contrast, is one who has more time, interest, and possibly more specialized knowledge to seek out exceptional buys in the market.<ref>Benjamin Graham, ''The Intelligent Investor'', 4th ed., 2003, Chapter 1.</ref> Graham recommended that investors spend time and effort to analyze the financial state of companies. When a company is available on the market at a price which is at a discount to its [[Intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]], a "[[margin of safety (financial)|margin of safety]]" exists, which makes it suitable for investment.

Graham wrote that investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. By that he meant that the stock investor is neither right nor wrong because others agreed or disagreed with him; he is right because his facts and analysis are right.<ref>The Intelligent Investor p.&nbsp;524 (Revised Ed 2006)</ref>  Graham's favorite allegory is that of [[Mr. Market]], a fellow who turns up every day at the stock holder's door offering to buy or sell his shares at a different price. Usually, the price quoted by Mr. Market seems plausible, but occasionally it is ridiculous. The investor is free to either agree with his quoted price and trade with him, or to ignore him completely. Mr. Market doesn't mind this, and will be back the following day to quote another price. The point is that the investor should not regard the whims of Mr. Market as determining the value of the shares that the investor owns. He should profit from market folly rather than participate in it.  The investor is best off concentrating on the real life performance of his companies and receiving dividends, rather than being too concerned with Mr. Market's often irrational behavior.<ref>Benjamin Graham, "The Intelligent Investor", 4 ed., 2003, Chapter 20.</ref>

Graham was critical of the corporations of his day for obfuscated and irregular [[financial reporting]] that made it difficult for investors to discern the true state of the business's finances. He was an advocate of [[dividend]] payments to shareholders rather than businesses keeping all of their profits as [[retained earnings]]. He also criticized those who advised that some types of stocks were a good buy at any price, because of the prospect of sustained stock price growth, without a good analysis of the business's actual financial condition. These observations remain relevant today.<ref>The Economist, [https://www.economist.com/node/21557499 Benjamin Graham: Figuring it out]. July 7th, 2012.</ref>

Graham's average investment performance was ~20% annualized return over 1936 to 1956. The overall market performance for the same time period was 12.2% annually on average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2012/12/18/ben-grahams-60-year-old-strategy-still-winning-big/ |title=Ben Graham's 60-Year-Old Strategy Still Winning Big |date=December 18, 2012 |website=Forbes.com |last=Reese |first=John P. |access-date=January 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315183858/http://www.forbes.com/ |archive-date=March 15, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Despite this, both Buffett and [[Berkshire Hathaway]] vice chairman [[Charlie Munger]]<ref>{{Cite book |title=Empower your investing : adopting best practices from John Templeton, Peter Lynch, and Warren Buffett |last=Chapman |first=Scott A. |publisher=[[Post Hill Press]] |year=2019 |isbn=978-1-64293-238-6 |location=New York |pages=202–203 |oclc=1112253785}}</ref> consider following Graham's method strictly to be outdated, with Buffett stating during a 1988 interview with journalist [[Carol Loomis]] for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], "Boy, if I had listened only to Ben, would I ever be a lot poorer."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Empower your investing : adopting best practices from John Templeton, Peter Lynch, and Warren Buffett |last=Chapman |first=Scott A. |publisher=[[Post Hill Press]] |year=2019 |isbn=978-1-64293-238-6 |location=New York |pages=190 |oclc=1112253785}}</ref>

Graham's largest gain was from [[GEICO]], which his Graham-Newman Partnership purchased 50% of in 1948 for $712,000. The position grew to $400 million by 1972, contributing more to the portfolio than all of Graham-Newman's other investments combined.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Empower your investing : adopting best practices from John Templeton, Peter Lynch, and Warren Buffett |last=Chapman |first=Scott A. |publisher=[[Post Hill Press]] |year=2019 |isbn=978-1-64293-238-6 |location=New York |pages=253 |oclc=1112253785}}</ref> GEICO was eventually acquired in whole by Berkshire Hathaway in 1996,<ref>{{cite web|title=74.

==Personal life==


On September 21, 1976, Graham died in [[Aix-en-Provence]], France, at the age of 82.<ref name="NYTimes-obit"/>

==Legacy==
His contributions spanned numerous fields, one of which was fundamental value investing.

Graham is considered the "father of value investing,"<ref name=":0" /> and his two books, [[Security Analysis (book)|''Security Analysis'']] and ''[[The Intelligent Investor]],'' defined his investment philosophy,  especially what it means to be a value investor. Arguably, his most famous student was [[Warren Buffett]], who is consistently ranked among wealthiest persons in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett|title=Warren Buffett|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> According to Buffett, Graham used to say that he wished every day to do something foolish, something creative, and something generous.<ref>Buffett, Warren E.: "Benjamin Graham", ''Financial Analyst Journal'', November/December 1976.</ref> And Buffett noted, Graham excelled most at the last.<ref>Financial Analysts Journal, November/December 1976. (Reprinted on page x of the preface to revised Fourth Addition of The Intelligent Investor.)</ref>

While many value investors have been influenced by Graham, his most notable investing disciples include [[Charles Brandes]], as well as [[William J. Ruane]], Bert Olden, [[Irving Kahn]] and [[Walter J. Schloss]]. In addition, Graham's thoughts on investing have influenced the likes of [[Seth Klarman]] and [[Bill Ackman]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/08/seth-klarman-video-conference-with-the-ben-graham-centre-for-value-investing-2009/|title=Seth Klarman - Video Conference with the Ben Graham Centre for Value Investing [2009] - ValueWalk|date=2016-08-27|newspaper=ValueWalk|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-12-books-that-bill-ackman-has-his-analysts-read-2012-7|title=These Are The 12 Books That Bill Ackman Has All His Analysts Read|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}</ref> While some of Graham's investing concepts are now regarded as superseded or outdated, many others are still recognized as important and ''Security Analysis'' or ''The Intelligent Investor'' are required reading for new hires at many investing firms around the world.<ref name=Carlen2012/>

Alongside his work in investment finance, Graham also made contributions to [[Economics|economic theory]]. Most notably, he devised a new basis for both U.S. and global currency as an alternative to the [[gold standard]].<ref>Bloomberg, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-28/benjamin-graham-s-clever-idea-for-averting-currency-wars.html Benjamin Graham’s Clever Idea for Averting Currency Wars]. February 28th, 2013.</ref> Graham regarded this currency theory as his most important professional work; it was largely ignored in his lifetime but gained serious attention decades after his death in the aftermath of [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]].<ref name=Carlen2012/>
