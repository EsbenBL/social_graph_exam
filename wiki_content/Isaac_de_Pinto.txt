'''Isaac de Pinto''' (Amsterdam, 10 April 1717 – 13 August 1787 in [[the Hague]]) was a [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jew]] of portuguese [[Sefardim]] origin, a merchant/banker, one of the main [[investor]]s in the [[Dutch East India Company]],  a [[scholar]], and a [[philosophe]] who concentrated on [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[National Debt]]. Pinto published mainly in French and once in Portuguese. "He was one of the very few Jews of the eighteenth century, before [[Moses Mendelssohn]], able to operate and express  himself in the mainstreams of European culture."<ref>POPKIN, R. H. (1970). Hume and Isaac de Pinto. Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 12(3), p. 430.</ref>

== Life ==
Isaac had his [[Brit milah]] on 18 April 1717; this likely means he was born on 10 April and received his [[Bar Mitzvah]] in 1730. The 17-year old Pinto married on 29 December 1734 to Rachel Nuñes Henriques; the couple never had any children. In 1748 Pinto helped stadholder prince [[William IV of Orange]], sending or lending him money to defeat the French at [[Bergen op Zoom]]. In return he asked for uplifting measures against [[Jewish]] [[merchants]] forbidding them to sell clothes, [[gherkins]] or fish on the street. He proposed to open the [[guilds]] for the Jews and to send the poorest to [[Surinam]]. In 1750 he was appointed by the [[stadtholder]] as the president of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. In 1755 he was visited by [[Frederick the Great]], travelling incognito through the Netherlands; together they visisted [[Gerrit Braamcamp]].

Pinto was a man of broad learning, but did not begin to write until nearly forty-five, when he acquired a reputation by defending his co-religionists against Voltaire. In 1762 he published his ''Essai sur le Luxe'' at Amsterdam. In the same year appeared his ''Apologie pour la Nation Juive, ou Réflexions Critiques''. The author sent a manuscript copy of this work to [[Voltaire]]. [[Antoine Guenée]] reproduced the ''Apologie'' at the head of his ''Lettres de Quelques Juifs Portugais, Allemands et Polonais, à M. de Voltaire''.

In 1761 De Pinto and his brother Aron went [[bankrupt]] maybe as a result of raising loans of 6 or 6.6 million guilders for the British government, in either 1759<ref>J.S.

Then he moved to The Hague and lived in a mansion at [[Lange Voorhout]]; he and his family were invited to the palace when the young [[Mozart]] and his sister played. In 1767 he went to London, met with [[John Steward|Lord Bute]] where he received a pension for his advice on the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], as the British gained influence over the French in India through his suggestion.

Wijler (1923) Isaac de Pinto, Sa vie et ses oeuvres, p. 20</ref> In 1776 he wrote against the American revolutionaries; he did approve the [[Boston Tea Party]]. Around 1780 he disapproved an alliance of the Dutch Republic with France, though realized in the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1785)]].

== Legacy ==
Various authors, both contemporary and later, commented on Pinto's writings. One of them, [[Karl Marx]], derisively referred to Pinto - whom he regarded as a major exponent of the free-market liberalism he criticized - as the "[[Pindar]] of the Amsterdam stock exchange" for his glorification of the Dutch financial system.
