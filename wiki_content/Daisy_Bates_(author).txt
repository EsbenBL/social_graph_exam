'''Daisy May Bates''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]<ref>[http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0050b.htm Australian Women Biographical entry]</ref> (born '''Margaret Dwyer'''; 16 October 1859 – 18 April 1951) was an [[Irish-Australian]] journalist, welfare worker and lifelong student of [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] culture and society. Some Aboriginal people referred to Bates by the [[honorific|courtesy name]] ''Kabbarli'' "grandmother."<ref name="glass">Glass, A. and D. Hackett, (2003) ''Ngaanyatjarra and Ngaatjatjarra to English Dictionary'', Alice Springs, IAD Press. {{ISBN|1-86465-053-2}}, p39</ref>

==Early life==
Daisy Bates was born Margaret Dwyer in [[County Tipperary]] in 1859, when it was under British rule. <!-- no Republic of Ireland in 1859 --> Her mother, Bridget (née Hunt), died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1862 when the girl was three.  Her widowed father, James Edward O'Dwyer, married Mary Dillon in 1864 and died en route to the United States, planning to send for his daughter after he got settled. Dwyer was raised in [[Roscrea]] by relatives, and educated at the National School in that town.

==Emigration and life in Australia==
In November 1882, Dwyer—who by then had changed her first name to Daisy May—emigrated to Australia aboard the {{RMS|Almora}} as part of a Queensland government-assisted immigration scheme. Dwyer said that she left Ireland for "health reasons", which was repeated by some sources, but biographer [[Julia Blackburn]] discovered that after getting her first job as a [[governess]] in Dublin at age 18, there was a scandal, presumably sexual in nature, which resulted in the young man of the house taking his own life.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} This story has never been verified, but if true, could have spurred Dwyer to leave Ireland and reinvent her history, setting a pattern for the rest of her life.<ref name="Reece 2009">{{cite web |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |title=The Irishness of Daisy Bates |url=http://www.irishheritage.net/durack2009.pdf |publisher=Australian-Irish Heritage Association |access-date=19 June 2018 |date=18 October 2009 |quote="Was her departure hastened by a young man of good family committing suicide on her account? We shall never know."}}</ref> It was not until long after her death that facts about her early life emerged,<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Vries |first1=Susanna |title=Desert Queen: the Many Lives and Loves of Daisy Bates |url=http://www.susannadevries.com/desert_queen.html |website=Susanna de Vries |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> and even recent biographers disagree in their accounts of her life and work.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Philip |title=Native entitlement |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/native-entitlement/news-story/6f970d6d73786a2161310bfefe7055e5?sv=cb8aff12e99922cb3a5b180ca2b5e05a |access-date=19 June 2018 |date=5 March 2008}}</ref>

Dwyer settled first at [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, purportedly staying first at the home of the Bishop of North Queensland. Later she stayed with family friends who had migrated earlier. On the later stage of her journey, Dwyer encountered Ernest C. Bagehole and James C. Hann, amongst others.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Both Bagehole and Hann had boarded at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] bound for Australia. She may have been introduced to the bishop through Hann. His father William Hann had donated £1000 for the construction of St James Church of England, a few years before Bishop Stanton had arrived at Townsville.  

Dwyer subsequently found employment as a governess on Fanning Downs [[Station (Australian agriculture)|Station]]. She married poet and horseman [[Breaker Morant]] (Harry Morant aka Edwin Murrant) on 13 March 1884 in [[Charters Towers]]; the union lasted only a short time. Dwyer reputedly threw Morant out because he failed to pay for the wedding and stole some livestock.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maloney |first1=Shane |title=Daisy Bates & Harry 'Breaker' Morant |journal=The Monthly |date=June 2007 |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2007/june/1290560118/shane-maloney/daisy-bates-harry-breaker-morant |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> The marriage was not legal, as Morant was underage (he said he was twenty-one, but was only nineteen).<ref name="Reece 2007a">{{cite book |last=Reece |first=Bob |title=Daisy Bates: Grand Dame of the Desert |date=2007a |publisher=National Library of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-64-227654-4 |pages=19–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_8KgFI92e4C |oclc=212893816}}</ref><ref name="West & Roper" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} They were never divorced. Morant biographer Nick Bleszynski <!-- year published? -->suggests that Dwyer played a more important role in Morant's life than has been previously thought, and that she persuaded him to change his name from Edwin Murrant to Harry Harbord Morant.<!-- When? -->{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

After separating from Morant, Dwyer moved to [[New South Wales]]. She said that she became engaged to Philip Gipps (the son of a former governor) but he died before they could marry; no records support this assertion. Biographer Bob Reece calls this story 'nonsense', as Gipps died in February 1884, before Dwyer married Morant.{{sfnp|Reece|2007a|p=21}}

She met and became involved with John (Jack) Bates, and they married on 17 February 1885. Like Morant, he was a bushman and [[Drover (Australian)|drover]]. Their only child, Arnold Hamilton Bates, was born on 26 August 1886 in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales. 

Bates also married Ernest Baglehole that year on 10 June 1885.<ref name="West & Roper" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} They had met on her immigration voyage. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}} They married at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Newtown, Sydney.<ref name="West & Roper" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} He was recorded as a seaman, but he was the son of a wealthy London family. He had become a ship's officer after completing an apprenticeship, and this might have been his attraction for Dwyer.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some biographers speculate that Arnold's biological father was Ernest Bagelhole, not Bates.<ref name="West & Roper">{{Cite book |last1=West |first1=Joe |last2=Roper |first2=Roger |date=2016 |title=Breaker Morant: The final roundup |publisher=Amberley Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn=978-1-44-565965-7 |oclc=976033815}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} The polygamous nature of Bates's marriages was kept secret during her lifetime.

The Bates marriage was not a happy one. Jack's work kept him away from home for long periods.

In February 1894, Bates returned to England, enrolling her son Arnold in a Catholic boarding school and telling Jack that she would return to Australia only when he had a home established for her. She arrived penniless in England, but found a job working for journalist and social campaigner [[W.T Stead|WT Stead]]. Despite her skeptical views, she worked as an assistant editor on the psychic quarterly ''Borderlands''. She developed an active intellectual life among London's well-connected and bohemian literary and political milieu. 

After she left Stead's employment in 1896, it is unclear how she supported herself until 1899. That year she set sail for Western Australia after Jack wrote to say that he was looking for a property there.<ref name="Reece 2007b">{{cite journal |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |date=2007b |title='You would have loved her for her lore': the letters of Daisy Bates |journal=Australian Aboriginal Studies |issue=1 |pages=51–70 |issn=0729-4352 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27You+would+have+loved+her+for+her+lore%27%3A+the+letters+of+Daisy+Bates.-a0169134504 |access-date=19 June 2018 |via=[[The Free Library]]}}</ref> 

In addition, she had been intrigued by a letter published that year in ''[[The Times]]'' about the cruelty of West Australian settlers to [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. As Bates was preparing to return to Australia, she wrote to ''The Times'' offering to investigate the accusations, and report the results to them. Her offer was accepted, and she sailed back to Australia in August 1899.

==Involvement with Australian Aboriginal people==
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}
Bates became interested in the Aboriginal Australians for their own cultures. In the [[foreword]] of her book, written by [[Alan Moorehead]], he said, "As far as I can make out she never tried to teach the Australians Aborigines anything or convert them to any faith. She preferred them to stay as they were and live out the last of their days in peace." Moorehead also wrote, "She was not an anthropologist but she knew them better than anyone else who ever lived; and she made them interesting not only to herself but to us as well."{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

In all, Bates devoted 40 years of her life to studying Aboriginal life, history, culture, rites, beliefs and customs. She researched and wrote on the subject while living in a tent in small settlements from Western Australia to the edges of the [[Nullarbor Plain]], including at [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] in South Australia. She was noted for her strict lifelong adherence to [[Edwardian]] fashion, including wearing boots, gloves and a veil while in the bush.

Bates set up camps to feed, clothe and nurse the transient Aboriginal people, drawing on her own income to meet the needs of the aged. She was said to have worn [[pistols]] even in her old age and to have been quite prepared to use them to threaten police when she caught them mistreating "her" Aborigines.

Given the strains that the Aborigines suffered from European encroachment on their lands and culture, Bates was convinced that they were a dying race. She believed that her mission was to record as much as she could about them before they disappeared.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/bates/daisy/passing/epilogue.html|title=The Passing of the Aborigines, by Daisy Bates : Epilogue|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref> In a 1921 article in the  ''Sunday Times'' (Perth), Bates advocated a "woman patrol" to prevent the movement of Aborigines from the [[Central Australian Reserve]] into settled areas, to prevent conflict and interracial unions.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Daisy |title=New Aboriginal Reserve |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57973115 |work=Sunday Times |publisher=via National Library of Australia |date=12 June 1921 |location=(Perth, WA : 1902 - 1954) |pages=8}}</ref> She later responded to criticism of her effort to keep the people separated, by civil-rights leader [[William Harris (Australian)|William Harris]], Aborigine. He said that part-Aboriginal, [[mixed-race]] people could be of value to Australian society. But Bates wrote, "As to the half-castes, however early they may be taken and trained, with very few exceptions, the only good half-caste is a dead one."{{sfnp|Reece|2007a|pp=89–90}}

===Western Australia===
On her return voyage she met Father Dean Martelli, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest who had worked with Aborigines and who gave her an insight into the conditions they faced. She found a boarding school and home for her son in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and invested some of her money in property as a security for her old age. She proceeded to buy note books and other supplies, and left for the state's remote north-west to gather information on Aborigines and the effects of white settlement.

She wrote articles about conditions around [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] and other areas for geographical society journals, local newspapers, and ''The Times''. She developed a lifelong interest in the lives and welfare of Aboriginal people in Western and South Australia.

Based at the [[Beagle Bay Mission]] near [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], Bates at the age of thirty-six began what became her life's work. Her accounts, among the first attempts at a serious study of Aboriginal culture, were published in the ''Journal of Agriculture'' and later by [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[geography|geographical]] societies in Australia and overseas.<!-- Repetitive with previous paragraph; need cites -->

While at the mission, she compiled a dictionary of several local [[dialects]]. It contained some two thousand words and sentences; she also included notes on legends and myths. In April 1902 Bates, accompanied by her son and her husband, set out on a droving trip from Broome to Perth. It provided good material for her articles. After spending six months in the saddle and travelling four thousand kilometers, Bates knew that her marriage was over.

Following her final separation from Bates in 1902, she spent most of the rest of her life in outback Western and South Australia. There she studied and worked for the remote Aboriginal tribes. They were suffering high mortality because of the incursions of European settlement and the introduction of new infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity. In addition, their societies were disrupted by having to adapt to modern technology and western culture.

In 1904, the Registrar General of Western Australia, Malcolm Fraser,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lomas|first1=Brian D.|title=Queen of Deception|date=2015|publisher=Amazon|isbn=978-0-646-94238-4}}<!--|access-date=July 30, 2015--></ref> appointed her to research Aboriginal customs, languages and dialects. She worked nearly seven years on this project, compiling and organizing the data. Many of her papers were read at Geographical and [[Royal Society]] meetings.

[[Image:Daisy may bates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bates and a group of Aboriginal women, circa 1911]]
In 1910–11 she accompanied anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], later a full professor, and writer and biologist [[E. L. Grant Watson]] on a [[Cambridge]] ethnological expedition to study  into Western Australian marriage customs. She was appointed a "[[Protector of Aborigines|Travelling Protector]]" of the Aborigines, with a special commission to conduct inquiries into all native conditions and problems, such as employment on stations, guardianship, and the morality of Aboriginal and half-caste women in towns and mining camps.

Bates was said later to come into conflict with Radcliffe-Brown after sending him her manuscript report of the expedition. Much to her chagrin, he did not return it for many years. When he did, he had annotated it extensively with critical remarks. At a symposium, Bates accused Radcliffe-Brown of plagiarising from her work. She was scheduled to speak after Radcliffe-Brown had presented his paper, but when she rose, she only complimented him on his presentation of her work, and resumed her seat.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} 

===A "Protector of Aborigines"===
After 1912, her application to become the Northern Territory's Protector of Aborigines was rejected on the basis of [[gender]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} Bates continued her work independently, financing it by selling her cattle station.

The same year she became the first woman to be appointed as Honorary Protector of Aborigines at [[Eucla, Western Australia|Eucla]]. During the sixteen months she spent there, Bates changed from a semi-professional scientist and ethnologist to a staunch friend and protector of the Aborigines. She decided to live among them in order to look after them, and to observe and record their lives and lifestyle.

Bates stayed at Eucla until 1914, when she travelled to [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]] and Sydney to attend the Science Congress of the [[Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science|Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Before returning to the desert, she gave lectures in Adelaide, which aroused the interests of several women's organisations.

During her years at [[Ooldea]], she financed the supplies she bought for the Aborigines from the sale of her property. To maintain her income, she also wrote numerous articles and papers for newspapers, magazines, and learned societies. Through journalist and author [[Ernestine Hill]], Bates's work was introduced to the general public. Much of the publicity tended to focus on her sensational stories of cannibalism among the Aborigines.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} <!-- Supported by other researchers? -->

In August 1933 the Commonwealth Government invited Bates to [[Canberra]] to advise on Aboriginal affairs. The next year she was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. Bates was more interested in the fact that the honor supported her ability to get her work published. 

===South Australia===
She left Ooldea and went to [[Adelaide]]. With the help of [[Ernestine Hill]], Bates published a series of articles for leading Australian newspapers, titled ''[[My Natives and I]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213918855 |title=MY NATIVES AND I|newspaper=[[The Nowra Leader]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 August 1937 |access-date=19 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At the age of seventy-one, she still walked every day to her office at ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' building. <!-- How far was it from her home? -->

Later the Commonwealth Government paid her a stipend of $4 a week to assist her in putting all her papers and notes in order, and preparing her planned manuscript.<!-- For what? How did this differ from previous work --> But with no other income, she found it too expensive to remain in Adelaide. She moved to the village settlement of [[Pyap]] on the [[Murray River]], where she pitched her tent and set up her typewriter.

In 1938, she published ''[[The Passing of the Aborigines]]''<ref>{{Citation | author1=Bates, Daisy | title=The Passing of the Aborigines : A Lifetime Spent Among the Natives of Australia | date=1938 | publisher=Murray | edition= 1st | isbn=978-0-7195-0071-8 }}</ref> which asserted that there were practices of [[cannibalism]] and [[infanticide]]. This generated considerable publicity about her book.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article225571211 |title=LATEST in the BOOK SHOPS |newspaper=[[Weekly Times]] |issue=3720 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 January 1939 |access-date=19 October 2018 |page=34 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><!--   amongst such clans as the [[Nyool-Nyool]], [[Bibbulmun]], [[Baduwonga]], [[Kaalurwonga]] and [[Baadu]]  -- citing who? -->

==Final years==
In 1941 Bates returned to her tent life at Wynbring Siding, east of Ooldea. She lived there on and off until 1945, when she returned to Adelaide because of her health. 

In 1948 she tried, through the [[Australian Army]], to contact her son Arnold Bates, who had served in France during [[World War I]]. Later, in 1949, she contacted the Army again, through the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] (RSL), in an effort to reach him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aborigines Friend Daisy Bates Seeks Her Son |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/82384575 |access-date=27 January 2020 |publisher=The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 - 1950) |date=4 July 1949 |page=7}}</ref> Arnold was living in [[New Zealand]] but refused to have anything to do with his mother.

Daisy Bates died on 18 April 1951, aged 91. She is buried at Adelaide's [[North Road Cemetery]].
