The first name of philanthropist Johns Hopkins comes from the surname of his great-grandmother, Margaret Johns, who married Gerard Hopkins.<ref name="Who Was Johns Hopkins?"/> They named their son Johns Hopkins, who named his own son Samuel Hopkins. Samuel named one of his sons for his father, and that son became the university's benefactor.

===Early years and Daniel Coit Gilman===
[[File:Daniel Coit Gilman1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Daniel Coit Gilman]]]]
The trustees worked alongside four notable university presidents – [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]] of [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Andrew Dickson White|Andrew D. White]] of [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Noah Porter]] of [[Yale College]] and [[James Burrill Angell|James B. Angell]] of [[University of Michigan|Michigan]]. They each vouched for [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] to lead the new University and he became the university's first president.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Pioneer: A History of the Johns Hopkins University, 1874–1889|last = Hawkins|first = Hugh|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1960 |oclc = 876490592|location = Ithaca, NY|page = 15|isbn = 9780810858183}}</ref> Gilman, a [[Yale University|Yale]]-educated scholar, had been serving as president of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] prior to this appointment.<ref name=":0" /> In preparation for the university's founding, [[Daniel Coit Gilman|Gilman]] visited [[University of Freiburg]] and other German universities.

[[File:Hopkins Hall, 1885.jpg|thumb|right|Hopkins Hall circa 1885, on the original downtown Baltimore campus]]
Gilman launched what many at the time considered an audacious and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research. He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: "The best teachers are usually those who are free, competent and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory," he stated.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://krieger.jhu.edu/about/mission/|title = School History and Mission|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = Johns Hopkins Krieger School of Arts and Sciences|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424024857/http://krieger.jhu.edu/about/mission/|archive-date = April 24, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known researchers including the mathematician [[James Joseph Sylvester]]; the biologist [[H. Newell Martin]]; the physicist [[Henry Augustus Rowland|Henry A. Rowland]] (the first president of the [[American Physical Society]]), the [[classical scholars]] [[Basil Gildersleeve]] and Charles D. Morris;<ref name="university"/> the economist [[Richard T. Ely]]; and the chemist [[Ira Remsen]], who became the second president of the university in 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://pages.jh.edu/gazette/2000/sep1100/11remsen.html|title = Ira Remsen: The Chemistry Was Right|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = The Johns Hopkins Gazette Online|last = Stimpert|first = James|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150317084254/http://pages.jh.edu/gazette/2000/sep1100/11remsen.html|archive-date = March 17, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

Gilman focused on the expansion of graduate education and support of faculty research. The new university fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and engineering. Hopkins became the national trendsetter in [[PhD|doctoral]] programs and the host for numerous scholarly journals and associations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/people/gilman-daniel-coit/|title = Gilman, Daniel Coit|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = The Social Welfare History Project|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095457/http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/people/gilman-daniel-coit/|archive-date = April 2, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], founded in 1878, is the oldest American [[university press]] in continuous operation.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.aaupnet.org/about-aaup/about-university-presses/history-of-university-presses|title = History of University Presses|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = AAUP|publisher = AAUP|last = Givler|first = Peter|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150313212628/http://www.aaupnet.org/about-aaup/about-university-presses/history-of-university-presses|archive-date = March 13, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Johns Hopkins Hospital, early photo.jpg|thumb|right|Johns Hopkins Hospital]]With the completion of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in 1889 and the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|medical school]] in 1893, the university's research-focused mode of instruction soon began attracting world-renowned faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of academic medicine, including [[William Osler]], [[William Halsted]], [[Howard Kelly]], and [[William H. Welch|William Welch]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/history5.html|title = The Four Founding Physicians|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = Hopkins Medicine|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150310220741/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/history5.html|archive-date = March 10, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Students came from all over the world to study at Johns Hopkins and returned to their sending country to serve their nation, including Dr Harry Chung (b. 1872) who served as a diplomat in the Manchu Dynasty and First Secretary to the United States. During this period Hopkins made more history by becoming the first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a [[Bachelor's degree]], based on the efforts of [[Mary Garrett|Mary E. Garrett]], who had endowed the school at Gilman's request.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/garrett/biography.htm#suffrage|title = A Biological Sketch of Mary Elizabeth Garrett|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = JHMI Medical Archives|publisher = The Alan Masan Chesney Archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150221123915/http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/garrett/biography.htm#suffrage|archive-date = February 21, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|school of medicine]] was America's first coeducational, graduate-level medical school, and became a prototype for academic medicine that emphasized bedside learning, research projects, and laboratory training.  

In his will and in his instructions to the trustees of the university and the hospital, Hopkins requested that both institutions be built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate, Clifton. When Gilman assumed the presidency, he decided that it would be best to use the university's endowment for recruiting faculty and students, deciding to, as it has been paraphrased, "build men, not buildings."<ref>{{Cite book|title = Founded by Friends: The Quaker Heritage of Fifteen American Colleges and Universities|last = Oliver|first = John W., Jr.|publisher = Scarecrow Press|year = 2007|location = Plymouth|page = 135}}</ref> In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment should be used for construction; only interest on the principal could be used for this purpose. Unfortunately, stocks in The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], which would have generated most of the interest, became virtually worthless soon after Hopkins's death. The university's first home was thus in Downtown Baltimore delaying plans to site the university in Clifton.<ref name=":1" />

===Move to Homewood and early 20th century history===
[[File:Gilman Hall, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.jpg|thumb|left|Gilman Hall, flagship building of the Homewood campus]]In the early 20th century, the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search for a new home. Developing Clifton for the university was too costly, and {{convert|30|acres|0|abbr=on}} of the estate had to be sold to the city as public park. A solution was achieved by a team of prominent locals who acquired the estate in north Baltimore known as [[Homewood campus|Homewood]]. On February 22, 1902, this land was formally transferred to the university. The flagship building, Gilman Hall, was completed in 1915. The [[Whiting School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] relocated in Fall of 1914 and the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences|School of Arts and Sciences]] followed in 1916. These decades saw the ceding of lands by the university for the public Wyman Park and Wyman Park Dell and the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], coalescing in the contemporary area of {{convert|140|acre}}.<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Maryland Hall, Johns Hopkins University, Jan 2011.jpg|right|thumb|Maryland Hall, second home of the [[Whiting School of Engineering]]]]Prior to becoming the main Johns Hopkins campus, the Homewood estate had initially been the gift of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a Maryland planter and signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], to his son Charles Carroll Jr. The original structure, the 1801 [[Homewood Museum|Homewood House]], still stands and serves as an on-campus museum.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url = http://www.museums.jhu.edu/homewood.php|title = Homewood House|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = JHU Museums|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150224222549/http://www.museums.jhu.edu/homewood.php|archive-date = February 24, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The brick and marble [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style of Homewood House became the architectural inspiration for much of the university campus versus the [[Collegiate Gothic]] style of other historic American universities.<ref name=":2" />

In 1909, the university was among the first to start adult [[continuing education]] programs and in 1916 it founded the US' first [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|school of public health]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://hub.jhu.edu/gazette/2012/september/leading-the-way-in-public-health|title = Leading the way in public health|date = September 2012|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = JHU Gazette|last = Edelson|first = Matt|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115321/http://hub.jhu.edu/gazette/2012/september/leading-the-way-in-public-health|archive-date = April 2, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===The post-war era===
Since 1942, the [[Applied Physics Laboratory|Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL)]] has served as a major governmental defense contractor. In tandem with on-campus research, Johns Hopkins has every year since 1979 had the highest federal research funding of any American university.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/01/02/research-spending-rankings-nsf|title = Johns Hopkins leads nation in research spending for the 34th consecutive year|date = January 2, 2014|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = JHU Hub|last = Hub staff report|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095002/http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/01/02/research-spending-rankings-nsf|archive-date = April 2, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===In the 21st century===
[[File:Legg mason tower.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Legg Mason Tower]], home of the new [[Carey Business School]]]]
The early decades of the 21st century saw expansion across the university's institutions in both physical and population sizes. Notably, a planned 88-acre expansion to the medical campus began in 2013.<ref name="Medical Campus Expansion"/> Completed construction on the [[Homewood campus]] has included a new [[biomedical engineering]] building in the [[Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering|Johns Hopkins University Department of Biomedical Engineering]], a new library, a new biology wing, an extensive renovation of the flagship Gilman Hall, and the reconstruction of the main university entrance.<ref name="Charles Street Reconstruction"/>

These years also brought about the rapid development of the university's professional schools of education and business. From 1999 until 2007, these disciplines had been joined together within the School of Professional Studies in Business and Education (SPSBE), itself a reshuffling of several earlier ventures. The 2007 split, combined with new funding and leadership initiatives, has led to the simultaneous emergence of the [[Johns Hopkins School of Education]] and the [[Carey Business School]].<ref name="new professional schools"/>

On November 18, 2018, it was announced that [[Michael Bloomberg]] would make a donation to his alma mater of $1.8&nbsp;billion, marking the largest private donation in modern history to an institution of [[higher education]] and bringing Bloomberg's total contribution to the school in excess of $3.3&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/nyregion/at-1-1-billion-bloomberg-is-top-university-donor-in-us.html|title=$1.1 Billion in Thanks From Bloomberg to Johns Hopkins|date=January 27, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Michael R.

In late 2019, the university's Coronavirus Research Center began tracking worldwide cases of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] by compiling data from hundreds of sources around the world.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/johns-hopkins-uni-corona-zahlen-101.html|title=Exklusiv: Woher die Johns-Hopkins-Zahlen zu Corona stammen|last1=Becker|first1=J.|last2=Hollstein|first2=R.|date=April 3, 2020|website=[[Tagesschau (German TV series)|Tagesschau]]|language=de|access-date=April 5, 2020|last3=Milatz|first3=M.}}</ref> This led to the university becoming one of the most cited sources for data about the pandemic.<ref name=":3" />

===Civil rights===

====African-Americans====
Hopkins was a prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] who supported [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After his death, reports said his conviction was a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins' first [[African-American]] student, [[Kelly Miller (scientist)|Kelly Miller]], a graduate student in physics, astronomy and mathematics.<ref name="mdhistoryonline">[https://archive.today/20120907140948/http://www.mdhistoryonline.net/mdmedicine/cfm/dsp_detail.cfm?id=1895 MDhistoryonline.net], Medicine in Maryland 1752–1920</ref> As time passed, the university adopted a "separate but equal" stance more like other Baltimore institutions.<ref name="racial_record"/>

The first black undergraduate entered the school in 1945 and graduate students followed in 1967.<ref name="timeline_JHSPH">{{cite web |title=Our First Century |url=https://magazine.jhsph.edu/2015/summer/features/a-century-of-firsts/ |website=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |access-date=June 5, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> James Nabwangu, a British-trained Kenyan, was the first black graduate of the medical school.<ref name="In a Sea of White Faces">{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/w98/sea.html |title=In a Sea of White Faces |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |access-date=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611033731/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/w98/sea.html |archive-date=June 11, 2011 }}</ref> African-American instructor and laboratory supervisor [[Vivien Thomas]] was instrumental in developing and conducting the first successful [[blue baby syndrome|blue baby operation]] in 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/partners/legacy/l_colleagues_thomas.html|title = Footprints Through Time: Vivien Thomas|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = PBS|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150215234419/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/partners/legacy/l_colleagues_thomas.html|archive-date = February 15, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Despite such cases, racial diversity did not become commonplace at Johns Hopkins institutions until the 1960s and 1970s.

====Women====
Hopkins' most well-known battle for women's rights was the one led by daughters of trustees of the university; [[Mary Garrett|Mary E. Garrett]], [[M. Carey Thomas]], Mamie Gwinn, Elizabeth King, and Julia Rogers.<ref name="women"/> They donated and raised the funds needed to open the medical school, and required Hopkins' officials to agree to their stipulation that women would be admitted. The [[nursing school]] opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as students.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/chronology/|title = The Johns Hopkins University- Chronology|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = webapps.jhu.edu|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150228234400/http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information%5Fabout%5Fhopkins/about%5Fjhu/chronology/|archive-date = February 28, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Other graduate schools were later opened to women by president [[Ira Remsen]] in 1907. [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]] was the first woman to earn a PhD at Hopkins, in mathematics in 1882.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/christineladd.html|title = Christine Ladd-Franklin|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = Women's Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society|last = Ragsdale|first = Samantha|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150421023720/http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/christineladd.html|archive-date = April 21, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The trustees denied her the degree for decades and refused to change the policy about admitting women. In 1893, Florence Bascomb became the university's first female PhD.<ref name=women/> The decision to admit women at undergraduate level was not considered until the late 1960s and was eventually adopted in October 1969. As of 2009–2010, the undergraduate population was 47% female and 53% male.<ref name="Johns Hopkins University"/> In 2020, the undergraduate population of Hopkins was 53% female.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Johns Hopkins University|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/jhu-2077|access-date=|website=USNews}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Johns Hopkins University - Student Population And Demographics|url=https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/edu/162928/johns-hopkins-university/enrollment/|access-date=2021-01-29|website=College Tuition Compare|language=en}}</ref>

====Freedom of speech====
On September 5, 2013, cryptographer and Johns Hopkins university professor [[Matthew D. Green|Matthew Green]] posted a blog entitled, "On the NSA", in which he contributed to the ongoing debate regarding the role of [[NIST]] and [[NSA]] in formulating U.S. [[cryptography]] standards. On September 9, 2013, Green received a take-down request for the "On the NSA" blog from interim Dean Andrew Douglas from the Johns Hopkins University [[Whiting School of Engineering]].<ref name="GuardianOnTakeDown"/> The request cited concerns that the blog had links to sensitive material. The blog linked to already published news articles from ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[ProPublica.org]]. Douglas subsequently issued a personal on-line apology to Green.<ref name="DaraKerrOnApology"/> The event raised concern over the future of academic freedom of speech within the cryptologic research community.

==Organization==
The Johns Hopkins entity is structured as two corporations, the university and The Johns Hopkins Health System, formed in 1986. The President is JHU's chief executive officer, and the university is organized into nine academic divisions.<ref name=overview/>

JHU's bylaws specify a Board of Trustees of between 18 and 65 voting members. Trustees serve six-year terms subject to a two-term limit. The alumni select 12 trustees. Four recent alumni serve 4-year terms, one per year, typically from the graduating class. The bylaws prohibit students, faculty or administrative staff from serving on the Board, except the President as an ex-officio trustee.<ref name="Bylaws"/> The Johns Hopkins Health System has a separate Board of Trustees, many of whom are doctors or health care executives.<ref name="Johns Hopkins Medicine Adds Four to Board"/>

==Academics==
The full-time, four-year undergraduate program is "most selective" with low transfer-in and a high graduate co-existence.<ref name="Carnegie"/> The cost of attendance per year is approximately $77,400. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Tuition and Costs|url=https://apply.jhu.edu/affording-hopkins/tuition-costs/|access-date=2021-08-01|website=Undergraduate Admissions {{!}} Johns Hopkins University|language=en}}</ref>  However, 51% of full-time undergraduates receive financial aid covering 100% of their need.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overview of Johns Hopkins University|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/jhu-2077|access-date=Aug 1, 2021|website=US News|publisher=}}</ref> The admit rate of Hopkins undergraduates to medical school is 80% and to law school is 97%, some of the highest rates in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Get The Facts|url=https://apply.jhu.edu/discover-jhu/get-the-facts/|access-date=2021-08-01|website=Undergraduate Admissions {{!}} Johns Hopkins University|language=en}}</ref> The university is one of fourteen founding members of the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU); it is also a member of the [[Consortium on Financing Higher Education]] (COFHE) and the [[Universities Research Association]] (URA).

The university's undergraduate programs are most selective: in 2021, the Office of Admissions accepted about 4.9% of its 33,236 Regular Decision applicants <ref name=":4" /> and about 6.4% of its total 38,725 applicants.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hopkins admits 304 ED II applicants|url=https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/02/hopkins-admits-304-ed-ii-applicants|access-date=2021-08-01|website=The Johns Hopkins News-Letter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Dec 11|first1=Hub staff report / Published|last2=2020|date=2020-12-11|title=Johns Hopkins welcomes first members of Class of 2025|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/12/11/class-of-2025-early-decision/|access-date=2021-08-01|website=The Hub|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=March 19|first1=Hub staff report / Published|last2=2021|date=2021-03-19|title=Johns Hopkins invites 1,652 to join Class of 2025|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2021/03/19/class-of-2025-regular-decision/|access-date=2021-08-01|website=The Hub|language=en}}</ref> In 2020, 99% of admitted students graduated in the top 10% of their high school class. <ref name=":7" /> Over time, applications to Johns Hopkins University have risen steadily; as a result, the selectivity of Johns Hopkins University has also increased. [[Early Decision]] is an option at Johns Hopkins University for students who wish to demonstrate that the university is their first choice. These students, if admitted, are required to enroll. This application is due November 2. Most students, however, apply Regular Decision, which is a traditional non-binding round. These applications are due January 1 and students are notified in late March. In 2014, Johns Hopkins ended legacy preference in admissions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/why-we-ended-legacy-admissions-johns-hopkins/605131/|title=Why We Ended Legacy Admissions at Johns Hopkins|last=Daniels|first=Ronald J.|date=January 18, 2020|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> Johns Hopkins practices [[need-blind admission]] and meets the full financial need of all admitted students.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Nov 26|first1=Hub staff report / Published|last2=2018|date=2018-11-26|title=Bloomberg's record gift helps Johns Hopkins realize key goal of need-blind admissions|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/11/26/michael-bloomberg-historic-donation-johns-hopkins/|access-date=2021-08-01|website=The Hub|language=en}}</ref>

===Libraries===
[[File:George-peabody-library.jpg|thumb|<center>The [[George Peabody Library]]</center>]]

The Johns Hopkins University Library system houses more than 3.6 million volumes<ref name="American Library Association Fact Sheet"/> and includes ten main divisions across the university's campuses. The largest segment of this system is the Sheridan Libraries, encompassing the [[Milton S. Eisenhower Library]] (the main library of the [[Homewood campus]]), the Brody Learning Commons, the Hutzler Reading Room ("The Hut") in Gilman Hall, the John Work Garrett Library at [[Evergreen House]], and the [[George Peabody Library]] at the [[Peabody Institute]] campus.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.library.jhu.edu/about.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120923195237/http://www.library.jhu.edu/about.html|url-status = dead|archive-date = September 23, 2012|title = The Sheridan Libraries|access-date = March 4, 2015|website = library.jhu.edu}}</ref>

The main library, constructed in the 1960s, was named for [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], former president of the university and brother of former U.S. president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. The university's stacks had previously been housed in Gilman Hall and departmental libraries.<ref name="gil"/> Only two of the Eisenhower library's six stories are above ground, though the building was designed so that every level receives natural light. The design accords with campus lore that no structure can be taller than Gilman Hall, the flagship academic building. A four-story expansion to the library, known as the Brody Learning Commons, opened in August 2012. The expansion features an energy-efficient, state-of-the-art technology infrastructure and includes study spaces, seminar rooms, and a rare books collection.<ref name="JHU News Releases">{{cite web|title=Brody Learning Commons Opens at Johns Hopkins' Homewood Campus|url=http://releases.jhu.edu/2012/09/04/brody-learning-commons-opens-at-johns-hopkins-homewood-campus/|publisher=JHU|access-date=December 27, 2012}}</ref>

===Johns Hopkins University Press===
{{Main|Johns Hopkins University Press}}
The Johns Hopkins University Press is the publishing division of the Johns Hopkins University. It was founded in 1878 and holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously running [[university press]] in the United States.<ref name="About the Press"/> To date the Press has published more than 6,000 titles and currently publishes 65 scholarly periodicals and over 200 new books each year. Since 1993, the Johns Hopkins University Press has run [[Project MUSE]], an online collection of over 250 full-text, peer-reviewed journals in the humanities and social sciences. The Press also houses the Hopkins Fulfilment Services (HFS), which handles distribution for a number of university presses and publishers. Taken together, the three divisions of the Press—Books, Journals (including MUSE) and HFS—make it one of the largest of America's university presses.

=== Center for Talented Youth ===
The Johns Hopkins University also offers the "[[Center for Talented Youth]]" program—a nonprofit organization dedicated to identifying and developing the talents of the most promising K-12 grade students worldwide. As part of the Johns Hopkins University, the "Center for Talented Youth" or CTY helps fulfill the university's mission of preparing students to make significant future contributions to the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth|url=http://cty.jhu.edu/support/docs/CTY-Scholarship-Brochure.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611162916/http://cty.jhu.edu/support/docs/CTY-Scholarship-Brochure.pdf|archive-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The Johns Hopkins Digital Media Center (DMC) is a multimedia lab space as well as an equipment, technology and knowledge resource for students interested in exploring creative uses of emerging media and use of technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Media Center|url=http://digitalmedia.jhu.edu/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628080726/http://digitalmedia.jhu.edu/|archive-date=June 28, 2014|access-date=May 23, 2014|work=digitalmedia.jhu.edu}}</ref>

=== Degrees offered ===
Johns Hopkins offers a number of degrees in various undergraduate majors leading to the BA and BS and various majors leading to the MA, MS and Ph.D. for graduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://krieger.jhu.edu/academics/fields/|title = Fields of Study|access-date = March 11, 2015|website = Krieger School of Arts and Sciences|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150317222032/http://krieger.jhu.edu/academics/fields/|archive-date = March 17, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Because Hopkins offers both undergraduate and graduate areas of study, many disciplines have multiple degrees available. [[Biomedical engineering]], perhaps one of Hopkins' best-known programs, offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://engineering.jhu.edu/fields-of-study/biomedical-engineering/|title = Biomedical Engineering|access-date = March 11, 2015|website = Whiting School of Engineering|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150303094526/http://engineering.jhu.edu/fields-of-study/biomedical-engineering/|archive-date = March 3, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

==Research==
The opportunity to participate in important research is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Hopkins' undergraduate education. About 80 percent of undergraduates perform independent research, often alongside top researchers.<ref name="Carnegie"/><ref name="Johns Hopkins News Release – JHU"/> In fiscal year 2016, Johns Hopkins spent nearly $2.5 billion on research<ref>{{cite web|last=Eichensehr|first=Morgan|title=For the 38th time, Hopkins leads the country in R&D expenditures|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2018/03/22/for-the-38th-time-hopkins-leads-the-country-in-r-d.html|website=www,bizjournals.com}}</ref>—more than any other U.S. university for the 38th consecutive year.<ref name=hub15/> Johns Hopkins has had seventy-seven members of the [[Institute of Medicine]], forty-three [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] Investigators, seventeen members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and sixty-two members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. As of October 2019, 39 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty members or researchers, with the most recent winners being [[Gregg L. Semenza|Gregg Semenza]] and [[William Kaelin Jr.|William G. Kaelin]].<ref name="The Johns Hopkins University: Nobel Prize Winners"/>

[[File:New Horizons LORRI.jpg|thumb|Installing a [[New Horizons]] Imager at the APL]]Between 1999 and 2009, Johns Hopkins was among the most cited institutions in the world. It attracted nearly 1,222,166 citations and produced 54,022 papers under its name, ranking No. 3 globally (after [[Harvard University]] and the [[Max Planck Society]]) in the number of ''total'' citations published in Thomson Reuters-indexed journals over 22 fields in America.<ref name="ScienceWatch.com"/> In 2020, Johns Hopkins University ranked 5 in number of utility patents granted out of all institutions in the world. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Top 100 Worldwide Universities Granted U.S Utility Patents 202|url=https://academyofinventors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NAI-IPO-Top-100-Universities-Granted-U.S.-Utility-Patents-2020.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

In FY 2000, Johns Hopkins received $95.4&nbsp;million in research grants from the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), making it the leading recipient of [[NASA]] [[research and development]] funding.<ref name="JHU_NASA_R&D_2000"/> In FY 2002, Hopkins became the first university to cross the $1&nbsp;billion threshold on either list, recording $1.14&nbsp;billion in total research and $1.023&nbsp;billion in federally sponsored research. In FY 2008, Johns Hopkins University performed $1.68&nbsp;billion in science, medical and engineering research, making it the leading U.S. academic institution in total R&D spending for the 30th year in a row, according to a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) ranking.<ref name="ascribe_oct09_r&d"/> These totals include grants and expenditures of JHU's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.

In 2013, the [[Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships]] program was established by a $250&nbsp;million gift from [[Michael Bloomberg]]. This program enables the university to recruit fifty researchers from around the world to joint appointments throughout the nine divisions and research centers. Each professor must be a leader in [[interdisciplinary]] research and be active in [[undergraduate education]].<ref name=anderson>Anderson, Nick.

==Student life==
[[File:The Beach, JHU.jpg|thumb|right|Students socializing on ''The Beach'', with Homewood House in the background]]
[[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]], the region of North Baltimore surrounding the university, has undergone several restoration projects, and the university has gradually bought the property around the school for additional student housing and dormitories. ''The Charles Village Project'', completed in 2008, brought new commercial spaces to the neighborhood. The project included Charles Commons, a new, modern residence hall that includes popular retail franchises.<ref name="Charles Commons"/><ref name="einsteinbros"/> In 2015, the University began development of new commercial properties, including a modern upperclassmen apartment complex, restaurants and eateries, and a CVS retail store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/03/26/st-paul-project-groundbreaking/|title=Construction begins on mixed-use development project near JHU's Homewood campus|date=March 26, 2015|website=The Hub|access-date=February 18, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218145242/http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/03/26/st-paul-project-groundbreaking/|archive-date=February 18, 2017}}</ref>

Hopkins invested in improving campus life with an arts complex in 2001, the Mattin Center, and a three-story sports facility, the O'Connor Recreation Center. The large on-campus dining facilities at Homewood were renovated in the summer of 2006.

Quality of life is enriched by the proximity of neighboring academic institutions, including [[Loyola College in Maryland|Loyola College]], [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)]], [[UMBC]], [[Goucher College]], and [[Towson University]], as well as the nearby neighborhoods of [[Hampden, Baltimore|Hampden]], the [[Inner Harbor]], [[Fells Point]], and [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]].

=== Greek life ===
[[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] came to Hopkins in 1876 with the charter of fraternity [[Beta Theta Pi]], which still exists on campus today.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://studentlifeatjhu.wordpress.com/greek-life-at-hopkins/origins-of-greek-life-at-hopkins/|title = The Beginning of Greek Life at Hopkins|date = March 6, 2014|access-date = February 26, 2015|website = Student Life @ Hopkins|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150226233213/https://studentlifeatjhu.wordpress.com/greek-life-at-hopkins/origins-of-greek-life-at-hopkins/|archive-date = February 26, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Since, Johns Hopkins has become home to nine sororities and 11 fraternities. Of the nine sororities, five belong to the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] and four to the Multicultural Greek Council Sororities. Of the fraternities, all 11 belong to the Inter-Fraternity Council.

=== Spring Fair ===
Spring Fair has been a Johns Hopkins tradition since 1972 and has since grown to be the largest student-run festival in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.jhuspringfair.com|title = Spring Fair|date = 2015|access-date = February 26, 2015|website = JHU Spring Fair|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150226235741/http://www.jhuspringfair.com/|archive-date = February 26, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Popular among Hopkins students and Baltimore inhabitants alike, Spring Fair features carnival rides, vendors, food and a [[beer garden]]. Since its beginning, Spring Fair has decreased in size, both in regard to attendance and utilization of space. While one point, the Fair attracted upwards of 100,000 people, it became unruly and, for a variety of reasons including safety concerns and a campus beautification project in the early 2000s, had to be scaled back.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://studentlifeatjhu.wordpress.com/spring-fair/|title = Spring Fair|date = March 5, 2014|access-date = February 26, 2015|website = Student Life @ JHU|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150227003345/https://studentlifeatjhu.wordpress.com/spring-fair/|archive-date = February 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Traditions ===
[[File:JHUQuad.jpg|thumb|{{center|Lighting of the Quad}}]]

While it has been speculated that Johns Hopkins has relatively few traditions for a school of its age and that many past traditions have been forgotten, a handful of myths and customs are ubiquitous knowledge among the community.<ref name="traditions"/> One such long-standing myth surrounds the university seal that is embedded into the floor of the Gilman Hall foyer. The myth holds that any current student to step on the seal will never graduate. In reverence for this tradition, the seal has been fenced off from the rest of the room.

An annual event is the ''Lighting of the Quad'', a ceremony each winter during which the campus is lit up in holiday lights. Recent years have included singing and fireworks.

===Housing===
[[File:AMR I, JHU.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Memorial Residence I, a freshman dormitory]]Living on campus is typically required for first- and second-year undergraduates.<ref name="Johns Hopkins Freshman Room Selection Brochure"/> Freshman housing is centered around Freshman Quad, which consists of three residence hall complexes: The two Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II) plus Buildings A and B. The AMR dormitories are each divided into ''houses'', subunits named for figures from the university's early history. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and in certain wings of McCoy Hall, both located slightly outside the campus. Dorms at Hopkins are generally co-ed with same-gender rooms, though a new policy has allowed students to live in mixed-gender rooms since Fall 2014.<ref name="Gender Inclusive Housing"/><ref name="Freshman Residence Halls"/>

Students determine where they will live during sophomore year through a housing lottery. Most juniors and seniors move into nearby apartments or row-houses. Non-freshmen in university housing occupy one of four buildings: McCoy Hall, the Bradford Apartments, the Homewood Apartments, and Charles Commons.<ref name="Freshman Room Selection"/> All are located in [[Charles Village]] within a block from the [[Homewood campus]]. Forty-five percent of the student body lives off-campus while 55% lives on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/jhu-2077/student-life|title = Johns Hopkins University Student Life|access-date = February 26, 2015|website = US News & World Report|publisher = US News & World Report|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150215115940/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/jhu-2077/student-life|archive-date = February 15, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>
