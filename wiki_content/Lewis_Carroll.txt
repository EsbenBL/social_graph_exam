'''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|t|w|ɪ|dʒ|_|ˈ|d|ɒ|dʒ|s|ən}}; 27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name '''Lewis Carroll''', was an English writer of children's fiction, notably ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. He was noted for his facility with [[word play]], logic, and fantasy. The poems ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' and ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' are classified in the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. He was also a mathematician, photographer, inventor, and [[Anglican]] [[deacon]].

Carroll came from a family of [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and developed a long relationship with [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. [[Alice Liddell]], daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, [[Henry Liddell]], is widely identified as the original for ''Alice in Wonderland'', though Carroll always denied this. Scholars are divided about whether his relationship with children included an erotic component.

In 1982, a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]]. There are Lewis Carroll societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/societies.html |title=Lewis Carroll Societies |publisher=Lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk |access-date=7 October 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&ein=132904564 Lewis Carroll Society of North America Inc.] Charity Navigator.

==Background and early life==
[[File:CharlesDodgson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photographic portrait of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), seated and holding a book|Lewis Carroll]]
Dodgson's family was predominantly [[Northern England|northern English]] (with Irish connections), conservative and [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or [[Church of England]] clergy. His great-grandfather, [[Charles Dodgson (bishop)|Charles Dodgson]], had risen through the ranks of the church to become the [[Bishop of Elphin]] in rural Ireland.<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;10</ref> His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 6–7</ref> The older of these sons – yet another [[Charles Dodgson (priest)|Charles Dodgson]] – was Carroll's father. He went to [[Westminster School]] and then to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].  He reverted to the other family tradition and took [[holy orders]].  He was mathematically gifted and won a [[double first]] degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1830 and became a country [[parson]].<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;8</ref><ref name="kqihew">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 30–35</ref>

Dodgson was born in All Saints' Vicarage at [[Daresbury]], Cheshire, near [[Warrington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g.co/maps/cp7d5|title=Google map of Daresbury, UK|access-date=22 October 2011}}</ref> the eldest boy and the third child. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] of [[Croft-on-Tees]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years.

Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the [[Church of England]] who later became the [[Archdeacon of Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|title=Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|access-date=8 March 2011}}</ref> and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was [[high church]], inclining toward [[Anglo-Catholicism]], an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]] and the [[Tractarian movement]], and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambivalent relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 200–202</ref>

==Education==

===Home life===
During his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His "reading lists" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. He also spoke with a [[Stuttering|stammer]] – a condition shared by most of his siblings<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;4</ref> – that often inhibited his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of [[Richmond School]]) in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]].

===Rugby===
In 1846, Dodgson entered [[Rugby School]] where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving:
{{quote|I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 30–31</ref>}}
Dodgson did not claim he suffered from bullying but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll: Discovering the Whimsical, Thoughtful, and Sometimes Lonely Man Who Created "Alice in Wonderland"|last=Woolf|first=Jenny|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2010|isbn=9780312612986|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24}}</ref> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, who was Dodgson's nephew, wrote that "even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a righteous cause", which is the protection of the smaller boys.<ref name=":0" />

Scholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. "I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby", observed mathematics master R. B. Mayor.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;29</ref> Francis Walkingame's ''The Tutor's Assistant; Being a Compendium of Arithmetic'' – the mathematics textbook that the young Dodgson used – still survives and it contained an inscription in [[Latin]], which translates to: "This book belongs to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson: hands off!"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rediscovered Lewis Carroll Puzzles|first=Lewis|last=Carroll|editor-first1=Edward|editor-last1=Wakeling|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=New York City|date=1995|isbn=0486288617|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rediscoveredlewi00carr/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/rediscoveredlewi00carr/page/13}}</ref> Some pages also included annotations such as the one found in p.&nbsp;129, where he wrote "Not a fair question in decimals" next to a question.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Charlie|last=Lovett|title=Lewis Carroll Among His Books: A Descriptive Catalogue of the Private Library of Charles L. Dodgson|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=2005|isbn=0786421053|pages=329}}</ref>

===Oxford===
He left Rugby at the end of 1849 and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], pp. 63–64</ref> After waiting for rooms in college to become available, he went into residence in January 1851.<ref name=clark6465>[[#Clark|Clark]], pp. 64–65</ref> He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of "inflammation of the brain" – perhaps [[meningitis]] or a stroke – at the age of 47.<ref name=clark6465/>

His early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard but was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him. In 1852, he obtained [[first-class honours]] in Mathematics [[Moderations]] and was shortly thereafter nominated to a [[Christ Church, Oxford#Governing body|Studentship]] by his father's old friend Canon [[Edward Pusey]].<ref name=collingwood52>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;52</ref><ref name=clark74>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;74</ref> In 1854, he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, graduating Bachelor of Arts.<ref name=collingwood57>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;57</ref><ref name=wilson>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], p.&nbsp;51</ref> He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.<ref name=cohen51>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;51</ref><ref name=clark79>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;79</ref> Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855,<ref name=frw41>{{cite book | title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain | first1=Raymond |last1=Flood | first2=Adrian |last2=Rice | first3=Robin |last3=Wilson | author3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=Oxfordshire, England|date=2011 | isbn=978-0-19-960139-4 |oclc=721931689 | page=41 }}</ref> which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.<ref name=cohen414-6>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 414–416</ref> Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson was to remain at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death, including that of Sub-Librarian of the Christ Church library, where his office was close to the Deanery, where Alice Liddell lived.<ref name = "ekfvyz">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 2.</ref>

==Character and appearance==

===Health problems===

[[File:Lewis Carroll 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|1863 photograph of Carroll by [[Oscar G. Rejlander]]]]
The young adult Charles Dodgson was about {{convert|6|ft|2}} tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. In early childhood, he acquired a [[Stuttering|stammer]], which he referred to as his "hesitation"; it remained throughout his life.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/>

The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. While one apocryphal story says that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, there is no evidence to support this idea.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;91</ref> Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many supposed facts often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/>

Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at [[charades]].<ref name="ekfvyz"/>

===Social connections===
In the interim between his early published writings and the success of the ''Alice'' books, Dodgson began to move in the [[pre-Raphaelite]] social circle. He first met [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 and became friendly with him. Around 1863,  he developed a close relationship with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his family. He would often take pictures of the family in the garden of the Rossetti's house in Chelsea, London. He also knew [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]], and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author [[George MacDonald]] well – it was the enthusiastic reception of ''Alice'' by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.<ref name="ekfvyz"/><ref name="snaogq">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 100–4</ref>

===Politics, religion, and philosophy===
In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. [[Martin Gardner]] labels Dodgson as a [[Tory]] who was "awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors".<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to The annotated Alice: Alice's adventures in Wonderland & Through the looking glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2000|page=xv|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}</ref> [[William Tuckwell|The Reverend W. Tuckwell]], in his ''Reminiscences of Oxford'' (1900), regarded him as "austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape".<ref>{{cite book | title = Introduction to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass | last = Gardner | first = Martin | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = xvi | isbn = 978-0-517-02962-6 }}</ref> Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In ''The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll'', the editor states that "his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future."<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]]</ref> When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but "doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'". He added:
{{Quote|I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us—our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another—we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to—that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, "I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary."|Carroll (1897)<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], Chapter IX</ref>}}

Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called "thought reading".<ref>{{cite book | title = The Society for Psychical Research, 1882–1982 A History | last = Hayness | first = Rene&#769;e | publisher = Macdonald & Co | place = London | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-356-07875-2 | pages = 13–14 }}</ref> Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]", which appeared in one of the early volumes of ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/IV.14.278| title = What the Tortoise Said to Achilles| journal = Mind| issue = 14| pages = 278–280| year = 1895| last1 = Carroll | first1 = L. }}</ref> The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by [[Simon Blackburn]] titled "Practical Tortoise Raising".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/104.416.695| title = Practical Tortoise Raising| journal = Mind| volume = 104| issue = 416| pages = 695–711| year = 1995| last1 = Blackburn | first1 = S. }}</ref>

==Artistic activities==

===Literature===
From a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine ''[[Mischmasch]]'' and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications ''The Comic Times'' and ''The Train'', as well as smaller magazines such as the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]'' and the ''Oxford Critic''. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. "I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the ''Whitby Gazette'' or the ''Oxonian Advertiser''), but I do not despair of doing so someday," he wrote in July 1855.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/> Sometime after 1850, he did write [[marionette|puppet]] plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: ''La Guida di Bragia''.<ref>{{Cite book| title=La Guida Di Bragia, a Ballad Opera for the Marionette Theatre| publisher=Lewis Carroll Society of North America| year=2007| chapter=Introduction| first=Peter L. |last=Heath| pages=vii–xvi| isbn=978-0-930326-15-9 }}</ref>

In March 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called "Solitude" appeared in ''The Train'' under the authorship of "Lewis Carroll". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: ''Lewis'' was the anglicised form of ''Ludovicus'', which was the Latin for ''Lutwidge'', and ''Carroll'' an Irish surname similar to the Latin name ''Carolus'', from which comes the name ''Charles''.<ref name = "kqihew"/> The transition went as follows:
"Charles Lutwidge" translated into Latin as "Carolus Ludovicus". This was then translated back into English as "Carroll Lewis" and then reversed to make "Lewis Carroll".<ref>Roger Lancelyn Green [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97087/Lewis-Carroll On-line Encyclopædia Britannica ]</ref> This pseudonym was chosen by editor [[Edmund Yates]] from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;129</ref>

====''Alice'' books====

[[File:Jabberwocky.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Illustration of a child with a sword facing a fearsome winged dragon in a forest|''The Jabberwock'', as illustrated by [[John Tenniel]] for Lewis Carroll's ''Through the Looking-Glass'', including the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".]]

In 1856, Dean [[Henry Liddell]] arrived at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], bringing with him his young family, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life over the following years, and would greatly influence his writing career. Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own "Alice" from [[Alice Liddell]]; the [[acrostic]] poem at the end of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his "little heroine" was based on any real child,<ref>Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) ''The Letters of Lewis Carroll'', London: Macmillan.</ref><ref name="nbrhxm">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 5 "The Unreal Alice"</ref> and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. [[Gertrude Chataway]]'s name appears in this form at the beginning of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.<ref name="nbrhxm"/>

Information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858–1862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend<ref name="Winchester">{{cite book| title=The Alice Behind Wonderland

It was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground'' in November 1864.<ref name="ulsdnc"/>

Before this, the family of friend and mentor [[George MacDonald]] read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected – ''Alice Among the Fairies'' and ''Alice's Golden Hour'' – the work was finally published as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.<ref name="snaogq" /> The illustrations this time were by [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist. Annotated versions provide insights into many of the ideas and hidden meanings that are prevalent in these books.<ref>Gardner, Martin (2000). "The Annotated Alice. The Definitive Edition". New York: W.W. Norton.</ref><ref>Heath, Peter (1974). "The Philosopher's Alice". New York: St. Martin's Press.</ref> Critical literature has often proposed [[Freudian]] interpretations of the book as "a descent into the dark world of the [[subconscious]]", as well as seeing it as a satire upon contemporary mathematical advances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=7 March 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391-600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved/|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|first=Melanie|last=Bayley|work=[[New Scientist]]}}</ref>

The overwhelming commercial success of the first Alice book changed Dodgson's life in many ways.<ref>{{cite book | title=The big book of beastly mispronunciations: the complete opinionated guide for the careful speaker | first=Charles Harrington | last=Elster | author-link=Charles Harrington Elster | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year=2006 | isbn=061842315X | pages=158–159 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtojrMr0Ft4C&pg=PA158 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=The Unpronounceables: Difficult Literary Names 1500–1940 | last=Emerson | first=R.

He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention. Indeed, according to one popular story, [[Queen Victoria]] herself enjoyed ''Alice in Wonderland'' so much that she commanded that he dedicate his next book to her, and was accordingly presented with his next work, a scholarly mathematical volume entitled ''An Elementary Treatise on Determinants''.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]]</ref><ref name=hhgg>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4462670 |title=Lewis Carroll – Logician, Nonsense Writer, Mathematician and Photographer |publisher=BBC  |work=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |date=26 August 2005 |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> Dodgson himself vehemently denied this story, commenting "...&nbsp;It is utterly false in every particular: nothing even resembling it has occurred";<ref name=hhgg/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dodgson |first=Charles |title=Symbolic Logic |year=1896}}</ref> and it is unlikely for other reasons. As [[Thomas Strong (bishop)|T. B.

Late in 1871, he published the sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''. (The title page of the first edition erroneously gives "1872" as the date of publication.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton |title=Introduction to "Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass"|publisher=[[Random House]] |date=24 June 2009 |isbn=978-0-553-21345-4}}</ref>) Its somewhat darker mood possibly reflects changes in Dodgson's life. His father's death in 1868 plunged him into a depression that lasted some years.<ref name="snaogq"/>

====''The Hunting of the Snark''====
In 1876, Dodgson produced his next great work, ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', a fantastical "nonsense" poem, with illustrations by [[Henry Holiday]], exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of nine tradesmen and one beaver, who set off to find the snark. It received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers,<ref name="Hark the Snark">{{cite book|title=Lewis Carroll Observed|editor=Guilano, Edward|author=Cohen, Morton N.|year=1976|chapter=Hark the Snark|publisher=Clarkson N.

====''Sylvie and Bruno''====
In 1895, 30 years after the publication of his masterpieces, Carroll attempted a comeback, producing a two-volume tale of the fairy siblings [[Sylvie and Bruno]]. Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirizes English society, and more specifically the world of academia. ''Sylvie and Bruno'' came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century.

===Photography (1856–1880) ===
[[File:Alice Liddell 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Photo of [[Alice Liddell]] taken by Lewis Carroll (1858)]]

In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge|Skeffington Lutwidge]], and later of his Oxford friend [[Reginald Southey]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;93</ref> He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.<ref name = "snaogq"/>

A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Taylor |first1=Roger |last2=Wakeling |first2=Edward |title=Lewis Carroll, Photographer |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=25 February 2002 |isbn=978-0-691-07443-6}}</ref> Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.<ref>Cohen, Morton (1999). "Reflections in a Looking Glass." New York: Aperture.</ref> His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.<ref name="Winchester"/>

He also found photography to be a useful entrée into higher social circles.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;116</ref> During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as [[John Everett Millais]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref name = "snaogq"/>

By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of [[Tom Quad]], created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;265</ref> He used the [[Collodion|wet collodion process]]; commercial photographers who started using the [[Dry-plate photography#Popularization|dry-plate process]] in the 1870s took pictures more quickly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=An Exhibition From the Jon A.

===Inventions===
To promote letter writing, Dodgson invented "The Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case" in 1889. This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the [[Cheshire Cat]] on the back.  It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing utensils; Carroll expressly notes in ''[[Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing]]'' it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own.  The pack included a copy of a pamphlet version of this lecture.<ref>Flodden W. Heron, "Lewis Carroll, Inventor of Postage Stamp Case" in ''Stamps'', vol. 26, no. 12, 25 March 1939</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/inspired/stamps.html |title=Carroll Related Stamps |publisher=The Lewis Carroll Society |date=28 April 2005 |access-date=10 March 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent.]]
Another invention was a writing tablet called the [[nyctograph]] that allowed note-taking in the dark, thus eliminating the need to get out of bed and strike a light when one woke with an idea. The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen squares and a system of symbols representing an alphabet of Dodgson's design, using letter shapes similar to the [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] writing system on a [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]] device.<ref>[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]].

</ref>

He also devised a number of games, including an early version of what today is known as [[Scrabble]]. He appears to have invented – or at least certainly popularized – the "doublet" (see [[word ladder]]), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word. For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.<ref name = "snaogq"/> The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.

Other items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociam (a type of tricycle); fairer elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the [[Senior Common Room]] at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double-sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two [[cipher]]s for [[cryptography]].<ref name = "snaogq"/>

He also proposed alternative systems of parliamentary representation. He proposed the so-called [[Dodgson's method]], using the [[Condorcet method]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PN1dAAAACAAJ|title=A Mathematical Approach to Proportional Representation |last1=Black |first1=Duncan |last2=McLean|first2= Iain|last3= McMillan|first3= Alistair|last4= Monroe|first4= Burt L.|last5= Dodgson|first5= Charles Lutwidge |isbn=978-0-7923-9620-8|year=1996}}</ref> In 1884, he proposed a proportional representation system based on multi-member districts, each voter casting only a single vote, quotas as minimum requirements to take seats, and votes transferable by candidates through what is now called [[Liquid democracy]].<ref>Charles Dodgson, Principles of Parliamentary Representation (1884)</ref>

Within the academic discipline of mathematics, Dodgson worked primarily in the fields of [[geometry]], linear and [[matrix algebra]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[recreational mathematics]], producing nearly a dozen books under his real name. Dodgson also developed new ideas in linear algebra (e.g., the first printed proof of the [[Rouché–Capelli theorem|Kronecker–Capelli theorem]]),<ref>{{cite journal|author=Seneta, Eugene|year=1984|title= Lewis Carroll as a Probabilist and Mathematician|url=http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/eseneta/l.carroll.1984.pdf|journal=The Mathematical Scientist|volume=9|pages= 79–84}}</ref><ref>Abeles, Francine F.

His occupation as Mathematical Lecturer at Christ Church gave him some financial security.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], p.&nbsp;61</ref>

===Mathematical logic===
His work in the field of mathematical logic attracted renewed interest in the late 20th century. Martin Gardner's book on logic machines and diagrams and William Warren Bartley's posthumous publication of the second part of Dodgson's symbolic logic book have sparked a reevaluation of Dodgson's contributions to symbolic logic.<ref>Gardner, Martin.

==Correspondence==
Dodgson wrote and received as many as 98,721 letters, according to a special letter register which he devised. He documented his advice about how to write more satisfying letters in a missive entitled "[[Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing]]".<ref name="Clark-D">{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v034/34.2.clark.html | title=The Place of Lewis Carroll in Children's Literature (review) | last=Clark|first= Dorothy G. | journal=The Lion and the Unicorn |date=April 2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=253–258 | doi=10.1353/uni.0.0495| s2cid=143924225 }}</ref>

==Later years==
[[File:Through the looking-glass, and what Alice found there (1917) (14773105753).jpg|thumb|upright|Lewis Carroll in later life]]

Dodgson's existence remained little changed over the last twenty years of his life, despite his growing wealth and fame. He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. Public appearances included attending the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (the first major live production of his ''Alice'' books) at the  [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] on 30 December 1886.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Lewis |title=The Letters of Lewis Carroll, Volumes 1-2|page=657 |date=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|quote=Dec. 30th.—To London with M—, and took her to "[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]," Mr. Savile Clarke's play at the Prince of Wales's Theatre... as a whole, the play seems a success.}}</ref> The two volumes of his last novel, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the ''Alice'' books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.<ref>Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002).

The only known occasion on which he travelled abroad was a trip to Russia in 1867 as an ecclesiastic, together with the Reverend [[Henry Liddon]]. He recounts the travel in his "Russian Journal", which was first commercially published in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html |title=Chronology of Works of Lewis Carroll |access-date=20 February 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220131026/http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html |archive-date=20 February 2009 }}</ref> On his way to Russia and back, he also saw different cities in Belgium, Germany, partitioned Poland, and France.

==Death==
[[File:Lewis Carroll Grave 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|The grave of Lewis Carroll at the [[Mount Cemetery]] in [[Guildford]]]]
Dodgson died of [[pneumonia]] following [[influenza]] on 14 January 1898 at his sisters' home, "The Chestnuts", in [[Guildford]] in the county of Surrey, just four days before the death of Henry Liddell. He was two weeks away from turning 66 years old. His funeral was held at the nearby [[St Mary's Church, Guildford|St Mary's Church]].<ref>[http://www.thisisourtownguildford.co.uk/st-marys-church/10301656 Lewis Carroll and St Mary's Church – ''Guildford: This Is Our Town'' website]</ref> His body was buried at the [[Mount Cemetery]] in Guildford.<ref name = "snaogq"/>

He is commemorated at [[All Saints' Church, Daresbury]], in its stained glass windows depicting characters from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''.

==Controversies and mysteries==

===Sexuality===
Some late twentieth-century biographers have suggested that Dodgson's interest in children had an erotic element, including [[Morton N. Cohen]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1995),<ref name=cohen-166254>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 166–167, 254–255</ref> [[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background'' (1995), and [[Michael Bakewell]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1996).
Cohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's "sexual energies sought unconventional outlets", and further writes:

{{quote|We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is naïve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;228</ref>}}

[[File: Hatch, Beatrice (Lewis Carroll, 30.07.1873).jpg|thumb|upright|Lewis Carroll portrait of [[Beatrice Hatch]]]]
Cohen goes on to note that Dodgson "apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [[erotic]]ism", but adds that "later generations look beneath the surface" (p.&nbsp;229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell and that this was the cause of the unexplained "break" with the family in June 1863,<ref name="snaogq"/> an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] stop short of identifying Dodgson as a [[paedophile]] (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world. {{Citation Needed|date=September 2021}} Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as "the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover".<ref>{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Robson|title=Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentlemen|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|date=2001|isbn=978-0691004228|page=137}}</ref>

Several other writers and scholars have challenged the evidential basis for Cohen's and others' views about Dodgson's sexual interests. [[Hugues Lebailly]] has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the "Victorian Child Cult", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |title=Association for new Lewis Carroll studies |publisher=Contrariwise.wild-reality.net |access-date=19 October 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207054041/http://www.contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref> Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian [[Christmas card]]s, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time.

[[Karoline Leach]]'s reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea – fostered by Dodgson's various biographers – that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson "the Carroll Myth". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as "child-friends" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 16–17</ref> She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;33</ref>

In addition to the biographical works that have discussed Dodgson's sexuality, there are modern artistic interpretations of his life and work that do so as well – in particular, [[Dennis Potter]] in his play ''Alice'' and his screenplay for the motion picture ''[[Dreamchild]]'', and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] in his musical ''Alice''.

===Ordination===
Dodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the [[Church of England]] from a very early age and was expected to be [[holy orders|ordained]] within four years of obtaining his master's degree, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861. But when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted Dodgson to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22–24 October 1862</ref> Dodgson never became a priest, unique amongst senior students of his time.

There is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step because he was afraid of having to preach.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;263</ref> Wilson quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], pp. 103–104</ref> But Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Wilson also points out that the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]]) and "alternative" religions ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;134</ref> Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a "vile and worthless" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text</ref>

===Missing diaries===
{{One source|section|date=November 2021}}
At least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48, 51</ref> The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48–51</ref> Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21–31 years old).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;52</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Real Lewis Carroll / A Talk given to the Lewis Carroll Society |first=Edward |last=Wakeling |date = April 2003|url=http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm |work=1855 ... 1856 ... 1857 ... 1858 ... 1862 ... 1863|access-date=14 September 2009}}</ref>{{Not in source given|date=November 2021}} This was a period when Dodgson began suffering great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin. This was also the period of time when he composed his extensive love poetry, leading to speculation that the poems may have been autobiographical.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]] p.&nbsp;54</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodgson Family and Their Legacy|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carroll/dreamchild/dreamchild5.html|access-date=5 January 2011}}</ref>

Many theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest that this was so, and a paper offers some evidence to the contrary which was discovered by [[Karoline Leach]] in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.<ref>Dodgson Family Collection, Cat. No. F/17/1. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20181116072055/http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html Cut Pages in Diary]". (For an account of its discovery see ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 3 May 1996.)</ref>

[[File:Cutpagesdoc.jpg|thumb|upright|The "cut pages in diary" document, in the Dodgson family archive in Woking]]
This paper is known as the "cut pages in diary" document, and was compiled by various members of Carroll's family after his death. Part of it may have been written at the time when the pages were destroyed, though this is unclear. The document offers a brief summary of two diary pages that are missing, including the one for 27 June 1863. The summary for this page states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson that there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's [[governess]], as well as about his relationship with "Ina", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The "break" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 170–2.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116072055/http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 November 2018 |work=Looking for Lewis Carroll |title=Text available on-line |access-date=4 May 2007}}</ref> An alternative interpretation has been made{{by whom|date=November 2021}} regarding Carroll's rumoured involvement with "Ina": Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is that the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all; until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt.

===Migraine and epilepsy===
In his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of [[migraine]] with aura, describing very accurately the process of "moving fortifications" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.<ref name=w1>Wakeling, Edward (Ed.) "The Diaries of Lewis Carroll", Vol. 9, p.&nbsp;52</ref> Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine ''per se'', or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] has been named after Dodgson's little heroine because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as [[micropsia]] and [[macropsia]], a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an afflicted person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as if it were the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson may have suffered from this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.<ref name="Migraineand">{{cite journal|title=Migraine and Lewis Carroll|author= Maudie, F.W. |journal=The Migraine Periodical|volume=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Dodgson also suffered two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an "epileptiform" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he was a lifetime sufferer of this condition, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.<ref name=w1/> Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for "quite sometime afterward". This attack was diagnosed as possibly "epileptiform" and Carroll himself later wrote of his "seizures" in the same diary.

Most of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 ''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll'', is that Dodgson very likely had migraine and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Woolf |first=Jenny |title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll |pages=298–9 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=978-0-312-67371-0|date=4 February 2010}}</ref>
