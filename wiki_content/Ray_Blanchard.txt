'''Ray Milton Blanchard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|l|æ|n|tʃ|ər|d}}; born October 9, 1945<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/ray_blanchard/|title=Ray Blanchard - University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine|website=individual.utoronto.ca|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>) is an American-Canadian [[sexologist]], best known for his research studies on [[transsexualism]], [[pedophilia]] and [[sexual orientation]]. He found that men with more older brothers are more likely to be gay than men with fewer older brothers, a phenomenon he attributes to the reaction of the mother's immune system to male fetuses. Blanchard has also published research studies on [[phallometry]] and several [[paraphilia]]s, including [[erotic asphyxia|autoerotic asphyxia]].

==Education and career==
Blanchard was born in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in [[Psychology]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1967 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1973. He conducted postdoctoral research at [[Dalhousie University]] until 1976, when he accepted a position as a [[clinical psychologist]] at the Ontario Correctional Institute in [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton, Ontario, Canada]] (a suburb of [[Toronto]]). There, Blanchard met [[Kurt Freund]], who became his mentor. Freund was conducting research in [[chemical castration]] for sex offenders.<ref name="freund1980">{{Cite journal | last1 = Freund | first1 = K. | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1980.tb10433.x | title = Therapeutic Sex Drive Reduction | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 62 | pages = 5–38 | year = 1980 | pmid =  7006321| s2cid = 21981060 }}</ref> In 1980, he joined the [[Clarke Institute of Psychiatry]] (now part of the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]]).<ref name="laws">{{cite book | editor = Laws RD |editor2=O'Donohue WT | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment | publisher = [[Guilford Press]] | isbn = 978-1-57230-241-9| year = 1997 }}</ref> In 1995 Blanchard was named Head of Clinical Sexology Services in the Law and Mental Health Programme of the CAMH, where he served until 2010.

==Fraternal birth order effect==
Blanchard has conducted research on [[biology and sexual orientation|factors that influence the development of sexual orientation]], including biological factors. He has proposed a theory known as a [[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] or older brother effect. This theory is that the more older brothers a man has, the greater the probability is that he will have a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] [[sexual orientation]].  The number of older ''sisters'' has no effect, however. The same is not true for lesbians—neither the number of older brothers nor the number of older sisters appears to be related to the sexual orientation of women.<ref>{{Cite journal

Blanchard hypothesizes that the older brother effect is caused by interactions between a male fetus and the immune system of the mother: because certain proteins (called H-y antigens) are produced by male and not by female fetuses, the mother's immune system reacts only to male fetuses and is more likely to produce a reaction with each successive exposure to a male fetus.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Typology of transsexualism==
{{main|Blanchard's transsexualism typology}}
Blanchard coined the term "autogynephilia" to describe [[Trans woman|trans women]] with an erotic desire "to be women," and hypothesized that all gender dysphoria experienced by this group is of two types: "homosexual" gender dysphoria and "non-homosexual" gender dysphoria.  Blanchard defined the former as being present in [[transsexuals]] attracted to men, while he defined the latter as being present in transsexuals attracted to the idea of themselves as women.<ref>{{Cite journal

Blanchard supports [[publicly funded health care|public funding]] of [[sex reassignment surgery]] as an appropriate treatment for transsexual people, as he believes the available evidence supports that the surgery helps them live more comfortably and happily, with high satisfaction rates.<ref name="blanchard2000">{{cite journal | last = Blanchard | first = R | year = 2000 | title = Part II: The case for publicly funded transsexual surgery | journal = Psychiatry Rounds | volume = 4 | issue = 2 |pages = 4–6 | url = http://individual.utoronto.ca/james_cantor/index_files/Blanchard2000.pdf }}</ref>

Blanchard defined autogynephilic as "a man's paraphilic tendency to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman".<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=Jamie|last2=Clarke|first2=David|last3=Lomax|first3=Terri|date=2011|title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals' Impressions of Blanchard's Autogynephilia Theory|journal=International Journal of Transgender Health|page=136}}</ref> He researched this theory by conducting a test on a sample of 119 MtF transsexuals who submitted an anonymous questionnaire to test if they were autogynephilic or homosexual. Blanchard believed that not all transsexuals fit in the category of "homosexual" and that some were instead autogynephilic transsexuals.<ref name=":1" /> Survey participants felt that they were neither homosexual nor autogynephilic transsexuals and should not be classified in either group. A majority felt that the sexual attraction to become a woman weakened with age, but others reported that they had noticed a change after physical transition.<ref name=":1" /> Blanchard ultimately concluded that transsexuals were either sexually aroused by men, androphilic, or aroused by the thought of being a woman, nonandrophilic.

The number of openly transgender women has rapidly increased over the past several decades. More and more individuals have undergone operations and [[transgender hormone therapy|hormone therapy]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Anne. A|date=2007|title=Becoming What We Love: autogynephilic transsexualism conceptualized as an expression of romantic love|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|pages=507–508}}</ref> They believe that their gender identity, defined as "one's inner sense of being male or female, masculine or feminine",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Anne. A|date=2004|title=. Autogynephilia: A Paraphilic Model of Gender Identity Disorder|journal=Transgender Subjectivities|page=76}}</ref> did not match the body they were in. According to Blanchard, "Autogynephilic transsexuals were men who were also sexually attracted to women, but whose paraphilic sexual interest made them want to go farther and permanently change their bodies to become the objects of their attraction".<ref name=":0" />

==''Teleiophilia''==
Blanchard coined ''teleiophilia'' to refer to a sexual preference for adults.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Barbaree | first2 = H. E. | last3 = Bogaert | first3 = A. F. | last4 = Dickey | first4 = R. | last5 = Klassen | first5 = P. | last6 = Kuban | first6 = M.

The term was formalized in order to forestall neologisms, such as "adultophilia" or "normophilia", that were occasionally used but had no precise definition. The term is used primarily by professional sexologists in the scientific literature.

==DSM-5==

===Appointment===
Blanchard served on the gender dysphoria sub-working group for the DSM-IV and served as Chair of the paraphilia sub-working group for the [[DSM-5]].

Whereas Green proposed to solve the problem by removing pedophilia from the DSM, and O'Donohue proposed to remove criterion B for pedophilia, Blanchard proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias, namely a distinction between paraphilia and ''paraphilic disorder''. The latter term is proposed to identify the [[mental disorder|diagnosable condition]], which meets both Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B, can be ascertained, but ''not'' diagnosed, as having a paraphilia. (Blanchard acknowledges [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[James Cantor]] for discussions about this distinction<ref name = BlanchardDSM5/>). Interviewed by [[bioethics]] professor [[Alice Dreger]], Blanchard explained: "We tried to go as far as we could in depathologizing mild and harmless paraphilias, while recognizing that severe paraphilias that distress or impair people or cause them to do harm to others are validly regarded as disorders."<ref>{{cite web | last = Dreger  | first = A | date = 2010-02-19 | url = http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioethicsforum/Post.aspx?id=4494 | title = Of Kinks, Crimes, and Kinds: The Paraphilias Proposal for the DSM-5 | publisher = [[Hastings Center]] | access-date = 2012-02-10 }}</ref>
