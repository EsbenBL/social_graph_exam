For more than three decades he focused on the Rorschach and developed a standardized system for its interpretation. His [[Exner system of scoring]], formally known as the Comprehensive System, was first published in 1974 and is now the standard method in psychology for administering, scoring and interpreting the Rorschach inkblot test.
Through his work, the Rorschach inkblot test became a more useful psychometric instrument.
