== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1856, the [[Iowa General Assembly]] enacted legislation to establish the Iowa Agricultural College and [[Model farm|Model Farm]].  This institution (now Iowa State University) was officially established on March 22, 1858, by the General Assembly. [[Story County, Iowa|Story County]] was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, beating proposals from [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Kossuth County, Iowa|Kossuth]], [[Marshall County, Iowa|Marshall]] and [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk]] counties. The original farm of {{convert|648|acre|km2}} was purchased for a cost of $5,379.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1858–1874">[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1858.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1858-1874.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513215211/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1858.html |date=May 13, 2009 }}</ref>

Iowa was the first state in the nation to accept the provisions of the [[Morrill Act of 1862]].<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1858–1874"/><ref name=Pres>{{cite web |title= Sesquicentennial Message from President |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~isu150/president.shtml |publisher=Iowa State University |access-date=September 8, 2011}}</ref>  Iowa subsequently designated Iowa State as the [[land-grant college]] on March 29, 1864.<ref name=point/><ref name=Pres/> From the start, Iowa Agricultural College focused on the ideals that higher education should be accessible to all and that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects. These ideals are integral to the land-grant university.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1858–1874"/><ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/time.html History of Iowa State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607144835/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/time.html |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

The institution was coeducational from the first preparatory class admitted in 1868. The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and two women.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1858–1874"/>

The Farm House, the first building on the Iowa State campus, was completed in 1861 before the campus was occupied by students or classrooms.  It became the home of the superintendent of the Model Farm and in later years, the deans of Agriculture, including Seaman Knapp and "Tama Jim" Wilson. Iowa State's first president, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and penned his inaugural speech in a second floor bedroom.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1858–1874"/>

The college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university's prominent features.  Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer.  Courses in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], and [[mining engineering]] were also part of the curriculum.

In 1870, President Welch and I. P. Roberts, professor of agriculture,<ref>Isaac Phillips Roberts (1916) [https://archive.org/details/autobiographyoff00robe/page/152 Autobiography of a Farm Boy] via [[Internet Archive]]</ref> held three-day farmers' institutes at [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], [[Washington, Iowa|Washington]], and [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]].  These became the earliest institutes held off-campus by a land grant institution and were the forerunners of 20th century extension.

In 1872, the first courses were given in domestic economy (home economics, family and consumer sciences) and were taught by Mary B. Welch, the president's wife.  Iowa State became the first land grant university in the nation to offer training in domestic economy for college credit.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1858–1874"/>

In 1879, the School of Veterinary Science was organized, the first state veterinary college in the United States (although veterinary courses had been taught since the beginning of the college).  This was originally a two-year course leading to a diploma.  The veterinary course of study contained classes in zoology, botany, anatomy of domestic animals, veterinary obstetrics, and sanitary science.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1875-1899.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410221627/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html |date=April 10, 2009 }}</ref>

[[Image:Iowa state beardshear hall.jpg|thumb|Beardshear Hall]]
William M. Beardshear was appointed President of Iowa State in 1891. During his tenure, Iowa Agricultural College truly came of age.  Beardshear developed new agricultural programs and was instrumental in hiring premier faculty members such as Anson Marston, Louis B. Spinney, J.B. Weems, Perry G. Holden, and Maria Roberts.  He also expanded the university administration, and added Morrill Hall (1891), the Campanile (1899), Old Botany (now Carrie Chapman Catt Hall) (1892), and Margaret Hall (1895) to the campus, all of which stand today.  In his honor, Iowa State named its central administrative building (Central Building) after Beardshear in 1925.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1900–1924">[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1900.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1900-1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152738/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1900.html |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>  In 1898, reflecting the school's growth during his tenure, it was renamed Iowa State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts, or Iowa State for short.

Today, Beardshear Hall holds the offices of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, Registrar, Provost, and student financial aid.  Catt Hall is named after alumna and famed [[suffragette]] [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], and is the home of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

[[Image:isubeardshear2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beardshear Hall celebrating Sesquicentennial in 2008]]
In 1912 Iowa State had its first Homecoming celebration.  The idea was first proposed by Professor Samuel Beyer, the college's “patron saint of athletics,” who suggested that Iowa State inaugurate a celebration for alumni during the annual football game against rival University of Iowa. Iowa State's new president, Raymond A. Pearson, liked the idea and issued a special invitation to alumni two weeks prior to the event: “We need you, we must have you. Come and see what a school you have made in Iowa State College. Find a way.” In October 2012 Iowa State marked its 100th Homecoming with a "[[Cy the Cardinal|CYtennial]]" Celebration.<ref name="History of Iowa State Homecoming">{{cite web|url=http://www.isualum.org/index.cfm?nodeID=49029&audienceID=1|title=History of Iowa State Homecoming|publisher= Iowa State University Alumni Association Website}}</ref>

Iowa State celebrated its first [[VEISHEA]] on May 11–13, 1922. Wallace McKee (class of 1922) served as the first chairman of the Central Committee and Frank D. Paine (professor of electrical engineering) chose the name, based on the first letters of Iowa State's colleges: Veterinary Medicine, Engineering, Industrial Science, Home Economics, and Agriculture.  VEISHEA grew to become the largest student-run festival in the nation.<ref name="of Iowa State Time Line, 1900–1924"/>

The Statistical Laboratory was established in 1933, with [[George W. Snedecor]], professor of mathematics, as the first director.  It was and is the first research and consulting institute of its kind in the country.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1925.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1925-1949.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152803/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1925.html |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

While attempting to develop a faster method of computation, mathematics and physics professor [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] conceptualized the basic tenets of what would become the world's first electronic [[digital computer]], the [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer]] (ABC), during a drive to [[Illinois]] in 1937. These included the use of a binary system of arithmetic, the separation of computer and memory functions, and regenerative drum memory, among others. The 1939 prototype was constructed with graduate student [[Clifford Berry]] in the basement of the Physics Building.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.iastate.edu/jva/jva-archive.shtml|title=John Vincent Atanasoff and the Birth of Electronic Digital Computing|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>

=== Maturity as a university ===
[[Image:Catt Hall, previously known as Agriculture Hall, at Iowa State University.JPG|thumb|Catt Hall, named for [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]]]
On July 4, 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology.  However, the short-form name "Iowa State University" is used even in official documents such as diplomas.

Official names given to the university's divisions were the College of Agriculture, College of Engineering, College of Home Economics, College of Sciences and Humanities, and College of Veterinary Medicine.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1950.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1950-1974.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152747/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1950.html |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

Iowa State's eight colleges today offer more than 100 undergraduate majors and 200 fields of study leading to graduate and professional degrees.  The academic program at ISU includes a liberal arts education and some of the world's leading research in the biological and physical sciences.

Breakthroughs at Iowa State changing the world are in the areas of human, social, economic, and environmental sustainability;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vpresearch.iastate.edu/research-iowa-state/timeline/|title=Innovations Through The Years|work=www.vpresearch.iastate.edu|access-date=January 18, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> new materials and processes for biomedical as well as industrial applications; nutrition, health, and wellness for humans and animals; transportation and infrastructure; food safety and security; plant and animal sciences; information and decision sciences; and renewable energies.

Parks Library provides extensive research collections, services, and information literacy instruction/information for all students. Facilities consist of the main Parks Library, the [[e-Library]], the Veterinary Medical Library, two subject-oriented reading rooms (design and mathematics), and a remote library storage building.

The Library's extensive collections include electronic and print resources that support research and study for all undergraduate and graduate programs.  Nationally recognized collections support the basic and applied fields of biological and physical sciences. The Parks Library includes four public service desks: the Learning Connections Center, the Circulation Desk, the Media Center (including Maps, Media,
Microforms, and Course Reserve collections), and Special Collections. The Library's instruction program includes a required undergraduate information literacy course as well as a wide variety of subject-based seminars on the effective use of Library resources for undergraduate and graduate students.

The e-Library, accessed through the Internet, provides access to local and Web-based resources including [[electronic journal]]s and books, local collections, [[online index]]es, [[electronic course]] reserves and guides, and a broad range of subject research guides.

Surrounding the first floor lobby staircase in Parks Library are eight [[mural panel]]s designed by Iowa artist [[Grant Wood]]. As with ''Breaking the Prairie Sod'', Wood's other Iowa State University mural painted two years later, Wood borrowed his theme for ''When Tillage Begins Other Arts Follow'' from a speech on [[agriculture]] delivered by Daniel Webster in 1840 at the State House in [[Boston]]. Webster said, “When tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization.” Wood had planned to create seventeen mural panels for the library, but only the eleven devoted to
agriculture and the practical arts were completed. The final six, which would have hung in the main reading room (now the Periodical Room) and were to have depicted the fine arts, were never begun.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/libinfo/factsfigs.html It's a Fact: Iowa State University.

== Distinctions ==

=== Birthplace of first electronic digital computer ===
[[Image:Atanasoff-Berry Computer at Durhum Center.jpg|thumb|[[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] replica on 1st floor of Durham Center, Iowa State University.]]
Iowa State is the birthplace of the first electronic digital computer, starting the world's computer technology revolution.  Invented by mathematics and physics professor [[John Atanasoff]] and engineering graduate student [[Clifford Berry]] during 1937–42, the [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer]] pioneered important elements of modern computing.<ref name="auto"/>

On October 19, 1973, U.S. [[Federal Judge]] [[Earl R. Larson]] signed his decision following a lengthy court trial which declared the [[ENIAC]] patent of Mauchly and Eckert invalid and named Atanasoff the [[inventor]] of the electronic digital computer—the Atanasoff-Berry Computer or the ABC.<ref name="auto"/>

An ABC Team consisting of Ames Laboratory and Iowa State engineers, technicians, researchers and students unveiled a working replica of the Atanasoff-Berry Computer in 1997 which can be seen on display on campus in the Durham Computation Center.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1975.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1975-2008.

=== Birth of cooperative extension ===
The [[Cooperative extension service|Extension Service]] traces its roots to farmers' institutes developed at Iowa State in the late 19th century.  Committed to community, Iowa State pioneered the outreach mission of being a land-grant college through creation of the first Extension Service in 1902.  In 1906, the [[Iowa Legislature]] enacted the Agricultural Extension Act making funds available for demonstration projects.  It is believed this was the first specific legislation establishing state extension work, for which Iowa State assumed responsibility.  The national extension program was created in 1914 based heavily on the Iowa State model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/dubuque/info/history.htm|title=Extension Service: A Historical Perspective |access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/about/highlights/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095050/http://www.iastate.edu/about/highlights/ |archive-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/IaStater/1997/feb/landgrant.html |title=Land-grant universities born from radical idea |access-date=June 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527124225/http://www.iastate.edu/IaStater/1997/feb/landgrant.html |archive-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref>

=== VEISHEA celebration ===
{{main|VEISHEA}}
[[Image:VEISHEA2006.jpg|thumb|The [[VEISHEA]] 2006 Battle of the Bands]]
Iowa State is widely known for VEISHEA, an annual education and entertainment festival that was held on campus each spring. The name VEISHEA was derived from the initials of ISU's five original colleges, forming an acronym as the university existed when the festival was founded in 1922:
* '''V'''eterinary Medicine
* '''E'''ngineering
* '''I'''ndustrial '''S'''cience
* '''H'''ome '''E'''conomics
* '''A'''griculture

VEISHEA was the largest student run festival in the nation, bringing in tens of thousands of visitors to the campus each year.

The celebration featured an annual parade and many open-house demonstrations of the university facilities and departments. Campus organizations exhibited products, technologies, and held fund raisers for various charity groups. In addition, VEISHEA brought speakers, lecturers, and entertainers to Iowa State, and throughout its over eight decade history, it has hosted such distinguished guests as [[Bob Hope]], [[John Wayne]], Presidents [[Harry Truman]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Lyndon Johnson]], and performers [[Diana Ross]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Sonny and Cher]], [[The Who]], The [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Bobby V]], and [[The Black Eyed Peas]].<ref>[http://www.veishea.iastate.edu/2006/mediakit/history.pdf VEISHEA History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203004848/http://www.veishea.iastate.edu/2006/mediakit/history.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }} from the official 2006 media kit</ref>

The 2007 VEISHEA festivities marked the start of Iowa State's year-long [[sesquicentennial]] celebration.

On August 8, 2014, President Steven Leath announced that VEISHEA would no longer be an annual event at Iowa State and the name VEISHEA would be retired.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2014/08/07/veisheaend|title = Veishea ends at Iowa State; new traditions will begin with 'thoughtful approach'|access-date = August 30, 2014|website = Iowa State University News Service|publisher = Iowa State University}}</ref>

=== Ames Laboratory ===
[[Image:Ames Lab logo.jpg|thumb| ]]
{{main|Ames Laboratory}}
Iowa State is the only university in the United States that has a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] research laboratory physically located on its campus. Operated by Iowa State, the [[Ames Laboratory]] is one of ten national DOE Office of Science research laboratories.<ref>[http://www.ameslab.gov/about/points-of-pride.html “Points of Pride”, The Ames Laboratory website]</ref>

ISU research for the government provided Ames Laboratory its start in the 1940s with the development of a highly efficient process for producing high-purity uranium for atomic energy.  Today, Ames Laboratory continues its leading status in current materials research and focuses diverse fundamental and applied research strengths upon issues of national concern, cultivates research talent, and develops and transfers technologies to improve industrial competitiveness and enhance U.S. economic security.  Ames Laboratory employs more than 430 full- and part-time employees, including more than 250 scientists and engineers. Students make up more than 20 percent of the paid workforce.<ref>[http://www.ameslab.gov/about/ames-lab-at-a-glance.html “Ames Lab at a Glance”, The Ames Laboratory website]</ref>

=== ISU Research Park ===
The ISU Research Park is a 230-acre development with over 270,000 square feet of building space located just south of the Iowa State campus in Ames. Though closely connected with the university, the research park operates independently to help tenants reach their proprietary goals, linking technology creation, business formation, and development assistance with established technology firms and the marketplace.

The ISU Research Park Corporation was established in 1987 as a not-for-profit, independent, corporation operating under a board of directors appointed by Iowa State University and the ISU Foundation. The corporation manages both the Research Park and incubator programs.<ref>[https://www.isupark.org/about/.html The ISU Research Park website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194444/http://www.isupark.org/about/.html |date=March 6, 2016 }}</ref>

=== Other research institutes ===
Iowa State is involved in a number of other significant research and creative endeavors, multidisciplinary collaboration, technology transfer, and strategies addressing real-world problems.

In 2010, the '''Biorenewables Research Laboratory''' opened in a LEED-Gold certified building that complements and helps replace labs and offices across Iowa State and promotes interdisciplinary, systems-level research and collaboration. The Lab houses the Bioeconomy Institute, the Biobased Industry Center, and the [[National Science Foundation]] Engineering Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals, a partnership of six universities as well as the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Technical University of Denmark]].<ref>[http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/the-college/points-of-pride.html “Points of Pride”, Iowa State University College of Engineering website]</ref>

== Campus ==
{{Main|Campus of Iowa State University}}

=== Recognition ===
[[Image:ISU Central Campus ASLA plaque.jpg|thumb|The medallion located in Central Campus, immediately to the west of Curtiss Hall]]
Iowa State's campus contains over 160 buildings. Several buildings, as well as the Marston Water Tower, are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="buildings">[http://www.iastate.edu/about/fact04/ It's a Fact: Iowa State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223113940/http://www.iastate.edu/about/fact04/ |date=February 23, 2007 }}</ref> The central campus includes {{convert|490|acre|km2}} of trees, plants, and classically designed buildings.  The landscape's most dominant feature is the {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} central lawn, which was listed as a "medallion site" by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 1999, one of only three central campuses designated as such. The other two were [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/memorials/marker.asp?id=32-07 |title=Rock Plaque |publisher=Fpm.iastate.edu |date=September 20, 1999 |access-date=August 23, 2014}}</ref>

Thomas Gaines, in ''The Campus As a Work of Art'', proclaimed the Iowa State campus to be one of the twenty-five most beautiful campuses in the country.  Gaines noted Iowa State's park-like expanse of central campus, and the use of trees and shrubbery to draw together ISU's varied building architecture.  Over decades, campus buildings, including the Campanile, Beardshear Hall, and Curtiss Hall, circled and preserved the central lawn, creating a space where students study, relax, and socialize.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Campus as a Work of Art |last=Gaines |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas A. Gaines |year=1991 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |location=New York |page=155 }}</ref>

=== Campanile ===
{{main|Campanile (Iowa State University)}}
[[Image:Ames iowastate.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The campanile as seen from the north]]
The campanile was constructed during 1897-1898 as a [[memorial]] to Margaret MacDonald Stanton, Iowa State's first dean of women, who died on July 25, 1895. The tower is located on ISU's central campus, just north of the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]]. The site was selected by Margaret's husband, Edgar W. Stanton, with the help of then-university president William M. Beardshear. The campanile stands {{convert|110|ft|m}} tall on a 16 by 16 foot (5 by 5 m) base, and cost $6,510.20 to construct.<ref name="lib.iastate.edu">[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/campanile/camphist.html Iowa State University Library. "History of the Campanile"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607110636/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/campanile/camphist.html |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

The campanile is widely seen as one of the major symbols of Iowa State University. It is featured prominently on the university's official ring<ref>[http://www.isualum.org/en/traditions/official_isu_ring/ring_symbolism.cfm Iowa State University Alumni Association. "Ring Symbolism"]</ref> and the university's mace,<ref>[http://www.isualum.org/en/traditions/traditions_of_iowa_state/traditions_and_history/official_university_mace.cfm Iowa State University Alumni Association. "Official University Mace"]</ref> and is also the subject of the university's alma mater, ''The Bells of Iowa State''.<ref name="lib.iastate.edu"/>

=== Lake LaVerne ===
Named for Dr. LaVerne W. Noyes, who also donated the funds to see that Alumni Hall could be completed after sitting unfinished and unused from 1905 to 1907.  Dr. Noyes is an 1872 alumnus. Lake LaVerne is located west of the [[#Memorial Union|Memorial Union]] and south of Alumni Hall, [[#Carver Hall|Carver Hall]], and [[#Music Hall|Music Hall]].  The lake was a gift from Dr. Noyes in 1916.

Lake LaVerne is the home of two [[mute swan]]s named Sir Lancelot and Elaine, donated to Iowa State by VEISHEA 1935.<ref>[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm Swans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113121/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }} from the Iowa State Library's special exhibits section</ref>  In 1944, 1970, and 1971 [[Cygnet (bird)|cygnets]]  (baby swans) made their home on Lake LaVerne.  Previously Sir Lancelot and Elaine were [[trumpeter swan]]s but were too aggressive and in 1999 were replaced with two mute swans.

In early spring 2003, Lake LaVerne welcomed its newest and most current mute swan duo. In support of Iowa Department of Natural Resources efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.iastate.edu/oldreleases/2003/mar/swans.shtml|title=News Releases: Iowa State University|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>

=== Reiman Gardens ===
[[Image:RG Conservatory Inside.jpg|thumb|Tropical conservatory, [[Reiman Gardens]]]]
Iowa State has maintained a [[horticulture]] garden since 1914. [[Reiman Gardens]] is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from [[Roy Reiman|Bobbi and Roy Reiman]]. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial {{convert|5|acre|m2}} were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.

Reiman Gardens has since grown to become a {{convert|14|acre|m2}} site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly "wing", butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of [[Jack Trice Stadium]] on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa.

The Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its [[rose garden]]s are particularly noteworthy.  It was honored with the President's Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the [[United States]] each year for superior rose maintenance and display: “For contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173000/http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/ |archive-date=August 7, 2008 }}</ref>

=== University museums ===
The university museums consist of the Brunnier Art Museum, Farm House Museum, the Art on Campus Program, the Christian Petersen Art Museum, and the Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden. The Museums include a multitude of unique exhibits, each promoting the understanding and delight of the visual arts as well as attempt to incorporate a vast interaction between the arts, sciences, and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.iastate.edu|title=University Museums|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>

==== Brunnier Art Museum ====
The Brunnier Art Museum, Iowa's only accredited museum emphasizing a [[decorative arts]] collection, is one of the nation's few museums located within a performing arts and conference complex, the [[Iowa State Center]].<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/Brunnier.htm Iowa State University Museums Brunnier Art Museum online]</ref> Founded in 1975, the museum is named after its benefactors, Iowa State alumnus Henry J. Brunnier and his wife Ann. The decorative arts collection they donated, called the Brunnier Collection, is extensive, consisting of ceramics, glass, dolls, ivory, jade, and enameled metals.

Other fine and decorative art objects from the University Art Collection include prints, paintings, sculptures, textiles, carpets, wood objects, lacquered pieces, silver, and furniture. About eight to 12 annual changing exhibitions and permanent collection exhibitions provide educational opportunities for all ages, from learning the history of a quilt hand-stitched over 100 years ago to discovering how scientists analyze the physical properties of artists' materials, such as glass or stone.  Lectures, receptions, conferences, university classes, panel discussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks are presented to assist with further interpretation of objects.

==== Farm House Museum ====
[[Image:Farm House Museum south sign.jpg|thumb|The Farm House Museum]]
{{main|The Farm House (Knapp–Wilson House)}}
Located near the center of the Iowa State campus, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture as well as a [[National Historic Landmark]].  As the first building on campus, the Farm House was built in 1860 before campus was occupied by students or even classrooms. The college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. This early practice lead to Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm opening its doors to Iowa students for free in 1869 under the [[Morrill Act of 1862|Morrill Act]] (or Land-grant Act) of 1862.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/FarmHouse.htm Iowa State University Museums Farm House Museum online]</ref>

Many prominent figures have made the Farm House their home throughout its 150 years of use. The first president of the college, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and even wrote his inaugural speech in a bedroom on the second floor.  James “Tama Jim” Wilson resided for much of the 1890s with his family at the Farm House until he joined President [[William McKinley]]'s cabinet as [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]]. Agriculture Dean [[Charles Curtiss]] and his young family replaced Wilson and became the longest resident of Farm House.

In 1976, over 110 years after the initial construction, the Farm House became a museum after much time and effort was put into restoring the early beauty of the modest farm home.  Today, faculty, students, and community members can enjoy the museum while honoring its significance in shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university. Its collection boasts a large collection of 19th and early 20th century decorative arts, furnishings and material culture reflecting Iowa State and Iowa heritage.  Objects include furnishings from [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] and Charles Curtiss, a wide variety of quilts, a modest collection of textiles and apparel, and various china and glassware items.

As with many sites on the Iowa State University Campus, The Farm House Museum has a few old [[Iowa State Myths and Legends|myths and legends]] associated with it. There are rumors of a ghost changing silverware and dinnerware, unexplained rattling furniture, and curtains that have opened seemingly by themselves.

The Farm House Museum is a unique on-campus educational resource providing a changing environment of exhibitions among the historical permanent collection objects that are on display. A walk through the Farm House Museum immerses visitors in the [[Victorian era]] (1860–1910) as well as exhibits colorful Iowa and local Ames history.

==== Art on Campus Collection ====
Iowa State is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States.  Over 2,000 works of public art, including 600 by significant national and international artists, are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and offices.<ref>[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/AOC.htm Iowa State University Museums Art on Campus online]</ref>

The traditional public art program began during the Depression in the 1930s when Iowa State College's President Raymond Hughes envisioned that "the arts would enrich and provide substantial intellectual exploration into our college curricula." Hughes invited [[Grant Wood]] to create the Library's agricultural murals that speak to the founding of Iowa and Iowa State College and Model Farm. He also offered [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]] a one-semester sculptor residency to design and build the fountain and bas relief at the Dairy Industry Building. In 1955, 21 years later, Petersen retired having created 12 major sculptures for the campus and hundreds of small studio sculptures.

The Art on Campus Collection is a campus-wide resource of over 2000 public works of art. Programs, receptions, dedications, university classes, Wednesday Walks, and educational tours are presented on a regular basis to enhance visual literacy and aesthetic appreciation of this diverse collection.

==== Christian Petersen Art Museum ====
[[Image:Justin Smith Morrill - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Justin Smith Morrill]], namesake of Morrill Hall]]
The Christian Petersen Art Museum in [[Morrill Hall (Iowa State University)|Morrill Hall]] is named for the nation's first permanent campus artist-in-residence, [[Christian Petersen (sculptor)|Christian Petersen]], who sculpted and taught at Iowa State from 1934 through 1955, and is considered the founding artist of the Art on Campus Collection.

Named for [[Justin Smith Morrill]] who created the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], Morrill Hall was completed in 1891.  Originally constructed to fill the capacity of a library, museum, and chapel, its original uses are engraved in the exterior stonework on the east side.  The building was vacated in 1996 when it was determined unsafe and was also listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the same year.  In 2005, $9 million was raised to renovate the building and convert it into a museum.  Completed and reopened in March 2007, Morrill Hall is home to the Christian Petersen Art Museum.

As part of University Museums, the Christian Petersen Art Museum at Morrill Hall is the home of the Christian Petersen Art Collection, the Art on Campus Program, the University Museums's Visual Literacy and Learning Program, and Contemporary Changing Art Exhibitions Program.

==== Anderson Sculpture Garden ====
The Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located by the Christian Petersen Art Museum at historic Morrill Hall. The [[sculpture garden]] design incorporates sculptures, a gathering arena, and sidewalks and pathways. Planted with perennials, ground cover, shrubs, and flowering trees, the landscape design provides a distinctive setting for important works of 20th and 21st century sculpture, primarily American.  Ranging from forty-four inches to nearly nine feet high and from bronze to other metals, these works of art represent the richly diverse character of modern and contemporary sculpture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.iastate.edu/ASGMain.htm|title=Anderson Sculpture Garden Main|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>

The sculpture garden is adjacent to Iowa State's {{convert|22|acre|m2}} central campus. Adonijah Welch, ISU's first president, envisioned a picturesque campus with a winding road encircling the college's majestic buildings, vast lawns of green grass, many varieties of trees sprinkled throughout to provide shade, and shrubbery and flowers for fragrance. Today, the central lawn continues to be an iconic place for all Iowa Staters, and enjoys national acclaim as one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.  The new Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden further enhances the beauty of Iowa State.

=== Residence halls ===
[[File:Roberts Residence Hall Iowa State University.jpg|thumb|View looking east towards Roberts Hall]]

Iowa State operates 20 on-campus [[dormitory|residence halls]]. The residence halls are divided into geographical areas.

The [[Buildings of Iowa State University#Union Drive|Union Drive Association]]
(UDA) consists of four residence halls located on the west side of campus, including [[Buildings of Iowa State University#Friley Hall|Friley Hall]], which has been declared one of the largest residence halls in the country.<ref name="friley">[http://www.iowastatedaily.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=5e9b12e3-5c74-4628-b30d-9773a75eccc3 The seven wonders of Iowa State.

=== Student government ===
The governing body for ISU students is ISU Student Government. The ISU Student Government is composed of a president, vice president, finance director, cabinet appointed by the president, a clerk appointed by the vice president, senators representing each college and residence area at the university, a nine-member judicial branch and an election commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.iastate.edu/|title=Government of the Student Body - Iowa State University|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>

=== Student organizations ===
[[Image:Memorial Union east.jpg|thumb|Memorial Union]]
ISU has over 900 student organizations on campus that represent a variety of interests. Organizations are supported by Iowa State's Student Activities Center. Many student organization offices are housed in the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]].

The Memorial Union at Iowa State University opened in September 1928 and is currently home to a number of University departments and student organizations, a bowling alley, the University Book Store, and the Hotel Memorial Union.

The original building was designed by architect, William T. Proudfoot. The building employs a classical style of [[architecture]] reflecting [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influences. The building's design specifically complements the designs of the major buildings surrounding the University's Central Campus area, Beardshear Hall to the west, Curtiss Hall to the east, and MacKay Hall to the north.  The style utilizes columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals, Palladian windows, triangular [[pediments]], and formally balanced [[facades]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mu.iastate.edu/en/about_the_mu/architecture|title=Architecture|work=iastate.edu}}</ref>

Designed to be a living memorial for ISU students lost in [[World War I]], the building includes a solemn memorial hall, named the Gold Star Room, which honors the names of the dead World War I, [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korean]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[War on Terrorism]] veterans engraved in marble.  Symbolically, the hall was built directly over a library (the Browsing Library) and a small chapel, the symbol being that no country would ever send its young men to die in a war for a noble cause without a solid foundation on both education (the library) and religion (the chapel).

Renovations and additions have continued through the years to include: elevators, bowling lanes, a parking ramp, a book store, food court, and additional wings.

=== Music ===
The Choral Division of the Department of Music and Theater at Iowa State University consists of over 400 choristers in four main ensembles – the ''Iowa State Singers'', ''Cantamus,'' the ''Iowa Statesmen'', and ''Lyrica'' – and multiple small ensembles including three a cappella groups, ''Count Me In'' (female), ''Shy of a Dozen'' (male), and "Hymn and Her" (co-ed).

=== Greek community ===
ISU is home to an active [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]]. There are 50 chapters that involve 14.6 percent of undergraduate students. Collectively, [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and [[sorority]] members have raised over $82,000 for philanthropies and committed 31,416 hours to community service. In 2006, the ISU Greek community was named the best large Greek community in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Greek Community Membership Statistics |publisher=Iowa State University Office of Greek Affairs |url=http://www.greek.iastate.edu/resources/Greek-Community-Statistics-Fall07.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516095715/http://www.greek.iastate.edu/resources/Greek-Community-Statistics-Fall07.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |access-date=August 7, 2008 |date=November 1, 2007 }}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=August 2019}}

The ISU Greek Community has received multiple Jellison and Sutherland Awards from Association for Fraternal Leadership and Values, formerly the Mid-American Greek Council Association. These awards recognize the top Greek Communities in the Midwest.

The first fraternity, [[Delta Tau Delta]], was established at Iowa State in 1875, six years after the first graduating class entered Iowa State. The first sorority, I.C. Sorocis, was established only two years later, in 1877. I.C. Sorocis later became a chapter of the first national sorority at Iowa State, [[Pi Beta Phi]]. Anti-Greek rioting occurred in 1888. As reported in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', "The anti-secret society men of the college met in a mob last night about 11 o'clock in front of the society rooms in chemical and physical hall, determined to break up a joint meeting of three secret societies." In 1891, President William Beardshear banned students from joining secret college fraternities, resulting in the eventual closing of all formerly established fraternities. President Storms lifted the ban in 1904.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greek Community Origins from Fraternities & Sororities at Iowa State |publisher=Iowa State University Office of Greek Affairs |url=http://www.greek.iastate.edu/history/timeline.html |access-date=August 7, 2008 |year=1961 |author=Miller, W.J. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719035757/http://www.greek.iastate.edu/history/timeline.html |archive-date=July 19, 2008 }}</ref>

Following the lifting of the fraternity ban, the first thirteen national fraternities (IFC) installed on the Iowa State campus between 1904 and 1913 were, in order, [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Theta Xi]], [[Acacia Fraternity|Acacia]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], and [[Phi Delta Theta]].<ref>The Scroll of Phi Delta Theta, Vol. XXXVII, (1912-1913) p 542, edited by Davis, T.</ref> Though some have suspended their chapters at various times, eleven of the original thirteen fraternities were active in 2008. Many of these chapters existed on campus as local fraternities before being reorganized as national fraternities, prior to 1904.

In the Spring of 2014, it was announced that [[Alpha Phi]] sorority would be coming to Iowa state in the Fall of 2014, with [[Delta Gamma]] sorority Following in the near future.

=== School newspaper ===
{{main|Iowa State Daily}}
The ''Iowa State Daily'' is the university's student newspaper. The ''Daily'' has its roots from a news sheet titled the ''Clipper'', which was started in the spring of 1890 by a group of students at Iowa Agricultural College led by F.E. Davidson. The ''Clipper'' soon led to the creation of the ''Iowa Agricultural College Student'', and the beginnings of what would one day become the ''Iowa State Daily''.  It was awarded the 2016 Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greenlee.iastate.edu/news/2016/spring/iowa-state-daily-named-best-student-newspaper-country |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018194910/https://www.greenlee.iastate.edu/news/2016/spring/iowa-state-daily-named-best-student-newspaper-country |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 18, 2016 |title=Iowa State Daily Named Best Student Newspaper in the Country &#124; Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication |publisher=Greenlee.iastate.edu |access-date=January 18, 2017 }}</ref>

{{main|Iowa State Cyclones}}
[[File:Big 12 logo in Iowa State colors.svg|left|thumb|[[Big 12 Conference]] logo]]
The "Cyclones" name dates back to 1895. That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as [[tornado]]es were called at the time). In September, Iowa Agricultural College's football team traveled to [[Northwestern University]] and defeated that team by a score of 36–0. The next day, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s headline read "Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town."<ref name="isutimeline1875">{{cite web|url=http://www.iastate.edu/~isu150/history/timeline-1875.html|title=Iowa State University Time Line, 1875-1899 |work=iastate.edu}}</ref> The article began, "Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday." The nickname stuck.

The school colors are [[cardinal (color)|cardinal]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The mascot is [[Cy the Cardinal]], introduced in 1954. Since a cyclone was determined to be difficult to depict in costume, the cardinal was chosen in reference to the school colors. A contest was held to select a name for the mascot, with the name Cy being chosen as the winner.

The Iowa State Cyclones are a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] and compete in [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), fielding 16 varsity teams in 12 sports. The Cyclones also compete in and are a founding member of the [[Central States Collegiate Hockey League]] of the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]].

Iowa State's intrastate [[College rivalry|archrival]] is the [[University of Iowa]] with whom it competes annually for the [[Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series]] trophy, an annual athletic competition between the two schools. Sponsored by the Iowa Corn Growers Association, the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions between the two rival universities in all sports.

=== Football ===
{{main|Iowa State Cyclones football}}
[[Image:Jack trice stadium south endzone.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Trice Stadium]]]]
Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it was not until 1892 that Iowa State organized its first team to represent the school in football.  In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams.  The 1894 team finished with a 6–1 mark.<ref>{{cite news|title=History of Iowa State: Time Line, 1875-1899.

Since 1977, Iowa State and Iowa compete annually for the [[Cy-Hawk Trophy]].  Iowa State competes in an [[Iowa State–Kansas State football rivalry|annual rivalry game]] against [[Kansas State University|Kansas State]] known as Farmageddon and against former conference foe [[University of Missouri|Missouri]] for the [[Telephone Trophy]]. The Cyclones also compete against the [[Iowa–Iowa State football rivalry|Iowa Hawkeyes]], their in-state rival.

[[Image:MattCampbellISU2016.jpeg|left|thumb|150px|Head coach [[Matt Campbell (American football coach)|Matt Campbell]]]]
The Cyclones play their home games at [[Jack Trice Stadium]], named after [[Jack Trice]], ISU's first [[African-American]] athlete and also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition.  Trice died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] on October 6, 1923.  Suffering from a broken collarbone early in the game, he continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players.  It is disputed whether he was trampled purposely or if it was by accident. The stadium was named in his honor in 1997 and is the only NCAA Division I-A stadium named after an African-American.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iowa State Media Guide-Records. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com//pdf7/134422.pdf?SPSID=48396&SPID=4653&DB_OEM_ID=10700 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212145/http://www.cyclones.com//pdf7/134422.pdf?SPSID=48396&SPID=4653&DB_OEM_ID=10700 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 }}</ref> Jack Trice Stadium, formerly known as Cyclone Stadium, opened on September 20, 1975, with a win against the [[United States Air Force Academy]].

=== Men's basketball ===
{{main|Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball}}
[[Image:Hilton Coliseum Inside View.jpg|thumb|[[Hilton Coliseum]]]]
Hopes of "Hilton Magic" returning took a boost with the hiring of ISU alum, Ames native, and fan favorite [[Fred Hoiberg]] as coach of the men's basketball team in April 2010.  Hoiberg ("The Mayor") played three seasons under legendary coach [[Johnny Orr (basketball, born 1927)|Johnny Orr]] and one season under future [[Chicago Bulls]] coach [[Tim Floyd]] during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991–95).  Orr laid the foundation of success in men's basketball upon his arrival from [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic.  Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including [[Jeff Grayer]], [[Barry Stevens (basketball)|Barry Stevens]], and walk-on [[Jeff Hornacek]].  The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable.  Orr coached the team to second place in the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the second round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]].

Under coaches Floyd (1995–98) and [[Larry Eustachy]] (1998–2003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000–01, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated [[UCLA]] in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75–64 (the differential representing the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]' narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout [[Marcus Fizer]] and [[Jamaal Tinsley]] were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32–5.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25–6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed [[Hampton University|Hampton]] in the first round.

In 2011–12, Hoiberg's Cyclones finished third in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA Tournament, dethroning defending national champion [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], 77–64, in the second round before losing in the Round of 32 to top-seeded [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]].  All-Big 12 First Team selection [[Royce White]] led the Cyclones with 38 points and 22 rebounds in the two contests, ending the season at 23–11.

The 2013-14 campaign turned out to be another highly successful season.  Iowa State went 28–8, won the Big 12 Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by beating [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Cyclones finished 11–7 in Big 12 play, finishing in a tie for third in the league standings, and beat a school-record nine teams (9–3) that were ranked in the Associated Press top 25.  The Cyclones opened the season 14–0, breaking the school record for consecutive wins. [[Melvin Ejim]] was named the Big 12 Player of the Year and an All-American by five organizations.  Deandre Kane was named the Big 12 Tournament's most valuable player.

On June 8, 2015, Steve Prohm took over as head basketball coach replacing Hoiberg who left to take the head coaching position with the Chicago Bulls.  In his first season with the Cyclones, Prohm secured a #4 seed in the Midwest region where the Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to top-seeded [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], 84–71. In 2017, Iowa State stunned 3rd ranked [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], 92–89, in overtime, snapping KU's 54-game home winning streak, before winning the [[2017 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]], its third conference championship in four years, defeating [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] in the final.

Of Iowa State's 19 NCAA Tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen six times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000, 2014, 2016), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title="Iowa State Men's Basketball Media Guide" Iowa State University. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle,dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&ATCLID=1608347&KEY=&DB_OEM_ID=10700&DB_LANG=&IN_SUBSCRIBE.html }}</ref>

=== Women's basketball ===
{{main|Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball}}
Iowa State is known for having one of the most successful women's basketball programs in the nation.  Since the founding of the Big 12, Coach [[Bill Fennelly]] and the Cyclones have won three conference titles (one regular season, two tournament), and have advanced to the Sweet Sixteen five times (1999–2001, 2009, 2010) and the Elite Eight twice (1999, 2009) in the NCAA Tournament.  The team has one of the largest fan bases in the nation with attendance figures ranked third in the nation in 2009, 2010, and 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title= Iowa State Bill Fennelly Bio.

=== Volleyball ===
Coach Christy Johnson-Lynch led the 2012 Cyclones team to a fifth straight 20-win season and fifth NCAA regional semifinal appearance in six seasons, and leading Iowa State to a 22–8 (13–3 Big 12) overall record and second-place finish in the conference.  The Cyclones finished the season with seven wins over top-25 teams, including a victory over No. 1 [[Nebraska Cornhuskers women's volleyball|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in Iowa State's first-ever win over a top-ranked opponent in addition to providing the only Big 12 Conference loss to the 2012 conference and NCAA champion [[Texas Longhorns women's volleyball|Texas Longhorns]].

In 2011, Iowa State finished the season 25–6 (13–3 Big 12), placing second in the league, as well as a final national ranking of eighth. 2011 is only the second season in which an Iowa State volleyball team has ever recorded 25 wins.
