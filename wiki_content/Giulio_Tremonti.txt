'''Giulio Tremonti''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒuːljo treˈmonti}}) (born 18 August 1947) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician. He served in the government of Italy as Minister of Economy and Finance under Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] from 1994 to 1995, from 2001 to 2004, from 2005 to 2006, and from 2008 to 2011.

==Early life==
Tremonti was born in [[Sondrio]], Northern [[Lombardy]], in a family of [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Campania]]n ancestry (his father was from [[Lorenzago di Cadore]], in the [[Province of Belluno]], and his mother from [[Benevento]]). He is a full professor of law at the [[University of Pavia]], Italy, and has been a visiting professor at the Institute of Comparative Law, Oxford. His particular fields of interest are fiscal and tributary law, as well as fiscal policies.

==Political career==
Tremonti was the man who facilitated the dialogue between billionaire entrepreneur/politician [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Umberto Bossi]], leader of the federalist [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] and a friend of Tremonti's, leading to the formation of the center-right coalition [[House of Freedoms]]. Although a  member of Forza Italia, on many issues he is closer to the League. In particular, he is a staunch [[federalism|political]] and [[fiscal federalism|fiscal federalist]], supporting a federal reform of the Italian political system and more autonomy for Lombardy and Veneto, where he has his core supporters.

He first ran for the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] in 1987 with the [[Italian Socialist Party]].

===Minister of Finance===
Elected for the first time in 1994 for the [[Pact for Italy]], he switched his allegiance to center-right [[Forza Italia]] soon after the Parliament held session, and obtained the finances position in the first Berlusconi cabinet.

Tremonti again served as finance minister starting in 2001, when Berlusconi came back to power. He was compelled to resign on 3 July 2004, after internal disputes about the economic situation of the country within the House of Freedoms, particularly with conservative [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sylvers |first1=Eric |title=Berlusconi seeks new economy minister : Hole in Italy's cabinet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/05/business/worldbusiness/IHT-berlusconi-seeks-new-economy-minister-hole-in.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=14 June 2020 |date=5 July 2004}}</ref> In late 2005 he was then reappointed to the same position for the third time after his substitute [[Domenico Siniscalco]] resigned until the end of the Berlusconi III Cabinet. At the 2008 general elections, Berlusconi came back to power with a large majority in the parliament and assigned Tremonti the Economics and Finances position. At the end of 2011, following some rumours Tremonti would close to leave Pdl and to adhere to the [[Lega Nord|Northern League]]. On 5 September 2012 Tremonti announced that he was setting up his own political movement ahead of elections to be held by next spring, potentially syphoning support from Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party.

During his time in office, Tremonti made the first and biggest across the board [[Income tax]] cuts in Italy by introducing a No-Tax-Area (2003) and reducing the top marginal tax rate (2005). He also made a significant reduction in the [[Corporate tax]] rate (from 36% to 33% now down to 27.5%) and has abolished taxes on reinvested profits. He has also completely abolished all Donation taxes, Estate/[[Inheritance]] taxes (2001) and more importantly [[Property taxes]] on Housing/Real Estate (2008) at the national level (property continues to be taxed at the local level). Nevertheless, after these measures, the [[OECD]] stated in its latest (2007) report on Italy that "tax rates are high compared to other countries".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_33873108_33873516_38698716_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Economic Survey of Italy 2007|publisher=OECD|date=4 June 2007|access-date=10 July 2011}}</ref> He has been the promoter of the Global Legal Standards.

From 2008 until 2009, Tremonti was a member of the High Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems, co-chaired by [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Robert Zoellick]].<ref>[https://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2009/hltfh_report/en/ High Level Taskforce on International Innovative Financing for Health Systems: Report released] [[WHO]], press release of May 29, 2009.</ref>

==Other activities==
As an author, during his life, Tremonti has written mostly on taxation and international trade. He expressed how high taxes are a drag on growth and how fiscal federalism can create territorial taxation competition between regions that can reduce the burden on families and workers. He has also been a critic of China's dumping trade policy that causes delocalization of jobs from Europe to Asia.<ref>"Tremonti was always fairly suspicious of globalization, once remarking that Europe would end up in the pot of a Chinese cook if it wasn’t careful." Tony Barber, ''Financial Times'', 2008</ref> Nevertheless, he gave an important lecture at the [[Central Party School of the Communist Party of China]] in 2009.

He is currently a member of the [[Italy-USA Foundation]], chairman of the [[Aspen Institute|Aspen Institute Italia]] and a frequent guest columnist on the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]''.
As of September 2020, he is a member of the Italian [[Aspen Institute]].<ref>[https://www.aspeninstitute.it/istituto/comunita-aspen/comitato-esecutivo executive Committee], aspeninstitute.it/</ref>
