==Early life and education==

Hacker was born and raised in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. He graduated summa cum laude in 1994 from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[social studies]], and he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Yale]] in [[political science]] in 2000.<ref name=HackerYale/> His first book, ''The Road to Nowhere: The Genesis of President Clinton's Plan for Health Security'', was published in 1996, while he was a graduate student at Yale.

==Career==

Hacker is a media contributor and has testified before the [[United States Congress]]. He was widely recognized as a contributor to the health care plans for three of the leading Democratic candidates — [[Barack Obama]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[John Edwards]] — in the [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2008]].<ref>Julie Rosner and Melissa Block, [[NPR News]], February 22, 2008</ref> Hacker's plan, ''Health Care for America,'' is outlined in a report for the [[Economic Policy Institute]].  It proposes providing health care for uninsured or under-insured Americans by requiring employers to either provide insurance to their workers or enroll them in a new, publicly overseen insurance pool. People in this pool could choose either a public plan modeled after [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or from regulated private plans.

Hacker's work with the international think tank [[Policy Network]] has had a major influence on the policies of many European political parties<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22993321 |title=BBC News |accessdate=2013-07-22|publisher=The BBC}}</ref> and his concept of [[pre-distribution]] has become a cornerstone of the UK Labour Party's economic policy and his name has even been mentioned by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] in the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.policy-network.net/content.aspx?CategoryID=354&ArticleID=3491&fp=1 |title=Pre-distribution and the crisis in living standards |accessdate=2014-03-11 |publisher=Policy Network |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311152142/http://www.policy-network.net/content.aspx?CategoryID=354&ArticleID=3491&fp=1 |archive-date=2014-03-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Hacker was a fellow at [[New America (organization)|New America]] in 1999 and 2002. In 2007 he co-chaired the National Academy of Social Insurance's conference, "For the Common Good," and oversees a Social Science Research Council project on the "privatization of risk."

Hacker's 2010 book, the ''New York Times'' bestseller ''[[Winner-Take-All Politics (book)|Winner-Take-All Politics]]: How Washington Made the Richer Richer--and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class'' ([[Simon & Schuster]]), written with [[Paul Pierson]] of [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], argues that since the late 1970s the American middle and working classes have fallen further and further behind economically because policy changes in government favor the rich and super-rich.

Their 2016 book ''American Amnesia: How the War on Government Led Us to Forget What Made America Prosper'' argues for the restoration and reinvigoration of the United States [[mixed economy]].

In 2017, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2017/04/11/five-professors-elected-american-academy-arts-and-sciences|title=Five professors elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences|website=Yale News|access-date=2017-04-18}}</ref>

===The Economic Security Index (ESI)===
In July 2010 the [[Economic Security Index]] was launched. Developed by Hacker and a multi-disciplinary research team with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the ESI measures the share of Americans who experience at least a 25 percent decline in their income from one year to the next and who lack an adequate financial safety net to replace this lost income.

==Personal life==

Hacker is married to [[Oona A. Hathaway]], a Professor of Law at Yale University and former [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] clerk to [[Sandra Day O'Connor]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Divided Welfare State | last = Hacker | first = Jacob | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-521-01328-4 | page = xvi | url = https://archive.org/details/dividedwelfarest00jaco }}</ref>
