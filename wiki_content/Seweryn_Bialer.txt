Born in [[Berlin]], Germany, Bialer joined the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|underground anti-fascist movement]] in [[Łódź|Lodz, Poland]] in 1942. Between February 1944 and May 1945 he was a prisoner in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

From May 1945 to June 1951 he was member of the Polish communist police force (the ''[[Milicja Obywatelska]]''). He also held various positions in the Polish Communist Party ([[Polish United Workers&#039; Party|PZPR]]). He was a political officer of the State Police in Warsaw and a member of the [[Central Committee]] of the Polish Worker's Party.
