==Biography==
Kimura was born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], and grew up in the village of [[Neudorf, Saskatchewan|Neudorf]], [[Saskatchewan]].<ref name=":1" /> Kimura was finishing her final year of high school via correspondence while teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Northern Manitoba when she applied to and won an entrance scholarship to [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|date=2006|title=Recollections of an accidental contrarian.|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=80–89|doi=10.1037/cjep2006009|pmid=16615720|issn=1878-7290}}</ref> 

Kimura went on to earn bachelor's, master's, and doctoral (in 1961) degrees from McGill.<ref name=":1" /> Woodburn Heron supervised her master's thesis.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|date=2011|title=From ear to brain|journal=Brain and Cognition|language=en|volume=76|issue=2|pages=214–217|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2010.11.009|pmid=21236541}}</ref> She conducted her doctoral research at the Montreal Neurological Institute under the supervision of neuroscientist [[Brenda Milner]] (co-supervised by [[Donald O. Hebb]]).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":5" />

Kimura joined the faculty at the University of Western Ontario in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], in 1967, and remained there for the rest of her career.<ref name=":1" />  In 1974, she established the Neuropsychology Unit at London’s University Hospital (now [[London Health Sciences Centre]]).<ref name=":0" />

She had one daughter, named Charlotte Thistle Archer.<ref name=":1" /> Kimura died on February 27, 2013, at age 80, in Vancouver.<ref name=":1" />

== Work ==
Kimura's early work, starting in the 1960s, assessed differences in the language and music processing capabilities of the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]] of the brain.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|date=1961|title=Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=166–171|doi=10.1037/h0083219|issn=0008-4255}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|date=1964|title=Left-right differences in the perception of melodies|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=355–358|doi=10.1080/17470216408416391|issn=0033-555X}}</ref> She demonstrated that right-handed subjects have a right-ear superiority for the reception of words and numbers, and left-ear superiority for the perception of melodies; she concluded that these superiorities must reflect the processing specializations of the left and right hemispheres of the brain.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Kimura was among the first researchers to use [[Dichotic listening|dichotic listening tests]] in her work, a non-invasive method for studying the [[Lateralization of brain function|lateral asymmetry]] of auditory processing in the brain.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5" />

Kimura studied healthy individuals, as well as patients with [[Apraxia of speech|apraxia]] and [[aphasia]], to draw conclusions about the neurological underpinnings of communication.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=D.|date=1982-06-25|title=Left-Hemisphere Control of Oral and Brachial Movements and Their Relation to Communication|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=298|issue=1089|pages=135–149|doi=10.1098/rstb.1982.0077|pmid=6125966|issn=0962-8436|bibcode=1982RSPTB.298..135K|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|chapter=The Neural Basis of Language Qua Gesture**The research reported here was supported by grants to the author from the National Research Council and the Medical Research Council, Ottawa.|date=1976|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/studiesinneuroli0000unse/page/145|pages=[https://archive.org/details/studiesinneuroli0000unse/page/145 145–156]|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-746302-5.50011-6|isbn=978-0-12-746302-5|access-date=2019-12-05|title=Studies in Neurolinguistics}}</ref> Her 1993 monograph, ''Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor mechanisms in human communication|last=Kimura, Doreen.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-505492-X|location=New York|oclc=26396505}}</ref> summarized her research in this area over the prior two decades.<ref name=":0" />
