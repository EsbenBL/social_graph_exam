==History==
The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from the [[Shirley Foundation]] of over £10m, with public funding totalling over £5m from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].<ref name="history">{{cite web| title=The Origins of the Oxford Internet Institute: A brief history | first=Andrew | last=Graham | authorlink=Andrew Graham (academic) | url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/andrew_graham_origins_of_the_oii.pdf | publisher=[[Balliol College, Oxford]] | location=UK | format=PDF | accessdate=8 October 2021 }}</ref>

The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP and [[Andrew Graham (academic)|Andrew Graham]], then Master-Elect of Balliol.  Two Balliol Alumni, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, persuaded Dame Stephanie to meet Andrew Graham and it was following their meeting that she agreed to give the idea her support.<ref name="history" />

The Oxford Internet Institute is part of a small network of research centres that includes the centres like the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society]] and [[Information Society Project]] at the [[Yale Law School]]. But it is the only one that functions as a fully functioning, degree-granting department.{{fact|date=March 2021}}
