In 2018, he moved to [[Los Angeles]], to occupy his current post at [[UCLA]].

During his time as a professor of sociology at Notre Dame, he was an External Member of the [[Centre for the Critical Study of Global Power and Politics]] at [[Trent University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trentu.ca/globalpolitics/members.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517143350/http://www.trentu.ca/globalpolitics/members.php |archive-date=2018-05-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He has also served as a faculty fellow at Notre Dame's [[Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies]], the [[Nanovic Institute for European Studies]], and was also a faculty member of iCeNSA, the Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications at Notre Dame,<ref>{{cite news |last= McCrystal |first= Laura |date= Oct 9, 2009 |url=https://ndsmcobserver.com/2009/10/notre-dames-interdisciplinary-center-for-network-science-and-applications-icensa-established-last-year-is-looking-to-expand-and-reach-out-to-more-faculty-and-students-david-hachen-co-dire/ | title = Notre Dame's Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA), established last year, is looking to expand and reach out to more faculty and students}}</ref> now renamed the Center for Network & Data Science.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Center for Network & Data Science | url=https://cnds.nd.edu/}}</ref>

The volume features contributions from a wide range of social scientists whose work has been inspired by or seeks to extend the theories of the sociologist [[Randall Collins]]. Lizardo co-drafted the introduction to the volume with [[Elliot Weininger]] in which they summarized the intellectual development of [[Randall Collins]]'s work.<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429464157-1/introduction-elliot-weininger-omar-lizardo | chapter=Introduction| doi=10.4324/9780429464157-1| title=Ritual, Emotion, Violence| year=2018| last1=Weininger| first1=Elliot B.| last2=Lizardo| first2=Omar| pages=1–24| isbn=9780429464157}}</ref> In 2020 Lizardo was part of the multiauthor collective that resulted in the book [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/measuring-culture/9780231180290 Measuring Culture], with [[John W. Mohr]], [[Christopher A. Bail]], [[Margaret Frye]], [[Jennifer C. Lena]], [[Terence E. McDonnell]], [[Ann Mische]], [[Iddo Tavory]], and [[Frederick F. Wherry]].

== Awards and Recognitions ==

In 2005, as a graduate student at the [[University of Arizona]] he won two separate [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] section awards with co-author [[Jessica Collett]]. First, the best Graduate Student Paper Award from the section on the [[Sociology of Religion]] for their paper ''Why biology is not (religious) destiny: a second look at gender differences in religiosity''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/religion_past_recipients.cfm |title = The Section on Sociology of Religion Award Recipients|date = 2011-10-03}}</ref> (a revised version of the paper was later published in the [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] under a different title<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Collett| first1=Jessica|last2=Lizardo|first2=Omar|date=2009|title=A power‐control theory of gender and religiosity|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=48|issue=2|pages=213–231|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01441.x}}.</ref>). The second was the Best Graduate Student Paper Award from the section on the [[Sociology of Emotions]] for their paper ''Socioeconomic status and the experience of anger''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/emotions_recipients_History.cfm |title = Section on Emotions Past Award Recipients|date = 2011-03-08}}</ref> (a revised version of that paper was later published in the journal [[Social Forces]] under a slightly different title<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Collett| first1=Jessica|last2=Lizardo|first2=Omar|date=2010|title=Occupational status and the experience of anger|journal=Social Forces|volume=88|issue=5|pages=2079–2104|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0037| s2cid=143681404}}</ref>).

In 2008, he won the [[Clifford Geertz]] Prize for Best Article from the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]]'s section on the [[sociology of culture|Cultural Sociology]] for a paper entitled ''How cultural tastes shape social networks,''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/culture_recipients_History.cfm |title = Section on Culture Past Award Recipients|date = 2011-03-08}}</ref> previously published in [[American Sociological Review]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lizardo|first=Omar|date=2006|title=How cultural tastes shape personal networks|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=71|issue=5|pages=778–807|doi=10.1177/000312240607100504|s2cid=14492041}}.</ref> In this article, Lizardo confronts the "traditional network model" in which cultural taste formation and transmission is shaped and determined by social networks and instead asks "whether cultural tastes and practices themselves have an independent effect on social structure (conceived as patterns of network relations)." He concludes that "popular culture" is characterized by wide appeal and ease of incorporation and is therefore associated with more weak ties (i.e. used as bridges), while "highbrow culture" is more exclusive and serves to strengthen close ties (i.e. used as fences).

In 2013, Lizardo won the [[Lewis Coser]] Award for Theoretical Agenda Setting, which is "intended to recognize a mid-career sociologist whose work holds great promise for setting the agenda in the field of sociology.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asatheory.org/coser-award.html|title = Coser Award}}</ref> The next year Lizardo delivered the Lewis Coser Lecture at the 2014 meetings of the [[American Sociological Association]] in [[San Francisco]]. An abridged and edited version of the lecture was subsequently published as an online pamphlet by [[Alison Gerber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akgerber.com/OpenBook010.pdf|title=The End of Theorists: The Relevance, Opportunities, and Pitfalls of Theorizing in Sociology Today}}</ref>

In 2014, with co-author [[Robert Fishman]], Lizardo won the [[Charles Tilly]] Best Article Award of the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]]'s Section on [[Comparative sociology|Comparative]] and [[Historical Sociology]] for their paper ''How macro-historical change shapes cultural taste: Legacies of democratization in Spain and Portugal,''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/current-sections/comparative-and-historical-sociology/section-comparative-and-historical-sociology-past-award-recipients|title = Comparative and Historical Sociology Award Recipient History|date = 8 March 2011}}</ref> previously published in [[American Sociological Review]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fishman|first1=Robert|last2=Lizardo|first2=Omar|date=2013|title=How macro-historical change shapes cultural taste: legacies of democratization in Spain and Portugal|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=78|issue=2|pages=213–239|doi=10.1177/0003122413478816|s2cid=85464317}}</ref>

In 2015, along with co-author [[Jessica Collett]], Lizardo received an honorable mention for the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]]'s Section on [[Sociology of Emotions]] Recent Contribution Award for their paper ''Embarrassment and social organization: A multiple identities model,'' previously published in [[Social Forces]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lizardo|first1=Omar|last2=Collett|first2=Jessica|date=2013|title=Embarrassment and social organization: A multiple identities model|journal = Social Forces|volume=92|issue=1|pages=353–375|doi=10.1093/sf/sot078}}</ref>

In 2017, along with co-author [[Michael Strand]], Lizardo received an honorable mention for the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]]'s Section on [[Sociological Theory|Theory]] Prize for Outstanding Article for their paper ''Beyond world images: Belief as embodied action in the world,''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asatheory.org/theory-prize.html|title=Theory Prize}}</ref> previously published in [[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]].,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strand|first1=Michael|last2=Lizardo|first2=Omar|date=2015|title=Beyond world images: Belief as embodied action in the world|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=33|issue=1|pages=44–70|doi=10.1177/0735275115572397|s2cid=85508446}}</ref>
