'''Richard Theodore Ely''' (April 13, 1854 – October 4, 1943) was an American [[economist]], author, and leader of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]] who called for more [[government intervention]] in order to reform what they perceived as the injustices of [[capitalism]], especially regarding factory conditions, compulsory education, [[child labor]], and [[labor union]]s. 

Ely is best remembered as a founder and the first Secretary of the [[American Economic Association]], as a founder and secretary of the Christian Social Union, and as the author of a series of widely read books on the [[labour movement|organized labor movement]], [[socialism]], and other social questions.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Richard Theodore Ely was born on April 13, 1854, in [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the eldest of three children of Ezra Sterling and Harriet Gardner (Mason) Ely.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REJVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA385|title=The Sterling genealogy|first=Edward Boker|last=Sterling|date=15 February 2019|publisher=Grafton Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtk-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA200|title=The National Cyclopedia of American Biography ... V.1-|date=15 February 1899|publisher=J. T. White|via=Google Books}}</ref> Soon after Ely's birth, his father moved the family to a 90-acre farm near Fredonia, New York, where Ely would spend the next 16 years. The elder Ely was a self-taught engineer and lacked the skills and knowledge to farm successfully, relying too heavily on popular, sometimes erroneous, information he obtained from farm magazines.

Although harsh weather and fluctuating market prices provided further hardship to the family, Ely credited his early farm life with instilling in him many valuable qualities. From a young age he had numerous responsibilities in maintaining the farm, including carrying wood, churning butter, picking up rocks out of the fields, and milking the cows. His parents were [[Presbyterian]] but Ely transferred his affiliation to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] when in college.

===Education and career===
Ely attended [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], from which he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1876 and a [[master's degree]] in 1879. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[economics]] from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in that same year, where he had studied with [[Karl Knies]], who belonged to the [[historical school of economics]],<ref name="Gannon355">Francis X. Gannon, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume IV.'' Boston: Western Islands, 1973; pg. 355.</ref> and [[Johann Kaspar Bluntschli]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard T. |last=Ely |title=Ground Under Our Feet |url=https://archive.org/details/groundunderourfe00elyr |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1938 |page=[https://archive.org/details/groundunderourfe00elyr/page/43 43] }}</ref> He later received a [[Doctorate of Laws]] from [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]], receiving the degree in 1892.<ref name="Gannon355" />

Ely was a professor and head of the Department of [[political economy|Political Economy]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] from 1881 to 1892.<ref name="Gannon356">Gannon, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume IV,'' pg. 356.</ref>

In 1885, Ely was a founder of the [[American Economic Association]], serving until 1892 as the group's Secretary.<ref name="Gannon356" /> He later served a term as President of the organization, holding that position from 1899 to 1901.<ref name="Gannon356" /> The AEA Distinguished Lecture series was formerly known as the Richard T. Ely Lecture; it was renamed in 2020.<ref>AEA Distinguished Lecture Series.[https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/distinguished-lecture-series]</ref> Ely also founded [http://www.lai.org/ Lambda Alpha International] in 1930. Its purposes included the encouragement of the study of [[land economics]] in universities; the promotion of a closer affiliation between its members and the professional world of land economics; and the furtherance of the highest ideals of scholarship and honesty in business and the universities. Richard T. Ely is known as the "Father of Land Economics".

In April 1891, Ely was a founder and the first Secretary of the [[Christian Social Union (United States)|Christian Social Union]], a membership organization advocating the application of [[Christianity|Christian]] principles to the social problems of the world.<ref>Gannon, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume IV.'' Boston: Western Islands, 1973; pg. 359.</ref>

From 1892 until 1925, he was professor of Political Economy and director of the School of Economics, Political Science, and History at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. In 1894 an unsuccessful attempt was made by [[Oliver Elwin Wells]], [[Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin]] and ''ex officio'' member of the [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States|University's Board of Regents]] to expel Ely from his chair at Wisconsin for purportedly teaching [[Socialism|socialistic]] doctrines. This effort failed, with the [[Wisconsin]] state [[Board of Regents]] issuing a ringing proclamation in favor of [[academic freedom]], acknowledging the necessity for freely "[[sifting and winnowing]]" among competing claims of truth.<ref>[http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/WIReader/WER1035-Chpt1.html "Sifting and Winnowing,"] www.library.wisc.edu</ref>

In 1925, Ely moved to [[Northwestern University]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], where he accepted a position as professor of economics. He remained at Northwestern until his retirement in 1933.<ref name="Gannon356" />

===Political views===
Although regarded as a radical by his detractors on the political right,<ref>See, for example, the editorializing comments in his biography published by the [[John Birch Society]] in 1973: Francis X. Gannon, "Richard T. Ely" in ''Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume IV'', pg. 357 and passim.</ref> Ely was in fact opposed to socialism. "I condemn alike," he declared, "that individualism that would allow the state no room for industrial activity, and that socialism which would absorb in the state the functions of the individual."<ref>Quoted in Sidney Fine, "Richard T. Ely, Forerunner of Progressivism, 1880–1901", ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review,'' vol. 37, no. 4 (March 1951), pg. 611.</ref> He argued that socialism was not needed, and "the alternative of socialism is our complex socio-economic order, which is based, in the main, upon private property."   He warned that the proper "balance between private and public enterprise" is "menaced by socialism, on the one hand, and by [[plutocracy]], on the other."<ref>Ely, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0CsuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR3&dq=inauthor:richard+inauthor:Ely&lr=&num=30&as_brr=3#PPA97,M1 ''Studies in the Evolution of Industrial Society''], pp. 464, 468, 237.</ref>

Ely's critique of socialism made him a political target of the socialists themselves. In his 1910 book, ''Ten Blind Leaders of the Blind'', Arthur Morrow Lewis acknowledged that Ely was a "fair opponent" who had "done much to obtain a hearing for [socialism] <!--intentional single square brackets, substituting for "it"--> among the unreasonable", but charged he was merely one of those "bourgeois intellectuals" who were "not sufficiently intellectual to grasp the nature of our position."<ref>Arthur M. Lewis, ''Ten Blind Leaders of the Blind''. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr & Co., 1912; pp. 65, 78.</ref>

Ely was a product of the German historical school with an emphasis on evolution to new forms, and never accepted the [[marginalist revolution]] that was transforming economic theory in Britain and the U.S. He was strongly influenced by [[Herbert Spencer]] and strongly favored competition over [[monopoly]] or [[state ownership]], with regulation to "secure its benefits" and "mitigate its evils". What was needed was "to raise its moral and ethical level."<ref>Ely, ''Studies in the Evolution of Industrial Society'', p. 97.</ref> However, whereas Spencer believed that free competition was best served by deregulation and a smaller state, Ely believed that more regulation and a more interventionist state was the policy to follow. Also on [[social Darwinism]], Spencer believed that the state should not get involved in supporting one ethnic group over another — whereas Ely believed that the state should support white "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]" people against people of other races (in line with the opinions of his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, [[Edward Alsworth Ross]] and [[Charles R. Van Hise]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Ely favored [[Eugenics in the United States|eugenics]], arguing the "unfit" should be kept from reproducing.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |author=Alex Tabarrok |date=2016-12-08 |title=Richard T. Ely, Alt-Right Founder of the American Economic Association |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/12/richard-t-ely-alt-right-founder-american-economic-association.html |access-date=2020-06-04 |website=Marginal Revolution |language=en-US}}</ref> Ely argued that blacks were "for the most part grownup children, and should be treated as such."<ref name=":0" /> Ely was an advocate for [[redlining]] (which entails racial segregation and discrimination in real estate), and has been considered influential in the institutionalization of redlining practices in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Winling|first=LaDale C|last2=Michney|first2=Todd M|date=2021-06-01|title=The Roots of Redlining: Academic, Governmental, and Professional Networks in the Making of the New Deal Lending Regime|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jahist/jaab066|journal=Journal of American History|volume=108|issue=1|pages=42–69|doi=10.1093/jahist/jaab066|issn=0021-8723}}</ref>

Ely did support labor unions and opposed child labor, as did many leaders of the [[Progressive Movement]], and also some conservatives such as [[Mark Hanna]]. Ely was close to the [[Social Gospel]] movement, emphasizing that the Gospel of Christ applied to society as a whole, not merely to individuals; he worked hard to convince churches to advocate on behalf of workers. Ely strongly influenced his friend [[Walter Rauschenbusch]], a leading spokesman for the Social Gospel.

During [[World War I]], Ely worked to build popular support for the American war effort, taking part in the activities of the [[League to Enforce Peace]]. He headed the committee of arrangements for a "Win the War Convention" held in Madison from November 8–10, 1918.<ref>Ely to A.M. Simons in Milwaukee, November 12, 1918. Simons Papers, box 2, folder 2.</ref> Ely's political activities during World War I included his campaign against Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]]. Although La Follette was a Progressive in politics, he did not support the war, and so Ely regarded him as unfit for office. Ely tried to have him removed from the [[United States Senate]] and end his influence in  Wisconsin politics.

Ely edited Macmillan's ''Citizen's Library of Economics, Politics, and Sociology'' and its ''Social Science Textbook Series'' and Crowell's ''Library of Economics and Politics'', and was a frequent contributor to periodical literature, both scientific and popular.<ref>Gannon, ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume 4'', pg. 361.</ref>

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Ely House.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Richard T. Ely House in Madison, Wisconsin]]

Richard Ely died in [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[Connecticut]] on October 4, 1943.  A large portion of his library was purchased by [[Louisiana State University]] and is now a part of LSU's Special Collections division.

Ely is honored together with [[William Dwight Porter Bliss]] with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on October 8.

The American Economic Association instituted the annual "Richard T. Ely Lecture" in 1960 in his memory, which, unlike the Association's other honors is also open to non-American economists. It was renamed the AEA Distinguished Lecture series in 2020.<ref>AEA Distinguished Lecture Series.[https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/distinguished-lecture-series]</ref>

His former home, now known as the [[Richard T. Ely House]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=41102|title=Ely House Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref>

The television series [[Profiles in Courage (TV series)|''Profiles in Courage'']] did an episode in 1964 titled "Richard T. Ely" about the "sifting and winnowing" incident. Ely was played by [[Dan O'Herlihy]]; Wells by [[Edward Asner]]; and Ely's attorney, former Congressman [[Burr Jones]], by [[Leonard Nimoy]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0679745/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm ''Profiles in Courage'' (tv series): "Richard T.
