'''Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk'''{{efn|{{IPA-cs|ˈtɔmaːʐ ˈɡarik ˈmasarik|lang}}}} (7&nbsp;March 1850{{snd}}14&nbsp;September 1937) was a [[Czechoslovaks|Czechoslovak]] politician, statesman, sociologist, and philosopher. Until 1914, he advocated restructuring the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] into a [[federal state]]. With the help of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], Masaryk gained independence for a [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as World War I ended in 1918. He co-founded [[Czechoslovakia]] together with [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Edvard Beneš]] and served as its first [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]].

==Early life==
Masaryk was born to a poor, working-class family in the predominantly Catholic city of [[Hodonín]], [[Moravia]], in [[Moravian Slovakia]] (in the present-day [[Czech Republic]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]). The nearby [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village of [[Kopčany]], the home of his father Josef, also claims to be his birthplace.<ref>Michaláč, Jozef 2007 T.G. Masaryk a kopčianska legenda. Kde sa v skutočnosti narodil náš prvý prezident? Bratislava: Nestor.</ref> Masaryk grew up in the village of [[Čejkovice (Hodonín District)|Čejkovice]], in [[South Moravian Region|South Moravia]], before moving to [[Brno]] to study.<ref name=capek>Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. ''Talks with T.G. Masaryk'', tr. Michael Henry Heim. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 77.</ref>

His father, Jozef Masárik, was born in Kopcsány, Kingdom of Hungary (now Kopčany, Slovakia). Jozef Masárik was a carter and, later, the steward and coachman at the imperial estate in the nearby town Hodonín. Tomáš's mother, Teresie Masaryková (née Kropáčková), was a [[Moravians|Moravian]] of Slavic origin who received a German education. A cook at the estate, she met Masárik and they married on 15&nbsp;August 1849.

==Education==

Masaryk was appointed professor of philosophy at the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University, [[Charles University#Split into Czech and German universities|the Czech-language part]] of [[Charles University]], in 1882. He founded ''[[Athenaeum (Czech magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', a magazine devoted to Czech culture and science, the following year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lepka |first=Karel |date=2015 |title=Mathematics in T. G. Masaryk journal Athenaeum |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Danish school of education |pages=749–59 |isbn=978-87-7684-737-1}}</ref> ''Athenaeum'', edited by Jan Otto, was first published on 15 October 1883.

Masaryk challenged the validity of the epic poems ''Rukopisy královedvorský a zelenohorský'', supposedly dating to the early [[Middle Ages]] and presenting a false, nationalistic Czech [[chauvinism]] to which he was strongly opposed. He also contested the Jewish [[blood libel]] during the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair|Hilsner trial]].

==Early career==
Masaryk served in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]] from 1891 to 1893 with the [[Young Czech Party]] and from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped [[Hinko Hinković]] defend the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] during their 1909 Vienna [[political trial]]; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.

When the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the [[Russian Empire]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote a number of articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=Србија некада мамила као Америка|website=www.novosti.rs}}</ref> In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]), where the student society and senior common room are named after him. Masaryk became professor of Slavic Research at [[King's College London|King's College]] in London, lecturing on the problem of small nations. Supported by [[Norman Hapgood]] T. G. Masaryk wrote the first memorandum to president [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]], concerning to independence of Czechoslovak state, here in January 1917.<ref>Preclík, Vratislav.

During the WWI and afterwards, Masaryk supported the unification of [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sistek|first=Frantisek|title=Czech-Montenegrin Relations, In: Ladislav Hladký et al., Czech Relations with the Nations and Countries of Southeastern Europe, Zagreb: Srednja Evropa 2019|url=https://www.academia.edu/41731034|language=en}}</ref>

During the war, Masaryk's intelligence network of Czech revolutionaries provided critical intelligence to the allies. His European network worked with an American counterespionage network of nearly 80 members, headed by [[Emanuel Viktor Voska]] (including [[George Washington Williams (naval officer)|G. W. Williams]]). Voska and his network, who (as [[Habsburg]] subjects) were presumed to be German supporters, spied on German and Austrian diplomats. Among other achievements, the intelligence from these networks was critical in uncovering the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=237}}</ref><ref name=Masaryk50>{{Harvnb|Masaryk|1970|pp=50, 221, 242}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Voska|Irwin|1940|pp=98, 108, 120, 122–23}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|1971|p=233}}</ref> Masaryk began teaching at London University in October 1915. He published "Racial Problems in Hungary", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to [[France]] to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor [[Pavel Miliukov]] an origin{{clarify|reason=what is origin?|date=January 2020}} and a state of Czechoslovak legions in Russia in London in that time. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] he proceeded to Russia to help organize the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians.

On 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914, and was attached to the Russian Third Army.

From its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.

Under these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. In early 1916, it was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. After the Czechoslovak troops' performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]] (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (Československý sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion – Československá legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.

Masaryk formed a good connection with supreme commanders Russian army, [[Mikhail Alekseyev]], [[Aleksei Brusilov]], [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] and [[Mikhail Diterikhs]], in [[Mogilev]], from May 1917.

Masaryk traveled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. On 5&nbsp;May 1918, over 150,000 [[Chicago]]ans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city's reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist [[Charles R. Crane]], who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except of the president Wilson and the secretary of the state [[Robert Lansing]] this was [[Ray Stannard Baker]] , W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and the French ambassador [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]. And [[Bernard Baruch]], Vance McCormick, [[Edward N. Hurley]], Samuel M. Vauclain, [[Colonel House]] too. On Chicago meeting on 8 October 1918 Chicago industrialist [[Samuel Insull]] introduced him as the president of future Czechoslovak Republic de facto and mentioned his legions.<ref>PRECLÍK, Vratislav. Masaryk a legie (Masaryk and legions), váz. kniha, 219 str., vydalo nakladatelství Paris Karviná, Žižkova 2379 (734 01 Karvina, Czechia) ve spolupráci s Masarykovým demokratickým hnutím (Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague), 2019, {{ISBN|978-80-87173-47-3}}, pp. 87 - 89, 124 - 128,140 - 148,184 - 190</ref> On 18 October 1918 he submitted to president Thomas Woodrow Wilson "Washington Declaration" ([[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]]) created with the help of Masaryk American friends ([[Louis Brandeis]], Ira Bennett, [[Gutzon Borglum]], [[Franklin K. Lane]], Edward House, [[Herbert Adolphus Miller]], [[Charles W. Nichols]], [[Robert M. Calfee]], [[Frank E. J. Warrick]], [[George W. Stearn]] and Czech [[Jaroslav Císař]]) as the basic document for the foundation of a new independent Czechoslovak state. Speaking on 26 October 1918 as head of the [[Mid-European Union]] in Philadelphia, Masaryk called for the independence of Czechoslovaks and the other oppressed peoples of central Europe.

Masaryk believed that [[Jews controlled the press]] and helped the nascent state of [[Czechoslovakia]] during its struggle for independence. Czech historian [[Jan Láníček]] comments that "The great philosopher and humanist Masaryk was still using the same anti-Semitic trope found at the bottom of all anti-Jewish accusations."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Láníček |first1=Jan|author-link=Jan Lanicek |title=Czechs, Slovaks and the Jews, 1938–48: Beyond Idealisation and Condemnation |date=2013 |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-137-31747-6 |language=en|title-link=Czechs, Slovaks and the Jews, 1938–48: Beyond Idealisation and Condemnation |pages=4, 10|quote=Later on, Masaryk repeated the same story, only instead of using ‘partly managed’ he used the phrase ‘a great influence on newspapers in all the Allied countries'.

With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the Allies recognized Masaryk as head of the provisional Czechoslovak government. On 14 November of that year, he was [[1918 Czechoslovak presidential election|elected]] president of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. On 22 December, Masaryk publicly denounced the Germans in Czechoslovakia as settlers and colonists.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=140}}

Masaryk was re-elected three times: in May [[1920 Czechoslovak presidential election|1920]], [[1927 Czechoslovak presidential election|1927]], and [[1934 Czechoslovak presidential election|1934]]. Normally, a president was limited to two consecutive terms by the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]], but a one-time provision allowed the first president–Masaryk–to run for an unlimited number of terms.

On paper, Masaryk's presidential power was limited; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|prime minister]] and cabinet hold actual power. However, a complex system of [[proportional representation]] made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority; no party ever won more than 25 percent of the vote. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 percent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; there were ten cabinets, headed by nine statesmen, during Masaryk's tenure. His presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk's presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.

He used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the [[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]] (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk's watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe.

There were founded "The Masaryk Academy of Labour", for the scientific study of scientific management too, with the Masaryk's supporting in [[Prague]] in [[1918]] and Masaryk University in [[Brno]].<ref>PRECLÍK, Vratislav: K stému výročí vzniku Masarykovy akademie práce (One hundred years of the Masaryk Academy of Labour), in Strojař (The Machinist): Journal of MA, časopis Masarykovy akademie práce, leden – červen 2020, roč. XXIX. , dvojčíslo 1, 2. - Czechia - ISSN 1213-0591, registrace Ministerstva kultury ČR E13559, str. 2–20</ref>

Masaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Hoover]], he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the [[United States]]), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour.<ref>Proceedings from 1.PIMCO "Encyclopedy of Performance", 2500 pages (3 volumes "Man", "Production", "Business") Masaryk Academy of Labour, Prague 1924 - 1926</ref> After the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. He resigned from office on 14 December 1935 because of old age and poor health, and was succeeded by [[Edvard Beneš]].

[[File:Statue of Masaryk in Prague, Apr 2012.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Urban statue of Masaryk|[[Statue of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue]] of Masaryk in Prague]]
Masaryk died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in [[Lány (Kladno District)|Lány]], Czechoslovakia (present-day [[Czech Republic]]). He did not live to see the [[Munich Agreement]] or the Nazi occupation of his country, and was known as the Grand (Great) Old Man of Europe.

===Commemoration===
As the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk is revered as [[George Washington]] is in the [[United States]]. Czechs and Slovaks regard him as a symbol of democracy.

[[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]], founded in 1919 as Czechoslovakia's second university, was named after him when it was founded; after 30 years as Univerzita [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně|Jana Evangelisty Purkyně]] v Brně, it was renamed for Masaryk in 1990.

Commemorations of Masaryk have been held annually in the Lány cemetery on his birthday and day of death (7 March and 14 September) since 1989.

The Czechoslovak, then Czech [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], established in 1990, is an [[order (distinction)|honour]] awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.

He is commemorated by a number of statues, busts and plaques. Although most are in the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]], Masaryk has a [[Statue of Tomas Masaryk (Washington, D.C.)|statue]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and in the [[Midway Plaisance]] park in [[Chicago]] and is memorialized in [[San Francisco]]'s Golden Gate Park [[rose garden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/thomas-garriue-masaryk.html|title = Thomas Garriue Masaryk – Public Art and Architecture from Around the World}}</ref> A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is on the wall of a hotel in Rachiv, [[Ukraine]], where he reportedly resided from 1917 to 1918, and a bust was erected in 2002 on Druzhba Narodiv Square (Friendship of Nations Square) in [[Uzhhorod]], Ukraine.

[[Avenida Presidente Masaryk]] (President Masaryk Avenue) is a main thoroughfare in [[Mexico City]], and [[Masaryktown, Florida]], is named for him.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H6xaAAAAIBAJ&pg=5126%2C1819266 | title=Into center of state | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=Mar 23, 1952 | access-date=1 November 2015 | author=Blackstone, Lillian | page=19}}</ref>

In Israel, Masaryk is considered an important figure and a national friend. A village was named after him - [[Kfar Masaryk|Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk]] near Haifa, which was largely founded by Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia. One of the main squares in [[Tel Aviv]] is [[Masaryk Square]] (he had visited the city in 1927). In [[Haifa]], one of the junctions in the city was named after him as well. 
Many cities in Israel named streets after his name, including [[Jerusalem]], [[Petach Tikva]], [[Netanya]], [[Nahariya]] and others. A Masaryk forest was planted in the Western Galilee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kkl-jnf.org/about-kkl-jnf/green-israel-news/february-2019/kkl-czech-republic-michael-pakowski-birthday/|title=KKL Czech Presidents' Birthday}}</ref>

Streets in [[Zagreb]], [[Belgrade]], [[Dubrovnik]], [[Daruvar]], [[Varaždin]], [[Novi Sad]], [[Smederevo]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]] are named Masarykova ulica, and a main thoroughfare in [[Ljubljana]] is named after Masaryk. Streets named Thomas Masaryk can be found in Geneva <ref>Plan of the City Center, Genf 2000 (Thomas Masaryk Chemin)</ref> and [[Bucharest]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Asteroid [[1841 Masaryk]], discovered by [[Luboš Kohoutek]], is named after him.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=(1841) Masaryk |title= Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |page=147 |publisher= Springer |date=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-29925-7 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_1842 }}</ref>

===In popular culture===
A [[United Nations]] Expeditionary Force [[starship]] in [[Joe Haldeman]]'s 1974 science-fiction novel, ''[[The Forever War]]'', is named ''Masaryk.'' A photograph of Masaryk leaning out of a train window, waving to and shaking hands with supporters, is the front cover for [[Faith No More]]'s 1997 album ''[[Album of the Year (Faith No More album)|Album of the Year]]''. Its [[liner notes]] include the funeral of an old man, with the words ''"[[Truth prevails|pravda vítězí]]"'' ("Truth prevails") adorning the coffin. The statement is the [[national motto|motto]] of the Czech Republic.

==Philosophy==
Masaryk's motto was "Do not fear, and do not steal" ({{lang-cz|Nebát se a nekrást}}). A philosopher and an outspoken [[rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], he emphasised practical [[ethics]] reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy and—in particular—the work of 18th-century German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who is considered the founder of nationalism. Masaryk was critical of [[German idealism]] and [[Marxism]].<ref>Masaryk, T. G.: Otázka sociální, Praha 1896, German 1898
