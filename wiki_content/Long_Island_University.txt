'''Long Island University''' ('''LIU''') is a [[private university]] with two main campuses, [[LIU Post]] and [[LIU Brooklyn]], in the U.S. state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. It offers more than 500 academic programs at its main campuses, online, and at multiple non-residential. LIU has NCAA Division I athletics and hosts the annual [[George Polk Awards]] in journalism.

==History==
LIU was chartered in 1926 in [[Brooklyn]] by the [[New York State Education Department]] to provide “effective and moderately priced education” to people from “all walks of life.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/Brooklyn/About/History|title=Campus History - Long Island University|work=liu.edu}}</ref> [[LIU Brooklyn]] is located in Downtown Brooklyn, at the corner of Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues. The main building adjoins the 1920s movie house, [[Paramount Theatre (Brooklyn)|Paramount Theatre]] (now called the Schwartz Gymnasium), the building retains much of the original decorative detail and a fully operational [[Wurlitzer organ]] that rises from beneath the basketball court floorboards.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grella |first=George |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/10/local/a-relic-reborn |title=A Relic Reborn |publisher=The Brooklyn Rail |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> The campus consists of nine academic buildings; a recreation and athletic complex that includes Division I regulation athletic fields; one on-campus and two nearby residential buildings; and an adjoining parking facility. The campus is home to the university's oldest school, LIU Pharmacy (Arnold & Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences), founded in 1891 as the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/pharmacy |title=LIU Pharmacy |publisher=Liu.edu |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> and [[LIU Global]], a four-year bachelor's degree program that allows students to live and study internationally in eight countries across eight semesters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/global |title=LIU Global |publisher=Liu.edu |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> LIU Brooklyn is home to the NCAA Division I Blackbirds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liuathletics.com |title=LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds |publisher=Liuathletics.com |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> the [[George Polk Awards]] for excellence in journalism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/polk |title=LIU George Polk Awards |publisher=Liu.edu |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> and Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts.

In 1951, in response to the growing number of families moving to the [[suburb]]s, LIU purchased an {{convert|177|acre|adj=on}} estate known as '''Hillwood''' from cereal heiress [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]] and her third husband Joseph E. Davies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/10/26/archives/liu-takes-over-long-island-estate.html|title=L.I.U. TAKES OVER LONG ISLAND ESTATE|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=26 October 1951|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Located in the town of [[Brookville, New York|Brookville]] on Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], the original home, Warburton Hall, had been built by William A. Prime and was extensively renovated by Marjorie and her second husband [[Edward F. Hutton]]. Three years later, the campus was renamed C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Post, in honor of Marjorie Post's father. In 2012, the university renamed all campuses. C.W. Post is now [[LIU Post]], the university's largest campus, at 307 acres (125 hectares) of historic 1920s mansions, gardens, athletic fields, art studios and performing arts space, broadcast television and radio stations, an on-campus [[sustainable]] energy facility, and the only on-campus [[equestrian facility]] on Long Island. LIU Post was home to the [[NCAA Division II]] [[LIU Post Pioneers]] and is the site of the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. The school introduced its first online degree plan in 2004

On March 7, 2013, LIU named [[Kimberly R. Cline]] as its 10th president, becoming the first woman to lead the private, six-campus institution.<ref>{{cite web|title=LIU names first female chief executive, Kimberly Cline|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/liu-names-first-female-chief-executive-kimberly-cline-1.4770595|publisher=Newsday|access-date=7 March 2013}}</ref>
