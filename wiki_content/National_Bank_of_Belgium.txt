The '''National Bank of Belgium''' ('''NBB'''; {{lang-nl|Nationale Bank van België}}, {{lang-fr|Banque nationale de Belgique}}, {{lang-de|Belgische Nationalbank}}) has been the [[central bank]] of [[Belgium]] since 1850. The National Bank of Belgium was established with 100% private capital by a law of 5 May 1850 as a ''[[naamloze vennootschap]]'' (NV). It is a member of the [[European System of Central Banks]].

The Governor of the National Bank is a member of the Governing Council, the main decision-making body of the Eurosystem, particularly as regards monetary policy; the National Bank of Belgium participates in the preparation and execution of its decisions.

Apart from monetary policy, the National Bank of Belgium takes on other tasks which can be classified as follows:
*the issuing of euro banknotes
*the printing of euro banknotes and the placing in circulation of euro coins
*the management of foreign currency reserves 
*the collection, circulation and analysis of economic and financial information 
*the stability of the Belgian financial sector – see also [[Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (Belgium)|CBFA]]
*the role of financial ambassador to international economic institutions 
*services for the Belgian State 
*services for the Belgian financial sector 
*services for the general public

50% of the NBB stock is freely traded on [[Euronext Brussels]], the other 50% of the shares are owned by the Belgian government. (400.000 shares in total)
