'''Paul Craig Roberts''' (born April 3, 1939) is an American [[economist]] and author. He formerly held a sub-cabinet office in the [[United States federal government]] as well as teaching positions at several U.S. universities. He is a promoter of [[supply-side economics]] and an opponent of recent [[U.S. foreign policy]].

Roberts received a doctorate from the [[University of Virginia]] where he studied under [[G. Warren Nutter]]. He subsequently taught at [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of New Mexico]] before going to work as an analyst and adviser at the [[United States Congress]] where he was credited as the primary author of the original draft of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]]. He was the [[Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy|United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and – after leaving government – held the [[William E. Simon]] chair in economics at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] for ten years and served on several corporate boards. A former associate editor at ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', his articles have also appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Harper's]]'', and he is the author of more than a dozen books and a number of [[scholarly journal|peer-reviewed papers]].

In 1987 Roberts was invested into the [[Legion of Honour]] at the rank of ''chevalier'' (knight) by [[President of France]] [[François Mitterrand]]. He is also recipient of the United States Treasury's Meritorious Service Award and the International Journalism Award for Political Analysis from the [[Club de Periodistas de Mexico|Mexican Press Club]]. 

Since retiring, he has been accused of antisemitism and conspiracy theorizing by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[Southern Poverty Law Centre]] and others.

Upon his return to the United States, Roberts enrolled in graduate courses at the [[University of California Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]], before earning a [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of Virginia]] where he studied as a [[Jefferson Scholars Foundation|Thomas Jefferson Scholar]].<ref name="nyt1"/><ref name="ac1961"/> His dissertation, prepared under the supervision of G.

==Career==

===Early career===
Roberts began his career with teaching assignments at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], the [[University of New Mexico]], [[Stanford University]], and [[Tulane University]].<ref name="nyt1"/> He was a professor of business administration and professor of economics at George Mason University and was the inaugural William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy at Georgetown University, serving for 12 years.
While a [[visiting professor]] at [[Georgetown University]], he was hired as economics counsel to [[United States Congressman]] [[Jack Kemp]], later also serving as economics counsel to [[United States Senator]] [[Orrin Hatch]], as staff associate with the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and as chief economist with the minority staff of the [[United States House of Representatives]] [[United States House Committee on the Budget|Committee on the Budget]].<ref name="nyt1"/><ref name="rr1"/> He has been credited as the primary author of the original draft of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Ronald Reagan, 1981 |date=1982 |isbn=978-1623769321 |page=64|last1=Reagan |first1=Ronald }}</ref>

During this time he also contributed columns to ''[[Harper's]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' and served as associate editor of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s opinion page.<ref name="nyt1"/><ref name="rr1"/><ref>{{cite news |title=UD to Feature Economist |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/61142512 |access-date=January 1, 2013 |work=Irving Daily News |date=April 8, 1979 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115024523/http://www.newspapers.com/image/61142512/ |archive-date=January 15, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref>

===Later career===
In December 1980, along with [[Alan Greenspan]] and [[Herbert Stein]], Roberts was one of the three speakers at the two-day National Forum on Jobs, Money and People at the [[Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club]] in [[Palm Harbor, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-officials to Talk at Innisbrook |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/319356439 |access-date=January 21, 2019 |work=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=December 2, 1980 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123010219/http://www.newspapers.com/image/319356439/ |archive-date=January 23, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> Two months later, in 1981, he was appointed by President of the United States [[Ronald Reagan]] as [[Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy]].<ref name="rr1"/> As Assistant Treasury Secretary he was a driver behind the economic policy of the first term of the Reagan administration and was lauded as the "economic conscience of Ronald Reagan".<ref name="lgon"/> Nonetheless, his singular zealousness for supply-side economics provoked ire in some quarters within the government, with [[Larry Kudlow]] – then an official in the [[Office of Management and Budget]] – saying that "Craig saw himself as the keeper of the Reagan flame. Only Craig knew what was right. No one else knew what was right".<ref name="nyt1"/> Roberts' concern about [[U.S. budget deficit]]s led him into conflict with other Reagan-era officials such as [[Martin Feldstein]] and [[David Stockman]].<ref name="nyt1"/>

Roberts resigned in February 1982 to return to academia.<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news |last1=Kilborn |first1=Peter |title=Gadfly Who Bites President on Supply Side |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/06/us/gadfly-who-bites-president-on-supply-side.html |access-date=September 27, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 6, 1984 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714193654/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/06/us/gadfly-who-bites-president-on-supply-side.html |archive-date=July 14, 2018 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rowan |first1=Hobart |title=Even Administration is Looking for Alternatives to Reaganomics |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/131749984/ |access-date=January 13, 2019 |work=[[Des Moines Register]] |date=July 8, 1982 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114210216/https://www.newspapers.com/image/131749984/ |archive-date=January 14, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> He was a senior research fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], from 1983 to 1993 was the William E.

==Work==

===Views===
====Economic policy====
Roberts' commitment to supply-side economics has been a dominant feature of his career.<ref name="silver"/> Writing in 1984, [[Thomas B. Silver]] said that adherents of supply-side economics had "no more formidable advocate in their ranks" than Roberts.<ref name="silver"/> However, Roberts has expressed skepticism at the ability of government to lower taxes and decrease regulation, positing that the personal political ambition of officeholders tends to promote meddling in the economy, a criticism he has directed even at the former Reagan administration of which he was a part.<ref name="silver">{{cite news |last1=Silver |first1=Thomas |title=Counterrevolution |url=http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/counterrevolution/ |access-date=January 18, 2019 |work=[[Claremont Review of Books]] |date=Fall 1984 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121309/http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/counterrevolution/ |archive-date=January 19, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref>

Ron Hira of the [[Economic Policy Institute]] has described Roberts as one of the first prominent economists to "break from the orthodoxy" by opposing [[offshoring]]; Roberts believes that the practice is "lethal for America's future".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hira |first1=Ron |title=Outsourcing America: What's Behind Our National Crisis and how We Can Reclaim American Jobs |date=2005 |publisher=American Management Association |isbn=978-0814408681 |page=[https://archive.org/details/outsourcingameri00hira/page/38 38] |url=https://archive.org/details/outsourcingameri00hira/page/38 }}</ref> According to him, "a country that doesn't make anything doesn’t need a financial sector as there is nothing to finance".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cockburn |first1=Alexander |title=Nail That Double Standard to the Mast! |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/nail-double-standard-mast/ |access-date=January 18, 2019 |work=[[The Nation]] |date=December 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119120851/https://www.thenation.com/article/nail-double-standard-mast/ |archive-date=January 19, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> In 2004, Paul Blustein in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described him as heretical in relation to mainstream US economics for challenging the positive impact of [[free trade]].<ref name="Washington Post 2004">{{cite news | title=Economist's Challenge Puzzles Free-Trade Believers | newspaper=Washington Post | date=2004-02-26 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2004/02/26/economists-challenge-puzzles-free-trade-believers/c3201860-aaac-4f20-8fa7-63c8aa846c51/ | access-date=2021-07-14}}</ref>

====Society and culture====
According to Roberts, "the West in general suffers from an excess of skepticism about its own values and accomplishments. We're being gobbled up by nihilism, itself the product of unbridled skepticism. It's hard to anchor on to the verities anymore".<ref name="nyt1"/> He has expressed his opposition to [[Affirmative Action]] policies and dismissed the existence of [[white privilege|white male privilege]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Paul Craig |title=Second-class citizens |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/402946811 |access-date=January 18, 2019 |work=[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]] |date=24 March 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119174403/http://www.newspapers.com/image/402946811/ |archive-date=19 January 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> In an opinion column for [[Scripps Howard News Service]] in 1997, Roberts opposed gender integration aboard [[U.S. Navy]] vessels, opining that gender integration would destroy the "ethos of comradeship" which, in his view, motivated wartime sacrifice more than "abstract concepts such as honor and country".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Paul Craig |title=Women in the Ranks Will Destroy the Military |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/351905628 |access-date=January 18, 2019 |work=[[The Missoulian]] |agency=[[Scripps Howard News Service]] |publisher=[[newspapers.com]] |date=February 13, 1997 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119174346/http://www.newspapers.com/image/351905628/ |archive-date=January 19, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref>

====Drug policy====
Writing in 1995, Roberts expressed skepticism at the [[war on drugs]], saying that it "perfectly illustrates the maxim 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions'."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Paul Craig |title=End the Drug Prohibition |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/462170684 |access-date=January 18, 2019 |work=[[San Francisco Examiner]] |date=January 20, 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120043109/http://www.newspapers.com/image/462170684/ |archive-date=January 20, 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> In ''The Tyranny of Good Intentions'' (2000), Roberts and co-author Lawrence Stratton argued that the opposition of some [[American conservatives]] to [[drug-policy reform]] was an example of "the right's myopia".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leverenz |first1=Nikos A. |title=The Tyranny of Good Intentions (Review) |journal=[[The Independent Review]] |date=Fall 2001 |volume=6 |issue=2 |url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=167 |access-date=2019-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119174743/http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=167 |archive-date=2019-01-19 |url-status = live}}</ref>

====Foreign policy====
He is a strong opponent of [[neoconservatism]], saying:
<blockquote>the neocons are the worst thing that ever happened to the United States. (They’re) really the scum of the earth… They should all be picked up and shipped out of the country. They all belong in Israel. That’s where they should be. Pick ’em up, ship ’em to Israel, revoke their passports.<ref name="Holland"/></blockquote>
Roberts has stated his opposition to United States involvement in the post-2001  [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref name="froomkin"/> According to Roberts, "the Bush regime’s response to 9/11 and the Obama regime’s validation of this response have destroyed accountable, democratic government in the United States".<ref name="ijc"/> He believes the US is a puppet government of Israel.<ref name="Holland"/>

He supports Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], blames the [[2013 Ukraine crisis]] and the [[Syria civil war]] on a neocon plot, and argues that human rights NGOs working in Russia are part of a “US fifth column” working to undermine its government.<ref name="Holland"/>

====Charges of conspiracy theorizing and antisemitism====
Writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', Darrell Delamaide has described Roberts as a "[[conspiracy theorist]]",<ref name="Delamaide"/> a charge echoed by Luke Brinker of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', and [[Michael C.

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] describes Roberts as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]]:
<blockquote>Paul Craig Roberts [is] an anti-Semitic syndicated columnist... Since 2007, Roberts’ columns have increasingly focused on criticism of Israel and Jews and often conjure up anti-Semitic canards, making them popular with fringe publications on both the left and the right. Like many other contemporary anti-Semites, Roberts frames his anti-Semitism as criticism of Israel and the country’s supporters. His published views, however, go far beyond any criticism of Israel’s policies, regularly charging Israeli or Jewish control of the U.S. government and media and comparing Israel to the Nazi regime.<ref name="Anti-Defamation League 2014">{{cite web | title=Ron Unz: Controversial Writer and Funder of Anti-israel Activists | website=Anti-Defamation League | date=2014-01-20 | url=https://www.adl.org/news/article/ron-unz-controversial-writer-and-funder-of-anti-israel-activists | access-date=2021-07-14}}</ref></blockquote>

====Views on World War II and the Holocaust ====
In 2019, Roberts wrote in support of the views of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]], asserting that "Irving, without any doubt the best historian of the European part of World War II, learned at his great expense that challenging myths does not go unpunished... I will avoid the story of how this came to be, but, yes, you guessed it, it was the Zionists".<ref name="The Lies About World War II">[https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2019/05/15/the-lies-about-world-war-ii The Lies About World War II] By Paul Craig Roberts | May 15, 2019, Foreign Policy Journal</ref> Roberts added that "No German plans, or orders from Hitler, or from Himmler or anyone else have ever been found for an organized holocaust by gas and cremation of Jews... The "death camps" were in fact work camps. Auschwitz, for example, today a Holocaust museum, was the site of Germany's essential artificial rubber factory. Germany was desperate for a work force."<ref name="The Lies About World War II"/>
