"Beyond the Fence", ''The New York Times'' (May 6 op-ed)., </ref><ref>Brown, Susan K and Frank D. Bean (2006) [https://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?id=442 Assimilation Models, Old and New:  Explaining a Long-Term Process], from the [[Migration Policy Institute]]</ref>

Alba grew up in [[New York City]], where he attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]], followed by undergraduate and graduate training at [[Columbia University]], where he earned his B.A. in 1963 and Ph.D. in 1974.
