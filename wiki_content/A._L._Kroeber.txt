'''Alfred Louis Kroeber''' (June 11, 1876 – October 5, 1960) was an American [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]]. He received his PhD under [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1901, the first doctorate in [[anthropology]] awarded by Columbia. He was also the first professor appointed to the Department of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="ucb-anthro-history">{{cite web | url=http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/content/history | title=History, Anthropology Department, UC Berkeley | publisher=University of California, Berkeley | access-date=7 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009153302/http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/content/history | archive-date=2014-10-09 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He played an integral role in the early days of its [[Phoebe A.

He was the father of the acclaimed novelist, poet, and writer of short stories [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].

==Life==
Kroeber was born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], to parents of German Protestant origin. His mother Johanna Muller was an American of German descent; his father Florence Kroeber came to the United States from Germany at the age of ten, with his parents and family, and became an importer of French clocks. The family belonged to a German-American milieu that was upper middle-class, classical and rationalistic, schooled in the German intellectual tradition, and of mixed Jewish and Protestant ancestry.<ref>Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/1960/10/06/archives/drkroeberdies-anthropologist-authority-on-indians-taught-at.html "Dr. Kroeber Dies; Anthropologist; Authority on Indians Taught at California 45 Years—Wrote Standard Text"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 6, 1960. Accessed February 6, 2013. "A native of Hoboken, N. J., Dr. Kroeber was graduated from Columbia in 1896."</ref><ref>J.H. Steward, "Alfred Louis Kroeber, 1876-1960", American Anthropologist 63 (1961), p. 1038-1087.</ref>

Alfred's family moved into New York City when Alfred was quite young, and he was tutored and attended private schools there.  He had three younger siblings and all had scholarly interests. The family was bilingual, speaking German at home, and Kroeber also began to study [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] in school, beginning a lifelong interest in languages.<ref name="Steward" /> He attended [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] at the age of 16, joining the [[Philolexian Society]] and earning an BA in English in 1896 and an MA in Romantic drama in 1897. Changing fields to the new one of [[anthropology]], he received his PhD under [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1901, basing his 28-page dissertation on decorative symbolism on his field work among the [[Arapaho]]. It was the first doctorate in anthropology awarded by Columbia.

Kroeber spent most of his career in California, primarily at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  He was both a Professor of Anthropology and the Director of what was then the University of California Museum of Anthropology (now the [[Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology]]). The anthropology department's headquarters building at the University of California was named Kroeber Hall in his honor, before being un-named January 26, 2021 in order to "help Berkeley recognize a challenging part of our history, while better supporting the diversity of today’s academic community."<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Kell|first1=Gretchen|date=2021-01-26|title=Kroeber Hall, honoring anthropologist who symbolizes exclusion, is unnamed|url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/01/26/kroeber-hall-unnamed/|access-date=2021-01-27|website=Berkeley News|language=en-US}}</ref> He was associated with Berkeley until his retirement in 1946.

==Personal life==
Kroeber married Henriette Rothschild in 1906.  She contracted [[tuberculosis]] (TB) and died in 1913, after several years of illness.<ref name="Steward" />

In 1926 he married again, to [[Theodora Kroeber|Theodora Kracaw Brown]], a widow whom he met as a student in one of his graduate seminars.<ref name="Steward" /> They had two children: [[Karl Kroeber]], a literary critic, and the science fiction writer [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Kroeber Le Guin]]. In addition, Alfred adopted Theodora's sons by her first marriage, Ted and [[Clifton Kroeber|Clifton Brown]], who both took his surname.

In 2003, Clifton and Karl Kroeber published a book of essays on [[Ishi]]'s story, which they co-edited, called, ''Ishi in Three Centuries''.<ref>Clifton and Karl Kroeber (2002) ''Ishi in Three Centuries'', Univ. of Nebraska Press {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2250-2}}</ref> This is the first scholarly book on Ishi to contain essays by Native American writers and academics.

==Death==
Alfred Kroeber died in [[Paris]] on October 5, 1960.

==Influence==
Although he is known primarily as a [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]], he did significant work in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropological linguistics]], and he contributed to anthropology by making connections between archaeology and culture. He conducted excavations in [[New Mexico]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]]. In Peru he helped found the [[Institute for Andean Studies]] (IAS) with the Peruvian anthropologist [[Julio C. Tello]] and other major scholars.

Kroeber and his students did important work collecting cultural data on western tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The work done in preserving information about California tribes appeared in ''Handbook of the Indians of California'' (1925). In that book, Kroeber first described a pattern in California groups where a social unit was smaller and less hierarchically organized than a [[tribe]],<ref name="kroeber1976handbook">{{cite book | last = Kroeber | first = A | title = Handbook of the Indians of California | pages = [https://archive.org/details/handbookofindian00kroe/page/160 160–163, 228–230, 234–235] | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-486-23368-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/handbookofindian00kroe/page/160 }}</ref><ref name="golla2011">{{cite book | last = Golla | first = Victor | title = California Indian languages | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-520-26667-4 }}</ref> which was elaborated upon in ''The Patwin and their Neighbors''<ref name="kroeberpatwin">{{Cite book | publisher = bUniversity of California Press | last = Kroeber | first = A.L. | title = The Patwin and their neighbors | year = 1932
| url = http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/anthpubs/ucb/text/ucp029-005.pdf }}</ref> in which Kroeber first coined the term "tribelet" to describe this level of organization. Kroeber is credited with developing the concepts of [[culture area]], cultural configuration (''Cultural and Natural Areas of Native North America'', 1939), and cultural fatigue (''Anthropology'', 1963).

Kroeber influenced many of his contemporaries in his views as a cultural historian. During his lifetime, he was known as the "Dean of American Anthropologists".  Kroeber and [[Roland Burrage Dixon|Roland B. Dixon]] were very influential in the genetic classification of [[Native American languages]] in North America, being responsible for theoretical groupings such as [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] and [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], based on common languages.

He is noted for working with [[Ishi]], who was claimed to be the last California [[Yahi]] Indian. (Ishi may have been of mixed ethnic heritage, with a father from the Wintu, Maidu or Nomlaki tribes.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arf.berkeley.edu/archaeology-news/arf-newsletter-1996-v3-2 |title=ARF Newsletter 1996 v3-2 &#124; Archaeological Research Facility |publisher=Arf.berkeley.edu |access-date=2013-08-29}}</ref> His second wife, [[Theodora Kroeber|Theodora Kracaw Kroeber]], wrote a well-known biography of Ishi, ''[[Ishi in Two Worlds]]''. Kroeber's relationship with Ishi was the subject of a film, ''[[The Last of His Tribe]]'' (1992), starring [[Jon Voight]] as Kroeber and [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] as Ishi.<ref name="LAT">{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-20/news/vw-4294_1_american-indian-college-fund|title=Makers of HBO's 'Tribe' Given a Warm Reception|date=March 20, 1992|first=Bill|last=Higgins}}</ref><ref name="Fleras">{{cite journal |last1=Fleras |first1=Augie |title=Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America |journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development |date=2006 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=265–268 |doi=10.1080/01434630608668780|s2cid=216112743 }}</ref>

Kroeber's textbook, ''Anthropology'' (1923, 1948), was widely used for many years. In the late 1940s, it was one of ten books required as reading for all students during their first year at [[Columbia University]]. His book, ''Configurations of Cultural Growth'' (1944), had a lasting impact on social scientific research on [[genius]] and [[greatness]]; Kroeber believed that genius arose out of culture at particular times, rather than holding to "the great man" theory.<ref>Simonton, D.K. 1994.  ''Greatness: Who Makes History and Why''.  New York: The Guilford Press. p. 375–382</ref>

Kroeber's childhood friend Carl Alsberg described him as a "good listener" and able "to be objective, to see the other point of view, to penetrate behind another person’s behavior to his underlying thought [...] These traits indicate a sincerity and simplicity of character that primitive peoples sense at once and to which they respond by giving their confidence."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Burnham|first=John C.|date=2012|title=Anthropologist A.

From 1920 to 1923 Kroeber conducted an active practice as a lay psychoanalyst, with an office in San Francisco.<ref name=":0" />

==Indian land claims==
Kroeber served early on as the plaintiffs' director of research in ''Indians of California v. the United States'', a land claim case.<ref>13 ''Ind. Cl. Comm.'' 369 (1964)</ref> [[Omer Stewart]] of the University of Colorado served as associate director. [[Ralph Beals]] of the University of California, Los Angeles, served as director of research for the federal government in the case.
