'''Kai Theodor Erikson''' (born February 12, 1931)<ref name="handbuch" /> is an Austrian-born American [[sociologist]], noted as an authority on the social consequences of [[catastrophic event]]s.<ref name="kenyon" /> He served as the 76th president of the [[American Sociological Association]].<ref name="asanet" />

==Life and career==
Erikson was born in [[Vienna]], the son of [[Joan Erikson]] (née Serson), a Canadian-born artist, dancer, and writer, and [[Erik Erikson]], a German-born famed psychologist and sociologist.<ref name="buff" /> His maternal grandfather was an Episcopalian minister,<ref name="nyt" /> and Erikson was raised a Protestant.<ref name="bio" /> Erikson graduated from [[The Putney School]] in [[Vermont]], [[Reed College]] in [[Oregon]] and earned a PhD at the [[University of Chicago]]. He joined the faculty of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1959 where he held a joint appointment at the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] and in the Department of Sociology. There he met his future wife Joanna Slivka, who became Joanna Erikson.<ref name="bio256" />

In 1963 he moved to [[Emory University]], and followed that with a move to  [[Yale University]] in 1966.  He now holds the title of [[William R. Kenan, Jr.]] Professor Emeritus of [[Sociology]] and [[American Studies]].<ref name="kenyon" />

Erikson edited the ''[[Yale Review]]'' from 1979 to 1989.<ref name="kenyon" />

==Wayward Puritans==
''Wayward Puritans'' is the title of his first book (1966) which contains a chapter on [[sociology of deviance]] and a chapter on the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] before three illustrations of deviance within the colony. The first was associated with [[Anne Hutchinson]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Governor Vane]] and called the [[Antinomian Controversy]]. The second was concerned with an  intrusion of [[Quaker]]s, while the third was the  [[Salem witch trials]]. The book notes the deviation from the [[City upon a Hill]] ideal set by [[John Winthrop]]. 
 
H. Lawrence Ross described the book as "fascinating  and superbly written". The sociological premise explored is from [[Émile Durkheim]]: "a function of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] is to define the normative boundaries of the group." He notes that it is "a remarkable exception to the well-known tendency of sociological research to focus on the here and now." On the statistical analysis Ross comments: "the reasons to expect constancy of deviance over time, such as the limited capacity of the control system, would seem to predict stability of convictions as much as stability of offenders, and in consequence the analysis here seems unsatisfactory.”<ref>H. Lawrence Ross (1967) "Review: ''Wayward Puritans'' by Erikson, [[Social Forces]] 46:462</ref>

==Aftermaths of disasters==
Erikson subsequently studied a number of disasters in the context of their sociological implications, including the nuclear fallout in the [[Marshall Islands]] in 1954; the [[Buffalo Creek flood]] in [[West Virginia]] in 1972 (resulting in the award-winning 1978 book ''Everything In Its Path''); the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] in 1979; the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] in 1989; and the [[Bosnian Genocide|genocide in Yugoslavia]] of 1992 to 1995.<ref name="kenyon" />
