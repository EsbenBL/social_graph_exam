== Early life and education ==
Sennett grew up in the [[Cabrini Green]] housing project in Chicago,<ref name="Guardian 2001">Melissa Benn: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/03/books.guardianreview4 "Inner-city scholar"] in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 February 2001</ref> to a [[Jewish]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Sales |first=Ben |date=19 July 2019 |title=Senator's speech on 'cosmopolitan elites': Anti-Semitic dog whistle or poli-sci speak? |url=https://www.jta.org/2019/07/19/united-states/a-missouri-senator-gave-a-speech-opposing-a-powerful-upper-class-and-their-cosmopolitan-priorities-um |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |access-date=26 July 2019 }}</ref> family of Russian emigres. As a child he trained in music, studying the cello and conducting, working with Claus Adam of the [[Juilliard String Quartet]] and the conductor [[Pierre Monteux]]. When a hand injury put an end to his musical career, he entered academia. He studied under [[David Riesman]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[Oscar Handlin]] at Harvard, graduating with his Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization<ref name="The University of Chicago Magazine 2011">{{cite web |last=Station |first=Elizabeth | title=Life in practice | website=The University of Chicago Magazine | date=11 August 2011 | url=https://mag.uchicago.edu/law-policy-society/life-practice | access-date=14 August 2021}}</ref> in 1969.<ref name="Harvard University 2019">{{cite web | title=Past Centennial Medalists – The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | website=Harvard University | date=14 January 2019 | url=https://gsas.harvard.edu/alumni-association/alumni-awards | access-date=14 August 2021}}</ref> His intellectual life as an urbanist came into focus during the time he spent as a fellow of the Joint Center for Urban Studies of [[Harvard]] and [[MIT]].<ref>London School of Economics: [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/sennett.aspx "Professor Richard Sennett"], retrieved 25 May 2013</ref>

==Career==
Sennett's scholarly writing centers on the development of cities, the nature of work in modern society, and the sociology of culture. ''Families Against the City'', his earliest book, examines the relationship between family and work in 19th-century Chicago. A subsequent quartet of books explores urban life more largely: ''The Uses of Disorder'', an essay on identity formation in cities; ''The Fall of Public Man'', a history of public culture and public space, particularly in London, Paris, and New York in the 18th and 19th Centuries; ''The Conscience of the Eye'', a study of how Renaissance urban design passed into modern city planning, and ''Flesh and Stone'', an overview of the design of cities from ancient to modern times.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Another quartet of books is devoted to labor. ''The Hidden Injuries of Class'' is a study of class consciousness among working-class families in Boston; ''The Corrosion of Character'' explores how new forms of work are changing our communal and personal experience; ''Respect'' probes the relation of work and reforms of the welfare system; and ''The Culture of the New Capitalism'' provides an overview of these changes.
''Authority'' is an essay in political theory; it addresses the tools of interpretation by which we recast raw power into either legitimate or illegitimate authority.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Sennett is working on a project called 'Homo Faber,' exploring material ways of making culture. The first book in this series is ''The Craftsman'', published in 2008; subsequent volumes are ''Together: The Rituals, Pleasures, and Politics of Cooperation'', published in 2012, and ''Building and Dwelling: Ethics for the City'' (2018) on the making of the urban environment.<ref>David Runciman: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/03/together-politics-cooperation-richard-sennett-review "Together: The Rituals, Pleasures and Politics of Co-operation by Richard Sennett – review"], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 February 2012</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/55383/building-and-dwelling/|title=Building and Dwelling, Ethics for the City by Richard Sennett|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>

In the public realm, Sennett founded, and directed for a decade, the New York Institute of the Humanities at New York University. Sennett then chaired a United Nations commission on urban development and design.<ref>[https://sap.mit.edu/article/standard/richard-sennett-comes-mit Richard Sennett Comes To Mit / Balzan Prize Finalist Will Relinquish Post at NYU] – PLAN issue 62 published Oct, 2005</ref> As president of the American Council on Work,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/12/comment.politics1|title=Richard Sennett: An inferior Bill Clinton|first=Richard|last=Sennett|date=11 May 2007|website=the Guardian|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://capitalism.columbia.edu/richard-sennett-0|title=Richard Sennett – The Center on Capitalism and Society|website=capitalism.columbia.edu|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditchley.co.uk/conferences/past-programme/2000-2009/2009/architecture|title=How do architecture and society interrelate? – Ditchley Foundation|website=www.ditchley.co.uk|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref> Sennett led a forum, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, for researchers trying to understand the changing pattern of American labor. Most recently he helped create, and has chaired, the [[LSE Cities]] Programme at the London School of Economics. The [[Urban Age]] project also emerged as a product of the research and ideas by Sennett and others at LSE Cities. In 2006, he served as Chair of the jury of the Venice Biennale.
