==Academic Research==

He is the author of many works on the subject, including ''Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes'' (1975/2000), ''The Perils of Presidentialism'' (1990), and ''Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation: Southern Europe, South America, and Post-Communist Europe'' (1996, co-authored with [[Alfred Stepan]]).

===''An Authoritarian Regime: Spain''===

One of Linz's early works focused on General Francisco Franco's Spain and classified Spain's [[Regime|political regime]] as an  "authoritarian regime." This was an important innovation because at the time regimes tended to be classified as either [[Democracy|democratic]] or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]].<ref name="auto">Juan J. Linz, "An Authoritarian Regime: Spain," pp. 291-341, in Erik Allardt and Yrjö Littunen (eds.), ''Cleavages, Ideologies and Party System. Contributions to Comparative Political Sociology''. Helsinki: Westermarck Society, 1964.</ref> 

Linz defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:
* Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], realized with constraints on the [[legislature]], [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s.
* [[Political legitimacy]] based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems, such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]".
* Minimal [[political mobilization]], and suppression of anti-regime activities.
* Ill-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting, which extends the power of the executive.<ref name="auto"/>

===''Totalitarianism and Authoritarian Regimes''===
In this classic work, republished in 2000, Juan Linz provides an encyclopedic classification of types of political [[regime]] that develops the fundamental distinction between [[totalitarian]] and [[authoritarian]] systems and also presents a discussion of [[Sultanism|sultanistic]] regimes.<ref>Juan J. Linz, "Totalitarianism and Authoritarian Regimes," pp. 175-411, in Fred Greenstein and Nelson Polsby (eds.), ''Handbook of Political Science'' Vol. 3, ''Macropolitical Theory''. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Press, 1975; ''Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes'', Boulder, Col: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000.</ref> This work was foundational to the literature on [[authoritarianism]].

===''The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes''===
''The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes'' is a four volume coedited work with Alfred Stepan,<ref>Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan (eds.), ''The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes.'' Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978.</ref> that includes Linz's theoretical volume ''The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes. Crisis, Breakdown, and Reequilibriation''.<ref>Juan Linz, ''The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes. Crisis, Breakdown, and Reequilibriation.'' Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978.</ref> Linz focused on "how the people in power in a democratic regime, not just the opponents, played a decisive role in the overthrow of democracy." Regime breakdowns were contingent, non-inevitable events. This work "challenged Marxist theories, which highlighted economic causes, as well as other approaches that focused on opposition groups to explain why democratic regimes collapse."<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, "Juan J. Linz: Political Regimes and the Quest for Knowledge," pp. 150-209, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p. 150.</ref>

===''Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation''===
This work on [[democratization]], with [[Alfred Stepan]], provides a cross-regional comparison of thirteen countries in South America, Southern Europe, and postcommunist Europe. It introducing a novel focus on ''stateness'' problems stemming from nationalist conflicts. It also argues that the type of old non-democratic regime affects subsequent trajectories of democratization.<ref>Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, Juan J. Linz: Political Regimes and the Quest for Knowledge," pp. 150-209, in Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder, ''Passion, Craft, and Method in Comparative Politics''. Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p 151.</ref> Linz's ideas about the impact of non-democratic regimes on the prospects of transitions to democracy launched a new strand in the literature on political regimes that explores the strengths and weaknesses of different types of authoritarian regimes.<ref>Geddes, Barbara; Wright, Joseph; Frantz, Erica (2018).
