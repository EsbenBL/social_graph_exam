While at the University of Sydney, he set up the [[Transnational Corporations Research Project]].

==Study of transnational corporations==

Wheelwright was a vocal critic of the influence of transnational corporations in the politics of sovereign countries. Writing in 1982 with G.J. Crough, he argued:

:"''The kind of state that transnationals have opted to work closely with ... are some of the most repressive of states in the world which, to provide the political stability, good investment climate and cheap, disciplined labour so beloved of transnational managers, have repressed political demands, depoliticised the populace, destroyed political institutions, and emasculated organised labour. ... There are those who argue that such repression shows the true face of capital, liberal capitalism being an historical aberration.''"<ref>page 185, Wheelwright E.L. & Crough, G.J. (1982) ''Australia: a client state''</ref>

Along with fellow University of Sydney economist [[Gregory John Crough|Gregory Crough]], Ted Wheelwright was one of the founding members and permanent staff of the Transnational Corporations Research Project, set up through the University of Sydney in July 1975. The stated goal of the project was to "provide information on, and initiate research into aspects of foreign investment, and the activities of transnational corporations in Australia."<ref>quoted from the foreword to publications of the Transnational Corporations Research Project</ref> Publications of the project assert three objectives;

:"''(a) the publication of books, research monographs, working papers and data papers,
:''(b) the building up of a library of books, articles and relevant journals...
:''(c) the establishment of relationships with similar research projects in other countries...''"<ref>quoted from the foreword to publications of the Transnational Corporations Research Project</ref>

Through the project Wheelwright kept a correspondence with the [[United Nations Information and Research Centre on Transnational Corporations]], the [[Transnational Institute]] in Washington, and an institute of the same name in Amsterdam. More than forty documents were published by the Transnational Corporations Research Project.
