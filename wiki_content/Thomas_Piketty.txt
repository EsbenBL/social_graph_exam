'''Thomas Piketty''' ({{IPA-fr|tɔ.ma pi.kɛ.ti|lang}}; born 7 May 1971) is a French [[economist]] who is Professor of Economics at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] ({{lang-fr|École des hautes études en sciences sociales}}: '''EHESS'''), Associate Chair at the [[Paris School of Economics]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/piketty-thomas/|title=Thomas Piketty - Paris School of Economics|website=PSE - Ecole d'économie de Paris - Paris School of Economics|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref> and Centennial Professor of Economics in the International Inequalities Institute at the [[London School of Economics]].

Piketty's work focuses on [[public economics]], in particular income and wealth inequality. He is the author of the best-selling book ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' (2013),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/capital21c | title=Paris School of Economics | access-date=19 May 2014 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509061051/http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/capital21c | archive-date=9 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> which emphasises the themes of his work on [[wealth concentration]]s and [[Wealth distribution|distribution]] over the past 250 years. The book argues that the rate of capital return in [[developed countries]] is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth, and that this will cause [[wealth inequality]] to increase in the future. To address this problem, Piketty proposes redistribution through a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] global [[Wealth tax|tax on wealth]].<ref name="nybooks1">{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Why We're in a New Gilded Age |journal=The New York Review of Books |date=8 May 2014 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/may/08/thomas-piketty-new-gilded-age/}}</ref><ref name=NYT-BigThinker-2014>{{cite news|last=Tanenhaus|first=Sam|title=Hey, Big Thinker: Thomas Piketty, the Economist Behind 'Capital in the Twenty-First Century' Is the Latest Overnight Intellectual Sensation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/fashion/Thomas-Piketty-the-Economist-Behind-Capital-in-the-Twenty-First-Century-sensation.html|access-date=26 April 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> In 2019, his book ''[[Capital and Ideology]]'' was published, which focuses on income inequality in various societies in history.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul |title=Thomas Piketty Turns Marx on His Head |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/books/review/capital-and-ideology-thomas-piketty.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=20 April 2020 |date=8 March 2020}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Piketty was born in the Parisian suburb of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine]]. His parents had been involved with a [[Trotskyist]] group and the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 protests]] in Paris but they had moved away from this political position before Piketty was born. A visit to the Soviet Union in 1991 was enough to make him a firm "believe[r] in capitalism, private property and the market".<ref name = "Lunch with the FT">{{Cite web | last = Chassany | first = Anne-Sylvaine | date = 26 June 2015 | title = Lunch with the FT: Thomas Piketty | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7ca6cfc2-1b39-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.html | website = ft.com | access-date = 26 June 2015 }}</ref>

Piketty earned an [[Baccalauréat#Baccalauréat général streams|S-stream]] (scientific) [[Baccalauréat]], and after taking [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles#Scientific CPGE|scientific preparatory classes]], he entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) at the age of 18 where he studied mathematics and economics.<ref name=cv>{{cite web|title=Curriculum vitae|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/cv-en|publisher=pse.ens.fr|access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref> At the age of 22, Piketty was awarded his PhD for a thesis on [[Redistribution of wealth|wealth redistribution]], which he wrote at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) and [[EHESS]] under [[Roger Guesnerie]]<ref name=Cassidy>John Cassidy, [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/31/forces-of-divergence "Forces of Divergence"], ''The New Yorker'', 31 March 2014.</ref> and winning the French Economics Association's award for the best thesis of the year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thomas Piketty, a Not-So-Radical French Thinker|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579575890128783848|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=8 December 2014|first=Pascal-Emmanuel|last=Gobry|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

==Career==
After earning his PhD, Piketty taught from 1993 to 1995 as an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1995, he joined the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) as a researcher, and in 2000 he became a professor (directeur d'études) at EHESS.<ref name="cv"/>

Piketty won the 2002 [[Prix du meilleur jeune économiste de France|prize for the best young economist in France]], and according to a list dated 11 November 2003, he is a member of the scientific orientation board of the association ''À gauche, en Europe'', founded by [[Michel Rocard]] and [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]].<ref name=franceinter>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinter.fr/personne-thomas-piketty |title=Thomas Piketty / France Inter |publisher=Franceinter.fr |date=20 October 2013|access-date=16 June 2014}}</ref>

In 2006, Piketty became the first head of the [[Paris School of Economics]], which he helped set up.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-869879,0.html|title=Les " French economists " font école|author=Annie Kahn and Virginie Malingre|newspaper=Le Monde|date=22 February 2007|access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> He left after a few months to serve as an economic advisor to [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] during the [[2007 French presidential election|French presidential campaign]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pourquoi Thomas Piketty quitte la direction de l'École d'économie de Paris|publisher=Observatoire Boivigny|date=3 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/speciales/elysee_2007/20070227.OBS4464/avant_quil_ne_soit_trop_tard.html|title=Avant qu'il ne soit trop tard|work=[[Nouvel Observateur]] |date=3 March 2007|access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Piketty resumed teaching at the EHESS and Paris School of Economics in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title = Thomas Piketty |publisher= Paris School of Economics| url = http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/piketty-thomas |access-date =13 March 2014}}</ref>

He is a columnist for the French newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' and occasionally writes op-eds for ''[[Le Monde]]''.

In April 2012, Piketty co-authored along with 42 colleagues an open letter in support of then socialist party candidate for the French presidency [[François Hollande]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/04/17/nous-economistes-soutenons-hollande_1686249_3232.html |title=" Nous, économistes, soutenons François Hollande " 17 Apr 2012 |newspaper=Le Monde.fr |publisher=lemonde.fr |date=17 April 2012 |access-date=16 June 2014}}</ref> Hollande won the contest against the incumbent [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in May of that year. Piketty was unimpressed by Hollande's tenure, later describing him as "hopeless".<ref name="Lunch with the FT"/>

In 2013, Piketty won the biennial [[Yrjö Jahnsson Award]], for the economist under age 45 who has "made a contribution in theoretical and applied research that is significant to the study of economics in Europe."<ref>{{cite web|title=Yrjö Jahnsson Award in Economics|url=http://www.yjs.fi/en/seminars-and-international-contacts/yrjo-jahnsson-award-in-economics/|website=Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation}}</ref>

In January 2015, he rejected the French [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]] [[order (honour)|order]], stating that he refused the nomination because he did not think it was the government's role to decide who is honourable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1a57429e-91d1-11e4-bfe8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3NbBsciNN|title=Piketty rejects Légion d'Honneur award|work=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30650097|title=BBC News – France economist Thomas Piketty rejects Legion D'Honneur|work=BBC News | date=1 January 2015}}</ref>

On 27 September 2015, it was announced that he had been appointed to the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party's]] [[Economic Advisory Committee]], convened by [[Shadow Chancellor]] [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] and reporting to [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party Leader]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]].<ref name="LP01">{{cite web |title=Labour announces new Economic Advisory Committee |publisher=Labour Press |date=27 September 2015 |url=http://press.labour.org.uk/post/129975218774/labour-announces-new-economic-advisory-committee |access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> The appointment of Piketty, who had previously advised [[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Lord Wood]], key policy advisor to former Labour Party Leader [[Ed Miliband]], that tax rates could be raised above 50% for earnings over one million pounds without it impacting the economy,<ref>Andrew Sparrow, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/jun/16/nick-cleggs-press-conference-politics-live-blog Thomas Piketty interviewed by Stewart Wood: Politics live blog], The Guardian, 16 June 2014.</ref> was seen as a particular coup for the Labour Party leadership due to his breakthrough success in the mainstream publishing world.<ref name="BI01">{{cite web |last=Williams-Grut |first=Oscar |title=Meet the team shaping the Labour Party's 'New Economics' |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=28 September 2015 |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/jeremy-corbyn-and-john-mcdonnells-economic-advisors-2015-9 |access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> Regarding this appointment he stated that he was very happy to take part and assist the Labour Party in constructing an economic policy that helps tackle some of the biggest issues facing people in the UK and that there was a brilliant opportunity for the Labour party to construct a fresh and new political economy which will expose austerity for the failure it has been in the UK and Europe,<ref name="LP01" /> although he reportedly failed to attend the first meeting.<ref name="NS03">{{cite magazine |last=Chakelian |first=Anoosh |title="Labour must get real about the economy": is Corbyn's economic advisory board unravelling? |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |date=27 January 2016 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2016/01/labour-must-get-real-about-economy-corbyn-s-economic-advisory-board |access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> In June 2016, he resigned from his role in Labour's Economic Advisory Committee, citing concerns over the weak campaign the party had run in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/thomas-piketty-resigns-from-labour-party-role-a7108891.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn's economic advisor Thomas Piketty resigns|date=29 June 2016|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref>

On 2 October 2015, Piketty received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Johannesburg]] and on 3 October 2015 he delivered the 13th Annual Nelson Mandela Lecture at the University of Johannesburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/transcript-of-nelson-mandela-annual-lecture-2015 |title=Transcript of Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture 2015 |date=3 October 2015 |website=The Nelson Mandela Foundation | access-date=23 December 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, Piketty was also elected an international member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Thomas+Piketty&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-03-01|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

On 11 February 2017, it was announced that he had joined the socialist [[Benoît Hamon]]'s campaign team in the latter's presidential run. He took in charge of EU matters, and more precisely, the [[European Fiscal Compact|Fiscal Stability Treaty]] (or TSCG), while [[Julia Cagé]] was responsible for the candidate's economic and fiscal platform. Piketty expressed his view that the TSCG should be renegotiated in order to introduce a eurozone assembly, composed of members of EU's parliaments – a "democratic government", he said, in comparison with the current system which he views as a "huis clos" (a "private, closed-door discussion", an ''[[in camera]]'' arrangement). Such change would currently require unanimous approval of all EU members, and Piketty has suggested that a change of rules might be necessary, saying that if countries representing 80% of EU's population or GDP ratify a treaty, it should be approved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/02/12/a-quoi-ressemble-leurope-de-hamon-version-piketty/ |title=À quoi ressemble l'Europe de Benoît Hamon version Thomas Piketty |last=Boudet |first=Alexandre |date=12 February 2017 |website=Le Huffington Post |access-date=13 March 2017 | language=fr}}</ref> He is also in favour of a "credible and bold [[basic income]]", which is one of Benoit Hamon's key proposals, although their views on the matter are different.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/02/13/for-a-credible-and-bold-basic-income/ |title=For a credible and bold basic income |last=Piketty |first=Thomas |date=13 February 2017 |website=Le blog de Thomas Piketty |access-date=13 March 2017 | language=en}}</ref> The call in which Piketty and other economic researchers argue for their version of the basic income has been criticised as not "universal", a criticism he answered on his blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/02/13/is-our-basic-income-really-universal/ |title=Is our basic income really universal? |last=Piketty |first=Thomas |date=13 February 2017 |website=Le blog de Thomas Piketty |access-date=13 March 2017 | language=en}}</ref>

Thomas Piketty joined the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) in 2015 as the distinguished Centennial Professor. Piketty continues his research as part of the LSE International Inequalities Institute. His economic research focusses mainly on wealth inequalities and the use of capital in the 21st century. Piketty has long-standing ties to the [[London School of Economics]] and he completed his PhD studies at the university in the early 1990s.

In addition to his research, Piketty also teaches post-graduate students at the LSE. His teaching and research approach is inter-disciplinary and he has been involved in the teaching of the new MSc degree in Inequalities and Social Science at the London School of Economics.

== Research ==
Piketty specializes in [[economic inequality]], taking a historic and statistical approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/piketty/fichiers/presse/panorama/2009/WallStreetJournal_090312.html|title=The Obama Rosetta Stone|author=Daniel Henninger|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=12 March 2009|access-date=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517222852/http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/piketty/fichiers/presse/panorama/2009/WallStreetJournal_090312.html|archive-date=17 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>See in particular his ''Introduction à la théorie de la redistribution des richesses'', Economica, 1994.</ref> His work looks at the rate of [[capital accumulation]] in relation to economic growth over a two hundred year spread from the nineteenth century to the present. His novel use of tax records enabled him to gather data on the very top economic elite, who had previously been understudied, and to ascertain their rate of accumulation of wealth and how this compared to the rest of society and economy. His 2013 book ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', relies on economic data going back 250 years to show that an ever-rising concentration of wealth is not self-correcting. To address this problem, he proposes redistribution through a progressive global tax on wealth.<ref name="nybooks1"/><ref>An In-depth review by Robert Boyer, leader of the French Régulation school [http://regulation.revues.org/10618 in Régulation Review]</ref>

=== Study of long-term economic inequalities ===
[[File:Thomas Piketty- Extreme inequality is useless for growth.webm|thumb|Thomas Piketty: Extreme inequality is useless for growth]]
A research project on high incomes in France led to the book ''Les hauts revenus en France au XXe siècle'' (''High incomes in France in the 20th Century'', Grasset, 2001), which was based on a survey of statistical series covering the whole of the 20th century, built from data from the fiscal services (particularly income tax declarations). He extended this analysis in his immensely popular book ''Le Capital au XXIe siècle'' (''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'').
A study by [[Emmanuel Saez]] and Piketty showed that the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the country's total income in 2012, the highest level recorded since the government began collecting the relevant data a century ago.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Annie | last=Lowrey | title=The Rich Get Richer Through the Recovery | date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/27/the-presidents-inequality-absurdities/ | work=New York Post | first=Michael | last=Tanner | title=The president's 'inequality' absurdities | date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf|title=Striking it Richer : The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Updated with 2012 preliminary estimates)|author=Emmanuel Saez|date=September 3, 2013|website=Eml.berkeley.edu|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref>

=== Survey on the evolution of inequalities in France ===
Piketty's work shows that differences in earnings dropped sharply during the 20th century in France, mostly after World War II. He argues that this was due to a decrease in estate inequalities, while wage inequalities remained stable. The shrinking inequality during this period, Piketty says, resulted from a highly progressive income tax after the war, which upset the dynamics of estate accumulation by reducing the surplus money available for saving by the wealthiest.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The normative conclusion Piketty draws is that a tax cut and thus a decrease in the financial contribution to society of the wealthy that has been happening in France since the late 1990s will assist in the rebuilding of the earlier large fortunes of the [[Rentier state|rentier]] class. This trend will lead to the rise of what he calls patrimonial capitalism, in which a few families control most of the wealth.<ref name=Cassidy/>

Through a statistical survey, Piketty also showed that the [[Laffer curve|Laffer effect]], which claims that high marginal tax rates on top incomes are an incentive for the rich to work less, was probably negligible in the case of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/public/Piketty1998d.pdf|title=Les Hauts revenus face aux modifications des taux marginaux supérieurs de l'impôt sur le revenu en France, 1970–1996|publisher=Économie et prévision, n° 138–139|date=1999}}</ref>

=== Comparative work ===
Piketty has done comparative work on inequality in other developed countries. In collaboration with other economists, particularly [[Emmanuel Saez]], he built a statistical series based on a similar method used in his studies of France. This research led to reports on the evolution of inequalities in the US,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Piketty | first1 = T. | author-link1 = Thomas Piketty| last2 = Saez | first2 = E. | author-link2 = Emmanuel Saez| doi = 10.1162/00335530360535135 | title = Income Inequality in the United States, 1913-1998 | journal = [[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]]| volume = 118 | pages = 1–41 | year = 2003 | url = http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf}}</ref> and on economic dynamics in the English-speaking world and continental Europe.<ref>See particularly, {{cite journal |first1=T. |last1=Piketty |first2=E. |last2=Saez |title=The Evolution of Top Incomes: A Historical and International Perspective |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=200–205 |year=2006 |jstor=30034642 |doi=10.1257/000282806777212116|s2cid=10738675 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w11955.pdf }} And {{cite book |editor-first=T. |editor-last=Atkinston |editor2-first=T. |editor2-last=Piketty |title=Top incomes over the twentieth century : a contrast between continental European and English-speaking countries |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 }}</ref> Saez won the prestigious [[John Bates Clark Medal|John Bates Clark prize]] for this work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/bates-clark/emmanuel-saez|title=Emmanuel Saez, Clark Medalist 2009|website=aeaweb.org|access-date=2018-02-07}}</ref>

The surveys found that following the [[Second World War]], after initially undergoing a decrease in economic inequality similar to that in continental Europe, English-speaking countries have, over the past thirty years, experienced increasing inequalities.

=== A critic of the Kuznets curve ===
Piketty's work has been discussed as a critical continuation of the pioneering work of [[Simon Kuznets]] in the 1950s.<ref>"The Kuznets' curve, yesterday and tomorrow", in A. Banerjee, R. Benabou et D. Mookerhee (eds.), ''Understanding poverty'', Oxford university press, 2005.</ref> According to Kuznets, the long-term evolution of earnings inequalities was shaped as a curve ([[Kuznets curve]]). Growth started at the beginning of the industrial revolution, and slackened off later due to the reallocation of the labor force from low productivity sectors like agriculture to higher productivity sectors like industry.

According to Piketty, the tendency observed by Kuznets in the early 1950s is not necessarily a product of deep economic forces (e.g. sectoral spillover or the effects of technological progress). Instead, estate values, rather than wage inequalities, decreased, and they did so for reasons that were not specifically economic (for example, the creation of income tax). Consequently, the decrease would not necessarily continue, and in fact, inequalities have grown sharply in the United States over the last thirty years, returning to their 1930s level.

=== Other work ===
Besides these surveys, which make up the core of his work, Piketty has published in other areas, often with a connection to economic inequalities. His work on schools, for example, postulates that disparities among different schools, especially class sizes, are a cause for the persistence of inequalities in wages and the economy.<ref>T.

Valdenaire, ''[http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/48/4/2484.pdf L'impact de la taille des classes sur la réussite scolaire dans les écoles, collèges et lycées français – Estimations à partir du panel primaire 1997 et du panel secondaire 1995]'', Ministère de l'éducation nationale, 2006.</ref> He has also published proposals for changes in the French pension system and the French tax system.<ref>A.

Piketty's latest book, ''Capital and Ideology'',<ref>Capital et idéologie (Seuil, 2019)</ref> argues it  is  necessary to examine  the ideological systems which attempted to justify the forms of inequality specific to different institutional configurations. This work was well received, but some critics considered Piketty's work too vague. In particular, Nicolas Brisset criticized his definitions and analyses of "ideology" and "capitalism" for being too weak:<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|title=Capital and Ideology: A critique|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340038031}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342522317_Du_capital_a_la_propriete_Histoire_et_justice_dans_le_travail_de_Thomas_Piketty|title= Du capital à la propriété: Histoire et justice dans le travail de Thomas Piketty|website=ResearchGate}}</ref> ''"ideology is loosely incorporated into Piketty's analysis. We argue that it lacks a reflection on the development of dominant ideologies by groups with an interest in maintaining various property regimes. The identification of these “dominant” groups is complicated by the absence of a true theory of the production of inequality and by a purely individualistic approach. In essence, as we have noted, in this analysis ideology seems to emerge completely independently from the social relations of production that underpin inequalities, presenting a rather surprising historiography centered on the repeatedly used concept of “experimentation”. Piketty thus considers history as a series of more or less successful institutional experiments (Piketty 2020, 41), leading to crises from which later ideologies draw lessons. Considering the history of human societies as so many experiments reinforces the ambiguity of the history proposed by Piketty: while he emphasizes the extreme violence of the different property regimes, he considers ideologies separate from the equally violent struggles in which they participate"''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|title=From capital to property : history and justice in the work of Thomas Piketty|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348263966|journal=}}</ref>

{{main|Capital in the Twenty-First Century}}

''Capital in the Twenty-First Century'', published in 2013, focuses on [[economic inequality|wealth and income inequality]] in Europe and the US since the 18th century.  The book's central thesis is that inequality is not an accident but rather a feature of capitalism that can be reversed only through state intervention.<ref name="cooper">{{cite news |author=Ryan Cooper |title=Why everyone is talking about Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/258666/why-everyone-is-talking-about-thomas-pikettys-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century |newspaper=[[The Week]] |date=25 March 2014 }}</ref> The book thus argues that unless capitalism is reformed, the very democratic order will be threatened.<ref name="cooper"/> The book reached number one on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestselling hardcover nonfiction list from 18 May 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-05-18/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html | title=Best Sellers | access-date=22 May 2014 | work=The New York Times | first=Gregory | last=Cowles}}</ref> Piketty offered a "possible remedy: a global tax on wealth".<ref name="The_Economist_2015">{{citation |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21653596-anthony-atkinson-godfather-inequality-research-growing-problem-mind-gap?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/st/mindthegap |title=Mind the Gap: Anthony Atkinson, the godfather of inequality research, on a growing problem|date=6 June 2015 |access-date=7 June 2015 |newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}</ref><!---
