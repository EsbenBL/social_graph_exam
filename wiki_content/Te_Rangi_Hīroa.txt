'''Sir Peter Henry Buck''' {{postnominals|country=NZL|KCMG|DSO}} (ca. October 1877 &ndash; 1 December 1951), also known as '''Te Rangi Hīroa''' or '''Te Rangihīroa''', was a New Zealand doctor, military leader, health administrator, politician, anthropologist and museum director. He was a prominent member of [[Ngāti Mutunga]], his mother's [[Māori people|Māori]] [[iwi]].

==Early life==
Peter Buck was born in [[Urenui]], New Zealand, the only child of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] immigrant William Henry Buck and Rina, a [[Māori people|Māori]] woman. William's wife Ngarongo-ki-tua had been unable to have children and, in line with Māori custom, Rina, one of Ngarongo's relatives, became part of the household and produced a child for the couple. Rina died soon after Peter was born, and Ngarongo raised him as her own. He claimed to have been born in 1880, but the register of the primary school he attended records October 1877, which is likely to be correct.<ref name="DNZB updateme">{{cite web | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3b54/1 | title= Buck, Peter Henry - Biography | last= Sorrenson | first= M.

[[File:RangiHiroa1904.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Rangi Hiroa in 1904]]
Te Rangi Hīroa was descended on his Māori (maternal) side from the [[Taranaki (iwi)|Taranaki]] iwi of Ngāti Mutunga. In his teens,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Buck, Sir Peter Henry (Te Rangihiroa), K.C.M.G., D.S.O. |first=Ernest |last=Beaglehole |editor-first=A.H. |editor-last=McLintock |encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] |date=1966 |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/buck-sir-peter-henry |via=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref> his elders gave him the name Te Rangi Hīroa (also written Te Rangihiroa) in honour of an uncle of Ngarongo's and an earlier notable ancestor. His paternal ancestry was English and Irish. Though he was largely brought up within the [[Pākehā]] (the Maori term for non-Maori people, Caucasian people in particular) community, Ngarongo-ki-tua and his great-aunt Kapuakore instilled a love of Māori tradition and [[Māori language|language]] in him.<ref name="DNZB updateme" />

After Ngarongo's death in 1892 he moved with his father to the [[Wairarapa]]. In 1896 he started attending [[Te Aute College]], a school that produced many Māori leaders of the time. In 1899 he was named [[Dux#Education|Dux]] and passed a medical preliminary examination, entitling him to attend the [[University of Otago]] Medical School. He was later associated with the [[Young Māori Party]].

==Medical school and practice==

Buck did well at Otago Medical School, where he also succeeded in sport, becoming national [[long jump]] champion in 1900 and 1903. He completed his MB ChB in 1904, and an MD six years later. During this time, in 1905, he married Irish-born Margaret Wilson. Their long marriage was often fiery, but was strong, and it was Margaret who often gave the impetus to Peter's career.

In November 1905 Buck was appointed as a medical officer to Māori, working under [[Māui Pōmare]], initially in the southern [[North Island]], then in the far north. Between them Pomare and Buck campaigned successfully to improve sanitation in the small Māori communities around the country.

During the [[First World War]], Buck helped in the recruitment of a Māori volunteer contingent. Buck joined this contingent as medical officer, travelling to the Middle East in 1915. He took part at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], later being awarded a [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his heroism. He later saw action in France and Belgium, before being posted to the No 3 New Zealand General Hospital at [[Codford]], [[England]], in 1918.

Returning to New Zealand, Buck was appointed as Chief Maori Medical Officer, and in 1921 was named director of the Maori Hygiene Division in the Department of Health.

==Bishop Museum==

Buck gained a five-year research fellowship at the [[Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], in 1927. At the end of the fellowship in 1932 he was appointed Bishop Museum visiting professor of anthropology at [[Yale University]]. He was promoted to Director of the Bishop Museum in 1936, a position he held until his death in 1951. He also served as a Trustee and President of the Board of Trustees of the museum.<ref name="DNZB updateme"/>
