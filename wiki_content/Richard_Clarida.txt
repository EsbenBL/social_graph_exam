His studies with [[Jordi Galí]] and [[Mark Gertler (economist)|Mark Gertler]] suggest that monetary policy in many countries today resembles a forward looking [[Taylor rule]], whereas the policy makers of the 1970s failed to follow such a forward looking Taylor rule.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clarida|first=Richard|author2=Gali, Jordi|title=The science of monetary policy: a New-Keynesian perspective|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|year=1999|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1661–707|doi=10.1257/jel.37.4.1661|hdl=10230/360|s2cid=55045787|display-authors=etal|url=http://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/10230/360/1/356.pdf|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

Whereas before the crisis r* was thought to be above 4 percent, Clarida wrote in 2014 that r* was now closer to 2 percent than to 4 percent.
