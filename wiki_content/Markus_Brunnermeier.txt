==Selected Research==
Brunnermeier's research lies at the intersection of international macro, monetary and financial economics. He primarily studies distortions caused by financial frictions. These frictions invalidate the [[Efficient market hypothesis]] (EMH), a proposition that markets incorporate all information relevant to prices immediately and consequently the price of a given asset accurately represents the likely value of that asset.<ref group=note>There are multiple forms of the EMH, each with various levels of confidence among academics economists.  Among the strong, semi-strong, and weak versions of the hypothesis, the latter have higher levels of support.  See Beechey, Gruen & Vickery (2000) for more detail.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beechey|first=Meredith|author2=Gruen, David |author3=Vickery, James |date=January 2000|title=The Efficient Market Hypothesis: A Survey|journal=Research Discussion Papers|publisher=Reserve Bank of Australia|volume=2000-01|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2000/pdf/rdp2000-01.pdf}}</ref>

===Price efficiency, bubbles, liquidity, and systemic risk===
Faced with the empirical evidence that asset prices diverged from their [[Fundamental analysis|fundamentals]] during the [[dot-com bubble]], Brunnermeier crafted a model of trading where participants in the market would recognize [[Economic bubble|bubbles]] in asset prices but continue to trade "into the wind".<ref>{{cite video| people =Brunnermeier, Markus; Hong, Harrison; [[Charlie Rose|Rose, Charlie]] (Host); Xiong, Wei| title =Charlie Rose | medium = Television| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]|date = 2008|url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2008/08/14/2/a-discussion-about-the-federal-reserve}}</ref>  Brunnermeier's empirical paper, coauthored with Stefan Nagel, documents that [[hedge fund]]s were riding the dot-com bubble. The paper won the [[Smith Breeden Prize]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afajof.org/journal/prizeabs.asp#first04oct |title=Brattle and Smith Breeden Prizewinners |publisher=The American Finance Association |access-date=2009-08-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529084848/http://www.afajof.org/journal/prizeabs.asp |archive-date=2009-05-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|author2=Nagel, Stefan|year=2004|title=Hedge Funds and the Technology Bubble|journal=[[Journal of Finance]]|volume=59|issue=5|pages=2013–2040|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00690.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.4441}}</ref>

Brunnermeier and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen|Lasse Pedersen]] introduced different liquidity concepts and studied [[liquidity crisis|liquidity spirals]], which are vicious cycles that amplify initial shocks and provide an explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|liquidity crisis in 2008]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|author2=Pedersen, Lasse Heje|year=2009|title=Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity|journal=The Review of Financial Studies|volume=22|issue=6|doi=10.1093/rfs/hhn098|pages=2201–2238|citeseerx=10.1.1.572.1746|s2cid=9093699}}</ref>

Brunnermeier with [[Tobias Adrian]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] created one of the first [[systemic risk]] measures, the CoVaR,<ref name="Adrian Brunnermeier pp. 1705–1741">{{cite journal | last=Adrian | first=Tobias | last2=Brunnermeier | first2=Markus K. | title=CoVaR | journal=American Economic Review | publisher=American Economic Association | volume=106 | issue=7 | date=June 1, 2016 | issn=0002-8282 | doi=10.1257/aer.20120555 | pages=1705–1741}}</ref> an alternative to value at risk which takes spillover and contagion effects between assets and industries into account.<ref>{{cite news|title=The revolution within|date=May 16, 2009 |work=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2009/05/16/the-revolution-within|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref>

===Macroeconomy and finance===
Brunnermeier and [[Yuliy Sannikov]] integrated financial frictions into macro and international economic models. Their macro models capture non-linearities that occur during crises episodes. They also introduced the concept of volatility paradox, which refers to the phenomenon that risk builds up primarily during tranquil times in background in the form of imbalances and only materializes when crises erupt.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|author2=Sannikov, Yuliy|year=2014|title=A Macroeconomic Model with a Financial Sector|journal=American Economic Review|volume=104|issue=2|pages=379–421|doi=10.1257/aer.104.2.379|hdl=10419/144448|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

===Monetary theory and financial regulation===
Brunnermeier and [[Yuliy Sannikov|Sannikov's]] monetary paper, The I Theory of Money, studies [[debt deflation]] à la Fisher and the interaction between (redistributive) [[monetary policy]] and [[Macroprudential regulation|macroprudential policy]]. The "Paradox of Prudence" emerges: micro-prudent behavior of individual financial institutions is not necessarily macro-prudent. His approach provides an alternative to the predominant [[New Keynesian economics|New-Keynesian view]], in which price and wage rigidities are the primary frictions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brunnermeier |first1=Markus |last2=Sannikov |first2=Yuliy |year=2016 |title=The I Theory of Money |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 22533 |doi=10.3386/w22533 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===International financial markets===
Brunnermeier's work on international finance documents the link between [[carry trade]]s and currency crashes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|author2=Nagel, Stefan |author3=Pedersen, Lasse H. |year=2008| title=Carry Trades and Currency Crashes |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=23 |pages=313–347|doi=10.1086/593088|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.4392|s2cid=15554090}}</ref> He also analyzes sudden stops in international credit flows and other inefficiencies due to [[Pecuniary externality|pecuniary externalities]].

===Euro and economic philosophies===
Further work of Brunnermeier focuses on the architecture of the [[euro]] and the [[Eurozone]]. His book, ''[[The Euro and the Battle of Ideas]]'', (together with [[Harold James (historian)|Harold James]], from Princeton's [[Princeton University Department of History|Department of History]], and [[Jean-Pierre Landau]], from the [[Banque de France]]) shows how core problems of the [[euro]] are also linked to conflicting political and economic philosophies of the [[Eurozone|Eurozone's]] founding countries, especially those of Germany and France, and discusses ways to reconcile the competing views.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|author2=James, Harold|author3=Landau, Jean-Pierre|title=The Euro and the Battle of Ideas|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ, USA|year=2016|isbn=978-0691172927}}</ref> Brunnermeier also proposes European Safe Bonds (ESBies) in form of Sovereign Bond Backed Securities (SBBS) as a means to break the vicious circle between sovereign risk and bank risk in the [[Eurozone]] and to rechannel flight-to-safety capital flows from cross-border flows to flows across tranches of the ESBies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus|author2=Langfield, Sam|author3=Pagano, Marco|author4=Reis, Ricardo|author5=Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn|author6=Vayanos, Dimitrios |year=2017|title=ESBies: safety in the tranches|journal=[[Economic Policy]]|volume=32|issue=90|pages=175–219|doi=10.1093/epolic/eix004|doi-access=free}}</ref>
