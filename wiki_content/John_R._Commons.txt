==Early years==
John R. Commons was born in [[Hollansburg, Ohio]] on October 13, 1862. Commons had a religious upbringing which led him to be an advocate for social justice early in life. Commons was considered a poor student and suffered from a mental illness while studying. He was allowed to graduate without finishing because of the potential seen in his intense determination and curiosity. At this time, Commons became a follower of [[Henry George]]'s [[Georgism|'single tax']] economics.<ref>Brue S. and Grant R. (2012). The Evolution of Economic Thought (PDF) ([http://www.cengage.com/resource_uploads/downloads/0324321457_65788.pdf Supplemental Biography of John Rogers Commons] for chapter 19 of the online edition of The Evolution of Economic Thought ed.). Cengage Learning. Retrieved 1 September 2014.</ref> He carried this 'Georgist' or [[Ricardian economics|'Ricardian']] approach to economics, with a focus on land and monopoly rents, throughout the rest of his life, including a proposal for income taxes with higher rates on land rents.<ref>Commons, John R.

After graduating from [[Oberlin College]], Commons did two years of graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he studied under [[Richard T. Ely]],<ref name=HDPE>J. David Hoeveler, Jr., "John R. Commons,"'' Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890–1920.'' Revised Edition.

In spring 1899, Syracuse dismissed him as a radical.<ref>Richard A. Gonce (2002), "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3487977 John R. Commons's "Five Big Years]": 1899–1904", ''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Vol. 61, No. 4 (Oct., 2002), pp. i+755–777, p. 756</ref> Eventually Commons  re-entered academia at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1904.<ref name=HDPE />

Commons' early work exemplified his desire to unite Christian ideals with the emerging social sciences of [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. He was a frequent contributor to ''Kingdom'' magazine, was a founder of the American Institute for Christian Sociology, and authored a book in 1894 called ''Social Reform and the Church.''<ref name="Hoeveler pg. 85">Hoeveler, "John R. Commons," pg. 85.</ref> He was an advocate of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] legislation and was active in the national [[Prohibition Party]].<ref name="Hoeveler pg. 85"/> By his Wisconsin years, Commons' scholarship had become less moralistic and more empirical, and he moved away from a religious viewpoint in his [[ethics]] and sociology.<ref>Gonce, Richard A. “John R. Commons's 'Five Big Years': 1899-1904.” The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, vol. 61, no. 4, 2002, pp. 760-i. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3487977.</ref>

==Career==
[[File:JohnCommons.jpg|thumb|John R. Commons at his desk at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s.]]
Commons is best known for developing an analysis of [[collective action]] by the [[state (polity)|state]] and other [[institution]]s, which he saw as essential to understanding economics. Commons believed that carefully crafted legislation could create social change; that view led him to be known as a socialist radical and incrementalist. Contrary to some published accounts, Commons did consider African Americans capable of voting. When he advocated proportional representation, he suggested a "negro party".<ref>Commons,John, R. 1900. Representative Democracy. New York: American Bureau of Economic Research, 1900, 20.</ref> He even suggested  applying the Thirteenth amendment to the Constitution to force Southern States to allow African Americans to vote.<ref>Chasse, John Dennis. A Workers' Economist: John R. Commons and His Legacy from Progressivism to the War on Poverty. New York: Transactions Press, pp.120-122.</ref> He continued the strong American tradition in institutional economics by such figures as the economist and social theorist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. His notion of transaction is one of the most important contributions to Institutional Economics.<ref>Nicita A. and M. Vatiero (2007), "The Contract and the Market: Towards a Broader Notion of Transaction?". Studi e Note di Economia, 1:7–22. [http://www.mps.it/NR/rdonlyres/B6F3EB33-518F-4310-8137-D2EC9B7C77F2/34110/722NICITAVATIERO.pdf Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927173812/http://www.mps.it/NR/rdonlyres/B6F3EB33-518F-4310-8137-D2EC9B7C77F2/34110/722NICITAVATIERO.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> The institutional theory was closely related to his remarkable successes in fact-finding and drafting legislation on a wide range of social issues for the state of [[Wisconsin]]. He drafted legislation establishing Wisconsin's [[worker's compensation]] program, the first of its kind in the United States.

In 1934, Commons published ''Institutional Economics'', which laid out his view that institutions were made up of collective actions that, along with conflict of interests, defined the economy. He believed that institutional economics added collective control of individual transactions to existing economic theory.<ref>Vatiero, Massimiliano. "From W. N. Hohfeld to J. R. Commons, and Beyond? A "Law and Economics" Enquiry on Jural Relations", ''[[American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', 69(2): 840–866, 2010.</ref> Commons considered the Scottish economist [[Henry Dunning Macleod]] to be the "originator" of Institutional economics.<ref name="isbn0-88738-797-7">{{cite book |author=Commons, John Rogers |title=Institutional Economics: Its Place in Political Economy |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wFHlGU70ZAC&pg=PA399 |pages=399 |isbn=978-0-88738-797-5 }}</ref>

Commons was a contributor to [[The Pittsburgh Survey]], a 1907 sociological investigation of a single American city. His graduate student, [[John A. Fitch]], wrote  ''The Steel Workers'', a classic depiction of a key industry in early 20th-century America. It was one of six key texts to come out of the survey.  [[Edwin E. Witte]], later known as the "father of social security" also did his PhD at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] under Commons.

He was a leading advocate of [[proportional representation]] in the United States, writing a book on the subject in 1907 and serving as vice-president of the Proportional Representation League.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAYxAQAAMAAJ&q=%22jane+addams%22%2C+proportional+representation&pg=PA74 | title=Proportional Representation Review| year=1921}}</ref>

Commons undertook two major studies of the history of [[labor unions in the United States]]. Beginning in 1910, he edited ''A Documentary History of American Industrial Society,'' a large work that preserved many original-source documents of the American labor movement. Almost as soon as that work was complete, Commons began editing ''History of Labor in the United States'', a narrative work which built on the previous 10-volume documentary history.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Hocheera.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The John R. and Nell Commons House Landmark Designation Sign]]

He died on May 11, 1945.

Today, Commons's contribution to labor history is considered equal to his contributions to the theory of institutional economics. He also made valuable contributions to the [[history of economic thought]], especially with regard to collective action. He is honored at the University of Wisconsin in Madison with rooms and clubs named for him.<ref>The John R. Commons Room on the 8th floor of the Sociology building, and the John R. Commons Club in the Economics department</ref>

Commons was the mentor of many outstanding economists and has been credited with originating the "[[Wisconsin Idea]]," in which university faculty serve as advisors to state government.<ref>[[File:Hocheera.jpg|thumb|The John R. and Nell Commons House Landmark Designation Sign]]</ref>

His former home, [[The John R. and Nell Commons House]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/hp/register/viewSummary.asp?refnum=85000572</ref><ref>http://landmarkhunter.com/159571-john-commons-house/</ref>

* "...But the smallest unit of the institutional economists is a unit of activity — a transaction, with its participants. Transactions intervene between the labor of the classic economists and the pleasures of the hedonic economists, simply because it is society that controls access to the forces of nature, and transactions are, not the "exchange of commodities," but the alienation and acquisition, between individuals, of the rights of property and liberty created by society, which must therefore be negotiated between the parties concerned before labor can produce, or consumers can consume, or commodities be physically exchanged..." —"Institutional Economics" ''American Economic Review'', vol. 21 (December 1931), pp.&nbsp;648–657.
