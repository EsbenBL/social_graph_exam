'''David Bloor''' ({{IPAc-en|b|l|ʊər}}; born 1942) is a British sociologist. He is a professor in, and a former director of, the Science Studies Unit at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He is a key figure in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge|Edinburgh school]] and played a major role in the development of the field of [[science and technology studies]].<ref>{{cite journal |author-link=Bruno Latour |last=Latour |first=B. |year=1999 |title='For Bloor and Beyond' – a reply to David Bloor's 'Anti-Latour' |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=113–129 |doi=10.1016/s0039-3681(98)00039-9 |pmid=11623971}}</ref> He is best known for advocating the [[strong programme]] in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], most notably in his book ''Knowledge and Social Imagery''.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Derby]]. He started his academic career in philosophy and [[psychology]]. In 1972 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis "Speech and the regulation of behaviour."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=C.|first=Bloor, David|year=1972|title=Speech and the regulation of behaviour|hdl=1842/22721}}</ref> In the 1970s he and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] were the major figures of the [[strong programme]], which put forward queries against ''philosophical [[a priorism]]'' in the understanding of scientific knowledge. This is an approach, popular in the philosophy of science, that simply precluded inquiries about science by treating successful scientific knowledge as simply true or rational without empirically investigating how such knowledge has come to be accepted as true or rational. Bloor's book ''Knowledge and Social Imagery'' (Routledge, 1976) is one of the key texts of the [[strong programme]].

Bloor wrote extensively on the [[T. S. Kuhn|Kuhn]]/[[Karl Popper|Popper]] debate, and is a representative figure of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]. In the 1980s when French scholars like [[Bruno Latour]] developed the [[actor-network theory]] (partially based on the strong programme), David Bloor strongly disagreed with the ANT camp when they argued that human and non-humans should be treated in an equivalent manner, going so far as to write an article entitled "Anti-Latour".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bloor|first=David|year=1999|title=Anti-Latour|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BLOA-5|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=30|issue=1|pages=81–112|doi=10.1016/S0039-3681(98)00038-7}}</ref>

He was awarded the [[John Desmond Bernal Prize]] by the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] in 1996 in recognition of his distinguished contribution to the field.<ref>[http://www.4sonline.org/prizes/bernal List of winners of the John Desmond Bernal Prize]</ref>
