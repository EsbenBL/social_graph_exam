'''Robert Alexander Nisbet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪ|z|b|ɪ|t}}; September 30, 1913 – September 9, 1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]], a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Vice-Chancellor]] at the [[University of California, Riverside]], and an Albert Schweitzer Professor at [[Columbia University]].

== Life ==
Nisbet was born in [[Los Angeles]] in 1913. He was raised with his three brothers and one sister<ref name=Woods>[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Thomas]] (2005-12-05) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/05/00017/ Twilight of Conservatism], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> in the small California community of [[Maricopa, California|Maricopa]],<ref name=Hometown>McWilliams, Susan (2010-02-01) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/hometown-hero/ Hometown Hero], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> where his father managed a lumber yard. His studies at [[University of California, Berkeley]] culminated in a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[sociology]] in 1939. His thesis was supervised by [[Frederick John Teggart|Frederick J. Teggart]]. At Berkeley, "Nisbet found a powerful defense of intermediate institutions in the conservative thought of 19th-century Europe. Nisbet saw in thinkers like [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]—then all but unknown in American scholarship—an argument on behalf of what he called 'conservative pluralism.'"<ref name=Hometown/> He joined the faculty there in 1939.<ref name=Woods/>

After serving in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], when he was stationed on Saipan in the Pacific Theatre, Nisbet founded the Department of Sociology at Berkeley, and was briefly Chairman. Nisbet left an embroiled Berkeley in 1953 to become a [[dean (education)|dean]] at the [[University of California, Riverside]], and later a [[Vice-Chancellor]]. Nisbet remained in the University of California system until 1972, when he left for the [[University of Arizona]] at [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. Soon after, he was appointed to the [[Albert Schweitzer]] Chair at [[Columbia University|Columbia]].

On retiring from Columbia in 1978, Nisbet continued his scholarly work for eight years at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] asked him to deliver the [[Jefferson Lecture]] in Humanities, sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. He died, at 82, in Washington, DC.

Nisbet's first important work, ''The Quest for Community'' (New York: Oxford University Press, [1953] 1969), claimed that modern social science's individualism denied an important human drive toward community as it left people without the aid of their fellows to combat the centralizing power of the nation-state. ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Ross Douthat]] called it "arguably the 20th century's most important work of conservative sociology."<ref>{{cite news|last=Douthat|first=Ross|title=The Age of Individualism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-age-of-individualism.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=March 15, 2014}}</ref>

Nisbet began his career as a leftist but later confessed a conversion to a philosophical conservatism.<ref>Robert Nisbet: The Quest For Community, 1953</ref> While he consistently described himself as a conservative, he also "famously defended abortion rights
and publicly attacked the foreign policy of President Ronald Reagan."<ref>Luke C. Sheehan, “Robert Nisbet: Reappraisal of a Political Sociologist,” ''The Political Science Reviewer'' 42, 2, 2018, 385–397 (385).</ref>

He was a contributor to ''[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]]''. He was especially concerned with tracing the history and impact of the [[Idea of Progress]].<ref>Nisbet, Robert (1979). "A History of the Idea of Progress"</ref> He challenged conventional sociological theories about progress and modernity, insisting on the negative consequences of the loss of traditional forms of community, a process that he believed was greatly accelerated by [[World War I]]. According to British sociologist Daniel Chernilo, for Nisbet, "The sociological interest in the formation of modern society lies in whether and how it can re-invigorate forms of communal life and, if not, in understanding what will be the consequences of such failure." Nisbet, thus, "inverts what had been until then the mainstream proposition that society was more important, both historically and normatively, than community."<ref>Daniel Chernilo, “Social Change and Progress in the Sociology of Robert Nisbet,” ''Society'' 52 (2015), 324–334.</ref> Chernilo also critically observed that Nisbet's "argument on the Great War [World War I] that marks the transition from community to society offers a one-sided view of the historical process as moving unequivocally towards a decaying condition."<ref>Chernilo, “Social Change,” 329.</ref>
