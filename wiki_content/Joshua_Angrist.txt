=== Economics of education===

==== Research on the returns to schooling====

The bulk of Angrist's research has concentrated on the economics of education, beginning with the returns to schooling. In one early study, Angrist and Krueger exploited the relationship between children's season of birth and educational attainment that is due to policies and laws setting ages for school start and compulsory schooling, finding that returns to education are close to their [[ordinary least squares|OLS estimates]]<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2937954|title=Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?|author1=Angrist, Joshua D.|author2=Krueger, Alan B.|year=1991|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=106|issue=4|pages=979–1014|via=JSTOR|doi=10.2307/2937954|jstor=2937954|s2cid=153718259}}</ref> and that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly 10% of students to stay in school who would have otherwise left.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2290263|title=The Effect of Age at School Entry on Educational Attainment: An Application of Instrumental Variables with Moments from Two Samples|author1=Angrist, Joshua D.|author2=Krueger, Alan B.|year=1992|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=87|issue=418|pages=328–336|via=JSTOR|doi=10.2307/2290263|jstor=2290263}}</ref> Another early attempt at using IV to estimate returns to schooling by Angrist and Krueger was to exploit the [[Draft lottery (1969)|Vietnam-era draft lottery]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w4067.pdf|title=Angrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (1992). Estimating the payoff to schooling using the Vietnam-era draft lottery. ''NBER Working Paper Series'', No. 4067.}}</ref> However, while their later research on split-sample IVs confirmed the findings of their compulsory schooling research, it failed to support the returns to schooling estimates derived from the draft-lottery research.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350015.1995.10524597|title=Split-Sample Instrumental Variables Estimates of the Return to Schooling|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Alan B.|last2=Krueger|date=April 1, 1995|journal=Journal of Business & Economic Statistics|volume=13|issue=2|pages=225–235|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/07350015.1995.10524597}}</ref> Angrist further used variation in U.S. compulsory schooling laws in research with [[Daron Acemoglu]] in order to estimate human-capital [[externalities]], which they found to be about 1% and not statistically significant.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/654403|title=How Large Are Human-Capital Externalities?

(1997). The Effect of a Change in Language of Instruction on the Returns to Schooling in Morocco. ''Journal of Labor Economics'', 15(1), pp. S48-S76.]</ref>

==== Research on the determinants of student learning====

Another strand of Angrist's research in the economics of education concerns the impact of various inputs and rules on learning. For instance, in further work with Lavy, Angrist exploited [[Maimonides' Rule]], which limits class size to 40 students, in order to study the impact of class size on scholastic achievement in [[Israel]]i schools, finding that class size reduction substantially increase test scores for 4th and 5th graders, albeit not for 3rd graders.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2587016|title=Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement|author1=Angrist, Joshua D.|author2=Lavy, Victor|year=1999|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=114|issue=2|pages=533–575|doi=10.1162/003355399556061|jstor=2587016|s2cid=149871459|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In further research at Israeli schools, they find that teacher training can cost-effectively improve students' test scores (at least in secular schools),<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/319564|title=Does Teacher Training Affect Pupil Learning?

===== Research on charter schools=====

Since the late 2000s, Angrist has conducted extensive research on [[charter school]]s in the U.S. with Pathak, Abdulkadiroglu, [[Susan Dynarski]], [[Thomas Kane (economist)|Thomas Kane]], and [[Christopher Walters]]. For instance, studying the [[KIPP Lynn Academy]], they estimate that KIPP Lynn attendance increased students' math scores by 0.35 SD and their [[English (language)|English]] scores by 0.12 SD,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.2.239|title=Inputs and Impacts in Charter Schools: KIPP Lynn|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Susan M.|last2=Dynarski|first3=Thomas J.|last3=Kane|first4=Parag A.|last4=Pathak|first5=Christopher R.|last5=Walters|date=May 11, 2010|journal=American Economic Review|volume=100|issue=2|pages=239–243|via=www.aeaweb.org|doi=10.1257/aer.100.2.239|hdl=1721.1/61732}}</ref> with most of the gains accruing to students with limited English proficiency or special education needs or those who scored low at baseline.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pam.21647|title=Who Benefits from KIPP?|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Susan M.|last2=Dynarski|first3=Thomas J.|last3=Kane|first4=Parag A.|last4=Pathak|first5=Christopher R.|last5=Walters|date=October 11, 2012|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=31|issue=4|pages=837–860|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/pam.21647|hdl=1721.1/73139|s2cid=376193}}</ref> Beyond KIPP Lynn, they find attendance to Boston charter schools to generally increase test scores for middle and high school students, especially for schools with binding assignment lotteries, whereas pilot schools (public schools covered by some collective bargaining provisions and more independence concerning educational policies) generally have at best statistically insignificant or small effects on students' test scores.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/126/2/699/1871552|title=Abdulkadiroglu, A. et al.

=== Labor economics===

Similar to his research on the economics of education, Angrist's research on labor economics also often seeks to exploit quasi-natural experiments to identify causal relationships. In a publication derived from his dissertation, Angrist e.g. exploits the [[Draft lottery (1969)|military draft lottery]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to estimate that fighting in [[Vietnam]] reduced veterans' lifetime earnings by about 15% relative to those of nonveterans.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2006669|title=Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social Security Administrative Records|author=Angrist, Joshua D.|year=1990|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=80|issue=3|pages=313–336|jstor=2006669|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Taking into account [[veterans' benefits]] that subsidized education and training (e.g. through the [[G.I.

=== Econometrics===

Besides his empirical research, Angrist has also made major contributions to [[econometrics]], especially concerning the use of [[instrumental variables estimation]]s. For instance, Angrist developed a [[two-stage least squares]] (2SLS) equivalent of the efficient [[Wald test|Wald estimator]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4076%2891%2990101-I|title=Grouped-data estimation and testing in simple labor-supply models|first=Joshua D.|last=Angrist|date=February 3, 1991|journal=Journal of Econometrics|volume=47|issue=2|pages=243–266|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/0304-4076(91)90101-I}}</ref> Together with [[Guido Imbens]], he developed the concept of [[local average treatment effect]]s and showed how to identify and to estimate them,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620|title=Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects|author1=Imbens, Guido W.|author2=Angrist, Joshua D.|year=1994|journal=Econometrica|volume=62|issue=2|pages=467–475|via=JSTOR|doi=10.2307/2951620|jstor=2951620|s2cid=153123153}}</ref> and how to use 2SLS to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1995.10476535|title=Two-Stage Least Squares Estimation of Average Causal Effects in Models with Variable Treatment Intensity|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Guido W.|last2=Imbens|date=June 1, 1995|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=90|issue=430|pages=431–442|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/01621459.1995.10476535}}</ref> In further work with Imbens and [[Donald Rubin]], Angrist then showed how instrumental variables can be embedded within the [[Rubin causal model]] in order to identify causal effects between variables.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2291629|title=Identification of Causal Effects Using Instrumental Variables|author1=Angrist, Joshua D.|author2=Imbens, Guido W.|author3=Rubin, Donald B.|year=1996|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=91|issue=434|pages=444–455|via=JSTOR|doi=10.2307/2291629|jstor=2291629|s2cid=8705497}}</ref> Angrist also developed with Imbens and Krueger so-called "jackknife instrumental variables estimators" to address the bias in 2SLS estimates in over-identified models<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1255%28199901/02%2914%3A1%3C57%3A%3AAID-JAE501%3E3.0.CO%3B2-G|title=Jackknife instrumental variables estimation|first1=J.

In articles with Krueger as well as with Jorn-Steffen Pischke in the ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'', Angrist has repeatedly made the case for a focus on the identification of causality in economics, e.g. using instrumental variables;<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.15.4.69|title=Instrumental Variables and the Search for Identification: From Supply and Demand to Natural Experiments|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Alan B.|last2=Krueger|date=December 11, 2001|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=15|issue=4|pages=69–85|via=www.aeaweb.org|doi=10.1257/jep.15.4.69}}</ref> in particular, Angrist has argued in 2010 in response to [[Edward Leamer]]'s 1983 critique of econometrics that microeconomics had experienced since then a "[[credibility revolution]]" thanks to substantial improvements in empirical research designs and renewed attention to causal relationships.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.3|title=The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics: How Better Research Design Is Taking the Con out of Econometrics|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Jörn-Steffen|last2=Pischke|date=June 11, 2010|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=24|issue=2|pages=3–30|via=www.aeaweb.org|doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.3}}</ref>

== Honors and awards ==

Angrist is a Research Fellow at the [[Institute for the Study of Labor]] (IZA). He is also a fellow of the [[Econometric Society]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2006.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}</ref> In 2007 Angrist received an honorary doctorate in Economics from the [[University of St. Gallen]]. He is the recipient of the 2011 [[John von Neumann Award]] given annually by the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]] in Budapest.

Angrist, along with [[Guido Imbens]], won the 2021 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]].<ref>https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/sarah-and-stan-angrist-on-how-to-raise-a-nobel-prize-winner/</ref> The two men received one-half of the prize money of 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.14 million U.S.); the rest went to the other winner, [[David Card]].<ref>https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/former-pittsburgher-awarded-nobel-prize-in-economics/</ref> The [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] wrote that:
<blockquote>
Data from a natural experiment are difficult to interpret . . . . For example, extending compulsory education by 
a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of  education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.<ref name=Nobel_Press_Release/>
