Berger used expectation states theory as an exemplar of [[axiomatic system|formal (or axiomatic) theory construction]], for whose wider adoption among sociologists he advocated. Formal theories are logically related sets of statements from which a scientist can [[logical deduction|logically deduce]] hypotheses (e.g., if A → B and B → C, then A → C). Formal theorists then lay out the precise conditions under which their predictions do and do not apply. This contrasts with the norm in sociological theorizing, which is less explicit in its definitions, predictions, and scope.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=David G.|last2=Berger|first2=Joseph|title=Do Sociological Theories Grow|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1985|volume=90|issue=4|pages=697–728|jstor=2779516|doi=10.1086/228142}}</ref>

He is currently a [[Professor Emeritus]] at [[Stanford University]] and a senior fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]].

==Biography==
A native of [[Brooklyn]], he was educated at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] and [[Brooklyn College]]. After earning his [[doctoral degree]] in sociology at [[Harvard University]] in the 1950s, where he had been taught by [[Talcott Parsons]], he established a theoretical and experimental research program at Stanford. The program, [[expectation states theory]], has many branches and through his mentorship of generations of [[graduate student]]s, this program has been a unique example of the growth of knowledge in sociology through chains of theory development accompanied by experimental tests and refinements.

His expertise is in the area of status processes and status relations among members of different groups, processes of legitimation, reward expectations and [[distributive justice]], and theory construction in the [[behavioral science]]s. His current research focuses on gender relations in interpersonal settings, status characteristics theory, and cumulative theory in [[social science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/bios/berger.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131220412/http://www.hoover.org/bios/berger.html |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}</ref>

Berger, along with collaborators, has edited a large number of books to which invited scholars have contributed papers that elaborate upon one or another "[[sociological theory]] in progress."

Berger is a recipient of the Cooley-Mead Award from the [[American Sociological Association]] to honor long-term distinguished contributions to the intellectual and scientific advancement of [[social psychology]]. In 2007, he received the [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] Award for his contributions to the field of sociology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/bios/berger.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131220412/http://www.hoover.org/bios/berger.html |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}</ref>
