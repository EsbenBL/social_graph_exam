==Early years==
Born in [[Philadelphia]], he attended the [[University of Minnesota]], Class of 1932, where he was a member of the [[Chi Phi Fraternity]].  After receiving his degree in psychology a year of graduate work at the University of Minnesota, he began graduate studies in economics at [[The University of Chicago]] in 1933, where he began what would prove to be lifelong friendships with [[Milton Friedman]], [[Aaron Director]] and [[George Stigler]].

In 1936–37, he served as an economist and statistician for the National Resources Committee. During [[World War II]], Wallis was the director of research of the U.S. [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]]'s [[Statistical Research Group]] (1942–46) at [[Columbia University]]; he recruited a team of bright young economists, including  Friedman and Stigler, to the Statistical Research Group.

From 1948 to 1954, Wallis served as the treasurer of the [[Mont Pèlerin Society]].<ref>R. M. Hartwell, ''A History of the Mont Pelerin Society'', Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1995, pp. 66–7.</ref>
