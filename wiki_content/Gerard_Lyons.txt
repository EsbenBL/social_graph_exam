Prior to this Lyons reinforced his own reputation as an accurate forecaster with being one of two British economists predicting in August 2008, a month before Lehman Brothers collapsed, a deep imminent recession.<ref name="Recession Forecast">{{cite report |title=boris johnson snaps up lyons|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/boris-johnson-snaps-up-lyons-from-standard-chartered-8405995.html}}</ref> He anticipated a GDP fall of 1.6% for the third quarter of 2008 when the consensus predicted a rise of 0.9%.<ref name="Recession Forecast2">{{cite report |title=gerard lyons interview|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/gerard-lyons-interview-the-key-boris-adviser-who-likes-to-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life-9815685.html}}</ref> Other accurate contrarian calls include correctly predicting that the [[Lawson Boom]] would end in a bust, as well arguing for the economic benefits of leaving the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. <ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/08/must-close-pessimism-gap-boris-favourite-gerard-lyons-bank-england]/</ref> Regarding the latter, Lyons wrote in [[The Observer]] in 1992 that “[S]omething will have to give: either the government’s exchange-rate commitment or the economy,” and he has called the euro “probably the worst economic idea ever thought up by anyone anywhere at any time”. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/08/01/what-makes-boris-johnsons-favourite-economist-tick|title = What makes Boris Johnson's favourite economist tick?|newspaper = The Economist|date = August 2019}}</ref>

==Public sector career==

On 11 December 2012, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]], announced that Lyons was to join his team as his Chief Economic Adviser.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-hires-city-veteran-gerard-lyons-to-tackle-emerging-dilemma-phnbj8rvpcn|title=Boris Johnson hires City veteran Gerard Lyons to tackle emerging dilemma|first=Sam|last=Fleming|date=11 December 2012|access-date=3 June 2019|work=The Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk//press-releases-4698|title=Top City economist appointed to direct Mayor's economic strategy|date=11 December 2012|website=London City Hall|access-date=3 June 2019}}</ref> During his first term, Lyons had been a member of Johnson's informal panel of economic and business advisers, speaking at a number of events at City Hall on London's global position during the term of the previous Mayor, [[Ken Livingstone]].<ref name="Lyons moves from City to City Hall to advise Boris">{{cite web |last1=Goodway |first1=Nick |title=Lyons moves from City to City Hall to advise Boris |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/lyons-moves-from-city-to-city-hall-to-advise-boris-8399793.html |work=The Independent |date=10 December 2012 |access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref> He began the role a month later in January 2013 and left in April 2016, at the conclusion of the Mayor's term. While at City Hall Lyons  championed the London living wage, co-chaired, with [[Munira Mirza]], the London Strategic Migration Partnership Panel, represented the Mayor on the Board of City UK and sat as a member of the GLA's Investment Performance Board<ref name="Raising the capital - Gerard Lyons">{{cite report |title=Raising the capital |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/Raising%20the%20capital_0.pdf |publisher=London Finance Commission}}</ref> and gave testimony to the Commission's second report, in 2016.<ref name="Devolution: a capital idea">{{cite report |title=Devolution: a capital idea |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/devolution_-_a_capital_idea_lfc_2017.pdf |publisher=London Finance Commission |access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref>

Because of his connection with Johnson and knowledge of emerging economies, he was considered for the 2019 appointment of [[Governor of the Bank of England]].<ref name="Guardian1" />
