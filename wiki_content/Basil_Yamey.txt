'''Basil Selig Yamey''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (4 May 1919 – 9 November 2020) was a South African economist and expert in the [[history of accounting]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Christopher J Napier | title=''Vale'' Basil S. Yamey | journal=Accounting History | volume=26 | issue=2 | pages=332-335 | url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10323732211009907}}</ref>

==Career==
He was born in [[Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]] in May 1919,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hshtAAAAMAAJ&q=Basil+S.+Yamey+May+4,+1919&dq=Basil+S.+Yamey+May+4,+1919&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwit2PnQx4LiAhUJKVAKHZpEA4wQ6AEIIzAA Profile of Basil Yamey]</ref> and educated at the [[University of Cape Town]]. For many years he was a Professor at the [[London School of Economics]]. He was a part-time member of the [[Competition Commission|Monopolies and Mergers Commission]] from 1966 to 1978, and author of many books and articles, including one on the economics of underdeveloped countries co-authored with [[Peter Thomas Bauer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World Connect|url=http://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:a43826&id=I372|access-date=22 August 2013}}</ref>

Yamey's interest in rational economic decision-making led him to study historical [[accounting]] records. Yamey rejected the claim by [[Werner Sombart]] that the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]] was a pre-condition, or at least an important stimulating factor, for the emergence of modern [[capitalism]].  Yamey combined his interest in [[Accounting History]] with his love of art (he was a trustee of the [[National Gallery, London]] from 1974 to 1981 and of the [[Tate Gallery]], London from 1978 to 1981) in his book ''Art & Accounting'', a richly-illustrated survey of paintings portraying commercial scenes and business-people. He died in November 2020 at the age of 101.<ref>[https://iea.org.uk/a-trip-down-memory-lane/ A trip down memory lane]</ref>
