He graduated in 1962 from the [[Nederlands Lyceum]] in The Hague and received a master's degree in [[sociology]] (specializing in public management) from [[Erasmus University]] in [[Rotterdam]] (1969). Subsequently, he completed a PhD in the [[Social Sciences]] also at Erasmus, with a dissertation on "The Condition of Happiness". He was also registered as a social-sexologist (1994–2000).<ref name=Autobiography>{{cite book|last=Deflem|first=Mathieu|title=Sociologists in a global Age: Biographical Perspectives|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham|isbn=978-0754670377|pages=175–186|url=http://www2.eur.nl/fsw/research/veenhoven/Pub2000s/2007c-full.pdf}}</ref>

* Main findings are:
** Happiness is universal. All humans tend to assess how much they like the life they live and conditions for happiness are quite similar. Yet there is some cultural variation in beliefs about happiness. Happiness draws on gratification of universal needs, rather than on meeting culturally relative wants.<ref name="Research paper">{{cite journal|last=Veenhoven|first=Ruut|title=Is happiness relative|journal=Social Indicators Research|date=February 1991|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–34|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/soinre/v24y1991i1p1-34.html|access-date=16 April 2013|doi=10.1007/bf00292648|hdl=1765/16148|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

** Greater happiness of a greater number is possible in contemporary societies and can be ‘engineered’, among other things in the following ways:<ref name="book chapter">{{cite book|last=Sheldon|first=Kennon M.|title=Designing Positive Psychology: Taking Stock and Moving Forward'|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-537358-5|pages=396–409|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/Clinical/?view=usa&ci=9780195373585}}</ref>
