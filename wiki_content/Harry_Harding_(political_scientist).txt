==Biography==
Dr. Harding was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1946. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in public and international affairs in 1967 from [[Princeton University]], and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1969) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1974) in political science from [[Stanford University]].

Dr. Harding served on the political science faculties of [[Swarthmore College]] (1970–71) and Stanford University (1971–83) and was a National Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]]. He then became Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the [[Brookings Institution]] (1983–94), and, later, Dean of the [[Elliott School of International Affairs]] at [[George Washington University]], a post he held for more than 10 years (January 1995 – June 30, 2005). Dr. Harding is widely credited for making the Elliott School an internationally competitive graduate program. Upon his retirement from that post, Harding accepted a University Professorship at the School. On August 1, 2005, Harding joined [[Eurasia Group]], a global political risk consultancy, as the firm's Director of Research and Analysis. He is currently a Senior Advisor at the firm.

In 2007, he returned to Elliott School of International Affairs as University Professor of International Affairs at the Sigur Center. He left the Elliott School effective July 1, 2009 to become the founding dean of the [[Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy]] at the [[University of Virginia]].<ref name="batten-school">{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=7633 |work=UVA Today |title=Harry Harding, Political and Policy Expert, Named Founding Dean of U.Va.'s Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2009-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121215115355/http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=7633 |archivedate=2012-12-15 }}</ref>
