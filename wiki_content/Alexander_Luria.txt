'''Alexander Romanovich Luria''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Рома́нович Лу́рия|p=ˈlurʲɪjə}}; 16 July 1902&nbsp;– 14 August 1977) was a Soviet [[neuropsychology|neuropsychologist]], often credited as a father of modern [[neuropsychological assessment]]. He developed an extensive and original battery of neuropsychological tests during his clinical work with brain-injured victims of [[World War II]], which are still used in various forms. He made an in-depth analysis of the functioning of various brain regions and integrative processes of the brain in general. Luria's magnum opus, ''Higher Cortical Functions in Man'' (1962), is a much-used psychological textbook which has been translated into many languages and which he supplemented with ''The Working Brain'' in 1973.

It is less known that Luria's main interests, before the war, were in the field of psycho-semantics (that is, research into how people attribute meaning to words and instructions). He became famous for his studies of low-educated populations in the south of the [[Soviet Union]] showing that they use different categorization than the educated world (determined by functionality of their tools).<ref name="Homskaya, p. 25">Homskaya, p. 25.</ref> He was one of the founders of [[Cultural-historical psychology|Cultural-Historical Psychology]], and a leader of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], also known as "Vygotsky-Luria Circle".<ref name="revBook"/><ref name="vygRevisitado"/> Apart from his work with Vygotsky, Luria is widely known for two extraordinary psychological case studies: ''The Mind of a Mnemonist'', about [[Solomon Shereshevsky]], who had highly advanced memory; and ''The Man with a Shattered World'', about [[Lev Zasetsky]], a man with a severe [[traumatic brain injury]].

During his career Luria worked in a wide range of scientific fields at such institutions as the Academy of Communist Education (1920-1930s), Experimental Defectological Institute (1920-1930s, 1950-1960s, both in Moscow), Ukrainian Psychoneurological Academy ([[Kharkiv]], early 1930s), All-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine, and the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery (late 1930s). A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Luria as the 69th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| display-authors= 8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913 |s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

== Life and career ==
<!------------We cannot have such a large prosaic piece verbatim. Needs to be rephrased:
'''The following is cited from [http://luria.ucsd.edu/bio.html ''A.R. Luria Biography by Michael Cole'']'''
Alexander Luria was born in [[Kazan]], an old Russian University town east of Moscow. He entered [[Kazan University]] at the age of 16 and obtained his degree in 1921 at the age of 19. He studied in this period under the logician [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]], who also taught psychology at the same university. While still a student, he established the Kazan Psychoanalytic Association, and planned on a career in psychology.  His earliest research sought to establish objective methods for assessing [[Freud]]ian ideas about abnormalities of thought and the effects of fatigue on mental processes.

In 1923 his use of reaction time measures to study [[thought|thought processes]] in the context of work settings won him a position at the Institute of Psychology in Moscow where he developed a psychodiagnostic procedure he referred to as the "combined motor method" for diagnosing individual subjects' thought processes. In this method (described in detail in Luria, 1932), subjects are asked to carry out three tasks simultaneously. One hand is to be held steady while the other is used to press a key or squeeze a rubber bulb in response to verbal stimuli presented by the experimenter, to which the subject is asked to respond verbally with the first word to come to mind. Preliminary trials are presented until a steady baseline of coordination is established. At this point, "critical" stimuli which the experimenter believes to be related to specific thoughts in the subject are presented. Evidence for the ability to "read the subject's mind" is the selective disruption of the previously established coordinated system by the critical test stimuli. This method was applied to a variety of naturally occurring and experimentally induced cases, providing a model system for psychodiagnosis that won widespread attention in the west when it was published. The book describing these studies was published in Russian only in 2002, owing to its association with psychoanalytic theorizing which was disapproved of by Soviet authorities.

In 1924 Luria met Lev Semionovich Vygotsky, whose influence was decisive in shaping his future career. Together with Vygotsky and Alexei Nikolaivitch Leontiev, Luria sought to establish an approach to psychology that would enable them to "discover the way natural processes such as physical maturation and sensory mechanisms become intertwined with culturally determined processes to produce the psychological functions of adults" (Luria, 1979, p. 43). Vygotsky and his colleagues referred to this new approach variably as "cultural," "historical," and "instrumental" psychology. These three labels all index the centrality of cultural mediation in the constitution of specifically human psychological processes, and the role of the social environment in structuring the processes by which children appropriate the cultural tools of their society in the process of ontogeny. An especially heavy emphasis was placed on the role of language, the "tool of tools" in this process: the acquisition of language was seen as the pivotal moment when phylogeny and cultural history are merged to form specifically human forms of thought, feeling, and action.

From the late 1920s until his death, Luria sought to elaborate this synthetic, cultural-historical psychology in different content areas of psychology. In the early 1930s he led two expeditions to Central Asia where he investigated changes in perception, problem solving, and memory associated with historical changes in economic activity and schooling. During this same period he carried out studies of identical and fraternal twins raised in a large residential school to reveal the dynamic relations between phylogenetic and cultural-historical factors in the development of language and thought.

In the late 1930s, largely to remove himself from public view owing to the period of purges initiated by Stalin, Luria entered medical school where he specialized in the study of aphasia, retaining his focus on the relation between language and thought in a politically neutral arena. The onset of World War 2 made his specialized knowledge of crucial importance to the Soviet war effort, and the tragic widespread availability of people with various forms of traumatic brain injury provided him with voluminous materials for developing his theories of brain function and methods for the remediation of focal brain lesions. It was during this period that he developed the systematic approach to brain and cognition which has come to be known as the discipline of neuropsychology. Central to his approach was the belief that "to understand the brain foundations for psychological activity, one must be prepared to study both the brain and the system of activity" (1979, p. 173). This insistence on linking brain structure and function to the proximal, culturally organized, environment provides the thread of continuity between the early and later parts of Luria's career.

Following the war Luria sought to continue his work in neuropsychology. His plans were interrupted for several years when he was removed from the Institute of Neurosurgery during a period of particularly virulent anti-semitic repression. During this time he pursued his scientific interests through a series of studies of the development of language and thought in mentally retarded children.

In the late 1950s Luria was permitted to return to the study of neuropsychology, which he pursued until his death of heart failure in 1977. In the years just prior to his death, he returned to earliest dreams of constructing a unified psychology. He published two case studies, one of a man with an exceptional and idiosyncratic memory (Luria, 1968), the other of a man who suffered a traumatic brain injury (Luria, 1972). These two case studies illustrate his blend of classical, experimental approaches with clinical and remediational approach, a synthesis that stands as a model for late 20th Century cognitive science.

===Early life and childhood===
Luria was born to Jewish parents in [[Kazan]], a regional center east of [[Moscow]]. Many of his family were in medicine. According to Luria's biographer Evgenia Homskaya, his father, Roman Albertovich Luria "worked as a professor at the [[University of Kazan]]; and after the Russian Revolution, he became a founder and chief of the Kazan institute of Advanced Medical Education."<ref>Evgenia Homskaya (2001). ''Alexander Romanovich Luria: A Scientific Biography'', Plenum Publishers, New York, NY, p. 9.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kostyanaya |first1=Maria |last2=Rossouw |first2=Pieter |title=Alexander Luria: Life, research & contribution to neuroscience |journal=The Neuropsychotherapist |date=October 9, 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=47–55 |doi=10.12744/ijnpt.2013.0047-0055 }}</ref> Two monographs of his father's writings were published in Russian under the titles, ''Stomach and Gullet Illnesses'' (1935) and ''Inside Look at Illness and Gastrogenic Diseases'' (1935).<ref>Homskaya, p. 9.</ref> His mother, Evgenia Viktorovna Haskin (maiden name), became a practicing dentist after finishing college in [[Poland]]. Luria was one of two children; his younger sister Lydia became a practicing psychiatrist.<ref>Homskaya, pp. 9-10.</ref>

===Early education and move to Moscow===
Luria finished school ahead of schedule and completed his first degree in 1921 at [[Kazan State University]]. While still a student in Kazan, he established the Kazan Psychoanalytic Society and briefly exchanged letters with [[Sigmund Freud]]. Late in 1923, he moved to Moscow, where he lived on [[Arbat Street]]. His parents later followed him and settled down nearby. In Moscow, Luria was offered a position at the Moscow State Institute of Experimental Psychology, run from November 1923 by Konstantin Kornilov.

In 1924, Luria met [[Lev Vygotsky]],<ref name="bioBook"/> who would influence him greatly. The union of the two psychologists gave birth to what subsequently was termed the Vygotsky, or more precisely, the [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky-Luria Circle]]. During the 1920s Luria also met a large number of scholars, including [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]], Mark Lebedinsky, [[Alexander Zaporozhets]], [[Bluma Zeigarnik]], many of whom would remain his lifelong colleagues. Following Vygotsky and along with him, in mid-1920s Luria launched a project of developing a psychology of a radically new kind. This approach fused "cultural", "historical", and "instrumental" psychology and is most commonly referred to presently as [[cultural-historical psychology]]. It emphasizes the mediatory role of culture, particularly [[language]], in the development of higher psychological functions in [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogeny]].

Independently of Vygotsky, Luria developed the ingenious "combined motor method," which helped diagnose individuals' hidden or subdued emotional and [[thought process]]es. This research was published in the US in 1932 as ''The Nature of Human Conflicts'' and made him internationally famous as one of the leading psychologists in Soviet Russia. In 1937, Luria submitted the manuscript in Russian and defended it as a doctoral dissertation at the University of Tbilisi (not published in Russian until 2002).

Luria wrote three books during the 1920s after moving to Moscow, ''The Nature of Human Conflicts'' (in Russian, but during Luria's lifetime published only in English translation in 1932 in the US), ''Speech and Intellect in Child Development'', and ''Speech and Intellect of Urban, Rural and Homeless Children'' (both in Russian). The second title came out in 1928, while the other two were published in the 1930s.

In early 1930s both Luria and Vygotsky started their medical studies in Kharkov, then, after Vygotsky's death in 1934, Luria completed his medical education at [[Moscow Medical Academy|1st Moscow Medical Institute]].

===Multiculturalism and neurology===
The 1930s were significant to Luria because his studies of indigenous people opened the field of multiculturalism to his general interests.<ref name="Homskaya, p. 25"/> This interest would be revived in the later twentieth century by a variety of scholars and researchers who began studying and defending indigenous peoples throughout the world. Luria's work continued in this field with expeditions to [[Central Asia]]. Under the supervision of Vygotsky, Luria investigated various psychological changes (including perception, problem solving, and memory) that take place as a result of cultural development of undereducated minorities. In this regard he has been credited with a major contribution to the study of [[orality]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Walter J. |last=Ong |title=Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word |edition=Second |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |year=2002 |pages=49–54 |isbn=978-0415281294 }}</ref>

In response to [[Lysenkoism]]'s purge of geneticists,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ing |first1=Simon |title=Stalin and the Scientists: A History of Triumph and Tragedy, 1905-1953 |date=February 21, 2017 |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |isbn=978-0-8021-8986-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYz1DAAAQBAJ&q=Elena+Alexandrovna+Luria+memoir+accused&pg=PT117 |access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=citing the memoir of Luria's daughter Elena Alexandrovna, 'I was accused of all mortal sins, right down to racism, and I was forced to leave the Institute of Psychology.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=LURIA, ALEXANDER ROMANOVICH |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/psychology-and-psychiatry-biographies/alexander-romanovich-luria |website=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |access-date=22 June 2018}}</ref> Luria decided to pursue a physician degree, which he completed with honors in the summer of 1937. After rewriting and reorganizing his manuscript for ''The Nature of Human Conflicts'', he defended it for a doctoral dissertation at the Institute of Tbilisi in 1937, and was appointed Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences. "At the age of thirty-four, he was one of the youngest professors of psychology in the country."<ref>Homskaya, p. 31.</ref> In 1933, Luria married Lana P. Lipchina, a well-known specialist in microbiology with a doctorate in the biological sciences.<ref name="Homskaya, p. 33">Homskaya, p. 33.</ref> The couple lived in Moscow on Frunze Street, where their only daughter Lena (Elena) was born.<ref name="Homskaya, p. 33"/>

Luria also studied [[identical twin|identical]] and [[fraternal twin|fraternal]] [[twin]]s in large residential [[school]]s to determine the interplay of various factors of cultural and genetic human development. In his early neuropsychological work in the end of the 1930s as well as throughout his postwar academic life he focused on the study of [[aphasia]], focusing on the relation between language, thought, and cortical functions, particularly on the development of compensatory functions for aphasia.

===World War II and aftermath===
For Luria, the war with Germany that ended in 1945 resulted in a number of significant developments for the future of his career in both psychology and neurology. He was appointed Doctor of Medical Sciences in 1943 and Professor in 1944. Of specific importance for Luria was that he was assigned by the government to care for nearly 800 hospitalized patients suffering from traumatic brain injury caused by the war.<ref name="Homskaya, p. 36">Homskaya, p. 36.</ref> Luria's treatment methods dealt with a wide range of emotional and intellectual dysfunctions.<ref name="Homskaya, p. 36"/> He kept meticulous notes on these patients, and discerned from them three possibilities for functional recovery: "(1) disinhibition of a temporarily blocked function; (2) involvement of the vicarious potential of the opposite hemisphere; and (3) reorganization of the function system", which he described in a book titled ''Functional Recovery From Military Brain Wounds'', (Moscow, 1948, Russian only.) A second book titled ''Traumatic Aphasia'' was written in 1947 in which "Luria formulated an original conception of the neural organization of speech and its disorders (aphasias) that differed significantly from the existing western conceptions about aphasia."<ref>Homskaya, p. 38.</ref> Soon after the end of the war, Luria was assigned a permanent position in General Psychology at the central [[Moscow State University]] in General Psychology, where he would predominantly stay for the remainder of his life; he was instrumental in the foundation of the [[MSU Faculty of Psychology|Faculty of Psychology]], and later headed the Departments of Patho- and Neuropsychology. By 1946, his father, the chief of the gastroenterological clinics at Botkin Hospital, had died of stomach cancer. His mother survived several more years, dying in 1950.<ref>Homskaya, p. 39.</ref>

===1950s===
Following the war, Luria continued his work in Moscow's Institute of Psychology. For a period of time he was removed from the Institute of Psychology, and in the 1950s he shifted to research on [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] children at the Defectological Institute. Here he did his most pioneering research in child psychology, and was able to permanently disassociate himself from the influence that was then still exerted in the Soviet Union by [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s early research.<ref>Homskaya, pp. 41–42.</ref> Luria said publicly that his own interests were limited to a specific examination of "Pavlov's second signal system" and did not concern Pavlov's simplified primary explanation of human behavior as based on a "conditioned reflex by means of positive reinforcement".<ref>Homskaya, p. 42.</ref> Luria's continued interest in the regulative function of speech was further revisited in the mid-1950s and was summarized in his 1957 monograph titled ''The Role of Speech in the Regulation of Normal and Abnormal Behavior''. In this book Luria summarized his principal concerns in this field through three succinct points summarized by Homskaya as: "(1) the role of speech in the development of mental processes; (2) the development of the regulative function of speech; and (3) changes in the regulative functions of speech caused by various brain pathologies."<ref name="Homskaya, p. 48">Homskaya, p. 48.</ref>

Luria's main contributions to child psychology during the 1950s are well summarized by the research collected in a two-volume compendium of collected research published in Moscow in 1956 and 1958 under the title of ''Problems of Higher Nervous System Activity in Normal and Anomalous Children''. Homskaya summarizes Luria's approach as centering on: "The application of the Method of Motor Associations (which) allowed investigators to reveal difficulties experienced by (unskilled) children in the process of forming conditioned links as well as restructuring and compensating by means of speech ... (Unskilled) children demonstrated acute dysfunction of the generalizing and regulating functions of speech."<ref>Homskaya, p. 46.</ref> Taking this direction, already by the mid-1950s, "Luria for the first time proposed his ideas about the differences of neurodynamic processes in different functional systems, primarily in verbal and motor systems."<ref>Homskaya, p. 45.</ref> Luria identified the three stages of language development in children in terms of "the formation of the mechanisms of voluntary actions: actions in the absence of a regulative verbal influence, actions with a nonspecific influence, and, finally, actions with a selective verbal influence."<ref name="Homskaya, p. 48"/> For Luria, "The regulating function of speech thus appears as a main factor in the formation of voluntary behavior&nbsp;... at first, the activating function is formed, and then the inhibitory, regulatory function."<ref>Homskaya, p. 47.</ref>

===Cold War===
In the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, Luria's career expanded significantly with the publication of several new books. Of special note was the publication in 1962 of ''Higher Cortical Functions in Man and Their Impairment Caused by Local Brain Damage''. The book has been translated into multiple foreign languages and has been recognized as the principal book establishing Neuropsychology as a medical discipline in its own right.<ref>Homskaya, p. 55.</ref> Previously, at the end of the 1950s, Luria's charismatic presence at international conferences had attracted almost worldwide attention to his research, which created a receptive medical audience for the book.

Luria's other books written or co-authored during the 1960s included: ''Higher Brain and Mental Processes'' (1963), ''The Neuropsychological Analysis of Problem Solving'' (1966, with L. S. Tzvetkova; English translation in 1990), ''Psychophysiology of the Frontal Lobes'' (first published in 1973), and ''Memory Disorders in Patients with Aneurysms of the Anterior Communicating Artery'' (co-authored with A. N. Konovalov and A. N. Podgoynaya). In studying memory disorders, Luria oriented his research to the distinction of long-term memory, short-term memory, and semantic memory. It was important for Luria to differentiate neuropsychological pathologies of memory from neuropsychological pathologies of intellectual operations.<ref>Homskaya, p. 61.</ref> These two types of pathology were often characterized by Luria as; "(1) the inability to make particular arithmetical operations while the general control of intellectual activity remained normal (predominantly occipital disturbances)... (2) the disability of general control over intellectual processes (predominantly frontal lobe disturbances."<ref>Homskaya, p. 62.</ref> Another of Luria important book-length studies from the 1960s which would only be published in 1975 (and in English in 1976) was his well-received book titled ''Basic Problems of Neurolinguistics''.

===Late writings===
Luria's productive rate of writing new books in psychology remained largely undiminished during the 1970s and the last seven years of his life. Significantly, volume two of his ''Human Brain and Mental Processes'' appeared in 1970 under the title ''Neuropsychological Analysis of Conscious Activity'', following the first volume from 1963 titled ''The Brain and Psychological Processes''. The volume confirmed Luria's long sustained interest in studying the pathology of [[frontal lobe]] damage as compromising the seat of higher-order voluntary and intentional planning. ''Psychopathology of the Frontal Lobes'', co-edited with Karl Pribram, was published in 1973.

Luria published his well-known book ''The Working Brain'' in 1973 as a concise adjunct volume to his 1962 book ''Higher Cortical Functions in Man''. In this volume, Luria summarized his three-part global theory of the working brain as being composed of three constantly co-active processes, which he described as:
# the attentional (sensory-processing) system
# the mnestic-programming system
# the energetic maintenance system, with two levels: cortical and limbic

This model was later used as a structure of the [[Functional Ensemble of Temperament]] model matching functionality of [[neurotransmitter]] systems. The two books together are considered by Homskaya as "among Luria's major works in neuropsychology, most fully reflecting all the aspects (theoretical, clinical, experimental) of this new discipline."<ref>Homskaya, pp. 70-71.</ref>

Among his late writings are also two extended case studies directed toward the popular press and a general readership, in which he presented some of the results of major advances in the field of [[clinical neuropsychology]]. These two books are among his most popular writings. According to [[Oliver Sacks]], in these works "science became poetry".<ref>[[Michiko Kakutani]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/arts/oliver-sacks-wrote-awakenings-and-cast-light-on-the-interconnectedness-of-life.html "Oliver Sacks, Casting Light on the Interconnectedness of Life"], ''The New York Times'', 30 August 2015.</ref>
# In ''The Mind of a Mnemonist'' (1968), Luria studied [[Solomon Shereshevskii]], a [[Russia]]n journalist with a seemingly unlimited memory, sometimes referred to in contemporary literature as "flashbulb" memory, in part due to his fivefold [[synesthesia]]. 
#In ''The Man with the Shattered World'' (1971) he documented the recovery under his treatment of the soldier [[Lev Zasetsky]], who had suffered a brain wound in World War II.

In 1974 and 1976, Luria presented successively his two-volume research study titled ''The Neuropsychology of Memory''. The first volume was titled ''Memory Dysfunctions Caused by Local Brain Damage'' and the second ''Memory Dysfunctions Caused by Damage to Deep Cerebral Structures''. Luria's book written in the 1960s titled ''Basic Problems of Neurolinguistics'' was finally published in 1975, and was matched by his last book, ''Language and Cognition'', published posthumously in 1980.<!-- Can't be 1970; first English ed. 1981, am I correct Russian was 1980? --> Luria's last co-edited book, with Homskaya, was titled ''Problems of Neuropsychology'' and appeared in 1977.<ref>Homskaya, p. 77.</ref> In it, Luria was critical of simplistic models of behaviorism and indicated his preference for the position of "Anokhin's concept of 'functional systems,' in which the reflex arc is substituted by the notion of a 'reflex ring' with a feedback loop."<ref name="Homskaya, p. 79">Homskaya, p. 79.</ref> In this approach, the classical physiology of reflexes was to be downplayed while the "physiology of activity" as described by Bernshtein was to be emphasized concerning the active character of human active functioning.<ref name="Homskaya, p. 79"/>

Luria's death is recorded by Homskaya in the following words: "On June 1, 1977, the All-Union Psychological Congress started its work in Moscow. As its organizer, Luria introduced the section on neuropsychology. The next day's meeting, however, he was not able to attend. His wife Lana Pimenovna, who was extremely sick, had an operation on June 2. During the following two and a half months of his life, Luria did everything possible to save or at least to soothe his wife. Not being able to comply with this task, he dies of a [[Myocardial infarction]] on August 14. His funeral was attended by an endless number of people -- psychologists, teachers, doctors, and just friends. His wife died six months later."<ref>Homskaya, p. 82.</ref>

== Main areas of research ==

In her biography of Luria, Homskaya summarized the six main areas of Luria's research over his lifetime in accordance with the following outline: (1) The Socio-historical Determination of the Human Psyche, (2) The Biological (Genetic) Determination of the Human Psyche, (3) Higher Psychological Functions Mediated by Signs-Symbols; The Verbal System as the Main System of Signs (along with Luria's well-known three-part differentiation of it), (4) The Systematic Organization of Psychological Functions and Consciousness (along with Luria's well-known four-part outline of this), (5) Cerebral Mechanisms of the Mind (Brain and Psyche); Links between Psychology and Physiology, and (6) The Relationship between Theory and Practice.<ref>Homskaya, Chapter VIII, pp. 82–101.</ref>

== Principal research trends ==

As examples of the vigorous growth of new research related to Luria's original research during his own lifetime are the fields of linguistic aphasia, anterior lobe pathology, speech dysfunction, and child neuropsychology.

===Linguistic aphasia===
Luria's neuropsychological theory of language and speech distinguished clearly between the phases that separate inner language within the individual consciousness and spoken language intended for communication between individuals intersubjectively. It was of special significance for Luria not only to distinguish the sequential phases required to get from inner language to serial speech, but also to emphasize the difference of encoding of subjective inner thought as it develops into intersubjective speech. This was in contrast to the decoding of spoken speech as it is communicated from other individuals and decoded into subjectively understood inner language.<ref name="ReferenceA">Luria, Alexander. ''Neuropsychology of Neurolinguistics''.</ref> In the case of the encoding of inner language, Luria expressed these successive phases as moving first from inner language to semantic set representations, then to deep semantic structures, then to deep syntactic structures, then to serial surface speech. For the encoding of serial speech, the phases remained the same, though the decoding was oriented in the opposite direction of transitions between the distinct phases.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Anterior (frontal) lobes===
Luria's studies of the frontal lobes were concentrated in five principal areas: (1) attention, (2) memory, (3) intellectual activity, (4)emotional reactions, and (5) voluntary movements. Luria's main books for investigation of these functions of the frontal lobes are titled, (a) ''The Frontal Lobes'' (1966), ''Problems of Neuropsychology'' (1977), and (c)  ''Functions of the Frontal Lobes (1982, posthumously published).

===Speech dysfunction===
Luria's research on speech dysfunction was principally in the areas of (1) expressive speech, (2) impressive speech, (3) memory, (4) intellectual activity, and (5) personality.<ref>Homskaya, closing chapter.</ref>

===Child neuropsychology===
This field was formed largely based upon Luria's books and writings on neuropsychology integrated during his experiences during the war years and later periods. In the area of child neuropsychology, "The need for its creation was dictated by the fact that children with localized brain damage were found to reveal specific different features of dissolution of psychological functions. Under Luria's supervision, his colleague Simernitskaya began to study nonverbal (visual-spatial) and verbal functions, and demonstrated that damage to the left and right hemispheres provoked different types of dysfunctions in children than in adults. This study initiated a number of systematic investigations concerning changes in the localization of higher psychological functions during the process of development."<ref name="Homskaya, p. 108">Homskaya, p. 108.</ref> Luria's general research was mostly centered on the treatment and rehabilitation "of speech, and observations concerning direct and spontaneous rehabilitation were generalized."<ref name="Homskaya, p. 108"/> Other areas involving "Luria's works have made a significant contribution in the sphere of rehabilitation of expressive and impressive speech (Tzvetkova, 1972), 1985), memory (Krotkova, 1982), intellectual activity (Tzvetkova, 1975), and personality (Glozman, 1987) in patients with localized brain damage."<ref name="Homskaya, p. 108"/>

== Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological test ==
{{main article|Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological battery}}

The Luria-Nebraska is a standardized test based on Luria's theories regarding neuropsychological functioning. Luria was not part of the team that originally standardized this test; he was only indirectly referenced by other researchers as a scholar who had published relevant results in the field of neuropsychology. Anecdotally, when Luria first had the battery described to him he commented that he had expected that someone would eventually do something like this with his original research.
