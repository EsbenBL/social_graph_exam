==Early life==
Barry Wellman was born and raised in the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] and [[Fordham Road]] area of the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]]. He attended P.S. 33 and Creston J.H.S. 79, and was a [[teenage]] member of the [[Bronx gangs (1950s-1960s)|Fordham Flames]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Barry Wellman, "I was a teenage network analyst," ''Connections'' 17(2):28-45</ref> He gained his high school degree from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1959.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He received his A.B.  (Bachelor's) degree ''magna cum laude'' from [[Lafayette College]] in 1963, majoring in social history and winning prizes in both history and religious studies. At Lafayette, he was a member of the McKelvy Honors House and captained the undefeated 1962 [[College Bowl]] team, whose final victory was over [[University of California Berkeley|Berkeley]].<ref>[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications/index.html Barry Wellman, "On from Lafayette"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617090242/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications/index.html |date=2010-06-17 }}</ref>

His graduate work was at [[Harvard University]], where he trained with Chad Gordon, [[Charles Tilly]] and [[Harrison White]], and also studied with [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]], [[Cora DuBois]], [[George Homans]], [[Alex Inkeles]], [[Florence Kluckhohn]], [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Phillip J. Stone]]. He received a M.A. in [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Social Relations]] in 1965 and a Ph.D. in Sociology in 1969. His focus was on community, computer applications, [[social network]]s and [[self-concept]]ion, and his dissertation showed that the [[social identity|social identities]] of [[African-American]] and [[White American]] [[Pittsburgh]] [[junior high school]] students were related to the extent of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] of their schools.

He has been married since 1965 to Beverly Wellman, a researcher in [[complementary and alternative medicine]].<ref>Merrijoy Kelner and Beverly Wellman, eds., ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Challenge and Change.'' London: Harwood/Taylor and Francis, 2000; {{cite web |url=https://www.utoronto.ca/CAMlab/bev/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209202629/http://www.utoronto.ca/CAMlab/bev/index.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 }}</ref>

==Community sociology==
Until 1990, he focused on [[community]] sociology and [[social network analysis]]. During his first three years in [[Toronto]], he also held a joint appointment with the [[Clarke Institute of Psychiatry]] where he working with [[D.B. Coates]], M.D., co-directing the "Yorklea Study" in the Toronto borough of East York. This first East York study, with data collected in 1968, attempted to do a field study of a large population, linking interpersonal relations with psychiatric symptoms. This early study of "[[social support]]" documented the prevalence of non-local [[friendship]] and [[kinship]] ties, demonstrating that community is no longer confined to [[neighborhood]] and studying non-local communities as [[social network]]s. Wellman's "The Community Question" paper, reporting on this study, has been selected as one of the seven most important articles in English-Canadian sociology.<ref>[[Claude Fischer]], ''To Dwell among Friends: Personal Networks in Town and City.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 1982. [[Robert J. Sampson]], "Local Friendship Ties and Community Attachment in Mass Society: A Multilevel Systemic Model."

''American Journal of Sociology'' 84 (March, 1979): 1201-31.</ref>

A second [[East York]] study, conducted in 1978 and 1979 at the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Centre for Urban and Community Studies]], used in-depth interviews with 33 East Yorkers (originally surveyed in the first study) to learn more information about their social networks. It provided evidence about which kinds of ties and networks supply which types of [[social support]]. It showed, for example, that sisters provide siblings with much emotional support, while parents provide financial aid.<ref>Nan Lin, ''Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action.''

Pp. 159-91 in ''Understanding Personal Relationships'', edited by [[Steve Duck]] and Daniel Perlman. London: Sage, 1985.</ref>

Although Wellman's work has shifted primarily to studies of the Internet (see section below), he has continued collaborative analyses of the first and second East York studies, showing that reciprocity (like social support) is much more of a tie phenomenon than a social network phenomenon<ref>Gabriele Plickert, Rochelle Côté and Barry Wellman. 2007. " It's Not Who You Know, It's How You Know Them: Who Exchanges What With Whom?" ''[[Social Networks]]'' 29, 3:405-29.</ref> and that the frequency and supportiveness of interpersonal contact before the Internet was non-linearly associated with residential (and workplace) [[distance]].<ref>Diana Mok and Barry Wellman. 2007. "How Much Did Distance Matter Before the Internet?" ''Social Networks'' 29: in press.</ref>

Wellman has edited ''Networks in the Global Village'' (1999), a book of original articles about personal networks around the world. In 2007, he edited a special issue, "The Network is Personal" of the journal, ''[[Social Networks]]'' (vol. 29, no. 3, July), containing analyses from Canada, France, Germany and [[Iran]].

==Social network theory==
Concomitant with his empirical work, Wellman has contributed to the theory of social network analysis. The most comprehensive statement is in his introductory article to ''Social Structures'', co-edited with the late [[S.D. Berkowitz]]. This work reviews the history of social network thought, and suggests a number of basic principles of social network analysis.<ref>Barry Wellman, "Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance." Pp. 19-61 in ''Social Structures: A Network Approach'', edited by Barry Wellman and S.D. Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988.</ref>

More recent and more focused theoretical work has discussed the "glocalization" of contemporary communities (simultaneously "global" and "local")<ref>Barry Wellman, "Little Boxes, Glocalization, and Networked Individualism." Pp. 11-25 in ''Digital Cities II: Computational and Sociological Approaches'', edited by Makoto Tanabe, Peter van den Besselaar, and Toru Ishida. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2002.</ref> and the rise of "networked individualism" &ndash; the transformation from group-based networks to individualized networks.<ref>Barry Wellman, "Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism."

==Social network methods==
Wellman's methodological contributions have been for the analysis of ego-centered or "personal" networks &ndash; defined from the standpoint of an individual (usually a person). As batches of personal networks are often studied, this calls for somewhat different techniques than the more common [[social network]] practice of analyzing a single large network.

A 2007 paper, co-authored by Wellman (with Bernie Hogan and Juan-Antonio Carrasco), has discussed alternatives in gathering personal network data.<ref>Bernie Hogan, Juan-Antonio Carrasco and Barry Wellman. 2007. "Visualizing Personal Networks: Working with Participant-Aided Sociograms." ''[[Field Methods]]'' 19 (2), May: 116-144.</ref> A paper with Kenneth Frank showed how to tackle the problem of simultaneously analyzing personal network data on the two distinct levels of ties and networks.<ref>Barry Wellman and Kenneth Frank.

Other work by Wellman with [[Howard D. White]] and associates has examined how to link social network analysis with the [[scientometrics|scientometric]] study of citation networks. This research has shown that scholarly friends do not necessarily cite each other, but that scholars cited in the same article are apt to seek each other out and become friends.<ref>Howard White, Barry Wellman and Nancy Nazer. 2004.

==Internet, technology and society==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Barry-speaking.jpg|thumb|left|Barry Wellman at the International Conference on Communities and Technologies, September 2003, Amsterdam]] -->

Wellman has often worked in collaboration with computer scientists, communication scientists and information scientists.
In 1990, he became involved in studying how ordinary people use the Internet and other communication technologies to communicate and exchange information at work, at home and in the community. Thus his work has expanded his interest in non-local communities and social networks to encompass the Internet, [[cellphones|mobile phones]] and other information and communication technologies.

===Work networks and ICTs===
Wellman's initial project ("Cavecat" which morphed into "[[Telepresence]]") was in collaboration with [[Ronald Baecker]], [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], Marilyn Mantei, Gale Moore, and Janet Salaff. This effort in the early 1990s was done before the widespread popularity of the Internet, to use networked PCs for [[videoconferencing]] and computer supported collaborative work ([[CSCW]]).<ref>Marilyn Mantei, Ronald Baecker, William Buxton, Thomas Milligan, Abigail Sellen and Barry Wellman. "Experiences in the Use of a Media Space." 1992. Pp 372-78 in ''Groupware: Software for Computer-Supported Cooperative Work'', edited by David Marca and Geoffrey Bock. Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society Press, 1992, pp. 372-78. [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]] and Barry Wellman, "Work, Friendship and Media Use for Information Exchange in a Networked Organization." ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 49, 12 (Oct., 1998): 1101-1114.</ref>
[[Caroline Haythornthwaite]] (for her dissertation and other works) and Wellman analyzed why computer scientists connect with each other &ndash; online and offline. They discovered that friendships as well as collaborative work were prime movers of connectivity at work.<ref>[[Caroline Haythornthwaite]] and Barry Wellman, "Work, Friendship and Media Use for Information Exchange in a Networked Organization." ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 49, 12 (Oct., 1998): 1101-1114. [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], Barry Wellman and Laura Garton, "Work and Community Via Computer-Mediated Communication." Pp. 199-226 in ''Psychology and the Internet: Intrapersonal, Interpersonal and Transpersonal Implications'', edited by Jayne Gackenbach. San Diego: Academic Press, 1998.</ref>

Wellman and Anabel Quan-Haase also studied whether such computer-supported work teams were supporting networked organizations, in which bureaucratic structure and physical proximity did not matter. Their research in one high-tech American organization &ndash; heavily dependent on [[instant messaging]] and [[e-mail]] &ndash; showed that the supposed ICT-driven transformation of work to [[Network-centric organization|networked organizations]] was only partially fulfilled in practice. The organizational constraints of departmental organization (including power) and physical proximity continued to play important roles. There were strong norms in the organization for when different communication media were used, with face-to-face contact intertwined with online contact.<ref>Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman. "Hyperconnected Net Work: Computer-Mediated Community in a High-Tech Organization." Pp. 281-333 in ''The Firm as a Collaborative Community: Reconstructing Trust in the Knowledge Economy'', edited by Charles Heckscher and Paul Adler.

In ''Computerization Movements and Technology Diffusion: From Mainframes to Ubiquitous Computing'', edited by Ken Kraemer and Margaret Elliott. Medford, NJ: Information Today, 2007.</ref>

Wellman collaborated with Dimitrina Dimitrova, Tsahi Hayat, and Guang Ying Mo to do the NAVEL study of 140 networked scholars in a variety of research centres across Canada. They discovered that despite the emphasis on networking, disciplinary and spatial boundaries continue to affect who interacts with whom.<ref>[http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/7290/2033 Barry Wellman, Dimitrina Dimitrova, Tsahi Hayat, Guang Ying Mo, and Beverly Wellman. 2017. "Fifteen Implications of Networked Scholar Research for Networked Work." ''International Journal of Communication'', 11]</ref>

===Community networks and ICTs===
As a community sociologist, Wellman began arguing that too much analysis of life online was happening in isolation from other aspects of everyday life. He published several papers (alone and with associates) arguing the need to contextualize Internet research, and proposing that online relations &ndash; like off-line &ndash; would be best studied as ramified social networks rather than as bounded groups.<ref>Barry Wellman and Milena Gulia. "Net Surfers Don't Ride Alone: Virtual Communities as Communities." Pp. 167-94 in ''Communities in Cyberspace'', edited by Marc Smith and Peter edited by Barry Wellman. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1999. Barry Wellman, "An Electronic Group is Virtually a Social Network." Pp. 179-205 in ''Culture of the Internet'', edited by Sara Kiesler. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1997.
Barry Wellman, "The Rise of Networked Individualism." Pp. 17-42 in ''Community Informatics'', edited by Leigh Keeble and Brian Loader. London: Routledge, 2001. Barry Wellman and Bernie Hogan (2004). "The Immanent Internet." Pp. 54-80 in ''Netting Citizens'', edited by Johnston McKay. Edinburgh: St. Andrew Press. Barry Wellman. 2004.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</ref> This argument culminated in a 2002 book, ''The Internet in Everyday Life'' (co-edited with [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]]), providing exemplification from studies in a number of social milieus.

Wellman did empirical work in this area: he was part of a team (led by James Witte) that surveyed visitors to the [[National Geographic Society]]'s website in 1998 and used these data to counter the [[dystopia]]n argument that Internet involvement was associated with [[social isolation]].<ref>Wenhong Chen, Jeffrey Boase and Barry Wellman. 2002.

The large U.S. national random-sample survey analyzed in the Pew Internet report, "The Strength of Internet Ties" (with Jeffrey Boase, John B. Horrigan and Lee Rainie) also showed a positive association between communication online and communication by telephone and face-to-face. The study showed that email is well-suited for maintaining regular contact with large networks, and especially with relationships that are only somewhat strong. The study also found that Internet users get more help than non-users from friends and relatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Internet_ties.pdf.pdf |title=Strength of Internet Ties |access-date=2009-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713151448/http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Internet_ties.pdf.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Research into the "[[glocalization]]" concept also fed into this intellectual stream. [[Keith Hampton]] and Wellman studied the [[Toronto]] suburb of "Netville", a pseudonym. It showed the interplay between online and offline activity, and how the Internet &ndash; aided by a list-serve &ndash; is not just a means of long-distance communication but enhances neighboring and civic involvement.<ref>Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman. 2003. "Neighboring in Netville: How the Internet Supports Community and Social Capital in a Wired Suburb."

He collaborated with Helen Hua Wang and Jeffrey Cole of the [[World Internet Project]]'s Center for the Digital Future to investigate the first national U.S. survey of social relationships and Internet use. Their work shows that the number of friends are growing, and that heavy Internet users have more friends than others.<ref>Hua Wang and Barry Wellman. 2010.

''American Behavioral Scientist'' 53 (8): 1148-1169. {{doi|10.1177/0002764209356247}}</ref>  Wellman also collaborated with Ben Veenhof ([[Statistics Canada]]), Carsten Quell ([[Department of Canadian Heritage]]) and Bernie Hogan to relate time spent at home on the Internet to social relations and civic involvement. A different focus is his collaboration on Wenhong Chen's study of transnational immigrant entrepreneurs who link China and North America.<ref>Wenhong Chen and Barry Wellman, "Doing Business at Home and Away: Policy Implications of Chinese-Canadian Entrepreneurship."

Wellman's work has continued to focus on the interplay between information and communication technologies, especially the [[Internet]], [[social relations]] and [[social structure]]. He directed the ''Connected Lives'' study of the interplay between communication, community and domestic relationships in Toronto and in [[Chapleau, Ontario|Chapleau]] in rural northern Ontario. Early findings of the interplay between online and offline life are summarized in "Connected Lives: The Project".<ref>Barry Wellman and Bernie Hogan, with Kristen Berg, Jeffrey Boase, Juan-Antonio Carrasco, Rochelle Côté, Jennifer Kayahara, Tracy L.M. Kennedy and Phouc Tran. "Connected Lives: The Project" Pp. 157-211 in Networked Neighbourhoods: The Online Community in Context, edited by Patrick Purcell. Guildford, UK: Springer, 2006.</ref> More focused research (with Jennifer Kayahara) has shown how the onetime [[two-step flow of communication]] has become more recursively multi-step as the result of the Internet's facilitation of information seeking and communication.<ref>Jennifer Kayahara and Barry Wellman, 2007.

''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication'' 12 (4): April: {{doi|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00352.x}}</ref> Research (with Tracy Kennedy) has argued that many households, like communities, have changed from local groups to become spatially dispersed networks connected by frequent ICT and mobile phone communication.<ref>Tracy Kennedy and Barry Wellman. 2007.

Wellman is involved in the "Networked Individuals" project, using the fourth East York study to investigate their social networks and digital media use. His collaborators include Brent Berry, Molly-Gloria Harper, Maria Kiceveski, Guang Ying Mo, Anabel Quan-Haase, Helen Hua Wang, and Alice Renwen Zhang. The initial papers focused on older adults, aged 65+. showing how they used digital media to stay connected with relatives and friends both near and far.<ref>Anabel Quan-Haase, Guang Ying Mo, and Barry Wellman. 2017.
