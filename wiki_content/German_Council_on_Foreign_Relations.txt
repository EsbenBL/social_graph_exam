The '''German Council on Foreign Relations''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik e. V. (DGAP)}}) is [[Germany]]'s national [[foreign policy]] [[Business network|network]]. As an independent, private, [[non-partisan]] and [[non-profit]] organisation, the Council actively takes part in political decision-making and promotes the understanding of German foreign policy and [[international relations]].

It serves as [[Forum (legal)|forum]] for foreign policy and facilitates a comprehensive network of political, [[economic]] and [[academic]] decision makers. The institution aims at linking foreign politicians to the German public.

==History==
The association was founded in 1955 in [[Bonn]]. The model for the foundation was in many respects the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Chatham House]] in [[London]].<ref>Daniel Eisermann in „''Außenpolitik und Strategiediskussion''“, „''Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik 1955–1972''“, [[R. Oldenbourg Verlag|Oldenbourg]] Verlag, München 1999, Band 66, S. 62ff, {{ISBN|3-486-56338-6}}.</ref> The first president of the newly founded DGAP was the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] politician, diplomat and entrepreneur [[Günther Henle]].<ref>Daniel Eisermann in „''Außenpolitik und Strategiediskussion''“, „''Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik 1955–1972''“, S. 79f.</ref>

In Bonn, the DGAP was seated in the villa at Joachimstraße 7 between 1956 and 1959 and then in the Villa Schaumburg-Lippe-Straße 6 between 1965 and 1966. In 1965 it acquired the former House of Craftsmen at Adenauerallee 131a in Bonn, including the Villa Adenauerallee 131, which in later years served as a logo of DGAP, for the first time its own building. It served as headquarters of the DGAP from April 1966 to 1999.

The current seat of the DGAP is the building of the [[Embassy of Yugoslavia, Berlin|Yugoslav embassy]] in the embassy district in [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Berlin-Tiergarten]].

It works to actively influence the foreign policy opinion-forming at all levels.
