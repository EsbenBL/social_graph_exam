'''Tibor de Scitovsky''', also known as '''Tibor Scitovsky''' (November 3, 1910 &ndash; June 1, 2002), was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] born, [[United States|American]] [[economist]] who was best known for his writing on the nature of people's happiness in relation to consumption. He was [[Associate Professor]] and Professor of [[Economics]] at [[Stanford University]] from 1946 through 1958 and Eberle Professor of Economics from 1970 until his retirement in 1976, when he became Professor Emeritus. In honor of his deep contributions to economic analysis, he was elected Distinguished Fellow of the [[American Economic Association]], Fellow of the [[Royal Economic Society]], member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]].

==Life==
Scitovsky was born in [[Hungary]] in 1910. As the ''de'' indicates, he was born into a noble family; his father, [[Tibor Scitovszky]], held the post of Foreign Minister. He was educated at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|Pázmány Péter University]] (from which he held an undergraduate degree in law), [[University of Cambridge]], and the [[London School of Economics]]. He came to the [[United States]] on a traveling fellowship. He enlisted in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], in counter-intelligence. Because he still had family in German-allied Hungary he changed his name during this time to Thomas Dennis.

After a spell at [[Stanford]] from 1946–1958, he left for [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and remained there until 1968, although he was on leave to do research at the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].

Starting as early as 1959, he began an examination of the nature of human well-being from a broader viewpoint than is customary among economists.
