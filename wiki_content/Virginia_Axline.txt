'''Virginia Mae Axline''' (1911â€“1988) was a psychologist and one of the pioneers in the use of [[play therapy]]. She wrote the book ''[[Dibs in Search of Self]]''. She was also the author of ''[[Play Therapy]]''.<ref name=therapy>{{cite web|title=Play Therapy|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1162840.Play_Therapy|publisher=goodreads.com|access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Dibs in Search of Self|isbn=0345339258|last1=Axline|first1=Virginia Mae|year=1967}}</ref><ref name=amazon>{{cite book|title=Play Therapy|isbn=0345303350|last1=Axline|first1=Virginia Mae|year=1969}}</ref>

Play therapy practice is still largely based on Axline's work. In the 1940s, she began to develop nondirective play therapy, the principles of which were based on [[Carl Rogers]]' newly emerging [[Person-centered psychotherapy|person-centred approach]]. In her first published work she establishes the eight basic principles of nondirective play therapy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frankel|first=Shimshon Meir|title=The Dibs on Play Therapy|url=http://chedva.org/2011/07/11/the-dibs-on-play-therapy/|publisher=chedva.org|access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=psychotherapy>{{cite web|title=Play Therapy|url=http://www.psychotherapy.com.au/shop/book-store/children-and-adolescents/c-a-play-therapy/play-therapy.html|publisher=V Axline - psychotherapy.com.au|access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref>

In 1964, she published ''Dibs in Search of Self'', which follows the path of one young patient, Dibs, throughout his journey with play therapy having Axline as his therapist. It is a nearly verbatim transcript of the weekly sessions that follow this five-year-old child and his emergence to health and functioning. Axline studied at [[Ohio State University]] and [[Columbia University]]. She taught at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] and School of Education. For seven years, she was on the faculty of [[Columbia University Teachers College]] and, prior to that, spent three years as a research associate and faculty member at the [[University of Chicago]].
