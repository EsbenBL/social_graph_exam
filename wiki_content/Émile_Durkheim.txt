He formally established the academic discipline of sociology and, with{{clarify|date=December 2021}} [[Max Weber]], and [[Karl Marx]], is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern [[social science]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-107">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA107 p. 107]}}</ref><ref>Kim, Sung Ho (2007). "Max Weber". [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (24 August 2007 entry) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ (Retrieved 17 February 2010)</ref>

From his lifetime,{{clarify|date=December 2021}} much of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could{{clarify|date=December 2021}} maintain their [[social integration|integrity and coherence]] in [[modernity]], an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed,{{clarify|date=December 2021}} and in which new social [[institutions]] have come into being. 
Durkheim asserted that sociology is unique from other disciplines, such as psychology, because of its larger scale. Some tools that could{{clarify|date=December 2021}} be used in sociology are polls, surveys, statistics, and observing historical patients. Durkheim used these scientific tools in his analysis of suicides in Catholic and Protestant groups. His work{{clarify|date=December 2021}} was the concept of modern sociology. His first major sociological work was {{Lang-fr|De la division du travail social|label=none}} (1893; ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]''), followed in 1895 by {{Lang-fr|Les Règles de la méthode sociologique|label=none}} (''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]''), the same year in which Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology and became France's first professor of sociology.<ref name="Allan_104">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=104}}</ref> Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Le Suicide]]'' (1897), a study of [[suicide]] rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, especially pioneered modern [[social research]], serving to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]]. The following year, in 1898, he established the journal ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]''. {{Lang-fr|Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse|label=none}} (1912; ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'') presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.

Durkheim was deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate [[science]]. He refined the [[positivism]] originally set forth by [[Auguste Comte]], promoting what could be considered as a form of [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]], as well as the use of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] in social science. For Durkheim, sociology was the science of [[institution|''institutions'']], understanding the term in its broader meaning as the "beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity,"<ref name=":0">Durkheim, Émile. 1982 [1901]. "Preface to the Second Edition". Pp. 34–47 in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method|The Rules of Sociological Method and Selected Texts on Sociology and its Method]]'', edited by [[Steven Lukes|S.

As such, Durkheim was a major proponent of [[structural functionalism]], a foundational perspective in both sociology and [[anthropology]]. In his view, social science should be purely [[holism|holistic]]<ref group="lower-roman">"The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things." (Durkheim 1895:14).</ref> in the sense that sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the study of specific actions of individuals.

He remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[morality]], [[social stratification]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[Sociology of education|education]], and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. Some terms that he coined, such as "[[collective consciousness]]", are now also used by laypeople.<ref>Durkheim, Emile. 1993 [1893]. ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', translated by G.

==Biography==

===Early life and heritage===
David Émile Durkheim was born 15 April 1858 in [[Épinal]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], [[France]], to Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim,<ref>Jones, Robert Alun. 1986.

As his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had all been [[rabbi]]s,<ref name="Poggi_1">Poggi, Gianfranco. 2000. ''Durkheim''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878087-8}}.</ref>{{Rp|1}} young Durkheim began his education in a [[Yeshiva|rabbinical school]]. However, at an early age, he switched schools, deciding not to follow in his family's footsteps.<ref name="Calhoun2002-103">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA103 p. 103]}}</ref><ref name="Poggi_1" />{{Rp|1}} In fact, Durkheim led a completely secular life, whereby much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. Despite this fact, Durkheim did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community.<ref name="Poggi_1" />{{Rp|1}} Actually, many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, some even being blood-related. [[Marcel Mauss]], a notable social anthropologist of the prewar era, for instance, was his nephew.<ref name="Calhoun2002-107"/>

=== Education ===
A precocious student, Durkheim entered the ''[[École normale supérieure (Paris)|École Normale Supérieure]]'' (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt.<ref name="Calhoun2002-103" /><ref name="Poggi_1" />{{Rp|2}} The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century, as many of his classmates, such as [[Jean Jaurès]] and [[Henri Bergson]], went on to become major figures in France's intellectual history as well. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a [[Classics|classicist]] with a social-scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin [[dissertation]] on [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].<ref>{{harvp|Bottomore|Nisbet|1978|p=8}}</ref> At the same time, he read [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], whereby Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career.<ref name="Calhoun2002-103" /> This meant the first of many conflicts with the [[Education in France|French academic system]], which had no [[social science]] curriculum at the time. Durkheim found [[Humanities|humanistic studies]] uninteresting, turning his attention from [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] to [[ethics]] and, eventually, [[sociology]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-103" /> He obtained his ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=64}}</ref>

The opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA104 p. 104]}}</ref> In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" /> As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of [[empiricism]] and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian method]].<ref>{{harvp|Jones|Spiro|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vM5MgiPPlgcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA148 p. 149]}}</ref> By 1886, as part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], he had completed the draft of his ''The Division of Labour in Society'', and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" />

====Academic career====
[[File:Emile Durkheim, Le Socialisme maitrier.jpg|thumb|A collection of Durkheim's courses on the origins of socialism (1896), edited and published by his nephew, [[Marcel Mauss]], in 1928]]

Durkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/> Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/> His official title was {{Lang-fr|Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie|label=none}}, thus he taught both [[pedagogy]] and sociology (the latter having never been taught in France before).<ref name="Allan_104"/><ref name="Poggi_1" />{{Rp|3}} The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/> From this position Durkheim helped reform the [[French school system]], introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Also in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They had two children, Marie and André.<ref name="Allan_104"/>

The 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/> In 1893, he published ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and [[evolution of society|its development]].<ref name="Poggi_1" />{{Rp|x}} Durkheim's interest in [[social phenomena]] was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to the fall of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], which was then replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new [[secularism|secular]] and [[republicanism|republican]] rule, as many people considered a vigorously [[nationalistic]] approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.<ref name="Calhoun2002-105">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA105 p. 105]}}</ref>

In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'',<ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/> a [[manifesto]] stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In 1898, he founded ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]'', the first French social science journal.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/> Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'', a [[case study]] that provided an example of what a sociological [[monograph]] might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of [[quantitative methods in criminology]], which he used in his study of suicide.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

By 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the [[professorship|chair]] of education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called "sociological imperialism" and admit social science to their curriculum.<ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/> He became a full professor (specifically, Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named chair in "Education and Sociology".<ref name="Allan_104"/><ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/> Because [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]] are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence—his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name="Allan_104"/> In 1912, he published his last major work, ''[[The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life]]''.

===Death===
[[File:Tomba emile durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Émile Durkheim's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery]]
The outbreak of [[World War I]] was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] was always patriotic rather than [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], in that he sought a secular, rational form of French life. However, the onset of the war, and the inevitable [[French nationalism|nationalist]] [[propaganda]] that followed, made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]]. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, many of them perishing in the trenches.

Finally, Durkheim's own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered.<ref name="Calhoun2002-105" /><ref name="Allan_105">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=105}}</ref> Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a [[stroke]] in Paris on 15 November, two years later in 1917.<ref name="Allan_105" /> He was buried at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name="Pickering">{{harvp|Pickering|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUl5F0uLrkUC&pg=PA11&dq=%C3%89mile+Durkheim+Cimeti%C3%A8re+de+Montparnasse&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQuwUwAWoVChMIsdXQ0OzvxwIVgQ-SCh0SxwMj#v=onepage&q=%C3%89mile%20Durkheim%20Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Montparnasse&f=false p. 11]}}</ref>

==Methodology==
[[File:The Rules of the Sociological Method.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the French edition of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1919)]]
In ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895), Durkheim expressed his will to establish a [[Scientific method|method]] that would guarantee sociology's truly scientific character. One of the questions raised concerns the [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, [[observation]] must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a "perfectly objective observation" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its [[Relativism|relation]] with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege [[Comparative method|comparison]] rather than the study of singular independent facts.<ref group="lower-roman">{{harvp|Collins|1975|p=539}}: "Durkheim was the first to seriously use the comparative method correctly in the scientific sense."</ref>

Durkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with [[Herbert Spencer]], he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society "work"). He also agreed with Spencer's [[organicism|organic analogy]], comparing society to a living organism.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" /> Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-103" /><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960a}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960b}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Thompson|2002}}</ref> Durkheim also insisted that society was [[Holism|more than the sum of its parts]].<ref group="lower-roman">Durkheim (1960/1892), p. 9: "Science cannot describe individuals, but only types. If human societies cannot be classified, they must remain inaccessible to scientific description."</ref><ref>Durkheim, Émile. 1960 [1892]. "Montesquieu's Contribution to the Rise of Social Science." In ''Montesquieu and Rousseau: Forerunners of Sociology'', translated by [[Ralph Manheim|R. Manheim]]. Ann Arbor: [[University of Michigan Press]]. p. 9.</ref>

Unlike his contemporaries [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] and [[Max Weber]], he did not focus on what motivates the actions of individuals (an approach associated with [[methodological individualism]]), but rather on the study of ''[[social facts]]''.

==Inspirations==
During his university studies at the ENS, Durkheim was influenced by two [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] scholars: [[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] and [[Émile Boutroux]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-103" /> The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included [[rationalism]], scientific study of morality, anti-[[utilitarianism]], and [[secular education]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" /> His methodology was influenced by [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a supporter of the [[scientific method]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" />

=== Comte ===
A fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], who effectively sought to extend and apply the [[scientific method]] found in the [[natural science]]s to the [[social science]]s.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" /> According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as [[Inductive reasoning|induce]] general [[scientific law]]s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis:

* First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. 
* Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. 
* Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] abstractions and philosophical speculation.<ref>{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=151}}</ref> At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.<ref name="Calhoun2002-104" />

=== Realism ===
A second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] outlook called ''social [[scientific realism|realism]]''. Although he never explicitly espoused it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society.<ref name="Morrison_152">{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=152}}</ref> As an epistemology of science, ''realism'' can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the [[subjectivity|individual's perception]] of them.

This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as [[empiricism]] and [[positivism]]. Empiricists, like [[David Hume]], had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception, thus all realities are merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves.<ref name="Morrison_152" /> Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover "apparent" laws, but would be able to discover the ''inherent nature'' of society.

=== Judaism ===
Scholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of [[Secular Jewish culture|secularized Jewish thought]],<ref group="lower-roman">{{harvp|Meštrović|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lqGUxDs3K_UC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 37]}}: "While Durkheim did not become a Rabbi, he may have transformed his father's philosophical and moral concerns into something new, his version of sociology."</ref><ref>{{harvp|Strenski|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nyneB7F0m0sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 1–2]}}</ref> while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.<ref>{{harvp|Pickering|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=amP-MyZAL-cC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 79]}}</ref>

==Durkheim and theory==
Throughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline.<ref name="Calhoun2002-105" /> Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed. To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and [[social integration]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-105" /><ref name="Allan_102">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=102}}</ref> Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of [[scientific knowledge]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-105" /> The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=136}}</ref><ref>Durkheim, Emile. 2011 [1925]. ''Moral Education'', translated by E. K. Wilson and H. Schnurer. Mineola, NY: [[Dover Publications]]. {{ISBN|9780486424989}}. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=JJooAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA102 p. 102].</ref>

{{Quote|For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.|title=|source=''Moral Education'' (1925)|author=}}

===Establishing sociology===
Durkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced.<ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/> His concern was to establish sociology as a science.<ref>{{harvp|Popolo|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vMALg_p5zHsC&pg=PA97 pp. 97–]}}</ref> Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences, he wrote, "sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science."<ref>{{harvp|Brinton|Nee|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=71e_jsQpzg0C&pg=PR11 pp. 11–]}}</ref>

To give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own [[methodology]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/> He argued that "there is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from those studied by the other natural sciences."<ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007">[[#CITEREFDurkheim2007|Durkheim, Émile. 2007 [1895]]].

===Social facts===
{{Main|Social fact}}

{{quote|A social fact is every way of acting, fixed or not, capable of exercising on the individual an external constraint; or again, every way of acting which is general throughout a given society, while at the same time existing in its own right independent of its individual manifestations.|''The Rules of Sociological Method''<ref name="socialfact" />|title=|source=}}

Durkheim's work revolved around the study of social facts, a term he coined to describe phenomena that have an existence in and of themselves, are not bound to the actions of individuals, but have a coercive influence upon them.<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=105-06}}</ref> Durkheim argued that social facts have, ''[[sui generis]]'', an independent existence greater and more objective than the actions of the individuals that compose society.<ref name="Allan_106">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=106}}</ref> Only such social facts can explain the observed social phenomena.<ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/> Being exterior to the individual person, social facts may thus also exercise [[Social control|coercive power]] on the various people composing society, as it can sometimes be observed in the case of formal laws and regulations, but also in situations implying the presence of informal rules, such as religious rituals or family norms.<ref name="socialfact" /><ref name="Durkheim_1994_433">Durkheim, Émile. 1994 [1895]. "Social facts." Pp. 433–40 in ''Readings in the Philosophy of Social Science'', edited by M. Martin and [[Lee C. McIntyre|L. C. McIntyre]]. Boston: [[MIT Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-262-13296-1}}. p. 433–34.</ref> Unlike the facts studied in [[natural science]]s, a ''social'' fact thus refers to a specific category of phenomena: "the determining cause of a social fact must be sought among the antecedent social facts and not among the states of the individual consciousness."{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Such facts are endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they may control individual behaviors.<ref name="Durkheim_1994_433"/> According to Durkheim, these phenomena cannot be reduced to [[biology|biological]] or [[psychology|psychological]] grounds.<ref name="Durkheim_1994_433" /> Social facts can be material (i.e. physical objects) or immaterial (i.e. meanings, sentiments, etc.).<ref name="Allan_106"/> Though the latter cannot be seen or touched, they are external and coercive, thus becoming real and gaining "[[facticity]]".<ref name="Allan_106"/> Physical objects, too, can represent both material and immaterial social facts. For example, a flag is a physical social fact that is often ingrained with various immaterial social facts (e.g. its meaning and importance).<ref name="Allan_106"/>

Many social facts, however, have no material form.<ref name="Allan_106"/> Even the most "individualistic" or "subjective" phenomena, such as love, freedom, or suicide, were regarded by Durkheim as ''objective'' social facts.<ref name="Allan_106"/> Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, as a social fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts—such as rules governing [[behavior]] and group attachment—whether an individual likes it or not.<ref name="Allan_106"/><ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=107}}</ref> Whether a person "leaves" a society does not alter the ''fact'' that this society will ''still contain'' suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential—coercive—as physical laws like gravity.<ref name="Allan_106"/> Sociology's task therefore consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on [[Social statistics|statistics]]).<ref group="lower-roman">{{harvp|Hassard|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EjI6Rd-NreYC&oi=fnd&pg=PP13&dq=Durkheim+suicide+sociological+positivism&ots=764qjcztaG&sig=YOVkvTMvWDpq2FIYgf0v7TR_JFw#PPA15,M1 p. 15]}}: "Suicide…is indeed the paradigm case of Durkheim's positivism: it remains the exemplar of the sociological application of statistics."</ref>

===Society, collective consciousness, and culture===
[[File:Emile Durkheim, Division du travail social maitrier.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the French edition of ''The Division of Labour in Society]]Regarding the society itself, like [[social institution]]s in general, Durkheim saw it as a set of social facts.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Even more than "what society is," Durkheim was interested in answering "how is a society created" and "what holds a society together." In ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', Durkheim attempts to answer the latter question.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA106 p. 106]}}</ref>

==== Collective consciousness ====
Durkheim assumes that humans are inherently [[Egotism|egoistic]], while "[[collective consciousness]]" (i.e. [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[belief]]s, and [[Value (ethics)|values]]) forms the moral basis of the society, resulting in [[social integration]].<ref>Kim, Sung Ho. 2007. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ Max Weber]." ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. Retrieved 17 February 2010.</ref> ''Collective consciousness'' is therefore of key importance to the society; its requisite function without which the society cannot survive.<ref name="Allan_1083">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=108}}</ref> This consciousness produces the society and holds it together, while, at the same time, individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions.<ref name=":0" /> Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.<ref name="Allan_1083" /><blockquote>The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or common consciousness.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-108">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

==== Culture ====
Groups, when interacting, create their own culture and attach powerful emotions to it, thus making ''[[culture]]'' another key social fact.<ref name="Allan_110">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=110}}</ref> Durkheim was one of the first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely.<ref name="Allan_103" /> Durkheim was interested in [[cultural diversity]], and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the [[law]].<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=111, 127}}</ref>

In a [[Sociocultural evolution|socio-evolutionary]] approach, Durkheim described the evolution of societies from [[mechanical solidarity]] to [[organic solidarity]] (one rising from mutual need).<ref name="Allan_103" /><ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /><ref name="psz500">{{harvp|Sztompka|2002|p=500}}</ref><ref name="Allan_125">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=125}}</ref> As the societies become more complex, evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity, the [[division of labour]] is counteracting and replacing to collective consciousness.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /><ref name="Allan_137">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=137}}</ref> In the simpler societies, people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions; in the larger, modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern, highly complex society to survive.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /> In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together.<ref name="psz500" /> Also, in such societies, people have much fewer options in life.<ref name="Allan_123">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=123}}</ref> In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialization and cooperation is extensive.<ref name="psz500" /> Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on [[population growth]] and increasing [[population density]], second on increasing "morality density" (development of more complex [[social interaction]]s) and thirdly, on the increasing specialization in workplace.<ref name="psz500" /> One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law: in mechanical society the law is focused on its [[punishment|punitive]] aspect, and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community, often by making the punishment public and extreme; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community.<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=123–24}}</ref>

One of the main features of the modern, organic society is the importance, [[sacred]]ness even, given to the concept—social fact—of the [[individual]].<ref name="Allan_132-133">{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=132–33}}</ref> The individual, rather than the collective, becomes the focus of rights and responsibilities, the center of public and private rituals holding the society together—a function once performed by the religion.<ref name="Allan_132-133" /> To stress the importance of this concept, Durkheim talked of the "cult of the individual":<ref name=":1">Durkheim, Émile. 1974 [1953]. ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=oCBNzbCG2N0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:7biAPRA5u8AC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4rICZuorpAhWNrp4KHbQDCeoQ6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false Sociology and Philosophy]'', translated by [[David Francis Pocock|D. F. Pocock]], with introduction by J. G. Peristiany. Toronto: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-02-908580-6}}. {{LCCN|74-19680}}.</ref><blockquote>Thus very far from there being the antagonism between the individual and society which is often claimed, moral individualism, the cult of the individual, is in fact the product of society itself. It is society that instituted it and made of man the god whose servant it is.</blockquote>Durkheim saw the [[population density]] and [[population growth|growth]] as key factors in the evolution of the societies and advent of [[modernity]].<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=125, 134}}</ref> As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex.<ref name="Allan_125" /> Growing [[competition]] between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour.<ref name="Allan_125" /> In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.<ref name="Allan_134">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=134}}</ref>

In another example of evolution of culture, Durkheim pointed to [[fashion]], although in this case he noted a more [[social cycle|cyclical]] phenomenon.<ref name="Allan_113">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=113}}</ref> According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between [[Working class|lower classes]] and [[upper class]]es, but because lower classes want to look like the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.<ref name="Allan_113"/>

===Social pathology and crime===
As the society, Durkheim noted there are several possible [[pathology|pathologies]] that could lead to a breakdown of [[social integration]] and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are ''[[anomie]]'' and ''forced division of labour''; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide.<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=128, 130}}</ref> To Durkheim, ''anomie'' refers to a lack of social norms; where too rapid of population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (i.e. norms, values, etc.).<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=128, 129, 137}}</ref> ''Forced division of labour'', on the other hand, refers to a situation in which those who hold power, driven by their desire for [[Profit (economics)|profit]] ([[greed]]), results in people doing work that they are unsuited for.<ref name="Allan_129">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=129}}</ref> Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.<ref name="Allan_129"/>

Durkheim's views on crime were a departure from conventional notions. He believed that crime is "bound up with the fundamental conditions of all [[social relation|social life]]" and serves a social function.<ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007" />{{Rp|101}} He states that crime implies "not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes."<ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007" />{{Rp|101}} Examining the [[trial of Socrates]], he argues that "his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country" as "it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed."<ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007" />{{Rp|101}} As such, his crime "was a useful prelude to reforms."<ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007" />{{Rp|102}} In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society.<ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007" />{{Rp|101}}  <blockquote>

The authority which the moral conscience enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself…[even] the originality of the criminal…shall also be possible. </blockquote>

==== Deviance ====
Durkheim thought [[Deviance (sociology)#Deviance|deviance]] to be an essential component of a functional society.<ref name="Textbook">{{cite book|url=https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-sociology-2e|title=Introduction to Sociology|publisher=OpenStax|isbn=978-1-947172-11-1|edition=2|pages=138|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> He believed that deviance had three possible effects on society:<ref name="Textbook" /><ref>"[https://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/7-2-explaining-deviance/ 7.2 Explaining Deviance]." ''Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World''. [[University of Minnesota Libraries]] (2016). {{ISBN|978-1-946135-24-7}}.</ref>

# Deviance challenges the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society.
# Deviant acts may support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors.
# Reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity.

Durkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to [[Strain theory (sociology)#Merton'sTheory|Robert Merton's Strain Theory]].<ref name="Textbook" />

====Suicide====
{{main|Suicide (Durkheim book)}}
In ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated [[suicide]] as a [[social fact]], explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /><ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=131}}</ref>

Durkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one's circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms.

He created a [[Normative statement|normative theory]] of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. Proposing four different types of suicide, which include [[Egoism|''egoistic'']], [[Altruism|''altruistic'']], [[Anomie|''anomic'']], and [[Fatalism|''fatalistic'']], Durkheim began his theory by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis:

* ''Egoistic suicide'' corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that they have not made a difference in anyone's lives. 
* ''Altruistic suicide'' corresponds to too much social integration. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. 
* ''Anomic suicide'' occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term ''anomie'', meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. 
* ''Fatalistic suicide'' results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to a belief that there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.

This study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],<ref>{{harvp|Stark|Bainbridge|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&pg=PA32 p. 32]}}</ref> who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may have always been the [[Spurious relationship|spurious reflection]] of other factors.<ref>{{harvp|Pope|Danigelis|1981}}</ref> Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the [[Fallacy|logical error]] termed the [[ecological fallacy]].<ref>Freedman, David A. 2002. ''[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/ecofall.txt The Ecological Fallacy]''. Berkeley: Dept. of Statistics, [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]].</ref><ref>{{harvp|Selvin|1965}}</ref> However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy.<ref>{{harvp|van Poppel|Day|1996|p=500}}</ref> More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the [[Structure and agency|micro–macro relations]] underlying Durkheim's work.<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|pp=78–79}}</ref> Some, such as [[Alex Inkeles|Inkeles]] (1959),<ref>{{harvp|Inkeles|1959}}</ref> Johnson (1965),<ref>{{harvp|Johnson|1965}}</ref> and Gibbs (1968),<ref>{{harvp|Gibbs|Martin|1958}}</ref> have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide ''sociologically'' within a [[holism|holistic]] perspective, emphasizing that "he intended his theory to explain variation among [[social environment]]s in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals."<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|p=60}}</ref>

Despite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of [[Control theory (sociology)|control theory]], and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]].<ref name="Poggi_1" />{{Rp||at=ch.1}}

===Religion===
In ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912), Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /> His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of [[spirituality]] and [[God]].<ref name="Allan_1152">{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=112-15}}</ref>

Durkheim defined ''religion'' as:<ref>Durkheim, Emile. 1964 [1915]. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427 The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]'', translated by J. W. Swain. London: [[George Allen & Unwin]]. – via [[Project Gutenberg]] (2012). [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_47 p. 47].</ref> <blockquote>"a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite in one single [[moral community]] called a [[Church body|Church]], all those who adhere to them."</blockquote>In this definition, Durkheim avoids references to [[supernatural]] or God.<ref name="Allan_115">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=115}}</ref> Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural—that which cannot be rationally explained—from natural, that which can.<ref name="Allan_116">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=116}}</ref> Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural.<ref name="Allan_116" /> Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as [[Buddhism]], where the [[Four Noble Truths]] are much more important than any individual deity.<ref name="Allan_116" /> With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts:<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=116, 118, 120, 137}}</ref>

* The [[sacred]]:  ideas and sentiments kindled by the spectacle of society and which inspire awe, spiritual devotion or respect;
* The [[belief]]s & [[ritual|practices]]: creating an emotional state of ''[[collective effervescence]]'', investing symbols with sacred importance;
* The [[moral community]]: a group of people sharing a common [[moral philosophy]].

Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred,<ref name="Allan_116" /><ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=25}}</ref> noting that it is at the very core of a religion:<ref name=":2">Durkheim, Emile. 1964 [1915]. ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]'', translated by J. W. Swain. London: [[George Allen & Unwin]]. – via [[Project Gutenberg]] (2012).</ref>{{Rp|322}}<blockquote>They are only collective forces [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasized]], that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.<ref group="lower-roman">Durkheim 1915, [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_322 p. 322]: "They are not homogeneous with the visible things among which we place them. They may well take from these things the outward and material forms in which they are represented, but they owe none of their efficacy to them. They are not united by external bonds to the different supports upon which they alight; they have no roots there; according to an expression we have already used and which serves best for characterizing them, ''they are added to them''. So there are no objects which are predestined to receive them, to the exclusion of all others; even the most insignificant and vulgar may do so; accidental circumstances decide which are the chosen ones."</ref></blockquote>Durkheim saw religion as the most fundamental [[social institution]] of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms.<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=112-13}}</ref> It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name="Allan_114">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=114}}</ref> Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early [[hunter and gatherer]] societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them.<ref name="Allan_137" /> Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane.<ref name="Allan_137" /> However, Durkheim also believed that [[religion]] was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by [[science]] and the cult of an individual.<ref name="Allan_132-133" /><ref name="Allan_112">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=112}}</ref><blockquote>Thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined to survive all the particular symbols in which religious thought has successively enveloped itself.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|427}}</blockquote>However, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it.<ref name="Allan_114" /> And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as "a period of transition and moral mediocrity."<ref name="Allan_134" />

Durkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion.<ref name="Allan_113"/> It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society.<ref name="Allan_114"/> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /> Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /> In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing [[category of being|categories]] as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /><ref>{{harvp|McKinnon|2014}}</ref> Our understanding of the world is shaped by [[social facts]]; for example the notion of [[time]] is defined by being measured through a [[calendar]], which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion.<ref name="Allan_114"/> In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion.<ref name="Allan_114"/> Durkheim states that, "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.<ref name="Allan_114"/>

In his work, Durkheim focused on ''[[totemism]]'', the religion of the [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. Durkheim saw this religion as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.<ref name="Calhoun2002-10632" /><ref name="Allan_115"/> As such, he wrote:<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|220}}<blockquote>Now the totem is the flag of the clan. It is therefore natural that the impressions aroused by the clan in individual minds—impressions of dependence and of increased vitality—should fix themselves to the idea of the totem rather than that of the clan: for the clan is too complex a reality to be represented clearly in all its complex unity by such rudimentary intelligences.</blockquote>Durkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, [[Arnold van Gennep]], an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were "entirely erroneous". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.<ref>{{harvp|Thomassen|2012}}</ref>

Despite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, "have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization."<ref>Jones, Robert Alun. 1986.

===Sociology of knowledge===

While Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, [[Sociology of the family|the family]], [[social structure]]s, and [[Institution|social institutions]], a large part of his work deals with the [[sociology of knowledge]].

While publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career,<ref group="lower-roman">For example, the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' (1902), written with [[Marcel Mauss]].</ref> Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 ''magnum opus'', ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.<ref>Durkheim, Emile. 2003 [1912]. ''Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse'' (5th ed.). [[Presses Universitaires de France]]. {{p.|628}}.</ref> In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the ''[[tabula rasa]]'' empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal [[A priori and a posteriori|''a'' ''prioris'']] (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.<ref group="lower-roman">See Durkheim (1912)  p.

==== Collective representations ====
Another key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge outlined in ''Elementary Forms'' is the concept of {{Lang-fr|représentations collectives|label=none}} ("[[collective representations]]"). ''{{Lang-fr|Représentations collectives|label=none}}'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''{{Lang-fr|représentations collectives|label=none}}'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such, these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual—since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole—yet, simultaneously within each individual of the society, by virtue of that individual's participation within society.<ref name="Durkheim, Emile 1964">Durkheim, Emile. (1964). ''The elementary forms of the religious life.'' London: Allen & Unwin.</ref>

Arguably the most important "{{Lang-fr|représentations collectives|label=none}}" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own:<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|435}}<blockquote>If concepts were only general ideas, they would not enrich knowledge a great deal, for, as we have already pointed out, the general contains nothing more than the particular. But if before all else they are collective representations, they add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.</blockquote>As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society was developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].

=== Morality ===
{{Quote frame |quote=How many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! |author=Émile Durkheim |source=''[[The Division of Labour in Society#DivisionofLabourinSociety|''Division of Labour in Society'']]''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=T. Anthony|title=Durkheim, Deviance and Development: Opportunities Lost and Regained|journal=Social Forces|date=June 1981|volume=59|issue=Special Issue|pages=1009–1024|doi=10.2307/2577978|jstor=2577978}}</ref>|align=right|1}}

Durkheim defines morality as "a system of rules for conduct."<ref>Durkheim, Émile. 2004. ''Sociologie et Philosophie''. Paris: [[Presses Universitaires de France]]. {{p.|50}}.</ref> His analysis of morality is strongly marked by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.

Durkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, "a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character."<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|38}} Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the [[categorical imperative]]. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common [[Summum bonum|Good]], and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|54}}

However, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|73}}

==Influence and legacy==

Durkheim has had an important impact on the development of anthropology and sociology as disciplines. The establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline, in particular, is among Durkheim's largest and most lasting legacies.<ref name="Calhoun2002-107" /> Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism, or [[structural functionalism]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-107" /><ref name="Allan_103" /> Scholars inspired by Durkheim include [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Célestin Bouglé]], [[Gustave Belot]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]], social reformer Patrick Hunout, and others.<ref name="Calhoun2002-107" />

More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as [[Steven Lukes]], [[Robert N. Bellah]], and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. His description of ''[[collective consciousness]]'' also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of [[Ziya Gökalp]], the founding father of [[Sociology in Turkey|Turkish sociology]].<ref name="Turkay Salim Nefes">{{harvp|Nefes|2013}}</ref> [[Randall Collins]] has developed a theory of what he calls ''interaction ritual chains'', a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with that of [[Erving Goffman]]'s [[Microsociology|micro-sociology]]. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the ''interaction order''.

Outside of sociology, Durkheim has influenced philosophers, including [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and his ideas can be identified, inexplicitly, in the work of certain [[Structuralism|structuralist]] theorists of the 1960s, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Michel Foucault]].<ref group="lower-roman">{{harvp|Bourdieu|Passeron|1967|pp=167–68}}: "For, speaking more generally, all the social sciences now live in the house of Durkheimism, unbeknownst to them, as it were, because they walked into it backwards."</ref>

===Durkheim contra Searle===
Much of Durkheim's work remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof, one can look to [[John Searle]], whose book, ''The Construction of Social Reality'', elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that Searle believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. [[Neil Gross]], however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.<ref>{{harvp|Gross|2006}}</ref> Searle responded by arguing that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work: "Because Durkheim’s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work."<ref>{{harvp|Searle|2006}}</ref> [[Steven Lukes|Stephen Lukes]], however, responded to Searle's reply to Gross, refuting, point by point, the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.<ref>{{Citation|last=Lukes|first=Steven|title=Searle versus Durkheim|date=2007|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-6104-2_9|work=Intentional Acts and Institutional Facts: Essays on John Searle's Social Ontology|pages=191–202|editor-last=Tsohatzidis|editor-first=Savas L.|series=Theory and Decision Library|place=Dordrecht|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6104-2_9|isbn=978-1-4020-6104-2|access-date=2020-12-05}}</ref>

===Gilbert pro Durkheim===
[[Margaret Gilbert]], a contemporary British philosopher of social phenomena, has offered a close, sympathetic reading of Durkheim's discussion of social facts in chapter 1 and the prefaces of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]''. In her 1989 book, ''On Social Facts''—the title of which may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his "{{Lang-fr|faits sociaux|label=none}}"—Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.<ref>[[Margaret Gilbert|Gilbert, Margaret]]. 1989. ''On Social Facts''. chap. 4, s.2.</ref>
