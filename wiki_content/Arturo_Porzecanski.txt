'''Arturo C. Porzecanski''' is a Uruguayan-born [[economist]] who has spent his entire adult life in the United States.

== Early life ==

Born (November 2, 1949) and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay, of European Jewish immigrant parents, Porzecanski came to the United States in early 1968 and earned his B.A. degree in economics at [[Whittier College]] (1968-1971) and then his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] (1971-1975).

== Financial industry career ==

After a summer internship as a visiting economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]] (1973), and a year-and-a-half stint as a research economist at the [http://www.cemla.org/english.html Center for Latin American Monetary Studies] in Mexico City (1975–76), he began his Wall Street career as an international economist and country risk analyst at the [[Morgan Guaranty Trust Company|Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York]], one of the forerunners of today's [[JP Morgan Chase]] (1977-1989). He went on to become the chief economist at [[Republic National Bank of New York]] (1989-1992); chief emerging-markets economist at [[Kidder, Peabody & Co.]] (1992-1993);<ref>Kidder Hires Economist ''The New York Times''.

== Academia, think tanks and related ==

Porzecanski opened up a second act in his professional career in mid-2005 by becoming a full-time university professor of international economics, a shift in professional direction that was part of a generational handover by Wall Street pioneers in emerging-markets research who had also taken early retirement and started out on new career paths.<ref>Esterl, Mike "[http://arturo.porzecanski.com/Wall%20Street%20Old%20Guard%20in%20Emerging%20Markets%20Heads%20Out.pdf Wall Street's Old Guard in Emerging Markets Heads Out]." ''Dow Jones Newswire''. 11 March 2005.</ref> Having taught economics on an adjunct basis at [[Columbia University]] and [[New York University]], he was a visiting professor of economics at [[Williams College]] in Spring 2005. He was appointed to the faculty of the [[School of International Service]] at [[American University]] as of Fall 2005, first as Scholar of International Finance and then, as of Fall 2007, as Distinguished Economist in Residence. In 2012, he was also named Director of the International Economic Relations M.A. degree program at SIS, a position held until August 2018. In mid-2021, after sixteen years, Porzecanski retired from his full-time faculty appointment.<ref>[https://www.american.edu/provost/communications/april-8-2021.cfm American University memorandum, April 8, 2021.]</ref>

Besides devoting himself to teaching, mentoring and policy-oriented research in his field, Porzecanski has provided expert-witness and other consulting services to law firms and institutional investors, as well as to U.S. government agencies and multilateral organizations. He has also served as a Dispute Resolution Arbitrator for the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] and was a Senior Associate at the think tank [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] during 2007–2013. In July 2020, President [[Donald Trump]] appointed Porzecanski to the [https://sites.ed.gov/hispanic-initiative/presidential-advisory-commission/ President's Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity].<ref>[https://www.american.edu/news/20200918-arturo-porzecanski-honored.cfm Arturo Porzecanski honored by the White House]</ref> Following his retirement from academia, he was named Research Fellow by American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies,<ref>[https://www.american.edu/centers/latin-american-latino-studies/research-fellows.cfm#txt-5784780 Porzecanski in list of AU/CLALS Research Fellows]</ref> and Global Fellow by the think tank [[The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]].<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/arturo-c-porzecanski Porzecanski in Wilson Center website]</ref>

== Patient advocacy ==

Since late 2005, Porzecanski has struggled with an exceedingly rare illness, [[Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome]] (SCLS), which left him partially disabled and brought him near death several times. He became an international advocate for those affected by the disease, setting up a website for patients, caregivers and physicians around the world to share information and provide support, and serving as its resident expert.<ref>[https://rareshare.org/communities/systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome#community_leader Porzecanski in Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome website on RareShare.org]</ref> He also persuaded the [[National Institutes of Health]] to carry out basic biomedical research on this syndrome. In early 2009, Porzecanski was profiled in the Health section of [[The Washington Post]] for this initiative and his determination to cope with this life- and limb-threatening illness.<ref>Bhanoo, Sindya N.
