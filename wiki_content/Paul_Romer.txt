==Early life and education==
Romer was born to former Colorado governor [[Roy Romer]] and Beatrice "Bea" Miller. He has four brothers and two sisters. One of his brothers, [[Chris Romer]], is a former Colorado state senator.<ref name=atlantic>{{Cite web| title=The Politically Incorrect Guide to Ending Poverty |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty/308134/ |work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=July–August 2010 }}</ref>

He graduated in 1973<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Romer '73 awarded Nobel Prize in economics |url=https://www.exeter.edu/news/paul-romer-%E2%80%9973-awarded-nobel-prize-economics |website=Phillips Exeter Academy |access-date=11 April 2021 |language=en |date=8 November 2018}}</ref> from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].

==Career==
Romer's most important work is in the field of economic growth, and he has made important contributions in the development of [[endogenous growth theory]]. He was named one of America's 25 most influential people by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1997,<ref>{{cite news| title=Time's 25 Most Influential Americans | work=[[Time Magazine]] | publisher = Time Inc. |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986206-10,00.html | access-date=2007-12-21 | date=1997-04-21}}</ref> and he was awarded the [[H. C. Recktenwald Prize in Economics|Horst Claus Recktenwald Prize in Economics]] in 2002. In 2015, he was recipient of the John R. Commons Award, given by the economics honor society [[Omicron Delta Epsilon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omicrondeltaepsilon.org/awards.html|title = Omicron Delta Epsilon - the International Economics Honor Society}}</ref>

===Academia===
Romer's research on economic growth followed extensive studies of long-run growth during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Solow |first=Robert M. |title=Perspectives on Growth Theory |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=45–54 |jstor=2138150 |doi=10.1257/jep.8.1.45|doi-access=free }}</ref> The [[Solow–Swan model]], for example, established the primacy of technological progress in accounting for sustained increases in output per worker. His 1983 [[Thesis|dissertation]], supervised by [[José Scheinkman]] and [[Robert Lucas Jr.]], amounted to constructing mathematical representations of economies in which [[technological change]] is the result of the intentional actions of people, such as research and development. It led to two ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' articles published in 1986 and 1990, respectively, which started endogenous growth theory.

He taught at the [[University of Rochester]], the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]] and [[New York University]].<ref name=":0" />

===Business===

Romer temporarily left academia in 2001 to found [[Aplia]], a company which produces online [[problem set]]s for college students; Aplia was purchased in 2007 by [[Cengage Learning]].

He is credited with the quote "A crisis is a terrible thing to waste," which he said during a November 2004 venture-capitalist meeting in California. Although he was referring to the rapidly rising education levels in other countries compared to the United States, the quote became a rallying concept for economists and consultants looking for constructive opportunities amid the [[Great Recession]].<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/magazine/02FOB-onlanguage-t.html| work=The New York Times | title= A Terrible Thing to Waste | first= Jack | last=Rosenthal | date=2009-07-31 | access-date=2011-10-09}}</ref>

===Charter cities===
Romer has attempted to replicate the success of [[charter city|charter cities]] and make them an engine of economic growth in developing countries. He promoted this idea in a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk in 2009,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSHBma0Ithk Paul Romer: Why the world needs charter cities], TED talk August 2009</ref> and he has argued that with better rules and institutions less developed nations can be set on a different and better trajectory for growth.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/can-charter-cities-change-the-world-a-qa-with-paul-romer/ | work=The New York Times | title=Can "Charter Cities" Change the World? A Q&A With Paul Romer | first=Dwyer | last=Gunn | date=2009-09-29 | access-date=2010-05-22}}</ref> In his model, a host country would turn responsibility for a charter city over to a more developed trustee nation, which would allow for new rules of governance to emerge. People could "vote with their feet" for or against these rules.<ref name=atlantic/>

The government of [[Honduras]] considered creating charter cities, though without the oversight of a third-party government, which some argue is [[neo-colonialism]].<ref name=atlantic /> Romer served as chair of a "transparency committee" but resigned in September 2012 when the Honduran government agency responsible for the project signed agreements with international developers without involvement of the committee.<ref>{{cite news|title=Plan for Charter City to Fight Honduras Poverty Loses Its Initiator|date=30 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/world/americas/charter-city-plan-to-fight-honduras-poverty-loses-initiator.html?_r=0}}</ref>

===World Bank===

He became [[World Bank Chief Economist]] in October 2016. He resigned on 24 January 2018,<ref name=FT2018-01-24/><ref name=Reuters2018-01-24/> following a controversy in which he stated in an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' on January 12,<ref name=WSJ2018-01-12>{{cite news|author1=Josh Zumbrun|author2=Ian Talley|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-bank-unfairly-influenced-its-own-competitiveness-rankings-1515797620|title=World Bank Unfairly Influenced Its Own Competitiveness Rankings|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=12 January 2018|access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=Reuters2018-01-24/>  that during the tenure of [[Chile]]'s [[Socialist Party of Chile|socialist]] [[President of Chile|President]] [[Michelle Bachelet]] from 2014 onwards, Chile's ranking for ease of doing business had been downgraded by the [[World Bank]] as a result of changes of methodology which he claimed may have been politically motivated,<ref name=Reuters2018-01-24>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-worldbank-economist-romer/world-bank-economist-paul-romer-quits-after-chile-comments-idUSKBN1FD38Y|title=World Bank economist Paul Romer quits after Chile comments|publisher=Reuters|date=24 January 2018|access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref> a claim denied by the former World Bank economist responsible for compiling Chile's ranking, Chilean economist Augusto Lopez-Claros.<ref name=BBC2018-01-15>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42685172|title=Chile complains of World Bank unfair treatment|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2018|access-date=8 October 2018|quote=In an interview given to the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, the World Bank economist who had been responsible for the rankings, Augusto Lopez-Claros, said changes in methodology "took place in a transparent and open context," denying any political bias.}}</ref><ref name=Bloomberg2018-01-13>{{cite news|author1=Oscar Medina|author2=Andrew Rosati|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-13/chile-demands-answers-in-world-bank-business-ranking-controversy|title=World Bank to Probe Chile's Business Ranking After Bias Alleged|publisher=Bloomberg|date=13 January 2018|access-date=8 October 2018|quote=Chilean economist Augusto Lopez-Claros, who was in charge of compiling Chile’s ranking for the World Bank report, said accusations of political manipulation were “wholly without merit.”}}</ref>

===Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics===
[[File:Paul Romer EM1B6039 (46234134401).jpg|thumb|262px|Paul Romer during Nobel press conference in Stockholm, December 2018]]
Romer shared the 2018 Prize with [[William Nordhaus]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Appelbaum | first = Binyamin | title = 2018 Nobel in Economics Awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 8, 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/business/economic-science-nobel-prize.html}}</ref> In choosing Romer as one of the 2018 economics laureates, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] stated that he had shown "how knowledge can function as a driver of long-term economic growth. . . . [Prior macroeconomic studies]  had not modelled how economic decisions and market conditions determine the creation of new technologies. Paul Romer solved this problem by demonstrating how economic forces govern the willingness of firms to produce new ideas and innovations."<ref name=nobelprize />

After receiving the prize, Romer described how he started thinking about the relationship between growth and innovation:
"The question that I first asked was, why was progress . . . speeding up over time? It arises because of this special characteristic of an idea, which is if [a million people try] to discover something, if any one person finds it, everybody can use the idea."<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Kiernan | first1 = Paul | last2 = Sugden | first2 = Joanna | title = Two Top U.S. Economists Win Nobel for Work on Growth and Climate: Research of William D.
