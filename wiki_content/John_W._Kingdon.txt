==Scholarly influence==
Kingdon is a specialist in American politics, and has written influential books such as ''Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies'',<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://prq.sagepub.com/content/27/4/749.extract |title=Book Reviews: Congressmen's Voting Decisions.

==Core ideas==
Kingdon argues that the structure of American political institutions, especially Congress, encourages fragmentation and splintering in American national governance. He also believes this occurs more in the United States than elsewhere.

In his book ''Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies'' he proposed that for an [[Social issue|issue]] to get on the [[political agenda]], three flux must encounter:
* The problem;
* The solution;
* The political will.

Effectively, if there is no solution to a problem, it would be impossible to get the political attention. There can be a wonderful idea in the air, but if this is not answering any prominent problem, no political attention will be raised. Finally, there can be a political will to solve a problem, but if no solution is available, nothing will happen. Political will comes from both predictable elements such as post-elections and unpredictable ones like natural disasters. The three flux must encounter in order to get the political attention to use an available solution to solve an existing problem. Individual [[policy entrepreneur]]s are needed to build acceptance for solutions and to create couplings between these streams of problems, solutions, and political will.

In his book, ''America the Unusual'', Kingdon states that both American institutions and American ideologies are a source of explanation for why the United States differs in its public policy from other Westernized democracies. For example, the United States' relatively small public sector is partially due to the government's restraints placed upon it in the Constitution, but also partially due to Americans' sustained preference for having a limited government.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=John |title=America the Unusual |date=1999 |publisher=Wadsworth |page=53}}</ref> Kingdon stresses the historical consequences of both American institutions and American ideology, and that they have resulted in American citizens persistently holding a "right of center" position regarding the desired size of the federal government, compared to other developed nations. Kingdon concludes in ''America the Unusual'' that United States' lawmakers need to abandon public policy creation beginning with ideology—favoring the use of political pragmatism instead. Creation of new public laws, or edits to the federal budget due to ideological motivations, such as individualism, will be ineffective to combat rising issues such as climate change and population growth in the coming decades, Kingdon argues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=John |title=America the Unusual |date=1999 |publisher=Wadsworth |pages=98–100}}</ref>
