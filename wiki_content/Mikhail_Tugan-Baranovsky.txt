'''Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky''' ( Михаил Иванович Туган-Барановский, {{lang-uk|Михайло Іванович Туган-Барановський}}, Mykhailo Ivanovich Tuhan-Baranovskyi) was a Ukrainian [[economist]], politician, statesman. He is remembered as one of the founders of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] and one of the earliest Ukrainian ministers of finances in the Vynnychenko's [[General Secretariat of Ukraine|General Secretariat]] of the [[Central Council of Ukraine]]. In professional circles he is remembered as a leading exponent of [[Legal Marxism]] in the Tsarist Russian Empire and was the author of numerous works dealing with the [[Value (economics)|theory of value]], the [[Allocative efficiency|distribution of a social revenue]], history of managerial development, and fundamentals of cooperative managerial activities.

==Early life==
Mikhail Ivanovich Tugan-Baranovsky was born on 8 January 1865 in the village of [[Kupiansk Raion|Solyonoe]] in the [[Kupyansky Uyezd]] of the [[Kharkov Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]). His father's distant ancestors were [[Lipka Tatar]]s who had come to Lithuania in the 14th century; the full family name was Tugan Mirza Baranovsky.<ref>A.V. Tyrkova-Williams, ''Na putiakh k svobode'' (''On the Path to Freedom''). New York: 1942; p. 38. Cited in Richard Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists: A Study of 'Legal Marxism' in Russia.'' Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, 1962; p. 52.</ref> 

Tugan-Baranovsky attended high school in the cities of [[Kyiv]] and Kharkiv, developing an early affinity for philosophy, including the works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. In 1884 he entered [[Kharkiv University]], beginning his studies in the natural sciences. He was awarded the degree of [[Candidate of Sciences]] in 1888 but he became interested in [[political economy]] and wound up completing his studies as an [[distance education|external student]] with a degree from the school's Faculty of Law and Economics in 1890. While in college Tugan-Baranovsky became active in the revolutionary movement which sought to overthrow [[Tsarism]] in Russia, briefly making the acquaintance of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s older brother, [[Aleksandr Ulyanov]], who was executed in 1887 for his part in the attempted assassination of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]].<ref name=Kind52>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 52.</ref>

In November 1886 Tugan-Baranovsky was arrested for participating in a student demonstration in [[St. Petersburg]] marking the 25th anniversary of the death of critical writer [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov]]. As a result of the arrest Tugan-Baranovsky was expelled from the capital city, falling out of contact with the ill-fated older Ulyanov. Tugan-Baranovsky married the daughter of the director of the [[St. Petersburg Conservatory]], Lydia Davydova, in 1889.<ref name=Kind53>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 53.</ref>

==Academic career==

Shortly after his marriage, Tugan-Baranovsky began what would be a long running and esteemed academic career. His first scholarly article, "The Doctrine of the Marginal Utility of Economic Goods", saw print in October 1890 in the journal ''Iuridicheskii Vestnik'' (Jurisprudence Courier).<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' pp. 53-54.</ref> In this work, which presaged his later criticism of [[Marxism]], Tugan-Baranovsky argued that the [[labor theory of value]] and contemporary [[marginalism|Marginalist economics]] were in basic agreement rather than in antagonistic opposition.<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 54.</ref>

After this first foray into theoretical economics, Tugan-Baranovsky turned his hand to the writing of biography, contributing short popular sketches of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] to a series entitled "Lives of Remarkable Men", produced by the publisher Pavlenkov.<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' pp. 54-55.</ref> In these roughly 80-page books Tugan-Baranovsky was highly critical of Proudhon for his lack of internal consistency, stylistic obscurity, lack of imagination, and hypocritical support of the regime of [[Louis Napoleon]].<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 55.</ref> He was much more sympathetic to Mill, hailing the  economist as one who "more than anyone else helped the spread throughout the civilized world of a right understanding of the spirit of contemporary science, based on the study of nature."<ref>M.I. Tugan-Baranovsky, ''J.S. Mill,'' p. 71. Quoted in Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' pp. 55–56.</ref>

Following the intellectual example of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]], Tugan-Baranovsky looked to England for the path that developing nations such as Russia inevitably must travel.<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' pp. 56–57.</ref> He next journeyed to London in the spring and summer of 1891 to work in the [[British Museum]], there examining the collection of rare books and statistical works.<ref name=Kind57>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 57.</ref> He then returned to Russia, spending two more years at work in St. Petersburg on a substantial tome of [[business cycle]] theory, ''Industrial Crises in Contemporary England: Their Causes and Influences on the Life of the People.''<ref name=Kind57 /> Publication of the book in 1894 earned Tugan-Baranovsky a [[Magister (degree)|Master's degree]] in Political Economics from [[Moscow University]].<ref name=Kind57 />

The achievement of this academic rank allowed Tugan-Baranovsky to gain employment in academia, accepting an appointment as a [[Privatdozent]] (lecturer) at [[Saint Petersburg State University|St. Petersburg University]].<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 58.</ref> According to his student and biographer [[Nikolai Kondratiev]], Tugan-Baranovsky retained this position until 1899, when he was dismissed for political unreliability.<ref>N.D. Kondratiev, ''Mikhail Ivanovich Tugan-Baranovsky.'' St. Petersburg: 1923; p. 115. Cited in Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 58, fn. 4.</ref>

In 1917 Tugan published a book "Paper Currency and Metal", where he presented a theory of fiat paper currency, believing that a new stage in monetary history after the war was coming. He connected the value of fiat currency with the business cycle and with aggregate demand. He proposed active monetary policy, mainly through exchange rate control. In many respects he could be considered as a forerunner of the theory of endogenous money.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://classiques-garnier.com/revue-d-histoire-de-la-pensee-economique-2020-2-n-10-varia-discussion-on-paper-currency-among-russian-economists-during-the-great-war-19141917-with-special-emphasis-on-tugan-baranovsky-s-contributions.html|title=Nenovsky Nikolay.

==Political activities==

In 1895 Tugan-Baranovsky and his co-thinker [[Peter Berngardovich Struve|Peter Struve]] joined the [[Free Economic Society|Free Economical Association]], of which he became the chairman in 1896.<ref>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' pp. 58–59.</ref> In December of that year he published a seminal article of Marxist theory, frequently reprinted, "The Significance of the Economic Factor in History", which drew the attention and written replies of leading ''[[narodnik]]'' critics such as [[Vasily Vorontsov]] and [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]].<ref name=Kind59>Kindersley, ''The First Russian Revisionists,'' p. 59.</ref> 
In April 1900, Tugan-Baranovsky participated in the organizational meeting to create the [[Iskra]] newspaper, which later became the basis for the creation of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]].<ref name=heritage >[https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/nasledie-m-i-tugan-baranovskogo М.И. Воейков. НАСЛЕДИЕ М .И. ТУГАН-БАРАНОВСКОГО]</ref> While he consistently expressed Marxist economic and political ideas in this period, there is no indication that Tugan-Baranovsky ever joined the underground Social Democratic movement which was then emerging in Russia.<ref name=Kind59 />

It was also during this time that his ''magnum opus,'' ''The Russian Factory in Past and Present'' appeared.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Geschichte_der_russischen_Fabrik.pdf | author=Michael Tugan-Baranovsky | title=Geschichte der russischen Fabrik | location=Berlin | publisher=Emil Felber | year=1900 | language=de }}</ref><ref>In English: ''The Russian Factory in the 19th Century'', translated by Arthur Levin, Claora S. Levin and Gregory Grossman, Homewood, Ill.: Richard D. Irwin, 1970.</ref>  The publication of this book led in 1898 to Tugan-Baranovsky receiving a doctorate degree from [[Moscow University]].

From 1901 to 1905 Tugan-Baranovsky participated in the public life of the Poltava region where he joined the local [[zemstvo]] (a form of local government). Later he returned to St. Petersburg, lecturing as private docent and as professor in the economics departments of various local polytechnic and commercial institutes and also at the private university of Shaniavsky in Moscow.

After February [[Russian Revolution|Revolution 1917]] in [[Russian Empire]] he went back in Ukraine where he became a Finance minister in the government of [[Central Council of Ukraine]] (August – November 1917). Then he founded Ukrainian National University, Institute of Economic condition, and Demographic Institute in [[Kyiv]]. The member of [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (1918), a head of social-economic department (1919).

==Interest in Neokantianism==
[[Image:Myhaylo Tuhan-Baranovsky.jpg|thumb|Monument to M.I. Tugan-Baranovsky (near Donetsk Commercial University).]]

During the early years of the 20th century he completely moved away from the popular views of legal Marxism towards the [[neokantianism]] that is reflected in his various works regarding the [[Co-operative economics|cooperative movement]]. In 1901-–902 Tugan-Baranovsky published his "Notes from the History of Political Economics" in the journal ''Narodnoe Bagatstvo'' (National Wealth), where he described the history of economics doctrines in the [[Russian Empire]], and "Notes of the Newest History in Political Economics" (1903). This work was translated into German in 1915. Later he published various other works in Russian and German as well.

In 1919 his first publication in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] appeared, ''Cooperation, its nature and goals''. Other works continued to appear up until 1923. Since 1906 he was the chief editor of ''Vestnik Kooperatsii'' (Cooperative Digest). Before [[World War I]] he worked, along with [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]] and other Ukrainian academicians, on the encyclopedia ''Ukrainsky narod v ego proshlom i nastoyaschem'' (The Ukrainian nation in its past and present). As the member of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Federalists quit the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine|General Secretariat]] on 20 November 1917 in the protest to the proclamation of the Third ''Universal'' of the [[Central Rada]] that advocated a wider autonomy to [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]].

Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky was one of the founders of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine]], as well as the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine|Secretary of Finance]] of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

==Death==
In January 1919, while en route via train to attend the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], Tugan-Baranovsky suffered a fatal heart attack.<ref name=Barnett>{{ cite journal |author=Vincent Barnett |author-link=Vincent Barnett (economist) |year=2004 |title=Tugan-Baranovsky, the Methodology of Political Economy, and the "Russian Historical School" |journal=[[History of Political Economy]]
