Then, instead of reporting on how Latino voters were a very important part of the Biden coalition, and provided the margin of victory due to very robust voter turnout in states like Arizona and Nevada, the media decided to go on a full-fledged assault about how Latinos were fleeing the Democratic Party. This is complete nonsense. What we saw in 2020 was first and foremost an incredible voter turnout among Latinos; our ballots cast grew by about 30% since 2016 compared to 15% growth for the country as a whole. Latino voters came out in huge numbers in Maricopa and Pima counties in Arizona for Biden. Latino voters, mostly Puerto Rican, came out in big numbers for Biden in Philadelphia. Latino voters came out in record-breaking numbers for Biden, and then Warnock and Ossoff in Georgia. These stories were ignored in favor of the Miami and RGV fixation of the Latino swing to Trump.

== Voting Rights Act Expert ==
In 2009 Barreto published one of the first academic studies on the impact of voter identification laws (co-authored with [https://www.unm.edu/~sanchezg/ Dr. Gabriel Sanchez] and [https://nau.edu/sbs/politics/faculty-staff/nuno-stephen/ Dr. Stephen Nuño]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mattbarreto.com/papers/PS_VoterID.pdf|title=The Disproportionate Impact of Voter-ID Requirements on the Electorate—New Evidence from Indiana|last=PS: Political Science & Politics|date=|website=www.apsanet.org/ps|publisher=Cambridge Press|access-date=}}</ref> His early research documented that racial minorities and low-income citizens had lower rates of government-issued photo identification and could face barriers to voting under strict voter ID laws. As more states passed voter ID laws Barreto and Sanchez were retained by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and other lawyers challenging these laws to provide expert reports and testify at trial about their research findings.

In Texas, Federal Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos wrote that Barreto and Sanchez are “[http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/20141009-TXID-Opinion.pdf experts in survey research, particularly in the field of racial and ethnic politics,” who “conducted a four-week survey of over 2,300 eligible voters in Texas, and concluded that African-American eligible voters are 1.78 times more likely to lack qualified SB 14 ID than Anglo eligible voters. The observed racial disparity was magnified with Hispanic eligible voters as they are 2.42 times more likely to lack qualified SB 14 ID compared to Anglo eligible voters].” (pg 57). In examining the evidence put forth by Barreto and Sanchez,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lawyerscommittee.org/pages/vra-at-50/|title=The VRA at 50: The Texas Voter ID Story|newspaper=Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> the court wrote that the experts “[http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/20141009-TXID-Opinion.pdf are impressively credentialed and who explained their data, methodologies, and other facts upon which they relied in clear terms according to generally accepted and reliable scientific methods for their respective fields. The Court finds that approximately 608,470 registered voters in Texas lack proper SB 14 ID. The Court also finds that SB 14 disproportionately impacts both African-Americans and Hispanics in Texas].” (pg 59).

In 2016 Barreto and Sanchez conducted a survey and authored an expert report in North Dakota which found Native Americans were disadvantaged by the state's voter ID law.  According to their report 23.5% of Native Americans lacked a valid ID compared to 12% of non-Native Americans in North Dakota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3002700/North-Dakota-Ruling.pdf|title=Brakebill v. Jaeger Motion for Preliminary Injunction|last=Hovland|first=Daniel L.|date=August 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> In August 2016 a Federal Court issued a preliminary injunction against the voter identification law based on Barreto's research.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/north-dakotas-voter-id-law-is-latest-to-be-overturned/|title=North Dakota's Voter ID Law Latest to Be Overturned|newspaper=FRONTLINE|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>  In his ruling, Judge Daniel L. Hovland wrote "[https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3002700/North-Dakota-Ruling.pdf The Defendant has provided no legislative testimony or findings to counter the Barreto/Sanchez Survey, nor in any manner challenged any of the evidence the Plaintiffs have submitted...Given the thorough and unrefuted record developed by the Plaintiffs in this case, and the lack of any evidence presented by the Defendant to the contrary, the Court gives the findings of the Barreto/Sanchez Survey, and the other studies and data presented by the Plaintiffs, considerable weight]" (pg 9)

Similar to the outcomes in Texas and North Dakota, a state court in Pennsylvania struck down a voter ID law.  As in the Texas and North Dakota cases, Barreto worked with Sanchez on a survey and expert report which documented that the Pennsylvania voter ID law had a discriminatory effect and would negatively impact hundreds of thousands of potential voters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2014/01/27/latino-decisions-research-critical-to-overturning-pennsylvania-voter-id-law/|title=Latino Decisions research critical to overturning Pennsylvania Voter-ID law|date=2014-01-27|newspaper=Latino Decisions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>  In January 2014 after an appeal by the state, Judge Bernard L. McGinley ruled against the voter ID law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pennsylvania-judge-strikes-down-voter-id-law/2014/01/17/472d620e-7fa2-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html|title=Pennsylvania judge strikes down voter ID law|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> According to the decision issued by Judge McGinley, the Court “[http://www.pilcop.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voter-ID-Final-Order.pdf had a high degree of confidence in Professor Barreto’s survey results and that those results corroborate that hundreds of thousands of voters lack a compliant ID]” (pg 10).

The [[2011 Wisconsin Act 23|voter ID law in Wisconsin]] has received considerable legal attention since 2011.  Barreto and Sanchez authored an [https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/062-10-exhibitjexpertreport.pdf expert report] based on a survey in Wisconsin. In his 2014 decisions against the voter ID law, Federal Judge Lynn Adelman<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/federal-judge-strikes-down-wisconsin-law-requiring-photo-id-at-polls.html|title=Federal Judge Strikes Down Wisconsin Law Requiring Photo ID at Polls|last=Davey|first=Monica|date=2014-04-29|last2=Yaccino|first2=Steven|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> stated that “[http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/wisconsin-voterID-ruling.pdf it is absolutely clear that Act 23 will prevent more legitimate votes from being cast than fraudulent votes],” (pg 38) and after careful review of Barreto's survey stated "I remain convinced that his results support the conclusion that Blacks and Latinos are less likely than whites to possess qualifying forms of ID." (pg 57).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/wisconsin-voterID-ruling.pdf|title=U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin. Decision and Order in Frank v. Walker.|last=Adelman|first=Lynn|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin|access-date=}}</ref>  Adelman ruled that the voter ID law violated the Federal Voting Rights Act, Section 2. The state of Wisconsin appealed the decision, and after extensive back-and-forth, the law was upheld and allowed to stand in place for the 2016 presidential election.

As a result of his role in these high-profile lawsuits, Barreto is considered a leading expert on the impact of voter identification laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpr.org/people/matt-barreto-0|title=Matt Barreto|website=Wisconsin Public Radio|access-date=2017-01-05|date=2014-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/03/voter-id-felony-disenfranchisement-and-racial-gerrymandering-on-super-tuesday/471777/|title=Meet the States Denying Millions of Minorities the Vote on Super Tuesday|newspaper=CityLab|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electionlawblog.org/?p=33980|title=Plaintiffs' Expert Report Finds Statistical Disparities in Voter ID Availability for Minorities in Wisconsin {{!}} Election Law Blog|website=electionlawblog.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/profile/civil-rights/matt-barreto-phd|title=Civil Rights Expert Witness Matt A.
