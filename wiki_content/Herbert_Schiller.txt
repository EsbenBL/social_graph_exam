'''Herbert Irving Schiller''' (November 5, 1919 – January 29, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] media critic, [[sociology|sociologist]], author, and scholar.  He earned his [[PhD]] in 1960 from [[New York University]].

Schiller warned of two major trends in his prolific writings and speeches: the private takeover of public space and public institutions at home, and U.S. corporate domination of cultural life abroad, especially in the developing nations. His eight books and hundreds of articles in both scholarly and popular journals made him a key figure both in communication research and in the public debate over the role of the media in modern society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/dschiller_obit.htm |title=General UCSD News |publisher=Ucsdnews.ucsd.edu |date=2000-01-31 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref> He was widely known for the term “packaged consciousness,” that argues American [[media (communication)|media]] is controlled by a few corporations that “create, process, refine and preside over the circulation of images and information which determines our beliefs, attitudes and ultimately our behavior.”<ref>http://mk220.paulmihailidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Schiller-et-al-Values-Shaped-By-Media.pdf{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Schiller used [[Time Warner Inc.]] as an example of packaged consciousness, stating that it “basically dominates publishing, cable television, recordings, tapes and filmmaking.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjournal.info/CJO/mm.schiller.html |title=Cyranos Journal of Politics Media&Culture Wars |publisher=Cjournal.info |accessdate=2012-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815141523/http://www.cjournal.info/CJO/mm.schiller.html |archivedate=2014-08-15 }}</ref>
