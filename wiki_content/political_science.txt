'''Political science''' is the scientific study of [[politics]]. It is a social science dealing with systems of [[governance]] and power, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thought, political behavior, and associated [[constitution]]s and laws.<ref>[https://www.lexico.com/definition/political_science Definition from ''Lexico'' powered by Oxford University Press. Retrieved 23 February 2020]</ref>

Modern political science can generally be divided into the three subdisciplines of [[comparative politics]], [[international relations]], and [[Political philosophy|political theory]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Comparative politics |date=2020 |editor=Daniele Caramani |isbn=978-0-19-882060-4 |edition=Fifth |location=Oxford |oclc=1144813972}}</ref> Other notable subdisciplines are [[Public administration|public policy and administration]], [[Domestic politics|domestic politics and government]] (often studied within comparative politics), [[political economy]], and [[political methodology]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roskin|first=Michael G.|date=August 11, 2005|title=Political Science|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-science|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2021|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[human geography]], [[journalism]], [[political anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[social policy]].

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[psychology]], [[social research]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: [[primary source]]s, such as historical documents and official records, [[secondary source]]s, such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

===Origins===
As a social political science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political [[philosophy]], which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, [[political theology]], history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4 |title=How to Become a Political Scientist |last=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor |access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The [[American Political Science Association]] and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of [[politics]] from economics and other social phenomena.

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===
In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioral revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behavior swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behavior, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioral political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a takeoff in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game-theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behavior, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.<ref>Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," ''Journal of Politics'' '''74''' (October 2012), 917–31.</ref>

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC |title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science |date=30 September 2005 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-13020-1 |language=en}}</ref>

Some [[evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.<ref name="AEP">Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Overview==
Political science is a social study concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour, and [[public policies]]. It measures the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]], [[peace]], and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] theses (which attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) by analysing politics; others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, such as by making specific policy recommendations. The study of politics and policies can be closely connected—for example, in comparative analyses of which types of political institutions tend to produce certain types of policies.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edeltraud |last=Roller |title=The Performance of Democracies: Political Institutions and Public Policy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}</ref> Political science provides analysis and predictions about political and governmental issues.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=June 26|last2=Maddocks|first2=2020 Krysten Godfrey|title=What is Political Science All About?|url=https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/social-sciences/what-is-political-science|access-date=2021-09-25|website=www.snhu.edu|language=en}}</ref> Political scientists examine the processes, systems and political dynamics of countries and regions of the world, often to raise public awareness or to influence specific governments.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=June 26|last2=Maddocks|first2=2020 Krysten Godfrey|title=What is Political Science All About?|url=https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/social-sciences/what-is-political-science|access-date=2021-09-25|website=www.snhu.edu|language=en}}</ref>


Political scientists may provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyze issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties, or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chaturvedy |first=J.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&pg=PA4 |title=Political Governance: Political theory |publisher=Isha Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-8205-317-5 |page=4 |access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref>}}

===Country-specific studies===
Political scientists may study political phenomena within one specific country; for example, they may study just the politics of the United States<ref>{{cite book |author1=Benjamin Ginsberg |author2=Theodore J. Lowi |author3=Margaret Weir |author4=Caroline J. Tolbert |author4-link=Caroline Tolbert |author5=Robert J. Spit |date=December 2012 |title=We the People: An Introduction to American Politics |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |isbn=978-0393921106}}</ref> or just the politics of China.<ref>{{cite book |title=State and Peasant in Contemporary China: The Political Economy of Village Government |url=https://archive.org/details/statepeasantinco00jean |url-access=registration |last=Oi |first=Jean C. |author-link=Jean C. Oi |year=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |page=xvi}}</ref>

In the case of the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data, including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]], such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]. Political scientists will often focus on the politics of their own country; for example, a political scientist from Indonesia may become an expert in the politics of Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aipi-politik.org/kolom-aipi/220-sekelumit-prof-dr-h-c-miriam-budiardjo-m-a |language=id |title=Sekelumit Prof. Dr. Miriam Budiardjo |publisher=Indonesian Political Science Association |date=25 October 2013 |access-date=1 October 2020}}</ref>

===Anticipating crises===
The theory of political transitions,<ref>Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review.  2001 Sep 1:938–63.</ref> and the methods of analyzing and anticipating<ref name=":0" /> crises,<ref>McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis: Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15–38</ref> form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.<ref>Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19; 338(6105):344–48.</ref> Among them, one statistical indicator of crisis, a simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crisis anticipation and may be successfully used in various areas.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gorban |first1=A.N. |last2=Smirnova |first2=E.V. |last3=Tyukina |first3=T.A. |date=August 2010 |title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003 |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications |volume=389 |issue=16 |pages=3193–217 |arxiv=0905.0129 |bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|s2cid=276956 }}</ref> Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rybnikov |first1=S.R. |last2=Rybnikova |first2=N.A. |last3=Portnov |first3=B.A. |date=March 2017 |title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable? |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065 |journal=Psychology & Developing Societies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=98–123 |doi=10.1177/0971333616689398|s2cid=151344338 }}</ref> A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.<ref>Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."]  Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74</ref>

The study of major crises, both political crises and external crises that can affect politics, is not limited to attempts to predict regime transitions or major changes in political institutions. Political scientists also study how governments handle unexpected disasters, and how voters in democracies react to their governments' preparations for and responses to crises.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Andrew Healy |author2=Neil Malhotra |author-link2=Neil Malhotra |title=Myopic Voters and Natural Disaster Policy |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=103 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=387–406|doi=10.1017/S0003055409990104 |s2cid=32422707 }}</ref>

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]
* [[Public policy]]
* Program evaluation

[[Program Evaluation|Program evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies, and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses on this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, whether there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{Cite ssrn |last=Shackman |first=Gene |date=11 February 2018 |title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide |ssrn=3060080}}</ref>

[[Policy analysis]] is a technique used in public administration to enable civil servants, activists, and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials.

==Subfields of political science==
Many political scientists conduct research in one of four areas, described below:<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is Political Science? {{!}} Department of Political Science {{!}} University of Washington|url=https://www.polisci.washington.edu/what-political-science|access-date=2021-09-25|website=www.polisci.washington.edu}}</ref>

*Political Theory: Concerned with the foundations of political community and institutions, while focusing on human nature and the moral purposes of political association.
*[[Comparative politics|Comparative Politics]]: Compares contemporary political systems and discovers general laws and theories.
*[[International relations|International Relations]]: Concerned with developing an understanding of why states and non-state international actors interact.
*[[Political methodology|Political Methodology]]: Studies the philosophical bases of social science, political science, empirical research design and analysis.

Some political science departments also classify [[political methodology|methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield. In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.<ref>[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm Organized Sections] APSA{{paywall}}</ref>

==Research methods==
{{main article|Political methodology}}

Political science is methodologically diverse; political scientists approach the study of politics from a host of different ontological orientations and with a variety of different tools. Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-521-17455-8 |editor-last=Druckman |editor-first=James |location=New York |editor-last2=Green |editor-first2=Donald |editor-last3=Kuklinski |editor-first3=James |editor-last4=Lupia |editor-first4=Arthur |display-editors=3}}</ref> Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."<ref name=":0">Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1944407?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents The Physiology of Politics]." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1–15.</ref> Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices, unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics, and [[methodology|methodological]] pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

Empirical political science methods include the use of field experiments,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nahomi Ichino |author2=Noah L.

Political scientists also use and develop theoretical tools like game theory and agent-based models to study a host of political systems and situations.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Morris P. |last=Fiorina |title=Formal Models in Political Science |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=133–159 |date=February 1975|doi=10.2307/2110698 |jstor=2110698 }}</ref>

Political theorists approach theories of political phenomena with a similar diversity of positions and tools, including [[feminist political theory]], historical analysis associated with the [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge school]], and [[Leo Strauss#Straussianism|Straussian approaches]].

Political science may overlap with topics of study that are the traditional focuses of other social sciences—for example, when sociological [[Social norm|norms]] or psychological [[Cognitive bias|biases]] are connected to political phenomena. In these cases, political science may either inherit their methods of study or develop a contrasting approach.<ref name=wedeen02>{{cite journal |first=Lisa |last=Wedeen |author-link=Lisa Wedeen |title=Conceptualizing Culture: Possibilities for Political Science |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=713–728 |date=December 2002|doi=10.1017/S0003055402000400 |s2cid=145130880 }}</ref> For example, [[Lisa Wedeen]] has argued that political science's approach to the idea of culture, originating with [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] and exemplified by authors like [[Samuel P. Huntington]], could benefit from aligning more closely with the study of culture in anthropology.<ref name=wedeen02/> In turn, methodologies that are developed within political science may influence how researchers in other fields, like public health, conceive of and approach political processes and policies.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nicole F. Bernier |author2=Carole Clavier |title=Public health policy research: making the case for a political science approach |journal=Health Promotion International |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=109–116 |date=1 March 2011 |doi=10.1093/heapro/daq079|pmid=21296911 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Education==
Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."<ref name="Stoner">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |last=Stoner |first=J.R. |date=22 February 2008 |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archive-date=30 November 2009 |access-date=19 October 2011 |quote=…although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States].}}</ref> Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|school or college of arts and sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of humanities or [[Liberal Arts|liberal arts]].<ref name="Marist">See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).</ref> Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share more terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g., [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer BA programs in political science. MA or MAT and PhD or EdD programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies the use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Separate programs (often professional degrees) in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Master's-level programs in [[public administration]] are professional degrees covering public policy along with other applied subjects; they are often seen as more linked to politics than any other discipline, which may be reflected by being housed in that department.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&pg=PA77 |title=Graduate education in government |publisher=University Press of America |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |page=77 |quote=…existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}</ref>

==Writing in political science==
There are different genres of writings in political sciences; including but not limited to:<ref>{{Citation|last=Schmidt|first=Diane E.|title=Political Inquiry|date=2019-01-14|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781351252843-1|work=Writing in Political Science|pages=1–25|place=Fifth Edition. {{!}} New York: Routledge, 2018. {{!}} “Fourth edition published by Pearson Education, Inc. 2010”—T.p. verso.|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781351252843-1|isbn=9781351252843|access-date=2021-09-25}}</ref>

* Argument essays and Research papers
* Political theory writing
* Responses to articles, texts, events thoughts and reflective papers

The most common piece of writing in political sciences are research papers, which investigate an original research question.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Political Science|url=https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/political-science/|access-date=2021-09-25|website=The Writing Center • University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|language=en-US}}</ref>
