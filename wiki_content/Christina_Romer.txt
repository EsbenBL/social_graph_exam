'''Christina Duckworth Romer''' (née '''Duckworth'''; born December 25, 1958) is the Class of 1957 Garff B. Wilson Professor of Economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and a former chair of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] in the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE4AN4LY20081124|title=Obama taps Berkeley professor as senior economist|work=Reuters|date=November 24, 2008 |first=Caren |last=Bohan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/11/obama-to-tap-be.html|title=Obama to Tap Berkeley Prof to Chair Council of Economic Advisers|work=[[ABC News]]|date=November 24, 2008}}</ref> She resigned from her role on the Council of Economic Advisers on September 3, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |last=Calmes |first=Jackie |title=Top Obama Adviser on Economics to Step Down |date=5 August 2010|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/06advise.html?hp}}</ref>

After her nomination and before the Obama administration took office, Romer worked with economist [[Jared Bernstein]] to co-author the administration's plan for recovery from the 2008 recession.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://otrans.3cdn.net/ee40602f9a7d8172b8_ozm6bt5oi.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308062940/http://otrans.3cdn.net/ee40602f9a7d8172b8_ozm6bt5oi.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a January 2009 video presentation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/video_christna_romer_explains_a_new_report_about_job_creation/ |title=Video: Christina Romer explains a new report about job creation &#124; Change.gov: The Obama-Biden Transition Team |publisher=Change.gov |date=2009-01-11 |access-date=2011-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005171658/http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/video_christna_romer_explains_a_new_report_about_job_creation/ |archive-date=2011-10-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> she discussed details of the [[job creation program]] that the Obama administration submitted to Congress.

==Early life==
Romer was born in [[Alton, Illinois]]. She graduated from [[GlenOak High School]] in [[Canton, Ohio]] in June 1977. She obtained her [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from [[The College of William & Mary]] in 1981, and her [[Ph.D.]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1985. Her doctoral advisors were [[Rudi Dornbusch]]<ref name="Thesis Supervisor">{{cite web|url=http://library.mit.edu/F/JA5KSJ22C34NAKCHB7T549S1MTF1VDVVHHUQNM6F4QDM4A3YM4-03437?func=find-acc&acc_sequence=006454269|title=PDS login|website=library.mit.edu|access-date=10 November 2018}}</ref> and [[Peter Temin]]<ref name="Thesis Supervisor"/> Upon completion of her doctorate, she started working as an [[assistant professor]] at [[Princeton University]]. In 1988 she moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was promoted to full professor in 1993.

==Research==
Romer's early work focused on a comparison of macroeconomic volatility before and after [[World War II]]. Romer showed that much of what had appeared to be a decrease in volatility was due to better economic data collection, although recessions have become less frequent over time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/JEP_Spring99.pdf |title=Changes in Business Cycles: Evidence and Explanations |access-date=2011-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044836/http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/JEP_Spring99.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

She has also researched the causes of the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and how the US recovered from the depression.  Her work showed that the Great Depression occurred more severely in the US than in Europe, and had somewhat different causes than the Great Depression in Europe.    Romer showed that New Deal fiscal policy measures, though innovative, were very insufficient, and dwarfed by Hoover's tax increase two years earlier.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Romer|first=Christina|date=March 9, 2009|title=Lessons from the Great Depression for Economic Recovery in 2009|url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~cromer/CEA/Lessons_from_the_Great_Depression_for_Economic_Recovery_in_2009.pdf|pages=13|via=eml.berkeley.edu}}</ref> However, accidental monetary policy played a large role in the US recovery from depression.  This monetary policy came first from the devaluation of the dollar in terms of [[gold standard|gold]] in 1933–1934, and later from the flight of European capital to the relatively stable US as war in Europe became more likely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/events/2009/0309_lessons/0309_lessons_romer.pdf |title=Lessons from the Great Depression |access-date=2011-09-20}}</ref>

She has done extensive work on fiscal and monetary policy from the Great Depression to the present, using notes from the meetings of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) and the materials prepared by Fed staff to study how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions. Her work suggests that some of the credit for the relatively stable economic growth in the 1950s should lie with good policy made by the Federal Reserve,<ref>http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/aer_v92.pdf</ref> and that the members of the FOMC could at times have made better decisions by relying more closely on forecasts made by [[the Fed]] professional staff.<ref>http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/aer_98_2.pdf</ref>

Her recent work (with [[David Romer]]) has focused on the impact of tax policy on government and general economic growth.  This work looks at the historical record of US tax changes from 1945 to 2007, excluding "endogenous" tax changes made to fight recessions or offset the cost of new government spending.  It finds that such "exogenous" tax increases, made for example to reduce inherited budget deficits, reduce economic growth (though by smaller amounts after 1980 than before).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/draft1108.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202234611/http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/draft1108.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-02 }}</ref>  Romer and Romer also find "no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed ... tax cuts may increase spending. The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/draft708.pdf |title=Example of Application of Methodology |access-date=2011-09-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044900/http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/draft708.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> However, she notes that "Our baseline specification suggests that an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real GDP by roughly three percent."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~cromer/RomerDraft307.pdf |title=THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF TAX CHANGES:ESTIMATES BASED ON A NEW MEASURE OF FISCAL SHOCKS |date=March 2007 |access-date=25 June 2010 |author=Christina D.

==Career==
[[File:Christina Romer meets with Barack Obama & Joe Biden 1-30-09.jpg|right|thumb|Romer meeting with President Obama and Vice President Biden.]]
She is a former vice president of the [[American Economic Association]], a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship]] recipient, a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a winner of the [[Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award]], and a winner of the [[Council for Economic Education]]'s Visionary Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.councilforeconed.org/visionaryawards/past-honorees/|title=Visionary Awards: Celebrate with CEE the leaders of Economic Education}}</ref> Professor Romer is co-director of the Program in Monetary Economics at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/programs/me/me.html|title=The NBER Monetary Economics Program|website=www.nber.org|access-date=10 November 2018}}</ref> and was a member of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee until she resigned from this position on November 25, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwdev.nber.org/dec2008.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090303023435/http://wwwdev.nber.org//dec2008.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-03-03 |title=Business Cycle Dating Committee, National Bureau of Economic Research }}</ref> She rejoined the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee in 2010, and still serves in this position, alongside her husband.<ref name="NBER2">{{cite web |title=Business Cycle Dating Committee Members |url=https://www.nber.org/business-cycle-dating-committee-members |website=National Bureau of Economic Research |access-date=24 February 2021}}</ref>

In 2008 Romer was set to join the [[Harvard]] faculty of economics, while her husband was offered a position at the university's [[Kennedy School of Government]]. However, the Romers remained at Berkeley after [[Drew Gilpin Faust]], Harvard's president, vetoed her appointment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/5/22/faust-vetoes-tenure-decision-with-word/ |title=Faust Vetoes Tenure Decision |date=22 May 2008 |access-date=31 October 2009 |author=Shan Wang}}</ref> Her decision resulted in substantial discussion within the discipline and in the mass media. The motivations for Faust's decision to block Romer's appointment remain unclear, though speculation has focused on an opposition among "[[New classical macroeconomics|New Classical]]" economists to her "[[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian]]" tendencies, or a reluctance to appoint MIT-trained faculty at Harvard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economicprincipals.com/issues/2008.06.15/322.html |title=Old Embers, New Flames |date=15 June 2008 |access-date=30 April 2009 |author=David Warsh |work=economicprincipals.com}}</ref>

Today, Romer is a professor at the University of California Berkeley Department of Economics. In 2021 she was named a [[Fellow of the Econometric Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.econometricsociety.org/content/congratulations-our-2021-fellows|title=Congratulations to our 2021 Fellows|publisher=The Econometric Society|date=September 22, 2021|access-date=2021-10-29}}</ref>


===Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers===
Romer was approached by the [[Obama transition team]] in November 2008 about the position of [[Council of Economic Advisers|CEA chair]] because of her deep knowledge of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="IMFProfile">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/03/people.htm|title=The $787 Billion Question - Finance & Development, March 2013|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-06}}</ref>  In late 2008, along with fellow economic advisors [[Larry Summers]] and [[Peter R. Orszag]], she presented then-President-elect [[Barack Obama]] with recommendations for a stimulus package.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Lizza | first = Ryan | title = The Obama memos | magazine = The New Yorker | date = January 30, 2012 | url = https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lizza}}</ref> Romer calculated that a $1.8-trillion package was necessary to fill the [[output gap]], but Summers rejected the proposal and opted not to include it in the memo fearing that a trillion-dollar package would not pass through Congress.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Scheiber | first = Noam | title = The Memo that Larry Summers Didn't Want Obama to See | magazine = The New Republic | date = February 22, 2012 | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/100961/memo-Larry-Summers-Obama}}</ref> The Obama administration ultimately passed an [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|$800-billion package]].

She left the CEA to return to the University of California at Berkeley in September 2010, saying her departure from the Obama administration was timed so that her youngest child could begin high school in Berkeley.{{r|IMFProfile}}

In late October 2011, Romer published an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' calling upon [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chair]] [[Ben Bernanke]] to begin targeting [[nominal income target|nominal GDP]], citing arguments made by economists [[Greg Mankiw]], [[Robert Hall (economist)|Robert Hall]], and [[Scott Sumner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/business/economy/ben-bernanke-needs-a-volcker-moment.html|title=Ben Bernanke Needs a Volcker Moment|first=Christina|last=Romer|date=October 29, 2011|access-date=November 13, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/re-targeting-the-fed |title=Re-Targeting the Fed |first=Scott |last=Sumner |date=Fall 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2015 |publisher=[[National Affairs]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112165400/http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/re-targeting-the-fed |archive-date=November 12, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Monetary Policy|chapter=2.
