'''Jan Tinbergen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|b|ɜr|g|ən}}; {{IPA-nl|ˈtɪnˌbɛrɣə(n)|lang}}; April 12, 1903{{spaced ndash}}June 9, 1994) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[economist]] who was awarded the first [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1969, which he shared with [[Ragnar Frisch]] for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of  [[economic]] [[business process|processes]]. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and one of the founding fathers of [[econometrics]].<ref name="Magnus, Jan 1987">Magnus, Jan & Mary S. Morgan (1987) ''The ET Interview: Professor J. Tinbergen'' in: 'Econometric Theory 3, 1987, 117-142.</ref><ref>Willlekens, Frans (2008) ''International Migration in Europe: Data, Models and Estimates.'' New Jersey. John Wiley & Sons: 117.</ref> It has been argued that the  development of the first [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|macroeconometric models]], the solution of the identification problem, and the understanding of dynamic models are his three most important legacies to econometrics.<ref name="Magnus, Jan 1987"/> Tinbergen was a founding trustee of [[Economists for Peace and Security]]. In 1945, he founded the [[Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis]] (CPB) and was the agency's first director.

==Biography==
Tinbergen was the eldest of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and Jeannette van Eek. His brother [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Nikolaas "Niko" Tinbergen]] would also win a Nobel Prize (for [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|physiology]], during 1973) for his work in [[ethology]], while his youngest brother [[Luuk Tinbergen|Luuk]] would become a famous [[ornithologist]]. Jan and Nikolaas Tinbergen are the only siblings to have both won Nobel Prizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize Facts}}</ref> Between 1921 and 1925, Tinbergen studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Leiden]] under [[Paul Ehrenfest]]. During those years at Leiden he had numerous discussions with Ehrenfest, [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|Kamerlingh Onnes]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Pieter Zeeman]], and [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name=r1>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044243/http://www.kb.nl/hkc/nobel/jtinbergen/jtinbergen.html Jan Tinbergen (1903–1994)] Koninklijke Bibliotheek (in Dutch)</ref><ref name=r2>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tinbergen}}</ref>

After graduating, Tinbergen fulfilled his community service in the administration of a prison in Rotterdam and at the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in The Hague. He then returned to the [[University of Leiden]] and in 1929 defended his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis titled "Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de economie" (Minimisation problems in Physics and Economics).<ref>{{cite web|author=Jan Tinbergen |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Tinbergen_1929.pdf |title=Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de economie |year=1929}}</ref> This topic was suggested by Ehrenfest and allowed Tinbergen to combine his interests in mathematics, physics, economics and politics. At that time, CBS established a new department of business surveys and mathematical statistics, and Tinbergen became its first chairman, working at CBS until 1945. Access to the vast CBS data helped Tinbergen in testing his theoretical models. In parallel, starting from 1931 he was professor of statistics at the [[University of Amsterdam]], and in 1933 he was appointed associate professor of mathematics and statistics at The [[Netherlands School of Economics]], Rotterdam, where he stayed until 1973.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/>

From 1929 to 1945 he worked for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] statistical office and briefly served as consultant to the [[League of Nations]] (1936–1938). In 1945 he became the first director of the [[CPB (Netherlands)|Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis]] and left this position in 1955 to focus on education. He spent one year as a visiting professor at the [[Harvard University]] and then returned to the Dutch Economic Institute (the successor of the Netherlands School of Economics). In parallel, he provided consulting services to international organizations and governments of various developing countries, such as United Arab Republic, Turkey, Venezuela, Surinam, Indonesia and Pakistan.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/><ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1969/tinbergen.html Curriculum Vitae]. nobelprize.org</ref>

Tinbergen became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003349 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918210046/https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003349 |title=Jan Tinbergen (1903 - 1994) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |archive-date=18 September 2020}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]]. In 1956 he founded the [[Econometric Institute]] at the [[Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam]] together with [[Henri Theil]], who also was his successor in [[Rotterdam]]. In 1960 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.</ref> The [[Tinbergen Institute]] was named in his honour. The [[International Institute of Social Studies]] (ISS) awarded its Honorary Fellowship to Jan Tinbergen in 1962.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/> In 1968, he received an honorary doctorate from [[Sir George Williams University]], which later became [[Concordia University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/tinbergen|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Jan Tinbergen* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>

For many, Jan Tinbergen became known for the so-called 'Tinbergen Norm' often discussed long after his death. There is no written work of Tinbergen in which he himself states it formally.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Akkerboom, Broer|url=http://www.mejudice.nl/artikelen/detail/de-tinbergennorm-bestaat-niet|title=De Tinbergennorm bestaat niet|journal=Me Judice, 14 Mei 2015}}</ref> It is generally believed to be the principle that, if the ratio between the greatest and least income exceeds 5, it becomes disadvantageous for the societal unit involved. Tinbergen himself discussed some technicalities of a five-to-one income distribution ratio in an article published in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tinbergen, Jan|url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/15463/1981Economist.pdf|title=Misunderstandings concerning income distribution policies|year=1981|journal=De Economist|volume=129|issue=1|pages=13|doi=10.1007/BF01705865|citeseerx=10.1.1.1030.5758|s2cid=154797347}}</ref> Apart from specifics about a five-to-one ratio, it is true in general that Tinbergen's grand theme was [[income distribution]] and the search for an optimal social order.

Tinbergen developed the first national comprehensive [[macroeconomic model]], which he first developed in 1936 for the [[Netherlands]], and later applied to the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0264-9993(89)90005-9| title = When it all began| journal = Economic Modelling| volume = 6| issue = 2| pages = 203| year = 1989| last1 = Dhaene | first1 = G. | last2 = Barten | first2 = A. P. }}</ref>

In his work on macroeconomic modelling and economic policy making, Tinbergen classified some economic quantities as ''targets'' and others as ''[[macroeconomic policy instruments|instruments]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klein, Lawrence|doi=10.1023/B:ECOT.0000023251.14849.4f|title=The Contribution of Jan Tinbergen to Economic Science|year=2004|journal=De Economist|volume=152|issue=2|pages=155–157|s2cid=154689887}}</ref> Targets are those macroeconomic variables the policy maker wishes to influence, whereas instruments are the variables that the policy maker can control directly. Tinbergen emphasized that achieving the desired values of a certain number of targets requires the policy maker to control an equal number of instruments. This is known as the [[Tinbergen Rule]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Del Rio |first1=Pablo |last2=Howlett |first2=Michael P. |title=Beyond the'Tinbergen Rule'in Policy Design: Matching Tools and Goals in Policy Portfolios. |journal=Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Research Paper |date=2013 |issue=13–01 |url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/design/article/download/534/470 |access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref>

Tinbergen's classification remains influential today, underlying the theory of monetary policy used by [[central bank]]s. Many central banks today regard the [[inflation rate]] as their target; the policy instrument they use to control inflation is the short-term [[interest rate]].<ref>Blinder, Alan (1999), [https://archive.org/details/centralbankingin0000blin_n3s4 ''Central Banking in Theory and Practice.''] MIT Press, {{ISBN|0262522608}}.</ref>

Tinbergen's work on macroeconomic models was later continued by [[Lawrence Klein]], contributing to another [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. For his cultural contributions, he was given the [[Gouden Ganzenveer]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web

Tinbergen's econometric modelling lead to a lively debate with several known participants including [[J.M. Keynes]], [[Ragnar Frisch]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. The debate is sometime referred to as the [[Tinbergen debate]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Leeson, R.|year=1998|title=The Ghosts I Called I Can't Get Rid of Now: the Keynes-Tinbergen-Friedman-Phillips Critique of Keynesian Macroeconometrics|journal=History of Political Economy|volume= 30|issue=1|pages= 51–94|doi=10.1215/00182702-30-1-51|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/5749/1/The_Ghosts.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Louçã, F. |doi=10.1080/10427719900000074 |url=http://courses.umass.edu/econ804/LoucaBackgroundFiles1.pdf |title=The econometric challenge to Keynes: Arguments and contradictions in the early debates about a late issue |year=1999 |journal=The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=404–438 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
