'''Carleton University''' is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Founded in 1942 as Carleton College, the institution originally operated as a private, [[non-denominational]] [[evening]] [[college]] to serve returning [[World War II]] veterans.<ref name="CreatingCarleton">{{cite book |last1= Neatby |first1= H. Blair |last2 = McEown | first2 = Donald C. | date= 2002|title= Creating Carleton: The Shaping of a University|publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press|page= xi|isbn=077352486X}}</ref> Carleton was chartered as a university by the provincial government in 1952 through ''The Carleton University Act,'' which was then amended in 1957, giving the institution its current name.<ref name="CreatingCarleton" /> The university is named for the now-dissolved [[Carleton County, Ontario|Carleton County]], which included the city of Ottawa at the time the university was founded. Carleton County, in turn, was named in honour of [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton, the 1st Baron Dorchester]], who was [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] of [[The Canadas]] from 1786 to 1796. The university moved to its current campus in 1959,<ref name="CreatingCarleton" /> growing rapidly in size during the 1960s as the Ontario government increased support for post-secondary institutions and expanded access to higher education.

Carleton offers a diverse range of academic programs, and is organized into six faculties. It has several specialized institutions well-regarded in their fields, including the [[Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs]], the [[Carleton School of Journalism]], the [[School of Public Policy and Administration]], and the [[Sprott School of Business]].

As of 2019, Carleton yearly enrolls about 27,000 undergraduate and more than 4,000 graduate students. Carleton has a 150-acre campus located west of [[Old Ottawa South]], close to [[The Glebe]] and [[Confederation Heights]]. It is bounded to the North by the [[Rideau Canal]] and [[Dow's Lake]] and to the South by the [[Rideau River]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gall|first=Gwendolyn|title=About Old Ottawa South|url=http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/index.php/oos|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314230515/http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/index.php/oos|archive-date=14 March 2012|access-date=27 February 2012|publisher=Old Ottawa South Community Association}}</ref> Carleton has more than 159,000 alumni worldwide, and has produced 6 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 29 [[Royal Society of Canada|Royal Society Fellows]], 20 recipients of the [[Order of Canada]], 8 Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship awardees, and 3 National Killam Award recipients.

Carleton competes in the [[U Sports]] league as the [[Carleton Ravens]]. The Carleton Ravens are nationally renowned for their men's basketball team; a team which has won seven consecutive Canadian national championships between 2006 and 2017, in addition to 14 of the 16 championships since 2003.

==History==
<blockquote>I learned very early the life lesson that it is people, not buildings, that make up an institution. And if we put our hearts to it we can do something worthwhile.
:– Henry Marshall Tory</blockquote>

[[File:On December 1, 1941, the Board of Directors of the Ottawa YMCA met on this site.jpg|thumb|Historical plaque commemorating the inaugural meeting of the Ottawa Association for the Advancement of Learning in December 1941]]

===Carleton College (1942–1957)===
Discussions on establishing a second post-secondary institution in Ottawa began in the fall of 1938 among a committee of members from the local [[YMCA]] chapter, who looked to create a school to meet the educational needs of Ottawa's sizeable non-Catholic population. While the Second World War abruptly ended the committee's activities, a new committee was organized by Henry Marshall Tory as the Ottawa Association for the Advancement of Learning at a meeting held in December 1941, with formal incorporation in June 1942.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/2 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>

Established in 1942 as Carleton College, a non-denominational institution, the school began offering evening courses in rented classrooms at the High School of Commerce, now part of the [[Glebe Collegiate Institute]]. Classes offered during the first academic year included English, [[French language|French]], [[history]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[biology]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/8 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> With the end of the war in 1945 and return of veterans from the frontlines, the college experienced an unexpected upsurge in student enrolment during the 1945–46 academic year, enrolling about 2,200 new students.

To accommodate increased enrolment, the school rented facilities in various buildings throughout the city, including classrooms at the [[Lisgar Collegiate Institute]], [[Ottawa Technical High School]], and the basements of several local churches.  Higher enrolment also gave way to an expansion of the college's academic offerings with the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Science, and new coursework in [[Carleton School of Journalism|journalism]] and engineering.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp164/page/4|title=Carleton College: Fifth Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>

In 1946, the college gained possession of its first campus, situated at the corner of Lyon Street and First Avenue in [[The Glebe]] neighbourhood. The four-story building was the former location of the [[Ottawa Ladies' College]], which was purchased during the Second World War for use as [[barracks]] for the Canadian Women's Army Corps.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp165/page/4|title=Carleton College: Fifth Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> Carleton's first degrees were conferred in 1946 to graduates of its Journalism and Public Administration programs.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/carleton-university|title=Carleton University|author1=J. Paul Green|author2=Philip M. Wults|author3=Sarah Church|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>

For nearly a decade after opening, the college operated on a shoestring budget, using funds raised mainly through community initiatives and modest student fees. Student fees during the school's first academic year from 1942 to 43 were modest at about $10.00 per course for first-year students, equivalent to $153.71 in 2019 dollars.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/12 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> Fundraising efforts spearheaded by the college's president, Henry Marshall Tory, worked to raise $1 million for the institution from donors throughout the Ottawa area, with half of the proceeds going towards the debt incurred by the purchase of the new building, and the other to endow the college.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp167/page/7 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> Carleton's faculty then was composed largely of part-time professors who worked full-time in the [[Civil service|public service]], some of whom were eventually convinced to leave government for full-time tenure positions.

In 1950, Carleton began the process of developing a crest and motto, as was tradition with other institutions of higher learning. James Gibson, chair of the Committee on Symbols and Ceremonials, initially proposed a Latin motto, "''Opera nobis aeterna''" derived from the [[Walt Whitman]] poem [[Pioneers! O Pioneers!]],<ref name="CreatingCarleton" /> a translation of the phrase "We take up the task eternal". The Board of Governors rejected the Latin motto as it was perceived as too pretentious for an institution focused on egalitarianism, leading to Carleton's current motto, "Ours the task eternal".  In October 1951, the Board of Governors formally adopted the new crest and motto.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Carleton, 1951-52 |url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton07carl/page/4 |website=Internet Archive |publisher=Carleton University |access-date=18 October 2019}}</ref>

In 1952, the ''Carleton College Act'' was passed by the [[Ontario Legislature]], changing the school's corporate name to Carleton College and conferring upon it the power to grant university degrees. Carleton thus became the province's first private, [[non-sectarian]] college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/futuree.html#appendixB |title=Excellence Accessibility Responsibility > Ministry of Education |publisher=Edu.gov.on.ca |access-date=10 March 2011}}</ref>  The governance system was modelled on the provincial ''University of Toronto Act'' of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a Faculty Senate, responsible for academic policy, and a Board of Governors composed of local community members, exercising exclusive control over the institution's finances and formal authority over all other matters. The President, appointed by the Board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university|title=Universities in Canada (Canadian Universities)|author=P. Anisef, P. Axelrod, J. Lennards|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|date=20 July 2015|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>

Though the acquisition of land tracts now part of the current campus began in 1947, it was only in 1952 that the college gained possession of the entire 150-acre property, a significant portion of which was donated by [[Harry Stevenson Southam]], a prominent Ottawa business magnate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton11carl/page/100 |title=The Carleton:1955-56|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> In March 1956, the college released a 75-year master plan for the development of the campus in stages, with the first stage costing an estimated $4.2 million, equivalent to $39 million in 2019 dollars, foreseeing the development of academic buildings, student residences, and athletic facilities on the new site.

In October 1956, the beginning of construction at the Rideau River campus was celebrated with a ceremonial sod-turning by [[Dana Porter]], then [[Treasurer of Ontario]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp391/page/12|title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1956-57|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

===Carleton University (1957–present)===

In 1957, the ''Carleton University Act'' was enacted<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://carleton.ca/about/history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref> as an amendment to the ''Carleton College Act'', granting Carleton nominal status as a [[public university]] and resulting in its current name, Carleton University.<ref name="Carleton Act">{{cite web | title = Carleton University Act | publisher=University Secretariat| access-date = 5 November 2011 | url = https://carleton.ca/secretariat/carleton-university-act/}}</ref> This did not result in substantive changes to the school's governance and academic organization as it had already been granted university powers through the existing legislation.

====Rapid development and growth (1960–69)====
The completion of initial construction at the Rideau River campus in 1959 saw the university move to its current location at the beginning of the 1959–60 academic year. Completed at a cost of $6.5 million, the first three buildings, the Maxwell MacOdrum Library, Norman Paterson Hall and the Henry Marshall Tory Building became the centre for academic life at Carleton, with Paterson Hall and Tory Building respectively serving the arts and sciences disciplines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp394/page/4 |title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1959-60 |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

The 1960s saw meteoric growth in student enrolment, with the number of full-time students ballooning from 857 to 7,139 within the decade,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp404/page/n1 |title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1960-61 |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> which coincided with a sharp uptick in financial support from the provincial and federal governments towards post-secondary institutions.

An increasing share of these students came to the school from outside the [[National Capital Region]], prompting the university to open its first purpose-built residence halls, Lanark and Renfrew Houses in the fall of 1962. The residences were initially segregated by sex, with Lanark House reserved for male students and Renfrew for female students.  However, Carleton did away with the practice of mandatory sex segregation in 1969 in favour of co-educational housing, becoming the first university in North America to adopt this practice.  By the end of the decade, the increased need for space to accommodate the growing faculty and student body saw the completion of several major academic buildings, including the Loeb Building in 1967 and the Mackenzie Building in 1968.

In 1967, a Catholic [[liberal arts college]], Saint Patrick's College, became affiliated with Carleton.  Saint Patrick's College was founded by the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] to meet the higher educational needs of Ottawa's growing English-speaking Catholic population.  Originally housed in a separate building Old Ottawa East, now the campus of [[Immaculata High School (Ottawa)|Immaculata High School]], a new building for the school was erected on the north end of the Carleton campus in 1973.

====Steady expansion (1970–1999)====
The arrival of a new decade ushered in the inauguration of the long-awaited University Centre, designed to be the linchpin for student life on campus, housing a student-operated pub and other administrative services. With growing restrictions in physical space, the university hailed the completion of Dunton Tower, then referred to as the Arts Tower, in September 1972, which was then tallest academic building in Canada

. Rising attention towards recreation and fitness, coupled with generous grants from the provincial government, spurred the construction of the Athletics Centre in 1974, housing a multiplicity of different sports facilities, including a pool, squash courts, and gymnasium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/thecharleton08carl/page/94 |publisher=Carleton University |title= The Charlatan: 1978-79|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

In 1979, Saint Patrick's College was dissolved and merged into Carleton with Gerald Clarke, a professor at the school since 1954, serving as its final Dean. While Carleton is a secular institution, the name of the St. Patrick's Building was kept as a nod to Carleton's historical relationship to the Catholic institution.<ref>{{cite web|last=MacDougall|first=H.A.|title=St. Patrick's College (Ottawa) (1929–1979) Ethnicity and the Liberal Arts in Catholic Education|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1982/MacDougall.html|access-date=16 March 2013}}</ref>

Although Carleton experienced a temporary decline in student enrolment toward the latter half of the 1970s, the 1980s saw a resurgence in the number of students attending the school, representing an increase of 76%, or 5,582 students over the course of the decade, leading to overcrowding in many of the school's buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cp421/page/28?q=decline+in+enrolment |publisher=Carleton University |title= Advancing into the Second Half-Century|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> Responding to the demands of a larger student population during the 1980s, the university built the Life Sciences Research Centre, the Minto Centre of Advanced Studies in Engineering (CASE), and funded an extension to MacOdrum Library.

Following renovations led by Toronto-based architect Michael Lundholm, 1992 saw the opening of the Carleton University Art Gallery in the St. Patrick's Building, supported by a fundraising drive within the local community and the bequest of several pieces of Canadian art from the estate of Frances and Jack Barwick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuag.ca/index.php/about/history/ |publisher=Carleton University Art Gallery |title=History|access-date=29 September 2019}}</ref> In fall 1994, a new computing system was introduced at Carleton, extending Internet and e-mail access to all students and faculty, where this had previously been only accessible to graduate and undergraduate students in specific courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cp383/page/20 |publisher=Carleton University|title=Survival at Carleton, 1994-95|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref>

====Contemporary developments (2000–present)====
[[File:HealthSciencesBuilding Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Health Sciences Building, exterior completed in 2018, some of the interior is still under construction]]
The new millennium brightened prospects for Carleton's finances, allowing it to fund the construction of several new buildings during the 2000s.  These include, ''inter alia'', the $30-million construction of new athletics facilities, the $22-million, 9,011&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (97,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>) Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute Facility and Centre for Advanced Studies in Visualization and Simulation (V-SIM), and the $17-million upgrade and expansion to the University Centre. In 2008, a sustainably-designed residence hall was added named Frontenac House, primarily serving returning second-year students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/housing/residence-buildings/frontenac-house/|title=Frontenac House|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=27 February 2012}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> During this decade, Carleton inaugurated its first female President and Vice Chancellor, [[Roseann Runte]] in 2008, who served in this position until 2017, resigning to fulfill a new position as president and CEO of the Canada Foundation for Innovation. Runte's leadership also pushed forward the planning and construction of three new academic buildings, Canal Building (2010), and River Building (2011), and the Health Sciences Building (2018), as well as a new residence building, Lennox and Addington House in 2011.

[[File:RichcraftGreenWall Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|right|[[Green wall]] installed in Richcraft Hall]]

At the behest of Runte's successor, Benoit-Antoine Bacon, Carleton has continued to pursue several major construction projects, notably the Advanced Research and Innovation and Smart Environments (ARISE) Building, replacing the existing Life Sciences Building, to house applied research in smart technology. The university also moved forward with the construction of the Nicol Building, providing 100,000 square feet of new learning spaces for students in the Sprott School of Business.  The cost of the building was estimated at around $65 million, but was offset through a sizeable donation of $10 million from the late Ottawa real estate developer and Carleton alumnus, Wes Nicol, for whom the building is namesake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/fmp/our-services/construction/major-capital-projects/|title=Major Capital Projects|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The building is slated for completion in 2021.

In 2018, Carleton purchased the [[Dominion-Chalmers United Church]] located in Ottawa's [[Centretown]] neighbourhood to serve as a community and cultural hub, and host to artistic performances and academic lectures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.carleton.ca/2018/carleton-in-the-community-dominion-chalmers-united-church/|title=Carleton in the Community: Dominion-Chalmers United Church|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The facility represents Carleton's first building situated in Ottawa's downtown area.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Carleton joined other Canadian post-secondary institutions in a decision to suspend in-person classes for the remainder of the 2019–2020 academic year, effectively moving instruction online. This move also saw the temporary withdrawal of non-essential services, such as athletics facilities, in order to contain the spread of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.carleton.ca/2020/covid-19-update-plan-for-remainder-of-term/|title=COVID-19 Update – Plan for Remainder of Term|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref> Unlike other institutions, Carleton did not immediately move to evict students from residence buildings, but instead allowed students to leave early at their own discretion.

To accommodate the disruption to the semester resulting from the abrupt suspension of in-person classes, the Carleton University Senate approved an unprecedented proposal to provide students with the option to receive a SAT or UNSAT grade in place of typical letter and grade point for their courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/provost/2020/sat-uns-grading-options/|title=Flexible and Compassionate Grading Options (SAT/UNS) for Students|last=Tomberlin|first=Jerry|date=27 March 2020|website=Carleton University|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>   The school also cancelled in-person classes for the summer semester, allowing courses to only be delivered online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/summer/course-offerings/|title=Course offerings|website=Carleton University|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

In July 2020, Carleton announced that classes for the Fall 2020 semester would be held entirely online, citing the potential risk posed by a second wave of COVID-19 and inequities to accessing physical classes for international students, who may encounter difficulties coming to Canada due to travel restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carleton University Scenario Planning (CUSP) Working Group|date=11 May 2020|title=Planning for Fall 2020|url=https://carleton.ca/provost/wp-content/uploads/Scenario-Planning-Report-200511-final.pdf|website=Carleton University}}</ref>  Additional waves of COVID-19 in Ontario in early 2021 prompted the university to continue with online course delivery for the remainder of the academic year.

With the implementation of a mass [[COVID-19 vaccination in Canada|COVID-19 vaccination program]], and widespread uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Canada, Carleton prepared for a gradual return of in-person learning for the 2021-22 academic year, offering a number of course delivery methods to students, including fully in-person classes, hybrid classes, and virtual classes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carleton University|date=26 May 2021|title=HyFlex: A new teaching option for the fall|url=https://carleton.ca/tls/2021/hyflex-a-new-teaching-option-for-the-fall/|url-status=live|access-date=7 October 2021|website=Carleton University}}</ref> In August 2021, announced that all students, staff, and faculty would need to receive a complete series of a [[Health Canada]] or [[World Health Organization]]-approved [[COVID-19 vaccine]] to receive full access to campus, including attending in-person classes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carleton University|date=12 August 2021|title=Vaccination Requirements for Campus Access|url=https://newsroom.carleton.ca/2021/vaccination-requirements-campus-access/|url-status=live|access-date=7 October 2021|website=Carleton University}}</ref>  

==Organization and administration==
===Governance===
The university's governing framework is established through the ''Carleton University Act, 1952'', enabling legislation which sets out the basic legal obligations and purposes of the institution.  The Act establishes Carleton as a bicameral institution, governed by a Board of Governors and Senate.<ref name="Carleton University">{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/secretariat/boardofgovernors/governance/|title=Governance Framework at Carleton University:An Overview|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref> The ''Act'' establishes the objects and purpose of the university as the advancement of learning; the dissemination of knowledge; the intellectual, social, and moral development of its members and the community at large; and the establishment of a non-sectarian institution within the City of Ottawa.

====Board of Governors====
The Board of Governors oversees the corporate affairs of the institution, including finances, real property, risk management, and strategic direction.<ref name="Carleton University"/> The Board is also responsible for appointing the President and Chancellor, and determines the compensation of staff, faculty, and members of the senior administration.  The Board of Governors is composed of 36 members, with 18 members derived from the students, staff, and administration of Carleton.  These include four students, two faculty members, two members of the University Senate, two alumni, two staff, as well as the President and Chancellor, who are ex-officio members of the Board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/secretariat/boardofgovernors/about/|title=About: Board Composition|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref> The remainder of the representatives are selected from the local community at large.

To support its mandate and oversight function, the Board has six standing committees, with each Governor holding membership in one or two of these committees over the course of a year.  These standing committees include Executive, Audit & Risk, Building Program, Advancement and University Relations, Governance, and Finance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/secretariat/boardofgovernors/board-committees/|title=Board Committees|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>

The Board is led by the Board Chair, who presides over meetings, evaluates executive performance, advises senior administration, and represents the university's interests to government. The current Board Chair is [[Dan Fortin]], former President of [[IBM]] Canada and Carleton alumnus. 

====Senate====
The Senate is the Carleton's highest academic body and is responsible for university's academic governance. The Senate's duties include conferring degrees, approving recipients of honorary degrees, developing scholarships and selecting recipients thereof, approving new programs and curricular changes, in addition to overseeing academic regulations.

''[[Maclean's]]'' is a Canadian magazine that publishes an annual ranking of Canadian universities, which is intended to measure a university's overall "undergraduate experience."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/university-rankings/university-rankings-2019/|title=University Rankings 2019 - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> In its 2022 edition, Carleton ranked fifth in the comprehensive category, which includes those universities with a significant degree of research activity and a wide range of programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels.<ref name="Macdocc" />

In 2015, ''Maclean's'' began publishing program rankings for biology, business, computer science, education, engineering, mathematics, medicine, nursing, and psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/the-top-20-program-rankings-in-10-subject-areas/|title=Maclean's 2016 Ranking of University Programs|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> As of 2019, Carleton is ranked 7th in Canada for engineering,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-engineering-universities-in-canada-2019-ranking/|title=Best engineering universities in Canada: 2019 ranking - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> 10th in computer science,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-computer-science-universities-in-canada-2019-ranking/|title=Best computer science universities in Canada: 2019 ranking - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> 10th in mathematics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-mathematics-universities-in-canada-2019-ranking/|title=Best mathematics universities in Canada: 2019 ranking - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> and 14th in psychology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-psychology-universities-in-canada-2019-ranking/|title=Best psychology universities in Canada: 2019 ranking - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> Notably, Carleton does not have ratings in nursing, medicine, or education programs, specifically; however, it does have a ''Health Sciences'' faculty, which includes a [[biomedicine]] program and a disability and chronic illness program, and does have, in its ''Arts'' faculty, a Childhood and Youth Studies program originally rooted in [[Early Childhood Education]] (ECE).

[[File:Carleton University south view 2.jpg|right|thumb|Carleton University campus as seen from the south.]]

Carleton's campus is situated on {{cvt|153|acres}} bounded to the west by [[Colonel By Drive]] and the [[Rideau Canal]], to the east by [[Bronson Avenue]], and the south by the [[Rideau River]].   The campus is situated adjacent to the [[Dominion Arboretum]] and the [[Central Experimental Farm]].

During its initial construction in 1959, the campus consisted of three buildings, the MacOdrum Library, the Tory Building, and Paterson Hall, forming a quadrangle situated at the heart of the university's academic buildings. Since then, the university has expanded to forty-seven buildings, the newest addition being the Health Sciences Building, which was inaugurated in 2018.

The campus is accessible to road traffic through two entrances respectively located at Bronson Avenue and Colonel By Drive. Carleton's campus contains a series of surface roads to facilitate traffic in and out of the university, the most heavily used of them being Campus Avenue, which was converted to a single-direction road in 2019 to ease congestion.

Several [[OC Transpo]] bus lines, including the 7, 10, and 111, serve the campus directly, in addition to the O-Train's [[Carleton station]], located at the centre of campus.

The campus is bisected by the [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line]], with several pedestrian and vehicular bridges and tunnels facilitating access between either side. The majority of the university's academic and residential buildings are situated on the western side of campus, while the eastern side contains the university's athletics facilities and administrative offices.

=== Architecture ===
The prevalence of [[modernist architecture|modernist]] and [[brutalist architecture]] in the design of the earliest academic buildings on the Carleton campus represented a stylistic departure from traditional collegiate architecture in North America, which historically emulated the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style dominant in many European universities. The decision to incorporate modernism into the campus' design was intentional, presenting Carleton as an egalitarian, progressive, and forward-thinking institution.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://arc.library.carleton.ca/exhibits/construction-u |title= Construction U|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2018 |publisher=Carleton University |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref>

Architectural critics have looked to Carleton as a leading example of modernist collegiate architecture in Canada. The campus became the subject of Modern U, an exhibition by local artist Adrian Gröllner that sought to highlight the late [[modernist architecture]] embodied by many of Carleton's early buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuag.carleton.ca/online/modernu/|title=Modern U|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807231423/http://cuag.carleton.ca/online/modernu/|archive-date=7 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Tunnel system===
[[File:Tunnels Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Junction between tunnels near the Health Sciences Building. Note the alphabetic wayfinding signage distinguishing tunnel routes.]]
Buildings on campus, with a few exceptions, are connected by a five kilometre-long system of underground pedestrian tunnels. The Carleton University tunnel system is the most extensive network of tunnels at a Canadian university or college campus. The tunnels were initially built as part of the second phase of initial construction on campus in the 1960s. Originally conceived as a maintenance crawl space connecting heating and ventilation between campus buildings,  a suggestion by a staff member transformed them into accessible pedestrian tunnels<ref name="CreatingCarleton" /> for students and faculty to use when travelling between different buildings on campus.  The tunnels receive heightened usage during the winter months due to the severity of winters in Ottawa. Maintenance staff use modified [[golf carts]] in the tunnels to transport personnel, supplies, and mail to different locations on campus.

In 2019, Carleton introduced a new wayfinding system to assist students, faculty, and visitors in navigating the tunnel networking, using a [[Transit map|metro-style]] map to display the network.

[[File:LennoxAddington Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Lennox & Addington House, the newest residence house at Carleton, at dusk]]
Carleton has eleven student residence buildings clustered together in the northwest section of campus, and are connected to the university's tunnel system. The first residence buildings constructed on campus were the Renfrew and Lanark Houses, which began accommodating students in 1962.

In 1969, the university introduced the first co-educational dormitories in North America.<ref name="CreatingCarleton" /> Since then, the university has gradually expanded the number of dormitories as enrolment has risen. On-campus housing at Carleton is configured in traditional and suite-style residences, with the latter offering students a kitchenette shared between four students. Unlike most collegiate dormitories, bathroom facilities are usually shared between two rooms, in contrast to the typical communal bathrooms.  Residence floors are staffed by dedicated [[Resident assistant|Residence Fellows]], upper-year students hired by the university's Department of Housing and Residence Life Services to provide personal and academic support to students.

Although the majority of students housed on-campus are first-year students, Frontenac House is reserved for returning second-year students, while Leeds House is reserved for upper-year and graduate students. Residence Commons serves as a hub for students living in residences, as it houses ''The Caf'', the university's main [[dining hall]], the Residence Reception Desk, a [[Starbucks]] location, and Abstentions, a [[convenience store]] operated by the [[Rideau River Residence Association]] (RRRA), which functions as the student government for residence students.

During the summer months, some residence halls are turned over to Conference Services for use as hotels for visiting school and tourist groups to Ottawa. The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] uses some facilities, notably Glengarry House and Residence Commons, to house and feed the [[Ceremonial Guard]], which conducts the renowned Changing of the Guard ceremony on [[Parliament Hill]] and posts sentries at [[Rideau Hall]]. It is possible to see practice marches and drills occurring on campus during this season.

=== MacOdrum Library ===
One of the three original buildings on the Carleton campus, the MacOdrum Library has served as Carleton's central library and archives. The library is named for former Carleton President and Vice-Chancellor [[Murdoch Maxwell MacOdrum]]. As of 2017, the Library maintains a collection of approximately 1.8 million print items, 161,396 cartographic materials, and 876,396 [[e-books]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = At A Glance: Carleton University Library|url = https://library.carleton.ca/sites/default/files/about/ataglance_2017.pdf|website = carleton.ca|access-date = 18 February 2019}}</ref>

Since 1959, the library has undergone expansion and renovations on several occasions, the most recent of which was completed in late 2013.  The facility contains computer labs, study carrels, and meeting rooms for students to complete assignments and conduct academic research. During midterm and final examination periods, the Library extends its operating hours to twenty-four hours to accommodate students preparing for their examinations or completing assignments. On an annual basis, the library receives upwards of 1.6 million visits from students, faculty, and researchers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = At A Glance: Carleton University Library|url = https://library.carleton.ca/sites/default/files/about/ataglance_2017.pdf|website = carleton.ca|access-date = 18 February 2019}}</ref>

In 2013, the Library inaugurated the Discovery Centre for Undergraduate Research, a multi-purpose space containing meeting tables, multimedia collaborative spaces, video game laboratories, as well as [[3D printers]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Discovery Centre - Carleton University|url = https://carleton.ca/discoverycentre/|website = carleton.ca|access-date = 16 January 2016}}</ref>

The Library occasionally hosts special artistic and historical exhibitions on the first floor, covering a broad spectrum of topics and academic disciplines.

[[Greek letter organizations]] are an active part of student life at Carleton, affiliated with both local and international organizations. From an administrative perspective, Carleton does not formally recognize fraternities and sororities, and has prohibited them from tabling in the University Centre Atrium and Residence Commons while wearing their letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://charlatan.ca/2016/11/carleton-limits-frats-and-sororities-presence-on-campus/|title=Carleton limits frats and sororities' presence on campus|last=Van Looyen|first=Gabbi|date=16 November 2016|website=The Charlatan|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref>

Since 2007, most Greek activities at Carleton are overseen by the Carleton University Greek Council (CUGC), a student-led organization which plans and coordinates social, philanthropic, and academic events throughout the school year between fraternities and sororities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.campusvibe.ca/campusvibe/group/a89a7547-a041-47b3-904d-8401cc7a367c/1273614a-aa11-400e-8f60-e8dd42a1238b|title=Carleton University Greek Council|website=CUSA Hub|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref> Three international sororities, Phi Sigma Sigma, Alpha Omicron Phi, and Delta Phi Epsilon are governed separately by the Carleton Panhellenic Council, which fulfills a mandate parallel to that of the CUGC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/fallorientation/expo-carleton/exhibitors-2019/|title=Exhibitors List 2019|website=Carleton University|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref>

In early 2016, a Carleton sorority became the locus of controversy after an incident in which several chapter members decided to pop 80 balloons simultaneously during a meeting in the Tory Building, followed by celebratory screaming which falsely triggered an active shooter lockdown on campus.  This led to some students advocating for an outright ban of the sorority responsible for the false alarm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://charlatan.ca/2016/03/letter-sorority-that-caused-campus-lockdown-should-be-banned/|title=Letter: Sorority that caused campus lockdown should be banned|last=Stern|first=Natalie|date=9 March 2016|website=The Charlatan|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref>

===Arts and media===

==== Student newspapers ====
Carleton's primary undergraduate student newspaper is ''[[The Charlatan (student newspaper)|The Charlatan]]'', which was founded in 1945 and known as ''The Carleton'' until 1971.  Until 2019, the newspaper published print editions on a bi-weekly basis when budgetary restraints forced the paper to reduce its frequency to once monthly.  The Charlatan's operations are overseen by a volunteer Board of Directors, composed of representatives from the newspaper's staff, students, faculty, and the community at large.<ref>{{cite web |title=Board |url=http://charlatan.ca/board/ |website=The Charlatan |access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

Carleton is also served by ''The Leveller'', a monthly newspaper established in 2009, representing student voice throughout the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]]. The publication is characterized by its [[Left-wing politics|radical left]] editorial stance toward social issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=https://leveller.ca/about/ |website=The Leveller |access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

''The Resin'' was a newspaper for students living in residence which was published in 2014, when the Rideau River Residence Association decided to discontinue it.

During the school year the School of Journalism publishes a community newspaper, ''[[Centretown News]]'', which reports on the [[Centretown]] neighbourhood of Ottawa, and an online newspaper, ''Capital News Online.''

The Department of English Language and Literature supports the student-run writers' zine, ''In/Words,'' featuring creative writing and short stories from Carleton students. Engineering students are similarly are served by ''The Iron Times'', which is published by the Carleton Student Engineering Society.

==== Broadcasting ====
Carleton is home to a [[community radio]] station, [[CKCU-FM]]. Since its first broadcast in November 1975,  CKCU-FM was the first licensed community-based campus radio station in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ckcufm.com/about|title=About CKCU-FM|publisher=CKCU-FM Radio|access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref>  CKCU-FM broadcasts a broad range of student and multicultural programming, featuring genres such as [[world music]], [[avant-garde music]], [[indie pop]], and [[Blue's Clues|blues]].  In addition to an optional student-levy, CKCU-FM relies largely relies on donations from the local community and program sponsorships for financial support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ckcufm.com/about/|title=About|website=CKCU-FM 93.1|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>

==== Theatre ====

Carleton competes as the [[Carleton Ravens]], participating in intercollegiate competitions at both the national and provincial levels. Carleton is a member of both [[U Sports]] and [[Ontario University Athletics]], encompassing 13 varsity sports.

=== Men's basketball ===
Carleton is recognized for the strength of its men's basketball team, which has accumulated the highest number of national titles of any collegiate basketball team in Canadian history.  Between 1999 and 2019, [[Dave Smart]] served as the head men's basketball coach at Carleton, and is credited for building the team's capacity to its current reputation of repeated success.  Smart resigned from his position in 2019 to serve as Carleton's director of basketball operations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winning Carleton coach stepping aside|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/dave-smart-leaves-ravens-coaching-1.5063314| work=CBC News}}</ref>

The Ravens men's basketball team has won the national championship fourteen times,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://goravens.ca/news/2019/03/mbb-ravens-soar-to-14th-national-championship/|title=MBB {{!}} Ravens soar to 14th national championship|work=Carleton Athletics}}</ref> with five consecutive titles between 2002–03 and 2006–07 and seven consecutive titles between 2010-2011 and 2016–2017, surpassing the [[University of Victoria]] at the top of the all-time list.<ref>{{cite news|title=Carleton cruises to record 9th CIS men's basketball title|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/sports/sports-nba/story/2013/03/10/sp-cis-mens-basketball-championship.html |work=CBC News}}</ref> The [[Victoria Vikes|Vikes]] had seven consecutive wins in the 1980s. With its 12th crown in 2016, the Ravens eclipsed the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball]] team as the college with the most national basketball titles, a feat accomplished in 14 years, compared with UCLA's 11 titles in 32 seasons.

Outside of its typical season games, the men's basketball team plays [[exhibition games]] with [[NCAA]] teams from the United States during the summer months, billed as the Can-Am Shootout. During these games, Carleton has garnered significant wins over reputable [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] teams such as the [[Ole Miss Rebels|University of Mississippi]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats|University of Cincinnati]], and [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits|South Dakota State University]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Canadian powerhouse Carleton is destroying American college teams again |url=https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2018/08/11/canadian-powerhouse-carleton-is-destroying-american-college-teams-again/ |work=NBC News}}</ref>

As part of its athletic rivalry with the [[University of Ottawa]], the team has participated in [[Capital Hoops Classic]] since its inception in 2007, which typically takes place in late January and early February at the [[Canadian Tire Centre]]. In twelve years of the event, Carleton has won on ten occasions.

=== Football ===
{{Main|Carleton Ravens football}}
Carleton established a football team during the 1945–46 academic year, losing 15–0 to [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald College]] during its debut match.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton01carl/page/4 |title=The Carleton, Volume 1 |publisher=Carleton University |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> In tandem with basketball and hockey, Carleton's football matches transformed into a staple of student life at Carleton during the early years of the school, securing funding for sports equipment early in the school's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton01carl/page/24|title=The Carleton, Volume 1|publisher=Carleton University |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> In 1959, Carleton's move to the Rideau campus provided the team with updated facilities, including a field, training room, and equipment room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/theraven1960carl/page/86|title=The Raven, 1960|year=1960|publisher=Carleton University |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref>

In 1955, the football team began competing in the much-celebrated annual [[Panda Game]] against their rivals, the [[Ottawa Gee-Gees]]. The game evolved into an iconic highlight within student life at Carleton, gaining a sordid reputation for heavy drinking and outlandish parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton01carl/page/24|title=The Charlatan, 1987-88|publisher=Carleton University |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> In 1999, the cancellation of Carleton's football program placed the game on indefinite hiatus,though was eventually revived in 2013. Since 2014, the game has taken place at [[TD Place Stadium|TD Place]] in [[Lansdowne Park]]. While Ottawa holds a historical advantage over Carleton in terms of Panda Game victories, the current iteration of the Panda Game saw four consecutive victories for Carleton between 2014 and 2017.

From 1999 to 2013, Carleton suspending its football program, citing a lack of success and the ensuing financial burden, then revived for the 2013 season.<ref name="SunFootball">{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2011/07/04/ravens-ready-to-roll-in-2013|title=Carleton Football is Back|publisher=Ottawa Sun|access-date=23 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517155343/http://www.ottawasun.com/2011/07/04/ravens-ready-to-roll-in-2013|archive-date=17 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the intervening years, several proposals to revive the football program were brought forward by the Carleton community and alumni, notably in 2000 with advocacy efforts by the ''Old Crow Society'', which represents Carleton Football's alumni, but it was deemed premature at the time.<ref name="SunFootball" /> Subsequently, a 2008 survey indicated 86% of students were in favour of resuscitating the university's football program.<ref name="SunFootball" /> The team planned to form an independent corporate entity with its own revenue stream—a model that has proven successful at other schools, notably [[Laval University]].<ref name="SunFootball" />

=== Other sports ===
The Carleton Ravens men's ice hockey team plays within the [[Ontario University Athletics]] conference of [[U Sports]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goravens.ca/news/mens-hockey/2014/06/former-penguins-draft-pick-suit-ravens-next-season/|title=Former Penguins draft pick to suit up for Ravens next season|access-date=28 August 2015}}</ref> Carleton also maintains a rivalry with the University of Ottawa in this field, having competed in the annual [[Colonel By Classic]] at [[TD Place Arena]] since the tradition began during the 2016–17 academic year for the men's team, and during the 2018–19 academic year for women.
