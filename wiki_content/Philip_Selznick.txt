==Major contributions==
Selznick was a major proponent of the neo-classical organizational theory movement starting in the 1930s.<ref name=ShafritzOtt1996>Shafritz, J.M., & Ott, J.S. (1996). Classics of Organization Theory (4th ed.). Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace & Company.</ref> One of his most influential papers, entitled "Foundations of the Theory of Organization" (1948),<ref name=Selznick1948>{{cite journal|last1=Selznick|first1=Philip|title=Foundations of the Theory of Organization|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=13|issue=1|year=1948|pages=25–35 |doi=10.2307/2086752|jstor=2086752}}</ref> laid out his major contributions to organization theory.

===Individuals as independent agents===
In simplified form, Selznick postulated that individuals within organizations can hold dichotomous goal-sets, which makes it difficult for organizations and employees to have the same implicit, rational objectives (as theorized in classical organization movement which was a precursor of Selznick's work).<ref name=Selznick1948/>

===Cooptation theory===
Selznick's principle of cooptation is an important precursor to the later developments of organizational ecology and [[contingency theory]].<ref name=ShafritzOtt1996/><ref>[[Gareth Morgan (business theorist)|Morgan, G.]] (1997). [[Images of Organization]] (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.</ref>

===Sociology of law===
Selznick has been a major contributor to the sociology of law,<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Nonet | first1 = Philippe | last2 = Selznick | first2 = Philip | title = Law and Society in Transition: Toward Responsive Law | year = 2001 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | location = New Brunswick, NJ | isbn = 0765806428 }}</ref> developing his ideas on legal institutions and their problems and possibilities of responsiveness to their constituencies, from his earlier work on the sociology of formal organizations.

===Theories of mass society===

Selznick was first &ndash; anticipating [[Daniel Bell]], [[Edward Shils]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[William Kornhauser]], and a host of American social scientists &ndash; to attack the then prevailing theory of [[mass society]]. His approach argued instead that there were two analytically distinct theoretical approaches to mass society:
*there were those who were critics of [[equalitarianism]] or who emphasized the role of creative and culture-bearing [[elite]]s;
*but there were also those who emphasized [[social disintegration]] and the quality of [[wikt:participation|participation]] in mass society and [[mass organization]]s.

The first group of theorists is best represented by [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Karl Mannheim]]. Each of these theorists located the cause of the advent of mass society in the decline of the social position of creative elites who were responsible for the development and the strength of [[cultural]] [[values]]. Mass society arose when society was no longer directed by an identifiable and stable structure of elites, when the vulgar appetites of the masses supplanted "the canons of refinement and sober restraint." The masses cannot simply take over the role served previously by elites; they can express [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]]s but not values.

The second group of mass society theorists, those who emphasized social disintegration and the quality of participation, was best represented by [[Emil Lederer]], [[Erich Fromm]], and [[Sigmund Neumann]]. Selznick argued that these theorists leave the role of elites largely unexamined. They defined mass society as the era of mass man, a type defined not in terms of any relationship to a formally superior or intrinsically more qualified elite, but as the expression of a wider social disintegration. The homogeneous, amorphous, and undifferentiated individuals in the mass resulted from radical [[social change]]s which rendered old [[norm (social)|norm]]s obsolete and old [[role]]s meaningless. [[Psychological]] deterioration followed on [[social disorganization]]: 'as [[family]], church, and traditional political ties weaken, a psychological atomization takes place.' This type of mass society theory pictures society as a crowd in which irrational, emotional acts predominate. "The readiness for manipulation by symbols, especially those permitting [[sado-masochistic]] releases, is characteristic of the mass as of the crowd."<ref>Philip Selznick, "Institutional Vulnerability in Mass Society," ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', 56 (January, 1951), 320-31</ref>
