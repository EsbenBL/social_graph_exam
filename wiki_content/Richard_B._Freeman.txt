== Education ==
He received his B.A. from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] in 1964 and his Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1969 for a thesis titled ''The Labor Market for College Manpower''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} He studied under Harvard Professor and Dean [[John Thomas Dunlop|John T. Dunlop]], who became U.S. Secretary of Labor under President [[Gerald Ford]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

== Contributions ==
Freeman has written 18 books, edited 29 books and published over 350 published articles on a wide range of subjects including global labor standards, the scientific workforce, the economics of crime, how the internet is transforming labor movements, and historical spurts in the growth of labor unions.<ref>CV: Richard B. Freeman, Harvard University, http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/freeman/files/rbf_full_cv_12-10-15.pdf?m=1449701139; Richard B. Freeman (2007), ''America Works: Critical Thoughts on the Exceptional U.S. Labor Market,'' New York: Russell Sage; Kimberly Ann Elliott and Richard B. Freeman (2003), ''Can Labor Standards Improve Under Globalization?'' Washington, D.C.: Peterson Institute; Richard B. Freeman (1998), "Spurts in Union Growth: Defining Moments and Social Processes" in Bordo, Michael D., Claudia Goldin, and Eugene N. White (Eds.),''The Defining Moment,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>
Freeman has made several significant but controversial contributions to economics and the field of industrial relations.  In ''What Do Unions Do?'' (1984), he and his co-author James Medoff presented evidence that countered conventional wisdom in economics when they concluded that “unionism on net probably raises social efficiency” and that “recent trends have brought the level of union density below the optimal level.”<ref>Freeman, Richard B. and James Medoff (1984). ''What Do Unions Do,'' New York: Basic Books, pp. 247 and 250.</ref> Freeman's work on the economic theory of unions has found support in several subsequent studies indicating that in many fields unionized workers have delivered higher levels of productivity than their non-union counterparts. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Nevertheless, some comparative scholarship indicates that the union advantage in productivity may vary by nation. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Christos Doucouliagos and Patrice Laroche in an article entitled “What do unions do to productivity?” (2003) indicate that unions significantly lift productivity in U.S. manufacturing, but these authors countered with evidence that unions have had detrimental effects on productivity in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Doucouliagos |first=Christos |first2=Patrice |last2=Laroche |year=2003 |title=What do unions do to productivity? A meta-analysis |journal=Industrial Relations |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=650–691 |doi=10.1111/1468-232X.00310 }}</ref>

Freeman and his collaborators have explored how the tournament model of prizes and funding in the biosciences has favored older researchers and contributed to the degradation of conditions for postdocs and graduate students. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} He has carried out a variety of studies on the internationalization of science, as more than half of the PhDs graduating in science and engineering from U.S. universities in 2003 were foreign born, more than double the rate in 1966.<ref>Freeman, Richard B. and Daniel L. Goroff (2009). “Introduction.” ''Science and Engineering Careers in the United States: An Analysis of Markets and Employment,'' Chicago: NBER and University of Chicago Press, p14.</ref>

In his early career, Freeman often faced critique for his book ''The Overeducated American'' (1976), which suggested that the U.S. labor market would have vast challenges employing the millions of citizens with college diplomas and advanced degrees from the enormous expansion of higher education after World War II. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} The high-tech boom of the later 1980s and 1990s reassured most observers that expanding higher education was the trusted route to national economic vitality and achieving the dreams for prosperity sought by millions of individuals. However, Freeman's thesis that labor markets will not always be friendly to university-educated workers is enjoying a revival in the early twenty-first century.<ref>{{cite news |last=Uchitelle |first=Louis |title=College Degree Still Pays, but It’s Leveling Off |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=January 13, 2005 |page=C1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/13/business/13pay.html }}</ref>  This re-consideration has gained momentum since the high unemployment and underemployment of college graduates following the Great Recession of 2008 as well as trends in globalization that have led to the off shoring of many jobs done by lawyers, accountants, information technology workers, and other well-educated professionals.

Freeman has made the case that expanding programs for employee ownership<ref>{{cite web |last1=Freeman |first1=Richard |title=Who owns the robots rules the world |url=https://wol.iza.org/articles/who-owns-the-robots-rules-the-world |publisher=IZA World of Labor |access-date=2 May 2021}}</ref> and broader-based profit sharing would help reduce inequality in the United States. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}  He co-wrote with Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse of Rutgers ''The Citizen’s Share: Reducing Inequality in the Twenty-first Century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), a work that French economist Thomas Piketty credited for tracing how “America used to be based on broad access to wealth and property” and then showing “how to revive” this tradition.<ref>Quote from cover of Freeman, Richard B., Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse,''The Citizen’s Share: Reducing Inequality in the Twenty-first Century,'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013.</ref>   Freeman has also written with Kimberly Ann Elliott studies of how human rights vigilantes have generated activism and consumer consciousness about apparel and other consumer products often manufactured under sweatshop labor conditions.<ref>Elliott, Kimberly Ann, and Richard B.
