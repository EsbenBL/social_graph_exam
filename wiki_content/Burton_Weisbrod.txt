'''Burton A. Weisbrod''' (born February 13, 1931 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is an [[Americans|American]] [[economist]] who pioneered the theory of [[option value]] and also advanced methods for [[benefit-cost analysis]] of [[public policy]] by recognizing the roles of [[externality]] effects in program evaluation. He applied those methods to the fields of [[education]], [[health care]], [[poverty]] and [[nonprofit organization]].  Over a career of fifty years, he published 16 books and over 200 scholarly articles.  He is currently the John Evans Professor of Economics and a Faculty Fellow of the [[Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research|Institute for Policy Research]] at [[Northwestern University]].

==Contributions to economics==
* Option Value –  Weisbrod is acknowledged to have developed the concept and coined the term [[option value]] as used in [[welfare economics]] to represent a portion of [[total economic value]].  His 1964 article introduced the idea that individuals may derive a benefit (referred to as "option value") from having access to use of a publicly provided good or service even if they are uncertain whether or not they will actually use it.<ref>Weisbrod, Burton A., 1964. "Collective-Consumption Services of Individual-Consumption Goods," Quarterly Journal of Economics, 78(3).</ref>  That concept has since come to be applied as an important tool in the valuation of parks, natural resources and environmental amenities, as well as access to public transit services.<ref>Arrow, Kenneth J and Anthony C. Fisher, 1974. "Environmental Preservation, Uncertainty and Irreversibility," Quarterly Journal of Economics, 88(2), May.</ref><ref>Schmalensee, Richard, 1972.

"Welfare Measurement and the Benefit-Cost Analysis of Projects Affecting Risk," Southern Economic Journal, 58(1), July.</ref>  Economists have further identified the concept of "Weisbrodian public goods" (private goods that also have public option value, such as hospital visits), as distinguished from the classic or pure "Samuelsonian public goods."<ref>Holtmann, Alphonse G., 1999. "Samuelsonian and Weisbrodian Public Goods," Public Finance Review, 27(4), July.</ref>
* Economics of Poverty –  Weisbrod conducted research demonstrating the [[externality]] (broader societal) benefits of public investment in [[education]] and [[health care]] in the early 1960s.<ref>Weisbrod, Burton A. 1961. Economics of Public Health, Univ. of Pennsylvania Press.</ref><ref>Weisbrod, Burton A. 1964. External Benefits of Public Education, Princeton University Press.</ref>  That work, which showed the income growth benefits from investment in [[human capital]], is recognized as advancing the use of [[benefit-cost analysis]] considerations in the area of [[public policy]].  That provided a justification for President Johnson's [[War on Poverty]] in the mid 1960s, which included [[education]] and [[health care]] as tools for [[poverty]] reduction.  As a Senior Staff member of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisors]] in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Weisbrod is credited with helping define the antipoverty program strategy that later led to the [[Head Start Program]] for preschool education.<ref>Vinovskis, Maris A., 2005. The Birth of Head Start, University of Chicago Press.</ref>
* Economics of Health Policy – Weisbrod was a pioneer in the development of [[benefit-cost analysis]] for [[health care]].  In the 1970s, he led two program evaluations that were considered path-breaking because they brought together economic, social and medical professionals to assess multi-year pilot programs.  A study in the Caribbean developed the connection between health, worker [[productivity]] and [[economic development]],<ref>Weisbrod et al, 1974. Disease and Economic Development: The Case of Parasitic Diseases, University of Wisconsin Press.</ref> and it provided support for international aid agencies to invest in [[disease prevention]].<ref>Weisbrod et al, 1983. Human Resources, Employment and Development, v.3: The Problems of Developed Countries and the International Economy, MacMillan Press, London.</ref>  It was followed by a study in the US that showed net cost savings and medical benefit gains from switching patients out of [[mental hospital]]s and into aggressive outpatient programs.<ref>Weisbrod, BA, MA Test and LI Stein, 1980. "Alternative to Mental Hospital Treatment, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 37(4).</ref><ref>Weisbrod et al, 1981. Economics and Mental Health, National Institute of Mental Health.</ref>  Over the next thirty years, that finding was used as a basis for a national movement towards closing mental hospitals and replacing them with outpatient services.  However, the adequacy of replacement outpatient services in controlling mental illness remains an issue of public discussion.<ref>McGuire, Thomas G., 1991. "Measuring the Economic Cost of Schizophrenia," Schizophrenia Bulletin, Oxford Journals, 17(3).</ref>
* Nonprofit Sector – In a series of four books issued each decade from 1978 to 2008, Weisbrod further developed theory to explain the comparative economic behavior of for-profit, government, and private [[nonprofit organization]]s, and the causes and consequences of the growing commercialism of nonprofits.<ref>Weisbrod, The Voluntary Nonprofit Sector: An Economic Analysis, Lexington Books, New York.</ref><ref>Weisbrod, The Nonprofit Economy, Harvard University Press, Cambridge.</ref><ref>Weisbrod, To Profit or Not to Profit: the Commercial Transformation of the Nonprofit Sector, Cambridge University Press.</ref><ref>Weisbrod, Mission and Money: Understanding the University, Cambridge University Press.</ref> As part of this effort, he calculated the value of voluntary labor in the United States, which is a factor considered in the analysis of [[efficiency wage]].
