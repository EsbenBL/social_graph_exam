'''Jacquetta Hawkes''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FSA}} {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (5 August 1910 – 18 March 1996) was an English [[archaeologist]] and writer. She was the first woman to study the Archaeology & Anthropology degree course at the [[University of Cambridge]]. A specialist in prehistoric archaeology, she excavated [[Neanderthal]] remains at the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] site of [[Mount Carmel]] with [[Yusra (archaeologist)|Yusra]] and [[Dorothy Garrod]]. She was a representative for the UK at [[UNESCO]], and was curator of the 'People of Britain' pavilion at the [[Festival of Britain]].

Widely recognised for her book ''[[A Land]]'' (1951), she wrote widely on archaeology, fusing a literary style of writing with a deep knowledge of landscape and past human lives, as well as using film and radio to enable archaeology to reach new audiences. In 1953 she married [[J. B. Priestley]], with whom she authored several works. She was co-founder of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and an active campaigner in the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]]. In 1967 she published ''Dawn of the Gods'', a 'feminine' interpretation of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan civilisation]]. In 1971 the [[Council for British Archaeology]] rewarded her advocacy for the discipline with the role of Vice-President.

In 1934 she had published her first article "Aspects of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in western Europe" in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''.<ref name="Cooke2242" /> The same year, she visited a seven-year old [[David Attenborough]]'s "museum" of fossils and geology, donating specimens to it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Attenborough|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RUhAQAAIAAJ&q=life+on+air|title=Life on Air: Memoirs of a Broadcaster|date=2002|publisher=BBC|isbn=978-0-563-53461-7|pages=318|language=en}}</ref> In 1935 she led a BBC Radio programme "Ancient Britain Out of Doors", introducing key ideas about archaeology then discussing them with colleagues [[Stuart Piggott]] and [[Nowell Myres]].<ref name=":5" />  In 1937 her only child, Nicholas, was born.<ref name="Cooke2242" /> 

In 1938 Hawkes' first book ''The Archaeology of Jersey'' was published &ndash; it was the second work in a series on the archaeology of the Channel Islands that had been begun by [[T. D.

Hawkes and her son moved to Dorset early in the war, when Britain was facing the threat of invasion.<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|last=Hawkes|first=Jacquetta|title=A Quest of Love|publisher=Chatto & Windus|year=1980|location=Fakenham|pages=213}}</ref> In her memoir ''A Quest of Love'', Hawkes described how, whilst in Dorset early in the war, her "violent emotional involvement with a woman" was "a sudden undamning of feelings of an intensity that I did not know I possessed".<ref name=":14" /> Her biographer, [[Christine Finn (writer)|Christine Finn]], characterised this affair as leaving Hawkes "emotionally confused".<ref name=":0" /> The writer [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]] described Hawkes as "bisexual through much of the 1930s".<ref name=":6" />

During the latter half of [[the Blitz]] Hawkes returned to London and began work in the civil service.<ref name="Cooke2242" /><ref name=":14" /> To begin with she was involved with moving items from the [[British Museum]] to the [[Aldwych tube station]] for safe-keeping.<ref name="Cooke2242" /> She began work in 1941 as Assistant Principal of the Post-War Reconstruction Secretariat.<ref name=":1" /> Her next post, begun in 1943 and one she held until 1949, was in the Ministry of Education, where she became Secretary of the UK National Committee for [[UNESCO]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":1" /> In her work in the Ministry of Education she was editor-in-chief of the film unit, where she commissioned and produced ''The Beginning of History'' &ndash; an early attempt to present prehistory on film.<ref name=":0" />

Whilst working for the government she continued to publish, including ''Prehistoric Britain'' (1944, co-authored with her then husband, Christopher Hawkes), and ''Early Britain'' (1945).<ref name=":1" /> ''Prehistoric Britain'' was used by many students in the 1940s and 1950s and underwent several editions and reprints.<ref name="Cooke2242" />

During the war she met the poet [[Walter J. Turner]], with whom she had an affair. Turner died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]] in 1946 and Hawkes was grief-stricken.<ref name=":1" /> Inspired by Turner's writing and their love, she published her only poetry collection ''Symbols and Speculations'' in 1948.<ref name=":1" /> It recalled, through poetry, both mystical and physical experiences in her archaeological career.<ref name=":3">{{cite book|last1=Hawkes|first1=Jacquetta|title=Symbols & Speculations|date=1949|publisher=The Cresset Press}}</ref> 

During her time as Secretary, a major task was the preparations for UNESCO's first conference, which was held in Mexico City in 1947.<ref name=":1" /> One of the UK representatives was her future husband, [[J. B. Priestley]], although Hawkes initially opposed his inclusion.<ref name=":1" /> However, at the conference Hawkes and Priestley fell in love.<ref name=":1" /> Priestley famously described her demeanour as "Ice without! Fire within!"<ref name=":0" />

== Festival of Britain ==
[[File:Festival_of_Britain.JPG|thumb|Festival of Britain poster]]
In 1949 Hawkes left the civil service, in order to work full-time as a writer.<ref name=":1" /> She was interested in communicating archaeology and art in new ways to new audiences, including through writing creatively and through film.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Finn|first1=Christine|date=2000|title=Ways of Telling: Jacquetta Hawkes as Film-maker|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/ways-of-telling-jacquetta-hawkes-as-filmmaker/4E3851B83D9F95623F72F38B2392BD9C|journal=Antiquity|volume=74|issue=283|pages=127–130|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00066229|s2cid=162582214}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=Jacquetta|date=1946|title=The Beginning of History &ndash; a film|journal=Antiquity|volume=20|issue=78|pages=78–82|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00019402}}</ref> In 1950 the British Film Institute made her a governor.<ref name=":0" /> Writing with empathy, in what became termed the 'archaeological imagination', was central to her practice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hick|first1=Dan|title=Jacquetta Hawkes, Sir Isaac Newton & the idea of stratigraphy|url=https://www.dayofarchaeology.com/jacquetta-hawkes-sir-isaac-newton-and-the-idea-of-stratigraphy/|access-date=20 September 2019|website=Day of Archaeology}}</ref> One of her first creative projects was as archaeological advisor to the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951, where she produced the 'People of Britain' pavilion.<ref name="Cooke2242" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cox|first=Ian|title=The South Bank Exhibition: A guide to the story it tells|publisher=H M Stationery Office|year=1951|location=London|pages=62–66}}</ref> The pavilion's architect was [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown|H T Cadbury Brown]] and it was designed by [[James Gardner (designer)|James Gardner]].<ref name=":5" /> The vision of the pavilion created by Hawkes showed archaeological sites as if they were being discovered for the first time, proceeding chronologically from a prehistoric burial, to a Bronze Age gold necklace, to a Roman mosaic floor. After the Roman section, visitors met a recreation of the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial.<ref name=":5" />

== ''A Land'' (1951) ==
Published one month after the opening of the Festival of Britain, and perhaps Hawkes' most widely recognised work, ''[[A Land]]'' (1951) characterised the archaeology of Britain, and thus the story of Britishness, as one of repeated waves of migration.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=A Land – The MERL|url=https://merl.reading.ac.uk/collections/festival-britain-1951/a-land|access-date=2021-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref> The book was illustrated by [[Henry Moore]].<ref name=":4" /> Described by geographer [[Hayden Lorimer]] as "an unconventional geological history",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lorimer|first1=Hayden|year=2012|title=Memoirs for the Earth: Jacquetta Hawkes' experiments in deep time|journal=Cultural Geographies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=87–106|doi=10.1177/1474474011432377|jstor=44251454|s2cid=143802706}}</ref> it was a bestseller in the UK and was described by [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert MacFarlane]] as "one of the defining British non-fiction books of the postwar decade".<ref name=":6">{{cite web|last1=McFarlane|first1=Robert|title=A Land &ndash; Jacquetta Hawkes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes|access-date=20 September 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Reviewed on its publication in ''The Journal of Geology'' as "literary expression ... rather than scientific description",<ref>{{cite journal|date=1953|title=Review: A Land|journal=The Journal of Geology|volume=61|issue=3|pages=287–8}}</ref> even Hawkes was aware that it was a difficult book to classify.<ref name=":6" /> Nevertheless, a review by [[Harold Nicolson]] helped to boost its popularity where he described "the weird beauty in this prophetic book …it is written with a passion of love and hate".<ref name=":6" /> In 1952 she was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hawkes, Jacquetta (1910–1996) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hawkes-jacquetta-1910-1996|access-date=2021-09-25|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref>

Priestley's letters in the work were set in a "brash new America in Texas", whilst Hawkes' were written from the perspectives of indigenous societies in New Mexico.<ref name=":1" />

== Research in the 1950s ==
In 1953, the film ''Figures in a Landscape'', a documentary about the work of [[Barbara Hepworth]], came out, whose script had been written by Hawkes.<ref name="Cooke2242" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Finn|first1=Christine|date=2005|title=Jacquetta and the Artists|journal=British Archaeology|volume=80|pages=24–7}}</ref> In 1956 she began excavations on the [[Mottistone Manor|Mottistone Estate]], whose land adjoined hers and Priestley's home of Brook Hill House.<ref name=":9">{{cite web|title=Jacquetta Hawkes &ndash; Longstone Mystery Solver|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/mottistone-estate/features/jacquetta-hawkes-mottistone-mystery-solver|access-date=20 September 2019|website=National Trust}}</ref> The subject of Hawkes' investigation was [[The Longstone, Mottistone|The Longstone]]; her research, which was published in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]],'' demonstrated that it was the remains of the entrance to a Neolithic long barrow.<ref name=":9" />

In 1968 she published ''Dawn of the Gods'', which examined [[Minoan civilization|Minoan civilisation]], and argued that it was a 'feminine' society.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Freeman|first=Charles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXIVDAAAQBAJ&q=jacquetta+hawkes+minoan&pg=PT138|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965191-7|pages=120|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8eIAgAAQBAJ&q=jacquetta+hawkes+minoan&pg=PA162|title=Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete|date=2002-01-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-88064-5|pages=162|language=en}}</ref> Hawkes was also one of the first archaeologists to suggest that the ancient Minoans might have been ruled by women; the idea had been discussed previously by historians of [[culture]] and [[religion]], such as [[Joseph Campbell]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vTDJDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT155&lpg=PT155&dq=joseph+campbell+minoan+women&source=bl&ots=dErWlBb9WE&sig=ACfU3U1J8sT_pj6toZ4JrxTj3EQvi51wTw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwie3bi-xb_zAhXMT8AKHQoMAzwQ6AF6BAgnEAM#v=onepage&q=joseph%20campbell%20minoan%20women&f=false|title=Occidental Mythology|date=2017-10-17|publisher=Joseph Campbell Foundation|isbn=978-1-61178-003-1|language=en}}</ref> and it had also been discussed as part of feminist discourse.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last=Muir|first=Richard|date=2003-04-01|title=Founders: Jacquetta Hawkes|url=https://doi.org/10.1179/lan.2003.4.1.99|journal=Landscapes|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99–110|doi=10.1179/lan.2003.4.1.99|s2cid=144540319|issn=1466-2035}}</ref> She used evidence from art to argue that the society was matriarchal: "the absence of these manifestations of the all-powerful male ruler that are so widespread at this time and in this stage of cultural development as to be almost universal, is one of the reasons for supposing that the occupants of Minoan thrones may have been queens".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkes|first1=Jacquetta|title=Dawn of the Gods|page=76}}</ref> Reviewed by [[Frank Stubbings]], he praised the book, describing how "the writer remembers always that these were real human beings"; however, he also had several caveats &ndash; some on questions of dating, but most of all on account of the poetic language used by Hawkes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stubbings|first=Frank H.|date=1969|title=Jacquetta Hawkes: Dawn of the Gods.

Also in 1968, Hawkes published a paper in ''Antiquity'' entitled 'The Proper Study of Mankind'. In it she argued against an over-emphasis on science in archaeological discourse.<ref name=":7" /> The paper was widely debated, with archaeologist [[D. P. Agrawal]] suggesting in 1970 that her article was the 'protests of a passing generation' and that it contributed to polemicisation of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Agrawal|first=D.

== Later life ==
[[File:Katha Pollitt photo credit to Christina Pabst.jpg|thumb|Reviewer [[Katha Pollitt]]]]
In 1971, Hawkes was elected Vice-President of the [[Council for British Archaeology]] in recognition of her life's work.<ref name=":2" /> In 1980 she published ''[[A Quest of Love]]'', a creative memoir of her romantic and sexual life, where she imagined herself as different women across time, from a Palaeolithic shaman called Jakka to a Victorian governess.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Finn|first=Christine|date=2001|title=A Rare Bird &ndash; Archaeology Magazine Archive|url=https://archive.archaeology.org/0101/abstracts/hawkes.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-25|website=archive.archaeology.org}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite news|last=Pollitt|first=Katha|date=1981-03-08|title=HAWKES'S MANY SELVES|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/hawkes-s-many-selves.html|access-date=2021-09-25|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> It was described by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Katha Pollitt]] as "antifeminist", a "humourless rambling document" and a "masochistic fantasia of the unconscious".<ref name=":12" /> [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] in the [[London Review of Books]] praise the "candour" of the final section, which discussed her marriages, but was negative overall.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sutherland|first=John|date=1980-10-16|title=In Praise of Follett|language=en|volume=02|work=London Review of Books|issue=20|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v02/n20/john-sutherland/in-praise-of-follett|access-date=2021-10-07|issn=0260-9592}}</ref> However, in a 2018 reappraisal of the work, literary theorist [[Ina Habermann|Ina Haberman]] described it as a "visionary autobiography" and an "overlooked exercise in ''[[Écriture féminine|écriture feminine]]".''<ref>{{Citation|last=Habermann|first=Ina|title=English Visions: The Work of Jacquetta Hawkes Priestley|date=2018|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92126-6_11|work=Fashioning England and the English: Literature, Nation, Gender|pages=253–271|editor-last=Orgis|editor-first=Rahel|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-92126-6_11|isbn=978-3-319-92126-6|access-date=2021-10-10|editor2-last=Heim|editor2-first=Matthias}}</ref> 

In 1982 she published a biography of [[Mortimer Wheeler]].<ref name=":7" /> Reviewed by [[F H Thompson]] in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', the biography was criticised for its over-emphasis on, and criticism of, Wheeler's sex life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=F.

Priestley died in 1982. After his death Hawkes moved to [[Chipping Campden|Chipping Camden]] and continued her interests in archaeology and science, particularly ornithology.<ref name=":1" /> Her last publication, ''The Shell Guide to British Archaeology'', was co-written with archaeologist [[Paul Bahn]] and published in 1986.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Dr Paul Bahn|url=https://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/travel/dr-paul-bahn|access-date=2021-09-25|website=Alumni|language=en}}</ref> Noted for her striking looks, she was the subject of the work of several photographers across her lifetime, including [[Lord Snowdon]], [[Bern Schwartz (photographer)|Bern Schwartz]], Mark Gerson, [[J.S.

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:All_Angels_Church,_Hubberholme._-_geograph.org.uk_-_1171577.jpg|thumb|All Angels Church, [[Hubberholme]].]]
Hawkes died in [[Cheltenham]] on 18 March 1996.<ref name=":1" /> Cremated, her ashes are interred with Priestley's at an unknown location in [[Hubberholme]] churchyard.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Hubberholme Church|url=https://www.yorkshire-dales.com/hubberholme-church.html|access-date=22 April 2020|website=www.yorkshire-dales.com}}</ref> However their presence there is commemorated with a plaque on the church.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-10-10|title=Hubberholme church congregation remembers literary icon J B Priestley {{!}} Craven Herald|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010092443/https://www.cravenherald.co.uk/news/countryfile/13599318.hubberholme-church-congregation-remembers-literary-icon-j-b-priestley/|access-date=2021-10-10|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>

Whilst Hawkes' views and writing may have been too "poetic" for the archaeological establishment, particularly in the context of processual archaeology's popularity in the later mid-twentieth century,<ref name=":11" /> in the twenty-first century her writing found new audiences, with a re-issue of ''[[A Land]]'' in 2012 with a new foreword by nature writer and academic [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":6" /> Hawkes' artistic, poetic and humanitarian approach to archaeology has been termed "creative archaeology" by biographer [[Christine Finn (writer)|Christine Finn]].<ref name=":7" />
