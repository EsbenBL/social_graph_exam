'''Kashmir'''{{efn|{{lang-ur|کشمیر|kaśmīr}}, {{lang-ks|کٔشیٖر|kaśīr}}}} ({{IPA-ks|kaʃmiːr|IPA}}) is the northernmost geographical region of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Until the mid-19th century, the term "Kashmir" denoted only the [[Kashmir Valley]] between the [[Great Himalayas]] and the [[Pir Panjal Range]]. Today, the term encompasses a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territories of [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]], the Pakistani-administered territories of [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], and the Chinese-administered territories of [[Aksai Chin]] and the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]].<ref name=britannica-intro>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Kashmir: region, Indian subcontinent|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=16 July 2016|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kashmir-region-Indian-subcontinent}} Quote: "Kashmir, region of the northwestern Indian subcontinent. It is bounded by the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang to the northeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east (both parts of China), by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south, by Pakistan to the west, and by Afghanistan to the northwest. The northern and western portions are administered by Pakistan and comprise three areas: Azad Kashmir, Gilgit, and Baltistan, ... The southern and southeastern portions constitute the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian- and Pakistani-administered portions are divided by a "line of control" agreed to in 1972, although neither country recognizes it as an international boundary. In addition, China became active in the eastern area of Kashmir in the 1950s and since 1962 has controlled the northeastern part of Ladakh (the easternmost portion of the region)."</ref><ref name=bbc-intro>{{cite web|title=Kashmir territories profile|publisher=BBC|access-date=16 July 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11693674}} Quote: "The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades.

An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of the [[Vedic age|Vedic]] sage [[Kashyapa]] who is believed to have settled people in this land. Accordingly, ''Kashmir'' would be derived from either ''kashyapa-mir'' (Kashyapa's Lake) or ''kashyapa-meru'' (Kashyapa's Mountain).<ref name="Snedden2015"/>

The word has been referenced to in a Hindu scripture mantra worshipping the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Saraswati|Sharada]] and is mentioned to have resided in the land of ''kashmira'', or which might have been a reference to the [[Sharada Peeth]].

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] called the region ''Kasperia'',  which has been identified with ''Kaspapyros'' of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] ([[:wikt:apud|apud]] [[Stephanus of Byzantium]]) and ''Kaspatyros'' of [[Herodotus]] (3.102, 4.44).

[[Xuanzang|Huientsang]], the Buddhist scholar and Chinese traveller, called Kashmir ''kia-shi-milo'', while some other Chinese accounts referred to Kashmir as ''ki-pin'' (or Chipin or Jipin) and ''ache-pin''.<ref name="Kashur"/>

''Cashmeer'' is an archaic spelling of modern Kashmir, and in some countries{{which|date=August 2019}} it is still spelled this way. Kashmir is called ''Cachemire'' in French, ''Cachemira'' in Spanish, ''Caxemira'' in Portuguese, ''Caixmir'' in Catalan, ''Casmiria'' in Latin, ''Cașmir'' in Romanian, and ''Cashmir'' in Occitan.

During the ancient and medieval periods, Kashmir was an important centre for the development of a Hindu-Buddhist [[syncretism]], in which [[Madhyamaka]] and [[Yogachara]] were blended with [[Shaivism]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]]. The Buddhist [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] is often credited with having founded the old capital of Kashmir, Shrinagari, now ruins on the outskirts of modern [[Srinagar]]. Kashmir was long a stronghold of [[Buddhism]].<ref>A.K. Warder, ''Indian Buddhism''. Motilal Banarsidass 2000, page 256.</ref> As a Buddhist seat of learning, the [[Sarvastivada]] school strongly influenced Kashmir.<ref>A.K. Warder, ''Indian Buddhism''. Motilal Banarsidass 2000, pages 263–264.</ref> East and Central Asian Buddhist [[monk]]s are recorded as having visited the kingdom. In the late 4th century CE, the famous [[Kucha]]nese monk [[Kumārajīva]], born to an Indian noble family, studied [[Āgama (Buddhism)#D.C4.ABrgha .C4.80gama|Dīrghāgama]] and Madhyāgama in Kashmir under Bandhudatta. He later became a prolific translator who helped take Buddhism to China. His mother Jīva is thought to have retired to Kashmir. Vimalākṣa, a Sarvāstivādan Buddhist monk, travelled from Kashmir to Kucha and there instructed Kumārajīva in the ''[[Buddhist texts#Vinaya|Vinayapiṭaka]]''.

In 1845, the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] broke out. According to ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]:''

<blockquote>Gulab Singh contrived to hold himself aloof till the battle of Sobraon (1846), when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Henry Lawrence]]. Two treaties were concluded. By the first the State of Lahore (i.e. West Punjab) handed over to the British, as equivalent for one crore indemnity, the hill countries between the rivers Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for 75 lakhs all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of the Indus and the west of the Ravi i.e. the Vale of Kashmir.<ref name=imperialgazet-gulabsingh/></blockquote>

Ranbir Singh's grandson [[Hari Singh]], who had ascended the throne of Kashmir in 1925, was the reigning monarch in 1947 at the conclusion of British rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent [[Partition of India|partition]] of the British [[British India|Indian Empire]] into the newly independent [[Dominion of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. According to [[Burton Stein]]'s ''History of India'', <blockquote>Kashmir was neither as large nor as old an independent state as [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]; it had been created rather off-handedly by the British after the first defeat of the Sikhs in 1846, as a reward to a former official who had sided with the British. The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14–15 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]]<ref>Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, stayed on in independent India from 1947 to 1948, serving as the first Governor-General of the Union of India.</ref> for assistance, and the [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.<ref name=stein>Stein, Burton. 2010. ''A History of India''. Oxford University Press. 432 pages. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9509-6}}. Page 358.</ref></blockquote>

In the last days of 1948, a ceasefire was agreed under UN auspices. However, since the [[plebiscite]] demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured,<ref name=stein/> and eventually led to two more wars over Kashmir in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Kargil War|1999]].

According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':

<blockquote>Although there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region. Pakistan was left with territory that, although basically Muslim in character, was thinly populated, relatively inaccessible, and economically underdeveloped. The largest Muslim group, situated in the Valley of Kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region, lay in Indian-administered territory, with its former outlets via the Jhelum valley route blocked.<ref name="britannica-kashmir" /><ref name=britannica-intro/></blockquote>

The eastern region of the former princely state of Kashmir is also involved in a boundary dispute that began in the late 19th century and continues into the 21st. Although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Afghanistan and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and China's official position has not changed following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|communist revolution of 1949]] that established the People's Republic of China. By the mid-1950s the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese army]] had entered the north-east portion of Ladakh.<ref name="britannica-kashmir">Kashmir. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica.

<blockquote>By 1956–57 they had completed a military road through the [[Aksai Chin]] area to provide better communication between [[Xinjiang]] and western [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]].

The region is divided amongst three countries in a [[Kashmir conflict|territorial dispute]]: Pakistan controls the northwest portion (Northern Areas and Kashmir), India controls the central and southern portion (Jammu and Kashmir) and Ladakh, and the People's Republic of [[China]] controls the northeastern portion (Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract). India controls the majority of the [[Siachen Glacier]] area, including the [[Saltoro Mountains|Saltoro Ridge]] passes, whilst Pakistan controls the lower territory just southwest of the Saltoro Ridge. India controls {{convert|101338|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the disputed territory, Pakistan controls {{convert|85846|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and the People's Republic of China controls the remaining {{convert|37555|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.

Jammu and Azad Kashmir lie south and west of the [[Pir Panjal range]], and are under Indian and Pakistani control respectively. These are populous regions. Gilgit-Baltistan, formerly known as the ''Northern Areas'', is a group of territories in the extreme north, bordered by the [[Karakoram]], the western [[Himalayas]], the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]], and the [[Hindu Kush]] ranges. With its administrative centre in the town of [[Gilgit]], the Northern Areas cover an area of {{convert|72,971|km2}} and have an estimated population approaching 1&nbsp;million (10 [[lakh]]s).

Ladakh is between the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] mountain range in the north and the main Great Himalayas to the south.<ref name="Ladakh">{{Citation |title=Ladakh: The Land and the People |last=Jina |first=Prem Singh |year=1996 |publisher=Indus Publishing |isbn=978-81-7387-057-6 }}</ref> Capital towns of the region are [[Leh]] and [[Kargil]].

Geographically part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], Aksai Chin is referred to as the Soda Plain. The region is almost uninhabited, and has no permanent settlements.

Though these regions are in practice administered by their respective claimants, neither India nor Pakistan has formally recognised the accession of the areas claimed by the other. India claims those areas, including the area "ceded" to China by Pakistan in the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] in 1963, are a part of its territory, while Pakistan claims the entire region excluding Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. The two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] established the rough boundaries of today, with Pakistan holding roughly one-third of Kashmir, and India one-half, with a dividing [[line of control]] established by the United Nations. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] resulted in a stalemate and a UN-negotiated ceasefire.

The topography of Kashmir is mostly mountainous. It is traversed mainly by the [[Western Himalaya]]s. The Himalayas terminate in the western boundary of Kashmir at [[Nanga Parbat]]. Kashmir is traversed by three rivers namely [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Jhelum River|Jehlum]] and [[Chenab River|Chenab]]. These river basins divide the region into three valleys separated by high mountain ranges. The Indus valley forms the north and north-eastern portion of the region which include bare and desolate areas of [[Baltistan]] and Ladakh. The upper portion of the Jhelum valley forms the proper Vale of Kashmir surrounded by high mountain ranges. The [[Chenab valley]] forms the southern portion of the Kashmir region with its denuded hills towards the south. It includes almost the whole of the [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]]. High altitude lakes are frequent at high elevations. Lower down in the Vale of Kashmir there are many freshwater lakes and large areas of swamplands which include [[Wular Lake]], [[Dal Lake]] and [[Hokersar]] near Srinagar.<ref>{{Cite book|last=B. O.

To the north and northeast, beyond the Great Himalayas, the region is traversed by the [[Karakoram]] mountains. To the northwest lies the Hindu Kush mountain range. The upper Indus River separates the Himalayas from the Karakoram.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Western Himalayas {{!}} mountains, Asia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/western-Himalayas|access-date=2020-10-29|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> The Karakoram is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions.

The Indus River system forms the [[drainage basin]] of the Kashmir region. The river enters the region in Ladakh at its southeastern corner from the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and flows northwest to run a course through the entire Ladakh and Gilgit-Baltistan. Almost all the rivers originating in these region are part of the Indus river system.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Indus River {{!}} Definition, Length, Map, History, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Indus-River|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> After reaching the end of the Greaty Himalayan range, the Indus turns a corner and flows southwest into the Punjab plains. The Jhelum and Chenab rivers also follow a course roughly parallel to this, and join the Indus river in southern Punjab plains in Pakistan. 

The geographical features of the Kashmir region differ considerably from one part to another. The lowest part of the region consists of the plains of Jammu at the southwestern corner, which continue into the plains of Punjab at an elevation of below 1000 feet. Mountains begin at 2000 feet, then raising to 3000–4000 feet in the "Outer Hills", a rugged country with ridges and long narrow valleys. Next within the tract lie the Middle Mountains which are 8000–10,000 feet in height with ramifying valleys. Adjacent to these hills are the lofty [[Great Himalayas|Great HImalayan]] ranges (14000–15000 feet) which divide the drainage of the [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Jehlum River|Jehlum]] from that of the Indus. Beyond this range lies a wide tract of moutainous country of 17000–22000 feet in Ladakh and [[Baltistan]].<ref name=drew/>{{Clarification needed|reason=It is unclear how all these ranges relate to the geography; where is the Kashmir Valley in this system?|date=April 2021}}

Kashmir has a different climate for every region owing to the great variation of the level of the altitude. The temperatures ranges from the tropical heat of the Punjab summer to the intensity of the cold which keeps the perpetual snow on the mountains. Jammu Division, excluding the upper parts of the Chenab Valley, features a humid subtropical climate. The Vale of Kashmir has a moderate climate. The [[Astore Valley]] and some parts of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] features a semi-Tibatan climate. While as the other parts of Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh have Tibetan climate which is considered as almost rainless climate.<ref name=drew/><ref>{{Cite book|last=[[Aurel Stein|Stein M.

The southwestern Kashmir which includes much of the Jammu province and Muzaffarabad falls within the reach of Indian monsoon. The Pir Panjal Range acts as an effective barrier and blocks these monsoon tracts in reaching the main Kashmir Valley and the Himalayan slopes. These areas of the region receive much of the precipitation from the wind currents of the Arabian Sea. The Himalayan slope and the Pir Panjal witness greatest snow melting from March until June. These variations in snow melting and rainfall have led to destructive inundations of the main valley. One instance of such Kashmir flood of a larger proportion is recorded in the 12th-century book ''[[Rajatarangini]]''. A single cloudburst in July, 1935 caused the upper Jehlum river level to rise 11 feet.<ref>{{Cite book|last=[[T. T.

Kashmir has a recorded forest area of {{convert|20230|km2|mi2}} along with some [[Deosai National Park|national parks]] and [[Hemis National Park|reserves]]. The forests vary according to the climatic conditions and the altitude. Kashmir forests range from the [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical deciduous forests]] in the foothills of Jammu and [[Muzafarabad]], to the [[temperate forests]] throughout the Vale of Kashmir and to the [[Alpine tundra|alpine grasslands]] and high altitude medows in Gilgit-Baltistan and Ladakh.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Dar|first1=Ghulam Hassan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyPTDwAAQBAJ|title=Biodiversity of the Himalaya: Jammu and Kashmir State|last2=Khuroo|first2=Anzar A.|date=2020-02-26|publisher=Springer Nature|isbn=978-981-329-174-4|pages=193–200}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bari Naik|first=Abdul|title=Tourism Potential in Ecological Zones and Future Prospects of Tourism: in Kashmir Valley|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing (April 22, 2016)|isbn=3659878626|pages=48}}</ref>
The Kashmir region has four well defined zones of vegetation in the tree growth, due to the difference in elevation. The tropical forests up to 1500 m, are known as the Phulai (''Acacia modesta'') and Olive (Olea cuspid ata) Zone. There occur semi-deciduous species of ''[[Shorea robusta]]'', ''[[Acacia catechu]]'', ''[[Dalbergia sissoo]]'', ''[[Albizia lebbeck]]'', ''[[Garuga pinnata]]'', ''[[Terminalia bellirica]]'' and ''[[Tilia tomentosa|T. tomentosa]]'' and ''[[Pinus roxburghii]]'' are found at higher elevations. The temperate zone between (1,500–3,500 m) is referred as the Chir Pine (Finns longifolia). This zone is dominated by [[oak]]s (''Quercus'' spp.) and ''[[Rhododendron]]'' spp. The Blue Pine (Finns excelsa) Zone with ''[[Cedrus deodara]]'', ''[[Abies pindrow]]'' and ''[[Picea smithiana]]'' occur at elevations between 2,800 and 3,500 m. The Birch (Betula utilis) Zone has Herbaceous genera of [[Anemone]], [[Geranium]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]], [[Lloydia]], [[Potentilla]] and [[Primula]] interspersed with dry dwarf alpine scrubs of [[Berberis]], [[Cotoneaster]], [[Juniperus]] and [[Rhododendron]] are prevalent in alpine grasslands at 3,500 m and above.<ref name=flowers>{{Cite book|last=B.

==Demographics==
In the 1901 Census of the British [[British Raj|Indian Empire]], the population of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu was 2,905,578. Of these, 2,154,695 (74.16%) were Muslims, 689,073 (23.72%) Hindus, 25,828 (0.89%) Sikhs, and 35,047 (1.21%) Buddhists (implying 935 (0.032%) others).

The Hindus were found mainly in Jammu, where they constituted a little less than 60% of the population.<ref name=imperialgazetteerkashmir>''Imperial Gazetteer of India, volume 15''. 1908. Oxford University Press, Oxford and London. pp. 99–102.</ref> In the Kashmir Valley, the Hindus represented "524 in every 10,000 of the population (''i.e.'' 5.24%), and in the frontier ''wazarats'' of Ladhakh and Gilgit only 94 out of every 10,000 persons (0.94%)."<ref name=imperialgazetteerkashmir/> In the same Census of 1901, in the Kashmir Valley, the total population was recorded to be 1,157,394, of which the Muslim population was 1,083,766, or 93.6% and the Hindu population 60,641.<ref name=imperialgazetteerkashmir/> Among the Hindus of Jammu province, who numbered 626,177 (or 90.87% of the Hindu population of the princely state), the most important castes recorded in the census were "[[Brahmin|Brahmans]] (186,000), the [[Rajput]]s (167,000), the [[Khatri|Khattris]] (48,000) and the Thakkars (93,000)."<ref name=imperialgazetteerkashmir/>

In the 1911 Census of the British Indian Empire, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu had increased to 3,158,126. Of these, 2,398,320 (75.94%) were Muslims, 696,830 (22.06%) Hindus, 31,658 (1%) Sikhs, and 36,512 (1.16%) Buddhists. In the last census of British India in 1941, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu (which as a result of the Second World War, was estimated from the 1931 census) was 3,945,000. Of these, the total Muslim population was 2,997,000 (75.97%), the Hindu population was 808,000 (20.48%), and the Sikh 55,000 (1.39%).<ref name = brush>{{cite journal | last1 = Brush | first1 = J.

The [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s, the only Hindus of the Kashmir valley, who had stably constituted approximately 4 to 5% of the population of the valley during Dogra rule (1846–1947), and 20% of whom had left the Kashmir valley by 1950,{{sfn|Zutshi|2003|p=318|ps=Since a majority of the landlords were Hindu, the (land) reforms (of 1950) led to a mass exodus of Hindus from the state. ...

According to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during that decade.{{sfn|Bose|1997|p=71}}{{sfn|Rai|2004|p=286}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=274|ps=The Hindu Pandits, a small but influential elite community who had secured a favourable position, first under the maharajas, and then under the successive Congress regimes, and proponents of a distinctive Kashmiri culture that linked them to India, felt under siege as the uprising gathered force.

==Economy==
{{Further|Azad Kashmir#Economy|Jammu and Kashmir (state)#Economy}}

Kashmir's economy is centred around [[agriculture]]. Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its [[temperate climate]], it is suited for crops like [[asparagus]], artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, [[peach]]es, and cherries. The chief trees are [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], firs and [[pine]]s, [[Platanus orientalis|chenar]] or plane, maple, birch and [[walnut]], apple, cherry.

Historically, Kashmir became known worldwide when [[Cashmere wool]] was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at [[knitting]] and making [[Pashmina]] [[shawl]]s, silk carpets, rugs, [[kurta]]s, and pottery. [[Saffron]], too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, [[papier-mâché]], wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistani-administered territory of Azad Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
