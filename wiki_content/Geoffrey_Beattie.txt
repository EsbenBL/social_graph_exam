Beattie has also published two novels – ‘The Corner Boys’ (Victor Gollancz)<ref>{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=Geoff|title=The Corner Boys|year=1998|publisher=Victor Gollancz|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0-575-40194-5}}</ref> and ‘The Body’s Little Secrets’ (Gibson Square).<ref>{{Cite book|title=BODY'S LITTLE SECRETS : a novel.|last=GEOFFREY.|first=BEATTIE|date=2018|publisher=GIBSON SQUARE BOOKS LTD|isbn=9781783341047|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1013594816}}</ref> ‘The Corner Boys’, the story of a teenager growing up in a loyalist working-class neighbourhood of Belfast during the Troubles, was also shortlisted for the Ewart-Biggs Literary Prize [https://issuu.com/alumniuom/docs/your_manchester_2005]. ‘The Body’s Little Secrets’ is the story of a social psychologist, Matt, whose research centres on the analysis of body language. The novel situates the action in Sheffield in Thatcher's Britain of the early nineteen-eighties, just after the miners’ strike with the mines and the steelworks closing. Self-construction is the nature of the day, trying still to be somebody in desperate times. Matt himself is trying to make a name for himself as an academic in this changing societal landscape but oversteps the mark in his claims about what his body language analyses can reveal from CCTV footage of a murder, to his ultimate cost. In a review in the international journal [[Semiotica]],<ref>https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/psychology/files/2018/08/Semiotica-Fiction-as-semiotics.pdf</ref> Professor [[Marcel Danesi]], professor of semiotics at the [[University of Toronto]], described the book as a ‘truly outstanding work’ and wrote that ‘With his latest novel, Dr Geoffrey Beattie can now be projected onto the same international platform as the late [[Umberto Eco]], who became famous for integrating semiotic theory with fiction, starting with his bestseller, [[The Name of the Rose]]...There is little doubt, in my estimation at least, that Geoffrey Beattie is Eco’s successor, displaying an uncanny and ingenious ability to blend his insightful work on nonverbal semiotics with an exceptional sense for narrative in this outstanding roman-à-clef.’

==Research==
Beattie's research falls within the broad areas of [[embodied cognition]]/[[Multimodality|multi-modal communication]] and applied [[social psychology]] particularly in the areas of [[sustainability]] and [[Ethnic group#Ethnicity and race|race]] where he researches the relationship between explicit and implicit processes,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.10.032|pmid = 18995826|title = Implicit and Explicit Processes in Social Cognition|journal = Neuron|volume = 60|issue = 3|pages = 503–510|year = 2008|last1 = Frith|first1 = Chris D.|last2 = Frith|first2 = Uta|s2cid = 6591189|url = https://pure.au.dk/ws/files/48560282/F_FNeuronImpl.pdf}}</ref> and the societal implications of any possible ‘dissociation’ here.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kandola |first1=Binna |title=Racism at Work |date=2018 |publisher=Ashford Colour Press |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780956231888 |ref=https://racismatwork.pearnkandola.com/images/Look_inside_book.pdf}}</ref>

===Multi-Modal Communication===

His long-standing interest in human multi-modal communication focuses on the interaction between language and nonverbal communication in talk. He was awarded the Spearman Medal<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bps.org.uk/about-us/awards-and-grants/research-board-awards/spearman-medal |title = Spearman Medal &#124; BPS}}</ref> by the British Psychological Society for ‘published psychological research of outstanding merit’ for work in this area. His research shows that both verbal and nonverbal elements are critical to everyday semantic communication and that iconic hand gestures reflect unarticulated aspects of thinking. He has explored the possible applications of this theoretical perspective for both [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000712605X103500 advertising] and for [https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/semi/2010/182/article-p133.xml deception], where gesture-speech mismatches may occur, along with structural changes in the phases of gestures. This research won the international Mouton d’Or prize<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://publons.com/journal/78/semiotica |title = Semiotica's page on Publons}}</ref> for the best research paper in semiotics.

===Sustainability===
He has also explored the psychological barriers that prevent consumers adopting more [[sustainable lifestyles]] in the light of the threat posed by [[climate change]]. He has challenged the established orthodoxy in this field. [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]], and others, have argued that the promotion of more sustainable behaviour is essentially just an ‘informational’ issue because the public already have the right underlying attitudes to environmental issues like [[carbon footprint]] (measured using various self-report instruments). For this reason, [[carbon label]]s were introduced. Beattie's experimental research, using eye tracking, showed that there was minimal visual attention to carbon labels and that explicit self-reported attitudes to carbon footprint did not actually predict visual attention to climate change images. Measures of implicit attitude, where such attitudes are largely unconscious and measured through speed of association, were, however, better predictors of both attentional focus and behavioural choice under certain conditions. Dispositional optimism also seems to affect visual attention to climate change images and this links to optimism bias (He presented this research at the British Academy Summer Showcase in 2018 where the best research funded by the B.A. is highlighted).<ref>https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/BritishAcademyReview33-Summer2018.pdf</ref>  He has explored new segmentation analyses of consumer markets based upon the intersection of explicit and implicit attitudes and researching how to change both types of attitude, necessary to produce the radical shift in consumer behaviour required to [[climate change mitigation|combat climate change]].

Beattie presented this research on sustainability at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change at UNESCO headquarters in Paris in July 2015,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/news/2015/06/academics-present-climate-change-research-at-paris-unesco-headquarters/ | title=Academics present climate change research at Paris UNESCO headquarters| date=12 June 2015}}</ref> and with Laura McGuire contributed a chapter to the United Nations International Commission on Education for Sustainable-Development-Practice Report<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/psychology/2018/10/15/edge-hill-academics-inform-un-report-on-sustainable-development/ |title = Edge Hill academics inform UN report on sustainable development|date = 15 October 2018}}</ref> (a report issued every ten years by the U.N. to define priorities in education internationally for the next decade), to be published in 2019.

===Implicit Racial Bias===
Another strand of his current research is into implicit racial bias and its effects on everyday life. He has explored how implicit racial attitudes impact on shortlisting decisions. He has shown how gaze fixations, as we consider CVs, are influenced by our implicit attitudes, and he has investigated how these impact on the representations that we build up of the various candidates under consideration, thereby influencing our final ‘rational’ decision about the relative suitability of the candidates. He has researched how people justify and rationalise their everyday decisions that often result from processes that are more implicit. Using the terminology of the [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Daniel Kahneman]], he has explored how [[Thinking, Fast and Slow|System 1 and System 2]] interact in everyday life and the implications of this interaction for both behaviour and talk. He has given a number of significant keynote addresses on this theme at a variety of applied conferences, including the Annual Conference of the Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, the [http://afsa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Final-Delegate-Pack-AFSA-National-Conference-2014.pdf Asian Fire Service Association National Conference], the [https://www.ecu.ac.uk/get-involved/conference-2018/ Equality Challenge Unit Biennial Conference], the Respect Difference Conference, [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] etc.

The overarching focus of his research has been on how human beings communicate and make decisions in their everyday social worlds, with emphasis on the more unconscious and implicit aspects of these everyday processes. He has been interested, throughout his career, in the real-world relevance of his research.
