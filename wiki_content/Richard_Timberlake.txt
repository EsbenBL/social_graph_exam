'''Richard Henry Timberlake Jr.''' (June 24, 1922 – May 22, 2020) was an American economist who was Professor of Economics at the [[University of Georgia]] for much of his career. He became a leading advocate of [[free banking]], the belief that [[money]] should be issued by private companies, not by a government monopoly. He wrote about the [[Legal Tender Cases]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in his book ''Constitutional Money: A Review of the Supreme Court's Monetary Decisions''.

== History ==
Born in [[Steubenville, Ohio]] on June 24, 1922,<ref>[http://econjwatch.org/authors/richard-h-timberlake-jr "Richard H. Timberlake" – Biography at Econjwatch.org]</ref> Timberlake was in the US military in [[World War II]]. He became a pilot in the U.S. Air Forces and flew 26 missions as a co-pilot in the 8th Air Force.<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Timberlake in front of his barracks in October of 1943.JPG |url=https://www.rockdalenewtoncitizen.com/richard-timberlake-in-front-of-his-barracks-in-october-of/image_95858988-dbcf-11e9-8b84-f3d02a5485b2.html |website=Rockdale Citizen & Newton Citizen |accessdate=24 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref> He was awarded three [[Purple Heart]]s. He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] at [[Kenyon College]] in 1946, a Master's at [[Columbia University]] in 1950, and a Ph.D in 1959 from the [[University of Chicago]] where he studied under [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Earl J. Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview--Richard Timberlake |url=https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2014/q1/pdf/interview.pdf |publisher=Richmond Fed |accessdate=31 May 2020}}</ref>

He then taught economics at [[Muhlenberg College]], [[Norwich University]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|Rensselaer Polytechnic]], [[Florida State University]], and the [[University of Georgia]] from 1963–1990, when he retired. Timberlake's research was on the [[history of money]], [[central banking]], and [[monetary policy]].<ref>[http://www.cato.org/people/richard-timberlake Richard H. Timberlake Jr. at Cato.org]</ref> He died in Georgia on May 22, 2020.<ref>[https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/athens-ga/richard-timberlake-9194049 Richard H. Timberlake]</ref>

== Ideas ==
Timberlake's research on the development of private moneys occurred at the time of [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s idea of ''[[The Denationalization of Money]]'', extending and expanding upon it in coordination with the [[free banking]] movement. He believed that, instead of a government-imposed [[central bank]], there should be a free market in the production of money, with banks choosing how to issue their own, competing currencies.

Timberlake also examined the causes of the [[Great Depression]], and emphasized the switch of the [[Federal Reserve]], starting in 1929, to the [[real bills doctrine]] of money management, and an anti-speculation policy that severely reduced bank reserves and the amount of deposit money that the banks could create. The money supply contracted by 30% in four years, something that no market economy could tolerate. Along with Hayek of the [[Austrian school]], [[Milton Friedman]] of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]], and even the [[Keynesian]]s, Timberlake saw this Fed policy as the primary cause of the Great Depression.<ref>[http://econjwatch.org/articles/gold-standards-and-the-real-bills-doctrine-in-us-monetary-policy ''Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S. Monetary Policy'' by Richard H. Timberlake] in [[Econ Journal Watch]]</ref>

However, Timberlake did not reject the [[gold standard]]. While many economists blamed the gold standard for the [[monetary collapse]], Timberlake cited data that refutes the validity of their complaints. He showed that the Fed Banks and U.S. Treasury had plenty of gold in the 1929–1933 period. Timberlake concluded that government interference with gold standard adjustments caused most of the trouble in the past, producing cycles of money growth and deflation, panic and depression.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timberlake, Jr. |first1=Richard H. |title=Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S Monetary Policy.|journal=The Independent |date=2007 |pages=325–354 |url=https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_11_03_01_timberlake.pdf |accessdate=24 May 2020}}</ref><ref>The Independent Review, v. XI, n. 3, Winter 2007, ISSN 1086-1653, Copyright © 2007, pp. 325–354</ref>

Timberlake's papers are housed at the Hoover Institution Library & Archives at Stanford University. 

== Politics ==
Timberlake was active in politics as a member of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lpgeorgia.com/what-should-the-federal-government-do-about-the-economy-an-economist%e2%80%99s-perspective/|title=What Should The Federal Government Do About The Economy? -- An Economist's Perspective|date=March 20, 2009|work=Libertarian Party of Georgia}}</ref> He was involved in the [[Harry Browne]] presidential campaign, writing and signing open letters advocating various positions, such as [[school choice]] and rejection of policies that would have raised taxes. In the past he was a vocal and outspoken critic of the science behind anthropogenic [[climate change]], writing a number of op-ed pieces for the ''[[Athens Banner Herald]]''. He was an adjunct scholar at the [[Cato Institute]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorn |first1=James |title=Cato Adjunct Scholar Richard Timberlake Turns 90 |url=https://www.cato.org/blog/cato-adjunct-scholar-richard-timberlake-turns-90 |website=Cato Institute |accessdate=24 May 2020 |language=en |date=22 June 2012}}</ref>
