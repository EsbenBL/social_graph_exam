== History ==
Since its foundation in 1999, the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) has primarily concentrated on economic research and public education. CEPR has focused on topics that affect people's lives, in order to contribute to public debate in the United States (social security, healthcare, the national budget), and internationally (global economy, International Monetary Fund, and Latin America policy).<ref name=CEPR-ClosingGap-Video-2011>{{cite web|last1=K.S.|first1=Jomo|last2=Weisbrot|first2=Mark|last3=James|first3=Deborah|title=The Scorecard on Development, 1960-2010: Closing the Gap?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpe_jrKYbjA|website=Center for Economic and Policy Research|format=Video|date=15 April 2011}}</ref>

Politically, CEPR has been described as both [[Progressivism|progressive]]<ref name="Dolny" /> and [[Centre-left politics|left-leaning]].<ref name="The Perils Of Petrocracy" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name="nbcnews.com" /> CEPR contributors include [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] recipients [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Robert Solow]]. 

== Issues ==
=== United States ===
==== Healthcare ====
CEPR supports the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) stating that it is "a family-friendly policy" and that the policy "has allowed thousands of workers to voluntarily reduce their work hours to care for children or elderly parents, or to explore new opportunities." Despite the increase in the percentage of workers employed on a part-time basis, CEPR concluded that such statistics were not sufficient to make any overall judgments on the health of the labor market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|title=Obamacare at one year: a birthday assessment|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-obamacare-at-one-year-20141001-column.html#page=1|access-date=3 October 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Verhage|first1=Julie|title=Dean Baker: There's a Big Economic Benefit to Obamacare That Isn't Getting Much Attention|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-07/dean-baker-there-s-a-big-economic-benefit-to-obamacare-that-isn-t-getting-much-attention|access-date=17 September 2015|publisher=Bloomberg|date=August 7, 2015}}</ref>

==== Employment ====
CEPR backs alongside the [[Economic Policy Institute]] (EPI) the Full Employment Caucus, a group on United States House officials that advocate for [[full employment]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Marans|first1=Daniel|title=Senior Democrat Has A New Plan To Trim Unemployment|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-unemployment-federal-reserve_55fca285e4b0fde8b0ce751b|access-date=20 September 2015|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=18 September 2015}}</ref>

==== Minimum wage ====
A 2014 study by CEPR shows that 13 states that increased their [[minimum wage]] had an average payroll of 0.99% compared to 0.68% in other states, though the CEPR stated the analysis was "far from scientific".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Davisdson|first1=Paul|title=Study: States that raised minimum wage had stronger job growth|url=http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2014/07/07/study-states-that-raised-minimum-wage-had-stronger-job-growth/|access-date=3 October 2014|work=USA Today|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> In response to criticism of President [[Joe Biden]]'s support for a [[Fight for $15|$15 minimum wage]], Baker calculated that, had wages risen alongside increases in productivity since 1968, the minimum wage would be around $24 an hour.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Jon|date=2021-03-05|title=Forget $15 an Hour — the Minimum Wage Should Be $24|url=https://theintercept.com/2021/03/05/minimum-wage-raise-15/|access-date=2021-10-08|website=The Intercept|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Taxes ====
In a 2014 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', CEPR co-founder [[Dean Baker]] suggested that according to poll findings, many citizens of the United States did not notice a 2% increase in their [[Social Security tax]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Dean|title=The tax hike that almost nobody noticed|url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/30/the-tax-hike-almost-nobody-noticed/|access-date=3 October 2014|work=Fortune|date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Latin America ===

CEPR has been supportive of left-leaning governments in South America.<ref name="The New York Times 2020">{{cite web | title=M.I.T. Researchers Cast Doubt on Bolivian Election Fraud | website=The New York Times | date=2020-02-29 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/world/americas/bolivia-election-fraud.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229010010/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/world/americas/bolivia-election-fraud.html | archive-date=2020-02-29 | url-status=live | access-date=2021-09-08}}</ref>

==== Brazil ====
In 2008, Brazilian [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Foreign Secretary]] [[Celso Amorim]] cited CEPR's work to explain why Brazil had no interest in signing a [[free trade agreement]] with the United States. He said that the CEPR report concluded that the most severe impacts from the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] would be suffered by those economies most integrated to United States, those that have free trade agreements with the US.<ref name=MercoPress-Brazil-CelsoAmorim-2008>{{cite news|title=Diversified markets have cut Brazil's exposure to US crisis|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2008/04/04/diversified-markets-have-cut-brazil-s-exposure-to-us-crisis|work=MercoPress|date=4 April 2008}}</ref> 

==== Venezuela ====
CEPR and its founder Mark Weisbrot have analysed and often written about the [[crisis in Venezuela]]. In an October 2012 op-ed for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Weisbrot wrote that "[a]lthough some media have talked of Venezuela’s impending economic collapse for more than a decade, it hasn’t happened and is not likely to happen."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/opinion/why-chavez-was-re-elected.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Why Chávez Was Re-elected|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|date=2012-10-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In a July 2014 article for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', Weisbrot said the Venezuelan economy had performed well for the period from 2004, when the government gained control of the oil industry from the opposition, to 2012. He said the problems which commenced in 2012 were mainly due to Venezuela's exchange rate system.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to fix Venezuela's troubled exchange rate|url=http://fortune.com/2014/07/22/how-to-fix-venezuelas-toubled-exchange-rate/|website=Fortune|access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref> In a June 2016 article in ''The New York Times'', Weisbrot wrote that "Washington has caused enormous damage to Venezuela in its relentless pursuit of 'regime change' for the last 15 years." He suggested the US end its intervention, which involved economic sanctions, funding of opposition groups and refusal to accept presidential election results.<ref>{{cite news|title=How to save Venezuela|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/06/28/how-to-save-venezuela/the-us-bears-blame-for-the-crisis-in-venezuela-and-it-should-stop-intervening-there/|work=The New York Times|access-date=30 June 2016}}</ref>

==== Bolivia ====
in 2019, CEPR criticized the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS)'s audit of the [[2019 Bolivian general election]], which concluded that the results of the elections should be voided because there were "drastic and hard-to-explain change in the trend of the preliminary results after the closing of the polls". Co-Director Mark Weisbrot wrote that the report "provides absolutely no evidence — no statistics, numbers, or facts of any kind — to support this idea", and called on the OAS to retract its press release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/oas-should-retract-its-press-release-on-bolivian-election-cepr-co-director-says|title=OAS Should Retract Its Press Release on Bolivian Election, CEPR Co-Director Says {{!}} Press Releases {{!}} CEPR|last=Beeton|first=Dan|website=cepr.net|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> 

CEPR commissioned researchers at the [[MIT]] Election Data and Science Lab, John Curiel and Jack R. Williams, to independently verify their work on the 2019 Bolivian election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cepr.net/report/analysis-of-the-2019-bolivia-election/|title=Analysis of the 2019 Bolivia Election|last1=Williams|first1=Jack|website=Center for Economic and Policy Research|publisher=CEPR|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="The New York Times 2020"/> The MIT researchers published a statistical analysis on 27 February 2020, confirming the results of the CEPR study and finding that there was no "statistical evidence of fraud that we can find — the trends in the preliminary count, the lack of any big jump in support for Morales after the halt, and the size of Morales’s margin all appear legitimate. All in all, the OAS's statistical analysis and conclusions would appear deeply flawed" and that "it is highly likely that Morales surpassed the 10-percentage-point margin in the first round" as originally presented.<ref name="MIT">{{cite web |last1=Curiel |first1=John |last2=Williams |first2=Jack R. |title=Bolivia dismissed its October elections as fraudulent.
