'''Amy Gutmann''' (born 1949) is an American academic who is the eighth [[List of presidents of the University of Pennsylvania|president of the University of Pennsylvania]]. In November 2016, the school announced that her contract had been extended to 2022, which will make her the longest-serving president in the history of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

In 2018, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named Gutmann one of the "World's 50 Greatest Leaders".<ref name="fortune.com-worlds-greatest-leaders-2018" /> She previously worked at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] as provost and Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Politics. While there, she founded Princeton's ethics center, the University Center for Human Values. Her published works are in the fields of politics, ethics, education, and philosophy.

On July 2, 2021, President [[Joe Biden]] nominated her to serve as [[United States Ambassador to Germany]]. If confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], she would be the first woman to serve in the role.

==Early life and education==
Amy Gutmann was born on November 19, 1949,<ref name=contempauthors>{{Cite web|title=Gutmann, Amy 1949–|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/gutmann-amy-1949|access-date=2021-09-23|website=[[Contemporary Authors]]}}</ref> in [[Brooklyn]], New York,<ref name=contempauthors/> the only child of Kurt and Beatrice Gutmann.

After being denied asylum in the US, he brought his entire family, including four siblings, to join him in [[Bombay]], India, where he founded a metal fabricating factory. Kurt Gutmann was still living in India in 1948 when he came to New York City for vacation. While there he attended a benefit at a Manhattan hotel, [[JW Marriott Essex House|Essex House]], where he met Beatrice, Amy's future mother, and the two were married weeks later.<ref name="nytimes-2004-05-16" /><ref>[http://www.phillymag.com/articles/amy-aims-east/ Amy Aims East – Philadelphia Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Gutmann told Adam Bryant of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in June 2011:

{{blockquote|The biggest influences on me for leading preceded my ever even thinking of myself as a leader—particularly my father's experience leaving Nazi Germany.  Because I would not even exist if it weren't for his combination of courage and farsightedness. He saw what was coming with Hitler and he took all of his family and left for India. That took a lot of courage. That is always something in the back of my mind.<ref>{{cite news|title=Welcoming the Wild Ideas of the Week|author=Adam Bryant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/business/19corner.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 June 2011|access-date=5 November 2014}}</ref>}}

Gutmann graduated from [[Monroe-Woodbury High School]] in [[Monroe, New York|Monroe]], New York.

==Career==

=== Princeton University ===

Gutmann taught at [[Princeton University]] from 1976 to 2004. In 1990, she became the first Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor at Princeton and the founding director of its University Center for Human Values, among the first and best-endowed university-wide multi-disciplinary ethics centers in the world. As provost at Princeton University from 2001 to 2004, she oversaw Princeton's plan to expand the undergraduate student body by 10 percent and spearheaded the recruitment from Harvard of star professor [[K. Anthony Appiah]] (co-author with Gutmann of ''Color Conscious: The Political Morality of Race'').<ref>Jacques Steinberg, "A Harvard Star in Black Studies Joins Princeton," New York Times, January 26, 2002, pA11</ref>

===University of Pennsylvania===
In her 2004 inaugural address Gutmann launched the Penn Compact,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.upenn.edu/penn-compact|title=From the President and Provost|work=upenn.edu}}</ref> her vision for making Penn both a global leader in teaching, research, and professional practice; and a dynamic agent of social, economic, and civic progress.

In 2017 she renewed and updated her vision with the Penn Compact 2022,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.upenn.edu/penn-compact|title=The Penn Compact 2020 : Office of the President : University of Pennsylvania|work=upenn.edu}}</ref> recommitting the university to these ideals and outlining the next steps: First, to increase inclusion at the University with increases in faculty and student diversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://almanac.upenn.edu/uploads/media/032117-full-supplement.pdf|title=The Penn Compact 2020 : Office of the President : University of Pennsylvania|work=upenn.edu}}</ref> Second, to integrate knowledge across academic disciplines with a strong emphasis on innovation: Penn was named No. 4 in Reuters' Top 100 World Innovative Universities in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|last=Inc.|first=Reuters|title=World's Most Innovative Universities, 2017|url=https://www.reuters.com/innovative-universities-2017/profile?uid=4|work=Reuters|access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> 2018,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amers-reuters-ranking-innovative-univ-idUSKCN1ML0AZ|title=Reuters Top 100: The World's Most Innovative Universities – 2018|date=2018-10-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-02-28|language=en}}</ref> and 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/innovative-universities-2019|title=The World's Most Innovative Universities 2019|author=Reuters Editorial|website=U.S.|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> and the university is consistently helping to facilitate commercialization agreements, ringing in over 650 in 2017 (up from fewer than 50 just a decade prior.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepenngazette.com/perfect-impact/|title=Perfect Impact – 2018|date=January 4, 2018|language=en}}</ref> A third priority through the Compact is to have an impact locally, nationally, and globally to bring the benefits of Penn's research, teaching, and service to individuals and communities at home and around the world, recently illustrated by one of Penn's biomedical research and clinical breakthroughs, approved by the FDA to treat cancer using a patient's own immune system.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grady|first=Denise|title=FDA Approves First Gene-Altering Leukemia Treatment, Costing $475,000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/health/gene-therapy-cancer.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> ''The Wall Street Journal'' noted that "Today the university [Penn] lays claim to having incubated the world's biggest cancer breakthrough."<ref>{{cite news|last=Finley|first=Alyssia|title=How HIV Became a Cancer Cure|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-hiv-became-a-cancer-cure-1503092082|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=18 August 2017|access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> In addition, it is Penn Medicine researchers who developed the mRNA vaccine technology that is a critical component of Pfizer/BioNTech’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines, which are being deployed globally in the fight against COVID-19.<ref>{{cite news|last=Avril|first=Tom|title=These Penn scientists paved the way for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine|url=https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/covid19-rna-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-based-penn-research-weissman-20201111.html|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=18 August 2017|access-date=November 11, 2020|language=en}}</ref>

====Fundraising and scholarships====
As president, Gutmann has overseen Penn's largest fundraising campaign ever, Making History.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makinghistory.upenn.edu/|title=PennGiving|work=upenn.edu|access-date=2007-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023055349/http://www.makinghistory.upenn.edu/|archive-date=2007-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Launched in 2007, the Making History Campaign raised a record $4.3 billion, exceeding its goal by more than $800 million.

Gutmann has been a leading national advocate for [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]] based on need to promote socioeconomic diversity in higher education. Gutmann made Penn one of the handful of universities in the country that substitute grants for loans for any undergraduate student with financial need. In September 2009, for the first time in Penn's history, all undergraduates eligible for financial aid received grants rather than loans in their aid packages. Students from typical families with income less than $40,000 paid no tuition, fees, room or board. Students from typical families with incomes less than $90,000 paid no tuition and fees. In 2017, one out of eight incoming Penn students were the first in their families to attend college, up from one out of 20 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://president.upenn.edu/penn-compact/inclusion

====Campus development====
Since arriving at Penn, Gutmann has also spearheaded a major campus development plan, Penn Connects, that includes {{convert|24|acre|m2}} that Penn purchased from the [[US Postal Service]] along the [[Schuylkill River]], which opened as [[Penn Park]] in September 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crimmens|first=Peter|title=Penn Park Opens Vistas and Green Space to all Philadelphians|url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local//arts-culture/26513-13pcpark|access-date=August 9, 2012|newspaper=Newsworks.org|date=September 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817082242/http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local//arts-culture/26513-13pcpark|archive-date=August 17, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Penn Connects is designed to boost the economic, educational and social capacity of Philadelphia and to create seamless gateways between [[West Philadelphia]] and [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] across the Schuylkill River.

Penn began an expansion east of the Schuylkill River with the purchase of the DuPont Marshall Laboratory in September 2010. Gutmann said that the Marshall Lab property has "infinite possibilities" as a place to nurture startups and "[[technology transfer]]", where faculty with "great discoveries can attract venture capital" and bring ideas to market.<ref>{{cite news|last=Loyd|first=Linda|title=University of Pennsylvania Expands East of the Schuylkill|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-06-18/business/32282981_1_green-space-tennis-courts-main-campus|access-date=August 9, 2012|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

In Fall 2016, Penn opened its Pennovation Center, the anchor of a 23-acre site that the university has dubbed Pennovation Works, on a Grays Ferry site along the south bank of the Schuylkill which was once home to the DuPont Co.'s Marshall Labs (where workers discovered the substance that led to the development of Teflon). The $35-million project is about 1 1/2 miles from the center of Penn's [[West Philadelphia]] campus. A large, red-letter sign reads "Pennovation" over the three-story, 58,000-square foot facility.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20161008_Pennovation__Where_ideas_go_to_grow_up.html Pennovation: Where ideas go to grow up<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Pennovation includes an addition that resembles a crystal formation, representing the "crystallization of ideas", and architecture critic Inga Saffron says that its unique design "announces the future", rather than harkening back to the past.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/inga_saffron/20161007_Changing_Skyline__At_Pennovation__UPenn_creates_a_lab_for_the_social_media_age.html Changing Skyline: At Pennovation, UPenn creates a lab for the social media age<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Johnson & Johnson announced in July 2018<ref name="technical1">{{Cite news|url=https://technical.ly/philly/2018/07/18/johnson-johnson-pennovation-jpod-research-networking/|title=Johnson & Johnson to open its first US 'networking hub' at Pennovation – Technical.ly Philly|date=2018-07-18|work=Technical.ly Philly|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}</ref> that Pennovation Works would house J&J's first US-based JPOD, a networking hub that seeks to connect J&J researchers and the local life sciences community. With the announcement, J&J joined the ranks of global telecom giant Qualcomm and chocolate maker Hershey's,<ref name="technical1"/> which also selected Pennovation Works to open Philadelphia operations.

====Protests on campus====
On December 8, 2014, ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]'' reported that student protesters concerned about the death of [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], disrupted a holiday party for students at Gutmann's home. As a gesture of support for the students' cause, Gutmann joined them in lying on the ground to symbolize the four-and-a-half hours that Brown's body was left lying on the street in Ferguson after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2014/12/protesters-take-over-gutmanns-holiday-party|title=The Daily Pennsylvanian – :: Protesters take over Gutmann's holiday party|work=thedp.com}}</ref> Members of the Penn police force publicly responded to the show of support, with the head of the police union writing a public letter criticizing the move and the chief of the police department responding with a letter defending Gutmann's actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20141212_Penn_s_president_feels_heat_from_her_police_for__quot_Die_In_quot__stance_.html|title=Penn's president feels heat from her police for 'die in'|work=philly-archives}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2014/12/letter-maureen-rush-fop-response|title=The Daily Pennsylvanian – :: Guest Column by Vice President for Public Safety Maureen Rush|work=thedp.com}}</ref>

====Tenure as president====

==Scholarly career==
Through her writings, Gutmann has consistently sought to bridge theory and policy to advance the core values of a civil democratic society: liberty, opportunity and mutual respect. In a recent ranking of US political scientists in PhD-granting departments, she is ranked second-highest in citations among all political theorists, eighth-highest among all women political scientists, and has been cited more than any other political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Hannah June |title=The Political Science 400: With Citation Counts by Cohort, Gender, and Subfield |journal=PS: Political Science and Politics |volume=52 |date=2019 |issue=4 Jan |pages=296–311 |doi=10.1017/S1049096518001786 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Her first major contribution to political philosophy was her book ''Democratic Education'' (1987; revised 1999). The book addresses the central questions in the political theory of education: How should a democratic society make decisions about education? What should children be taught? How should citizens be educated? It was reviewed in ''Ethics'' as "the finest contribution to the literature on democratic education of the last seventy years" and fostered a revival of interest in the relationship between democracy and education. The book also takes on some contemporary scholarly debates: What is the appropriate response of democratic education to the challenge of [[multiculturalism]]? Should schools try to cultivate patriotic or cosmopolitan sentiments among students?

Gutmann's second major contribution to political philosophy is a theory of [[deliberative democracy]] that she developed in collaboration with Harvard political scientist [[Dennis Frank Thompson|Dennis Thompson]]. ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (1996) calls for more reasoned and respectful argument in everyday politics. Deliberation can inform decision making through reasoned argument and develop society's collective capacity to pursue justice while finding mutually acceptable terms of social cooperation—even when disagreements persist.

''Democracy and Disagreement'' has been praised as an effective remedy for polarized politics and criticized as impractical, as evidenced in a collection of pro and con essays published in ''Deliberative Politics'', edited by Stephen Macedo. Defenders argue that more and better political deliberation can help all citizens. In her work Gutmann has applied the ideas of deliberative democracy to the US electoral process, President [[Barack Obama]]'s Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and healthcare organization in the United Kingdom.

Gutmann's third major contribution to political philosophy is her analysis of [[Collective identity|group identity]] and its intersection with justice. In ''Identity in Democracy'' (2003), Gutmann argues that identity groups as such are neither friends nor enemies of democratic justice. She analyzes the legitimate but also problematic parts played by group identity in democratic politics and draws distinctions among the various types of identity group politics. She further developed this perspective in her nationally recognized<ref>{{cite journal | date=August 2018 | first1=Amy | last1=Gutmann | title=Think Uniquely, Stand United | journal=Vital Speeches of the Day | volume=LXXXIV | issue=8 | pages=223–224}}</ref> 2018 Penn Commencement speech, "Think Uniquely, Stand United," in which she said that ". . . what makes us unique and what unites us are not starkly opposed. Uniqueness and unity are the twin pillars of a strong pluralism. We thrive when we combine unity of shared values with our unique perspectives on life. It has never been more important that we think uniquely while we stand united."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://thepenngazette.com/think-uniquely-stand-united |title=Think Uniquely, Stand United: Upholding Twin Pillars of a Strong Pluralism |work= The Pennsylvania Gazette|date=24 August 2018 }}</ref>

In May 2012, Gutmann published her 16th book, ''The Spirit of Compromise: Why Governing Demands It and Campaigning Undermines It'' ([[Princeton University Press]]), with co-author Dennis Thompson of Harvard. The authors posit that the difficulty of compromise is built into the democratic process itself, but so is the need for it. A better understanding and appreciation of compromise might be especially useful in this time of political polarization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/blog/2012/04/12/qa-with-amy-gutmann-dennis-thompson-on-the-spirit-of-compromise|title=Q&A with Amy Gutmann & Dennis Thompson on The Spirit of Compromise|work=Princeton University Press Blog}}</ref> Paul Starr of ''[[The New Republic]]'' said ''The Spirit'':

<blockquote>Provide[s] grist for thinking through the difficulties of compromise in [domestic policy], from tragic choices at desperate moments of history to the routine nastiness in American public life today... Until recently, who would have thought it necessary to offer Americans advice in the ways of compromise? We used to enjoy a reputation for being a practical-minded people, our politicians being regarded as an all-too-flexible species. But something has changed, and according to Gutmann and Thompson, the change has to do with the relation of campaigning and governing... Gutmann and Thompson end their book with recommendations to strengthen the spirit and practice of compromise."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/102761/compromise-margalit-guttmann-thompson-yalta|title=Paul Starr: Cockroaches and Compromise – The New Republic|author=Paul Starr|magazine=The New Republic|date=20 April 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Judy Woodruff]] of the PBS Newshour called the book "a clear-eyed examination of the forces that bring warring political leaders together or keep them apart. I wish every policymaker would read it".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Spirit-Compromise-Campaigning-Undermines/dp/product-description/0691153914|title=The Spirit of Compromise: Why Governing Demands It and Campaigning Undermines It: Amy Gutmann, Dennis Thompson: 9780691153919: Amazon.com: Books|date=22 April 2012}}</ref>

Norton & Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-87140-446-6/|title=Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven, but Nobody Wants to Die}}</ref>
