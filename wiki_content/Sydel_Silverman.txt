'''Sydel Finfer Silverman Wolf''' (May 20, 1933 – March 25, 2019) was an American [[anthropologist]] notable for her work as a researcher, writer, and advocate for the archival preservation of anthropological research.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011>{{cite book|last1=Fic|first1=Christy|title=Register to the Papers of Sydel Silverman|date=September 2011|publisher=[[National Anthropological Archives]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Suitland, Maryland|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/fa/silverman.pdf|format=Finding aid}}</ref> Silverman's early research focused on the study of complex societies and the history of anthropology.<ref name=Maryland-SilvermanBio-2016>{{cite web|title=Revitalizing CoPAR for the Digital Age: Workshop Participants|url=http://archivescollaboratory.umd.edu/copar-participants/|website=ARCLab – The Archives Collaboratory|publisher=iSchool at the University of Maryland|date=2016}}</ref> This work involved conducting anthropological research in [[Central Italy]], with a focus on traditional [[agrarian system]]s, [[land reform]], and [[festivals]] in [[central Italy]].

== Early life and education ==
Silverman was born in the [[North Lawndale, Chicago|Lawndale]] neighborhood on the west side of Chicago, Illinois, to Joseph Finfer, a rabbi and kosher shohet butcher, and Elizabeth Finfer (née Bassman), a cook.<ref name=FamilySearch-USCensus-1930>{{cite web|title=Elizebeth Finfer United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XSGC-DDD|website=[[FamilySearch]]|date=1930}}</ref><ref name=FamilySearch-USCensus-1940>{{cite web|title=Sydelle Finfer United States Census, 1940|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KWB5-MDZ|website=[[FamilySearch]]|date=1940}}</ref> The youngest of seven children, her family was [[Orthodox Jewish]] and was very poor.

Silverman's interest in anthropology began at an early age, thanks in part to her uncle Hirshel Bassman. With her uncle, Silverman explored ideas such as mysticism and "oriental religions."<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /><ref name=Smithsonian-Memoirs-2008>{{cite book|last1=Silverman|first1=Sydel|title="Memoirs" Sydel Silverman Papers: Box 42|date=2008|publisher=[[National Anthropological Archives]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Suitland, MD}}</ref>

In 1951, Silverman graduated from high school and began her studies at the [[University of Illinois]] at Navy Pier as a pre-med student. After two years, she applied to the [[University of Chicago]]'s program in Committee on Human Development, and began studies at the University of Chicago in biology, psychology, and sociology-anthropology. In 1957, Silverman received a master's degree from the Committee on Human Development. Her thesis, ''The Female Climacterium'' was published the same year.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 />

In 1957, Silverman enrolled at the PhD program in Anthropology at [[Columbia University]]. [[Conrad Arensberg]]'s work in the [[Mediterranean]], as well as a personal interest in the region, led Silverman to select Italy as the focus of her dissertation research.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /><ref name=Smithsonian-Memoirs-2008 /><ref>{{cite web|last1=McG. Thomas|first1=Robert|title=Conrad Arensberg, 86, Dies; Hands-On Anthropologist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/nyregion/conrad-arensberg-86-dies-hands-on-anthropologist.html|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Silverman's dissertation research was focused in the Italian village of [[Monte Castello di Vibio|Montecastello di Vibio]]. Her work in this region began in August 1960. Her work was one of the initial social-anthropological studies of  Central Italy, describing the [[mezzadria]], the traditional agrarian system of the region. Shortly after Silverman's research, the mezzadria was abolished by law.<ref name="Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011" />

In 1963, Silverman received a PhD in Anthropology from Columbia University for a  dissertation  ''Landlord and peasant in an Umbrian community,''   subsequently used as the basis of her first book, ''Three bells of civilization : the life of an Italian hill town''.  This early work remains one of Silverman's most-cited contributions in the academic community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sydel Silverman|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Sydel+Silverman+&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&oq=silver|website=Google Scholar}}</ref>  Silverman's dissertation research was also the foundation of several additional journal articles.<ref name="Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011" />

Some of Silverman's photography from this period, (specifically 1960–1961), including photographs by her late husband [[Melvin Silverman]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Mel Silverman (Melvin Frank Silverman)|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/silverman_mel_frank_thevillage.htm|website=Art of the Print}}</ref> can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sappino|first1=Marco|title=Ritratti, Riti, Ritrovi: Le Fotografie di Sydel Silverman a Monte Castello di Vibio nel 1960–1961|url=http://www.montecastellodivibio.gov.it/life/news/le-fotografie-di-sydel-silverman-a-monte-castello-di-vibio-nel-1960-1961|website=Benvenuto a Monte Castello di Vibio|language=Italian}}</ref>

=== Teaching ===
After completing her PhD, Silverman worked as a teacher by [[Queens College]] in [[New York City]] from 1962–1975, while continuing  her research in Italy. H research included a 1967 study of land reform in the South of Italy, and several field seasons in Central Italy focused on a comparative study of competitive regional festivals.  From this time, Silverman's publications on [[Palio of Siena]] are the most noteworthy.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /><ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012 /> At Queens College  Silverman began her career as an administrator when she was elected as Department Chair in 1970.

=== Administration ===
(1975–1986)
From 1975–1986 Silverman was the Executive Officer of the [[Graduate Center, CUNY|CUNY Graduate Center]]  PhD Program in Anthropology.  Under her leadership, the program rose from disorganization and threat of disbandment to  one of the top ten anthropology doctoral programs in the United States of America.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /><ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012 /> For a time, Silverman was also the acting Dean of Graduate Studies at CUNY.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maeroff|first1=Gene|title=Education; City U. Graduate School Gains High Rank|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/education-city-u-graduate-school-gains-high-rank.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1983}}</ref>

Silverman moved to the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation]] in 1987 where she was appointed to the position of President of the Foundation, serving from 1987–1999. She was spokesperson for the organization, advocating for the field of anthropology as well as overseeing administrative tasks including fellowship and grant funding.  Silverman organized twenty-five international symposia during her years at Wenner-Gren.  These symposia became the topic of her 2002 book, ''The Beast on the Table'' which offers a rich narrative concerning the living history of anthropology.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 />

Outside of her fieldwork, advocacy, and administrative work, Silverman's other major research interest has been on anthropology itself—particularly the history of anthropology and the practice of anthropology.  In addition to what has already been discussed, Silverman's work at Wenner-Gren also included an effort to preserve anthropological records.<ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012 />

Silverman's  selected bibliography is included below, and more detailed descriptions of a number of her books has been provided by Archivist [[Christy Fic]] in the Register to the Papers of Sydel Silverman.  Silverman's work in this area has spanned the course of her long career, and has continued into her retirement in 1999.<ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 />

Silverman is President Emerita of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research and Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the City University of New York.<ref name=Maryland-SilvermanBio-2016 /><ref>{{cite web|title=Emeritus Faculty|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Anthropology/Faculty/Emeritus-Faculty|website=Anthropology Department|publisher=City University of New York (CUNY)}}</ref>
