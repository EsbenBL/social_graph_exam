'''Mark Abrams''' (27 April 1906 – 25 September 1994) was a social scientist and market research expert who pioneered new techniques in statistical surveying and opinion polling.

==Background and education==

Mark Abrams was born Max Alexander Abramowitz in Edmonton, North London in 1906 to Jewish parents who had emigrated from Lithuania and Latvia to the [[East End of London]] in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford ODNB: Abrams, Mark Alexander|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}</ref> He later described his father Abram Abramowitz, a journeyman bootmaker, shopkeeper, and house agent, as a 'philosophical anarchist'.<ref>{{cite web|title=An interview with Mark Abrams (19 September 1984) 1. Family Origins|url=http://surveyresearch.weebly.com/an-interview-with-mark-abrams-audio-files.html}}</ref>

Abrams received a scholarship to attend [[The Latymer School]], then read economics at the [[London School of Economics]]. He went on to complete a PhD in early modern English economic history under the supervision of [[R. H. Tawney]] in 1929.<ref>Mark Abrams, 'The Gold and Silver Thread Monopolies of James I', unpublished PhD dissertation, London School of Economics, 1929.</ref>

==Career==

Between 1931 and 1933 Abrams was a research fellow at the progressive [[Brookings Institution]] in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the [[London Press Exchange]], one of Britain's leading advertising agencies. Here Abrams began developing his pioneering work in social investigation, market research, and opinion polling by conducting large-scale statistical surveys into consumer behaviour. His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934 and 1938, were landmarks in survey research and were credited with establishing the widespread use of the [[NRS social grade|ABC1 system]] of social classification in Britain.<ref>Dawn Mitchell, 'Research for the Truth: Mark Abrams (1906–1994), ''The Guardian'', 27 September 1994.</ref> Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from [[Nazi]] Europe (in 1939 helping [[Sigmund Freud]] make his final move to England).<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford ODNB: Abrams, Mark Alexander|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}</ref>

During [[World War II]] Abrams was employed first in the [[BBC]] Overseas Research Department, then at the Psychological Warfare Board, where he carried out government surveys into working-class diets under rationing and the impact of bombing on civilian morale, and also commissioned covert psychological analysis into the mind of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside Hitler's Mind, University of Cambridge Research (4 May 2012).|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/inside-hitlers-mind}}</ref> His studies of food consumption during the war contributed to the establishment of the National Food Survey in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Data Service: National Food Survey 1940–2000|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}</ref>

Abrams returned to the London Press Exchange in 1946 to direct its research department as an independent subsidiary consultancy, Research Services Ltd. By the early 1960s the company employed over ninety members of staff and produced surveys for 300 clients a year, including academic as well as commercial, political, and public sector organisations.<ref>Stefan Schwarzkopf, 'The Statisticalization of the Consumer in British Market Research, c. 1920–1960: Profiling a Good Society', in Glen O'Hara and Tom Crook (eds.), ''Statistics and the Public Sphere: Numbers and the People in Modern Britain'' (London: Routledge, 2012), pp. 144–62.</ref> Research Services Ltd. was commissioned to undertake social surveys prior to the building of [[Peterlee]] new town and the establishment of [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] newspaper.<ref>Lawrence Black, 'The Impression of Affluence: Political Culture in the 1950s and 1960s', in Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton (eds.) ''An Affluent Society? Britain's Post-War 'Golden Age' Revisited'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004), p. 99; Mark Clapson, 'The Rise and Fall of Monica Felton, British Town Planner and Peace Activist, 1930s to 1950s', ''Planning Perspectives'', 30:2 (2015): 216.</ref> Abrams, along with contemporary pollsters such as [[Henry William Durant|Henry Durant]] of the [[British Institute of Public Opinion]], gained a reputation as an expert authority on market research and mass communication techniques in Britain, and published widely in academic journals as well as newspapers and the popular press.<ref>Joe Moran, 'Mass Observation, Market Research, and the Birth of the Focus Group 1937–1997', ''Journal of British Studies'' 47:4 (2008): 827–51.</ref> Two of his most influential market research reports coined the phrase 'teenage consumer',<ref>Mark Abrams, ''The Teenage Consumer'' (London: London Press Exchange, 1959) and Mark Abrams, ''Teenage Consumer Spending in 1959'' (London: London Press Exchange, 1961).</ref> drawing attention to the new significance of a rapidly expanding youth market for products and advertising.<ref>Sean Nixon, 'Understanding Ordinary Women: Advertising, Consumer Research and Mass Consumption in Britain, 1948–67', ''Journal of Cultural Economy'', 2:3 (2009): fn. 14, p. 320; [[David Kynaston]], ''Modernity Britain, 1957–62'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2013), p. 341. cf. David Fowler, ''The First Teenagers: The Lifestyle of Young Wage-Earners in Interwar Britain'' (Oxford: Routledge, 1995) pp. 93–94</ref> Abrams was one of the founding members of the [[Market Research Society]] and an advisor of the [[Which?|Consumers' Association]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Market Research Society: History|url=https://www.mrs.org.uk/mrs/history}}</ref> Research Services Ltd. (later known as RSL) was one of the founder companies of [[Ipsos MORI]].

From the mid-1950s Abrams became closely connected with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and carried out many of their private opinion polls, first with the modernisers in the party aligned with [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and then [[Harold Wilson]], for whom he worked on the development of Labour's publicity campaign for the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]].<ref>Dominic Wring, ''The Politics of Marketing the Labour Party'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), pp. 67–70.</ref>

Abrams left his chairmanship of Research Services Limited in 1970 to become Director of the Survey Research Unit at the [[Economic and Social Research Council|Social Science Research Council]], under [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]]. Between 1971 and 1975 he worked on the 'Quality of Life in Britain' surveys, which included the innovative use of 'subjective social indicators' to track perceptions of social change.<ref>Scott Anthony, 'Governing for Happiness: Mark Abrams, Subjective Social Indicators and the Post-war Explosion of 'Middle-Opinion', in Don Leggett and Charlotte Sleigh (eds.), ''Scientific Governance in Britain, 1914–79'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016), pp. 274–94.</ref> Between 1976–1985, Abrams was Research Director at the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology, King's College London, where he undertook studies of living standards among people aged 65 and over. He was also Vice-President of the [[Policy Studies Institute]] between 1978 and 1994.
