==History==
===Lincoln and Lee University===
The school has its roots in the '''Lincoln and Lee University''' movement first put forth by the [[Methodist Church]] and its Bishop [[Ernest Lynn Waldorf]] in the 1920s. The proposed university (which was to honor [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]) was to be built on the [[Missouri]]&ndash;[[Kansas]] border at 75th and State Line Road, where the [[Battle of Westport]] (the largest battle west of the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[American Civil War]]) took place. The centerpiece of the school was to be a [[National Memorial]] marking the tomb of an unknown Union soldier and unknown Confederate soldier. Proponents of the school said it would be a location "where North met South and East met West." The Methodist interest reflected the church's important role in the development of the Kansas City area through the [[Shawnee Methodist Mission]] which was the second capital of Kansas.

As the Methodists started having problems piecing together the necessary property, other civic leaders including [[J.C. Nichols]] began pushing to create a cultural center on either side of [[Brush Creek (Blue River)|Brush Creek]], just east of the [[Country Club Plaza]]. According to this plan the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] and [[Kansas City Art Institute]] would be built north of Brush Creek around the estate of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' publisher [[William Rockhill Nelson]] and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a [[junior college]]) would be built south of the creek. In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of ''[[Kansas City Journal-Post]]'' publisher [[Walter S. Dickey]]. The hospital was never built.

In 1930, after the Methodists had brought the Kansas City Dental School into their fold, the two plans were merged. The new school was to be called "'''Lincoln and Lee, the University of Kansas City'''."<ref>Link Names for Schools – ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' – December 16, 1930 – Page 1</ref> and plans were underway to develop it into a four-year school.

The university was built on a {{convert|40|acre|ha|2|adj=on}} plot, southeast of the Nelson mansion. [[William Volker]] had purchased and donated this land for the University of Kansas City. The original Volker purchase did not include the Dickey mansion itself. Dickey died unexpectedly in 1931 and Volker acquired it to be the first building.

===University of Kansas City===
[[File:UMKC Nima 31.jpg|thumb|Block School of Executive Management]]
{{For|the defunct school in Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City University (1896–1933)}}
The two groups were to squabble back and forth, with [[Ernest H. Newcomb]] attempting to mediate. The Church did not maintain its ties and the Lincoln and Lee name was abandoned.

The school announced that it would start if 125 students enrolled. The target was met, and the '''University of Kansas City''', or "KCU" for short, held its first classes in October 1933 with a faculty of 17 and a student enrollment of 264.

The campus (now expanded to {{convert|90|acre|ha|1|disp=or}}) is called the Volker Campus. The Dickey mansion is now Scofield Hall. The second building on the campus, the library, was named for Newcomb. A [[Carl Milles]] fountain on Brush Creek opposite the Nelson Gallery is called the Volker Fountain.

The University of Kansas City grew quickly, and soon incorporated other existing local private institutions of higher learning. The [[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|Kansas City School of Law]], which was founded in the 1890s and located in [[downtown Kansas City]], merged into the university in 1938. The Kansas City-Western Dental College followed in 1941 and the Kansas City College of Pharmacy merged in 1943. This was followed by the Kansas City Conservatory of Music in 1959. During this period, the university also established the School of Administration in 1953, the School of Education in 1954, and the Division for Continuing Education in 1958.

===University of Missouri–Kansas City===
On July 25, 1963, at the urging of alumnus [[Hilary A. Bush]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121020074450/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=0EAF3DC326BD8AFF&p_docnum=1&s_orderid=NB0109081715312923076&s_dlid=DL0109081715315323152&s_ecproduct=DOC&s_ecprodtype=&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=KC&s_referrer=&s_username=americasroof&s_accountid=AC0108122400392400643&s_upgradeable=no ''The Kansas City Star'' – May 22, 1992]</ref> the university became part of the [[University of Missouri System]] and $20 million of assets including 23 buildings were transferred to the University of Missouri. At the time of the acquisition, KCU had 3,300 students (2,000 full-time) and 175 full-time faculty.<ref>K.C.U., M.U. Plan a Merger – ''Kansas City Times'' – February 26, 1963</ref>

At the same time, the University of Missouri acquired the Normandy Residence Center in St. Louis to form the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]]. The acquisitions of the two schools were different in that the privately owned University of Kansas City could be donated to Missouri while the University of Missouri had to buy the St. Louis campus (although for a nominal $60,000) because the St. Louis campus had been purchased for a junior college in a bond election by the public [[Normandy, Missouri]] School District.

At the time of acquisition Missouri already owned the campuses in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] and [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]]. Accordingly, the university's name was changed to the University of Missouri–Kansas City.

After this, UMKC established the School of Graduate Studies in 1964, the School of Medicine in 1970, the School of Nursing in 1980, the School of Basic Life Sciences in 1985 (which was renamed the School of Biological Sciences in the mid-1990s), and the School of Computing and Engineering in 2001.

In 2012, the school conducted studies on whether to rename the school back to the University of Kansas City (but still remaining in the University of Missouri system). In November 2012, the school decided against the change noting at the time, "while prospective students and the community at large had strong interest in the name change, several other important groups — current students, faculty/staff, and alumni — do not favor a name change at this time."<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3898418/umkc-says-no-to-name-change.html#storylink=cpy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103211013/http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3898418/umkc-says-no-to-name-change.html|date=November 3, 2012}}</ref>

In the mid and late 2010s, UMKC came under fire for corruption and cover ups that alleged a pursuit of outside money above all else.<ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article231135763.html "After hiding details about student’s death, UMKC needs to change its cover-up culture"]</ref><ref>[https://sentinelksmo.org/still-another-umkc-prof-accused-of-exploiting-foreign-students/ "UMKC Prof Accused of Modern Slavery"]</ref> Critics highlighted examples in the management school and pharmaceutical school including a faculty member who required international students to perform personal tasks for him and false information used to rank the business school.<ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article221876590.html "UMKC widens investigation after Star found professor used his students as servants"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article220872325.html "Professor used students as servants"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article9640337.html "UMKC chancellor apologizes for use of flawed data in pursuit of rankings"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article9463514.html "Bloch School leader: No. 1 ranking lacked credibility"]</ref><ref>[https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article811481.html "A deceptive jobs claim keeps cropping up at Bloch School"]</ref>

The [[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] is regionally known for its six-year post-secondary program, wherein a student spends only six years obtaining both a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree. The school is located away from the main campus on [[Hospital Hill]], where it is connected to [[Truman Medical Center-Hospital Hill|Truman Medical Center]], a large research hospital.

The [[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|School of Law]] is one of four law schools in Missouri ([[St. Louis University School of Law]], [[University of Missouri School of Law]], and [[Washington University School of Law]] are the others). It is one of only seven American law schools to have educated both a [[President of the United States]] ([[Harry S. Truman]]) and a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ([[Charles Evans Whittaker]]). Truman attended but did not graduate from the law school and never practiced law. The schools that actually have had President-Supreme Court graduates who practiced law are [[Yale Law School]], [[Harvard Law School]], [[Columbia Law School]], the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], the [[William & Mary Law School]] and the [[University of Cincinnati College of Law]].<ref>http://www.lsac.org/LSACResources/Publications/2011OG/lsac6872.pdf {{Dead link|date=May 2020}}</ref>

The university is the home of [[New Letters]], a preeminent [[literary magazine]], as well as the nationally syndicated public radio program ''New Letters on the Air''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newletters.org/ontheair.asp|title=New Letters|work=newletters.org}}</ref> For over 50 years, UMKC has broadcast live, taped and syndicated programming over [[KCUR]], the university's radio station and NPR affiliate.

In 2004, the [[Fungal Genetics Stock Center]] moved to UMKC where it is in the School of Biological Sciences. The FGSC was founded in 1960 and is supported by the US [[National Science Foundation]]. The FGSC distributes research materials around the world and is part of the [[World Federation for Culture Collections]]. Collaborators include researchers at the [[Broad Institute]] and the US Department of Energy [[Joint Genome Institute]].

[[UMKC Theatre]] is considered to have one of the stronger M.F.A. programs in acting in the country. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 the MFA costume design program was ranked in the top 10 best costume design schools in the country by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', respectively.

The university is the site where the [[Supplemental Instruction]] program was established and developed.<ref>Burmeister, S. L. (1996). Supplemental Instruction: An interview with Deanna Martin. Journal of Developmental Education, 20(1), 22-24, 26</ref>

==Campuses==
UMKC is spread across multiple locales; the main Volker Campus, home to the majority of university operations, is located in Kansas City, Missouri Rockhill neighborhood, east of the [[Country Club Plaza]], and adjacent to both the [[Stowers Institute for Medical Research]] and the world-renowned [[Linda Hall Library]]. In 2017 the University, in collaboration with [[Truman Medical Center-Hospital Hill|Truman Medical Center]], [[Children's Mercy Hospital]], the Missouri Health Department, the Jackson County Medical Examiners Office, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health Behavioral Medicine, formed the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill. This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in research, innovation, education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trumed.org/about/umkc-health-sciences-district|title=Truman Medical Centers - UMKC Health Sciences District|website=med.umkc.edu|access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://info.umkc.edu/artscampus/|title=Downtown Campus for the Arts {{!}} Exploring the feasibility of a UMKC Campus for the Arts in downtown Kansas City|website=info.umkc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref>

===Volker Campus===
[[File:UMKC Nima 02.jpg|thumb|Durwood Stadium is located in the middle of campus. The Plaza is in the background.]]

UMKC has two campuses in Kansas City. Most of UMKC's main campus (Volker campus) is inside a square formed by Volker Boulevard (north), Oak Street (west), 53rd Street (south) and Troost (east). The "Hospital Hill" campus houses the health sciences academic departments.

Directly across Troost from UMKC is [[Rockhurst University]], a Jesuit university.

===Hospital Hill Campus===
The Hospital Hill Campus houses the [[nursing|School of Nursing]], the [[UMKC School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], and the [[pharmacy|School of Pharmacy]].

===Buildings===
'''Cockefair Hall'''
[[File:UMKC Nima 09.jpg|thumb|Nichols Library]]
Cockefair, (pronounced coke-fair), is located on Rockhill across from Flarsheim Hall. It was built in 1950 and is named for former faculty member Carolyn Cockefair who was a humanities professor at UMKC. The building currently houses the departments of History, English, and Philosophy.

'''Biological Sciences Building'''

Built in 1972, the Biological Sciences Building is located north of the Spencer Chemistry Building and east of Katz Hall. The building houses offices, classrooms, and research laboratories of the School of Biological Sciences. The school offers undergrad, grad, and doctoral degrees in the life sciences.  The Biological Sciences Building and Spencer Chemistry Building are connected on four of its floors; in addition to this, the south stairwell on the basement floor of the Biological Sciences Building is the north stairwell of the Spencer Chemistry Building.

'''Spencer Chemistry Building'''

The building, located at 51st & Rockhill, was built in 1972 using funds donated by Helen Spencer. The purpose of the building was to nurture scientific advancement at UMKC. It currently houses the main office of the Chemistry Department as well as several chemistry laboratories and classrooms. Spencer Chemistry Building and the Biological Sciences Building are connected on four of its floors.

'''The Quad'''

The majority of UMKC's students regularly attend classes in buildings on the Quad. These buildings are Flarsheim Hall, Newcomb Hall, Manheim Hall, Royall Hall, Haag Hall, and Scofield Hall.

'''Flarsheim Hall'''
[[File:UMKC Nima 03.jpg|thumb|Swinney Rec Center]]
Flarsheim Hall was built in 1999, and is the largest building on UMKC's campus. The Chemistry, Physics and Geosciences departments, as well as the School of Computing and Engineering, are located in Flarsheim Hall. The hall was named after Robert H. Flarsheim, who left a $9 million endowment to the University in his estate. Flarsheim Hall is located on the northeast corner of the Quad.<ref>http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/flarsheim.asp {{Dead link|date=May 2020}}</ref>

'''Newcomb Hall'''

Newcomb Hall (built in 1936) was named after the first manager of the University, Ernest H. Newcomb. Originally designed to house the library, Newcomb Hall is now home to offices, the University Archives, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection and the Edgar Snow Collections. Newcomb Hall is located on the extreme west edge of the quad.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903151655/http://www.umkc.edu/virtualtour/newcomb.asp Newcomb Hall<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

'''Manheim Hall'''

Manheim Hall, along with Newcomb Hall were the first two buildings originally built for the University.

'''Proposed new downtown arts campus'''
[[File:Epperson House.jpg|thumb|Epperson House]]
A proposal for a new downtown arts campus got a funding boost on June 26, 2013, with a $20 million challenge grant from the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation, but an additional $70 million needs to be raised. The backers say a new campus will increase the profile of the university's arts programs and the new performing arts facility. The first phase involves moving the university's Conservatory of Music and Dance to a location in the [[Crossroads District]]. Other programs would be moved in subsequent phases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/effort-begins-to-move-umkc-conservatory-downtown/article_50e47ae2-4d44-5234-a353-3fdbaeca336d.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629085615/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/effort-begins-to-move-umkc-conservatory-downtown/article_50e47ae2-4d44-5234-a353-3fdbaeca336d.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2013 |title=Effort begins to move UMKC Conservatory downtown |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=June 27, 2013 }}</ref>

==Housing==
'''Cherry Hall'''

Begun in 1955, Cherry Street Hall, located at 5030 Cherry Street, was a more traditional-style dormitory on the UMKC Volker campus. It housed approximately 300 students in 168 single, double and triple rooms with each floor being separated by gender and sharing a communal bathroom. Cherry Street Hall was often regarded by students as having better opportunities for social interaction than Oak Street. In August 2009, Cherry Street Hall was closed as a student residence. In May 2011 the Psychology Department moved into the newly renovated Cherry Hall.

'''Twin Oaks Apartments'''

Formerly located at 5000 Oak Street, Twin Oaks Apartments was acquired by the University in 1998 to house students who desired more independent living than the dormitory could provide. In the years since, however, the buildings had begun to show their ages. In 2002, the University decided it would be more cost-effective to demolish Twin Oaks and build a new residence hall in its place. UMKC stopped renting to new prospective tenants in 2005, and to current tenant extended a grace period for them to locate new housing. The buildings were completely vacant by July 2006. In September 2006, the Kansas City Fire Department used Twin Oaks in a firefighters training program. Demolition by wrecking ball followed in November 2006 and was completed in early 2007.

'''Oak Street Hall'''

Completed in 2004, Oak Street Hall is located at 5051 Oak Street. The five-story building houses approximately 559 students in single room and suite-style two-bedroom suites. The ground level is a large common lobby with a kitchen, laundry facility, music practice rooms, pool tables and a widescreen television set. On floors 2-5, [[kitchenette]]s, vending machines, quiet study rooms and social lounges comprise the common areas. Oak Hall was set as the quality standard for the UMKC 30-year Master Plan.

'''Oak Place Apartments'''
[[File:UMKC Nima 41.jpg|thumb|Student Union, overlooking The Plaza]]
The Oak Place Apartments are located at 5050 Oak Street on land once occupied by the demolished Twin Oaks Apartments. Twin Oaks construction on Oak Place was started in 2007 and Oak Place was opened to students in August 2008. Oak Place consists of two four story apartment complexes separated by an above ground parking structure. Oak Place houses around 500 students in 1, 2, and 4 bedroom suite style apartments, each complete with a kitchen. Common areas include lounge areas, an academic room, and 1 computer lab in each building.

'''Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall'''

Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall is the latest residence hall on the UMKC Volker Campus and is located to the immediate north of Oak Place Apartments. Construction was started in June 2008 and the hall opened in August 2009. The four story hall houses up to 328 students in the traditional dormitory style with suites of single and double occupancy rooms with their own shared suite bathroom. Johnson Hall has gender-segregated by floor housing. Common areas include music practice rooms, a computer lab, laundry rooms, and outdoor green space. The building was designed by Mackey Mitchell Architects of St. Louis, Missouri.

==Student activities==

===Greek life===
Greek Life at the University of Missouri–Kansas City is administered by the Office of Student Involvement's Fraternity and Sorority Affairs. UMKC is home to 26 Greek Letter Organizations (8 social fraternities, 8 social sororities, and 10 professional fraternities). Although the Greek population is relatively small (4.5% of the overall student population), it maintains a proud heritage, and several chapters have received awards from their organization's international offices.

Greek Life at UMKC traces its origins to 1936, with the establishment of the Bounders Fraternity. The Bounders was the first social organization recognized by the University of Kansas City, and the fraternity originated many of UMKC's school traditions. The Bounders even led the push for the removal of university president Clarence Decker. Decker's resignation in 1953 opened the door for both intercollegiate athletics and national Greek organizations on campus. In 1956, the Bounders petitioned [[Delta Chi]] and received a charter. Delta Chi became the first national fraternity to charter on the UMKC campus. The Delta Rho chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] was founded four years earlier, in 1952; however, it was originally chartered at nearby [[Rockhurst University]] and did not submit its charter for official recognition by UMKC until 1963.<ref name="umkc.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.umkc.edu/commencement/content.cfm?id=20 |title=UMKC Commencement |publisher=Umkc.edu |date=May 12, 1989 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>

===Traditions===
'''Hobo Day and Bum Friday'''

One of the best known traditions in the history of UMKC was Hobo Day, later known as Bum Friday. The campus-wide event was created as Hobo Day, and it first occurred on May 8, 1935, to celebrate the end of the spring semester. Students dressed as hobos throughout the day, and various events and competitions took place. The day started with the Hobo parade, and then everyone gathered in the quad where university president Clarence Decker would read a proclamation that he was cancelling classes and turning the university over to the students. President Decker was an appropriate master of ceremonies for the day, as he had lived the life of a [[hobo]] during a portion of his younger years. Events throughout the day included beard growing contests, pie eating contests, glee club performances, skits satirizing campus life, car rallies, talent shows, and athletic contests. The Bum Friday Queen and the Most Fascinating Man were crowned, and the day ended with a dance in which students switched out their bum attire for formal wear. Awards for the daytime activities were presented at the dance. A bonfire closed out the evening. In 1951, Hobo Day was renamed Bum Friday, although the activities essentially remained the same. In 1982, the Student Life Office put a stop to Bum Friday and replaced it with "Roo Fest", which lacked many of the activities and traditions of Bum Friday and its predecessor, Hobo Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/unews/hobo-day-a-tradition-of-the-past/ |title=Hobo Day: a tradition of the past – University News &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=October 15, 2013 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/perspectives/campus-news/2606/ |title=Birth and death of a tradition &#124; |publisher=Info.umkc.edu |date=May 8, 1935 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>

'''The Bounder Bells'''
[[File:UMKC Nima 45.jpg|thumb|Spencer Chemistry]]
Alumni members of the former Bounders Fraternity raised nearly $30,000 in donations for the purchase of a Van Bergen 49-bell [[carillon]]. The Bounder Bells was dedicated on the UMKC campus in May 1989. The carillon is located in the tower of the Swinney Recreation Center. The bells controlled by an electronic keyboard, and they ring on the hour. The bells can also can be programmed to play melodies.<ref name="umkc.edu"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.umkc.edu/news/congratulations-graduates-2/attachment/8650/|title=Ringing of the Bounder Bells|work=UMKC Today}}</ref>
