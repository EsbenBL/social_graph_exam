'''Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois''' ({{IPA-fr|øʒɛn dybwɑ|lang}}; 28 January 1858 – 16 December 1940) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] and geologist. He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (later redesignated ''[[Homo erectus]]''), or "[[Java Man]]". Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before, Dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them.

== Life and work ==

MEFT. Dubois was born and raised in the village of [[Eijsden]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], where his father, Jean Joseph Balthazar Dubois, an [[immigrant]] from [[Thimister-Clermont]], [[Liège (province)|Liège]], [[Belgium]], was an [[apothecary]], later the mayor. Interested in all phenomena of the world of nature, Eugène explored the "caves" ("''grotten''", actually underground limestone mines) of [[Mount Saint Peter]] and amassed collections of plant parts, stones, insects, shells, and animal skulls. From age 12-13 on, he attended school in the Limburg city of [[Roermond]], boarding with a family there and then he dropped out. In Roermond he attended lectures on Charles Darwin's new theory of evolution given by the German biologist, [[Carl Vogt]].

Resisting his father's plan for him to train to follow in his footsteps, Dubois, encouraged by his teachers, decided in 1877 to study medicine at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. While a student, he taught anatomy at both of the brand new (founded 1880) art schools housed at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]] (Amsterdam State Museum) the Rijksschool voor Kunstnijverheid (State School for Applied Arts) and the Rijksnormaalschool voor Teekenonderwijzers (State [[Normal School]] for Drawing Instructors).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euromuse.net/en/resources/resource/view-r/rijksmuseum-bibliotheekcatalogus/?art1=&art2=&art3=all&art4=&sprache=2&lim_Start=0 |title=Rijksmuseum Research Library - online-catalogue |publisher=euromuse.net |access-date=2014-06-15}}</ref> In 1884 he completed his medical degree. He declined an offer from the [[University of Utrecht]] of a position as a docent. Instead, at the invitation of his anatomy instructor, [[Max Fürbringer]], he decided to train as an academic. From 1881 to 1887 he studied comparative anatomy and became Fürbringer's assistant. In 1885 he investigated the larynx of vertebrates, which led him to develop a hypothesis of the evolution of this organ. Nevertheless, his chief interest was in human evolution, influenced by [[Ernst Haeckel]], who reasoned that there must be intermediate species between ape and human.

Dubois contributed an article on [[whale anatomy]] to a book by the Dutch zoologist, [[Max Weber (biologist)|Max Weber]], and, inspired by the fresh discovery of new [[Neanderthal]] fossils at the Belgian town of [[Spy, Belgium|Spy]], he spent his vacation fossil hunting in the vicinity of his birthplace. In the Henkeput<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vuursteenmijnen.nl/rijckholt/english-summary.html |title=Summary: Prehistorical flint-mining in the Netherlands: Rijckholt (Ryckholt) - St. Geertruid |publisher=Vuursteenmijnen.nl |access-date=2014-06-15}}</ref> near the village of [[Rijckholt]], where a prehistoric flint mine had just been discovered in 1881, he found some prehistoric human skulls.

Reasoning that the origins of the human species must be in the tropics, in 1887 he joined the Dutch army and arranged to be posted in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (the Dutch colony that is now independent [[Indonesia]]), to the dismay of his academic colleagues. With his wife and newborn daughter he moved to the colony to search for the missing link in human evolution. (He was unalterably convinced there was only one missing link.)<ref>Morwood and van Oosterzee 2007: 124</ref>

=== Hominid discoveries ===
Between 1887 and 1895, Dubois searched at potential sites near rivers and in caves, first on the island of [[Sumatra]], then on the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Java (island)|Java]].

In 1891, Dubois discovered remains of what he described as "a species in between humans and apes". He called his finds ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' ("ape-human that stands upright") or [[Java Man]]. Today, they are classified as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' ("human that stands upright").<ref>[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/dubois_eugene.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515004154/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/dubois_eugene.html |date=May 15, 2008 }}</ref> These were the first specimens of early [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains to be found outside of Africa or Europe. During this period Dubois carried out fieldwork at sites such as [[Sangiran]] in [[Central Java]] and [[Trinil]] in [[East Java]].

=== Later years ===
In 1897, the [[University of Amsterdam]] awarded Dubois an honorary doctorate in botany and zoology, but he had to wait until 1899 for a professorship. In that year, he was appointed a professor in [[geology]], a function that did not keep him from his research in [[anatomy]]. He was also (from 1897 until 1928) keeper of [[paleontology]], geology and [[mineralogy]] at [[Teylers Museum]],<ref>In this position, he was the successor to [[Tiberius Cornelis Winkler]], who was one of the earliest translators (1860) of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''Origin of Species'' and a very early proponent of human evolution.</ref> where he also kept the ''H. erectus'' remains.

In 1919 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00000052 |title=M.E.F.Th.

Although the scientific debate slowly began to turn in his favour in the 1920s and 1930s, he died embittered in 1940.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Prothero |first1=Donald R. |author1-link=Donald Prothero |title=When Humans Nearly Vanished: The Catastrophic Explosion of the Toba Volcano |date=2018 |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1588346360 |page=105}}</ref> He was buried in unconsecrated ground on the 16th of December 1940 in [[Venlo]], "Algemene Begraafplaats", grave number NH2\26\-\BR.

== Legacy ==
His paleontological collection and scientific archive remain at [[Naturalis]] in Leiden.<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Vos |first=J. |year=2004 |title=The Dubois collection: a new look at an old collection |journal=Scripta Geologica  |volume=4 |pages=267–285 |url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/record/215474 |format=PDF}}</ref> The institute dedicated an exhibition to his findings of ''Homo erectus'' in their renovated museum, where the holotype [[Java Man|Trinil 2]] is on display. According to Pat Shipman, adjunct professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, Dubois was "an extremely influential person in founding paleo-anthropology. He not only found the fossils. He analyzed them in wholly new ways. He pulled human fossils out of this context of racial identification and shoved it into an evolutionary context and that was a real revolution."<ref>[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/the-discovery-and-re-discovery-of-eugene-dubois/ "The discovery and re-discovery of Eugène Dubois", Radio Netherlands Archives, November 7, 2000]</ref> A special section of Museum Het Ursulinenconvent - [[International Museum for Family History]] is devoted to Dubois' life and work. Asteroid [[206241&nbsp;Dubois]], discovered by the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking|NEAT]] program in 2002, was named in his memory.<ref name="MPC-object" /> The official {{MoMP|206241|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 7 June 2009 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 66245}}).<ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" />
