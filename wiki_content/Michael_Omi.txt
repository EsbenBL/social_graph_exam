==Racial formation in the United States==
{{main|Racial formation theory}}
Omi's most influential work has been his 1986 collaboration with [[University of California Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]] Professor Howard Winant, ''Racial Formation in the United States''.  The theory draws upon [[Gramsci|Gramsci's]] conception of [[hegemony]] to describe the social construction of the [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] concept in contemporary US society.  Omi and Winant argue that race emerged as an organizing factor in society due to political actions they call [[racial project]]s.  These racial projects remain ongoing making race an unstable social category which is constantly changing as evidenced by the changing nature of race relations and as the result of political actions such as the [[Civil Rights Movement]].  Still, as Gramsci would predict, the reforms secured during crisis moments like the Civil Rights era serve merely to incorporate resistance.  The political project of racial equality remains incomplete.  Thus, the fundamental dynamics of race including institutional racism and continued inequality along [[racialized]] lines remain in place today, according to Omi and Winant.

Racial formation has solidified as one of the primary paradigms of sociological understandings of race.  Omi and Winant identify reductionist theories of race that identify race as epiphenomenal rather than durable as the chief competing theories of racial dynamics in contemporary sociology.
