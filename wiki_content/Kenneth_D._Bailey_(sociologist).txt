In between he was a scholar and visiting associate professor at the department of sociology at the [[Tulane University]] from 1981 to 1983. Since 1984 he is also a senior research fellow at the International Systems Science institute in [[La Jolla]].<ref name = "CV"/>

Bailey is a member of the American Sociological Association, the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]], where he was president in 2003,<ref>ISSS website, 2007.</ref> and the International Sociological Association and the Society for the Study of Social Problems.

Bailey participated in scientific reviews as American Sociological Review from 1974 to 1976, Systems Practice from 1987 to 1989, Behavioral Science from 1993 to 1997 and Systems Research and Behavioral Science since 1997. He also refereed in some dozen other magazines and books.

== Work ==
Bailey's research interests have been in the fields of [[research methods]], [[systems theory]] and [[Social environment|environmental]] [[demography]] and [[ecology]].

=== Sociology and new systems theory ===
In his 1994 work ''Sociology and new systems theory. Toward a theoretical synthesis,'' Bailey questioned if in those days social systems theory really existed, and if science could speak of a new social systems theory. In Bailey's opinion the works in this fields in those days did not bears much resemblance to the original [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] since the 1950s.

=== Social entropy theory ===
One of the main focuses of Bailey was the development a macro-sociological [[systems theory]], which he named [[social entropy]] theory. In this the concept of social entropy stood for a "measure of the natural decay of the structure or of the disappearance of distinctions within a social system."<ref>[[Charles François (systems scientist)|Charles François]] ed., ''International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics,'' 2001. p. 537</ref>
