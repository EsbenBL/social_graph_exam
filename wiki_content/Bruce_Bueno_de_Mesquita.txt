'''Bruce Bueno de Mesquita''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|s|k|iː|t|ə}}; born November 24, 1946) is a [[political scientist]], professor at [[New York University]], and senior fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]].

==Biography==
Bueno de Mesquita graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1963{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}, earned his BA degree from [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College, New York]] in 1967 and then his MA and PhD from the [[University of Michigan]]. He specializes in [[international relations]], [[foreign policy]], and [[nation building]]. He is one of the originators of [[selectorate theory]], and was also the director of [[New York University]]'s Alexander Hamilton Center for [[Political Economy]] from 2006 to 2016.<ref>https://cap.stanford.edu/profiles/viewCV?facultyId=86047&name=Bruce_Bueno%20De%20Mesquita</ref>

He was a founding partner at Mesquita & Roundell,<ref name=sm>{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Mathematical Fortune-Telling |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/9041/title/Math_Trek__Mathematical_Fortune-Telling|work=ScienceNews|access-date=May 12, 2011}}</ref> until that company merged with his other company, Selectors, LLC, that used the selectorate model for macro-level policy analysis. Now, the company is called Selectors, LLC and uses both the forecasting model and the selectorate approach in consulting.

Bueno de Mesquita is discussed in an August 16, 2009 Sunday ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' article entitled "Can [[Game Theory]] Predict When Iran Will Get the Bomb?"<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Clive|title=Can Game Theory Predict When Iran Will Get the Bomb?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/magazine/16Bruce-t.html|access-date=May 12, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 12, 2009}}</ref> In December 2008 he was also the subject of a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] two-hour special entitled "The Next [[Nostradamus]]" and has been featured on the 2021 [[Netflix]] series [[How to Become a Tyrant]].

He is the author of many books, including [[The Dictator's Handbook]], co-authored with [https://wp.nyu.edu/alastairsmith/ Alastair Smith], and the forthcoming book [https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita/the-invention-of-power/9781541768758/ The Invention of Power] (January 2022).

== Work in Forecasting ==
Into the early 2000s, Bueno de Mesquita was known for his development of an expected utility model (EUM) capable of predicting the outcome of policy events over a unidimensional policy space.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Mesquita|first=Bruce Bueno de|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5t9dvgAACAAJ|title=Predicting Politics|date=2002|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-0898-4|language=en}}</ref> His EUM used [[Duncan Black]]'s [[median voter theorem]] to calculate the median voter position of an N-player bargaining game and solved for the median voter position as the outcome of several bargaining rounds using other ad-hoc components in the process.

The first implementation of the EUM was used to successfully predict the successor of Indian Prime Minister Y. B. Chavan after his government collapsed (this was additionally the first known time the model was tested). Bueno de Mesquita's model not only correctly predicted that Charan Singh would become prime minister (a prediction that few experts in Indian politics at the time predicted) but also that Y. B. Chavan would be in Singh's cabinet, that Indira Gandhi would briefly support Chavan's government, and that the government would soon collapse (all events that did occur). From the early success of his model, Bueno de Mesquita began a long and continuing career of consulting using refined implementations of his forecasting model. A declassified assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency rated his model as being 90 percent accurate.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mesquita|first=Bruce Bueno de|title=Recipe for Failure|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/19/recipe-for-failure/|access-date=2021-02-02|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US}}</ref>

Since 2005 or so, Bueno de Mesquita developed a superior model, now known as the Predictioneer's Game or PG that forecasts in a multi-dimensional space, uses the Schofield mean voter theorem, and solves for [[Perfect Bayesian equilibrium|Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium]] in an N-player bargaining game that includes the possibility of coercion, essentially a greatly generalized version of the 2-player game in [https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300059229/war-and-reason War and Reason]. This model predicts significantly more accurately and does a substantially better job of identifying opportunities that players have to improve the outcome by exploiting uncertainties. This model is documented in ''A New Model for Predicting Policy Choices: Preliminary Tests'',<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bueno de Mesquita|first=Bruce|date=2011-02-01|title=A New Model for Predicting Policy Choices: Preliminary Tests|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0738894210388127|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=65–87|doi=10.1177/0738894210388127|issn=0738-8942}}</ref> and discussed and applied to examples in ''The Predictioneer's Game''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bueno de Mesquita|first=Bruce|title=The Predictioneer's Game|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2009}}</ref>

Bueno de Mesquita's forecasting model have greatly contributed to the study of political events using forecasting methods, especially through his numerous papers that document elements of his models and predictions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Mesquita|first1=Bruce Bueno|last2=Organski|first2=A.
