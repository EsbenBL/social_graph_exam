'''Timothy Francis Leary''' (October 22, 1920 – May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and writer known for his strong advocacy of [[psychedelic drug]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/timothy-leary |title=Timothy Leary |website=Biography |language=en-us |access-date=February 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/timothy-leary |title=Timothy Leary |website=psychology.fas.harvard.edu |language=en |access-date=February 2, 2020}}</ref> Evaluations of Leary are polarized, ranging from bold oracle to publicity hound. He was "a hero of American consciousness", according to [[Allen Ginsberg]], and [[Tom Robbins]] called him a "brave neuronaut".{{sfnp|Leary|1998|p=back cover}}

As a clinical psychologist at [[Harvard University]], Leary worked on the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]] from 1960 to 1962. He tested the therapeutic effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) and [[psilocybin]], which were still legal in the [[United States]] at the time, in the [[Concord Prison Experiment]] and the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]]. The scientific legitimacy and ethics of his research were questioned by other Harvard faculty because he took psychedelics along with research subjects and pressured students to join in.<ref name=Kansra>{{cite news |last1=Kansra |first1=Nikita |last2=Shih |first2=Cynthia W. |title=Harvard LSD Research Draws National Attention |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=May 21, 2012 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/21/harvard-lsd-project-leary/ |access-date=March 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320064322/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/21/harvard-lsd-project-leary/ |archive-date=March 20, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Harvard>{{cite web |author=Department of Psychology |title=Timothy Leary (1920–1996) |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |url=https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/timothy-leary |access-date=February 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405155113/https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/timothy-leary |archive-date=April 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnp|Weil|1963}} However, the claims that Leary pressured unwilling students was denied by one of Leary's students, [[Robert Thurman]].<ref name=Trussell>{{cite podcast | last1 = Trussell | first1 = Duncan | title = The Duncan Trussell Family Hour |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/duncan-trussell-family-hour/id350580455?i=1000509930898 |date=February 20, 2021}}</ref> Leary and his colleague, [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]] (who later became known as Ram Dass), were fired from Harvard University in May 1963.{{sfnp|Stevens|1983|pp=273–274}} Many people of the time only came to know of psychedelics after the Harvard scandal.<ref name=Junker>{{cite news |last=Junker |first=Howard |title=LSD: 'The Contact High' |work=The Nation |date=July 5, 1965 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/lsd-contact-high/ |access-date=May 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924191157/https://www.thenation.com/article/lsd-contact-high/ |archive-date=September 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Leary believed that LSD showed potential for therapeutic use in [[psychiatry]]. He used LSD himself and developed a philosophy of mind expansion and personal truth through LSD.<ref>

He popularized [[catchphrase]]s that promoted his philosophy, such as "[[turn on, tune in, drop out]]", "[[set and setting]]", and "[[Question authority|think for yourself and question authority]]".

== Early life and education ==
Leary was born on October 22, 1920, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], the [[only child]]<ref name=Mansnerus>{{cite news |last=Mansnerus |first=Laura |title=Timothy Leary, Pied Piper of Psychedelic 60s, Dies at 75 |series=Obituary |work=The New York Times |date=June 1, 1996 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DD1E39F932A35755C0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |access-date=July 11, 2008}}</ref> in an [[Irish Catholic]] household. His father, Timothy "Tote" Leary, was a dentist who left his wife Abigail Ferris when Leary was 14.{{sfnp|Higgs|2006|p=17}} He graduated from Classical High School in the western Massachusetts city.{{sfnp|Greenfield|2006|pp=7, 11-12, 18}}

He attended the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], from 1938 to 1940. Under pressure from his father, he became a cadet in the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. In the first months as a "plebe", he received numerous demerits for rule infractions and then got into serious trouble for failing to report rule breaking by cadets he supervised. He was also accused of going on a drinking binge and failing to admit it, and was asked by the Honor Committee to resign. He refused and was "silenced" — that is, shunned, by fellow cadets. He was acquitted by a court-martial, but the silencing continued, as well as the onslaught of demerits for small rule infractions. In his sophomore year his mother appealed to a family friend, United States Senator [[David I. Walsh]], head of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, who investigated personally. The Honor Committee quietly revised its position and announced that it would abide by the court-martial verdict. Leary then resigned and was honorably discharged by the Army.<ref>Peter O. Whitmer, ''Aquarius Revisited: Seven Who Created the Sixties Counterculture That Changed America'' (NY: Citadel Press, 1991), 21-5</ref> Almost 50 years later, he said that it was "the only fair trial I've had in a court of law".{{sfnp|Greenfield|2006|pp= 28–55}}

To the chagrin of his family, Leary transferred to the [[University of Alabama]] in late 1941 because it admitted him so expeditiously. He enrolled in the university's [[ROTC]] program, maintained top grades, and began to cultivate academic interests in [[psychology]] (under the aegis of the Middlebury and Harvard-educated Donald Ramsdell) and [[biology]]. Leary was expelled a year later for spending a night in the female dormitory and lost his [[student deferment]] in the midst of [[World War II]].

Leary was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and received [[basic training]] at [[Fort Eustis]] in 1943. He remained in the non-commissioned officer track while enrolled in the psychology subsection of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], including three months of study at [[Georgetown University]] and six months at [[Ohio State University]].{{sfnp|Greenfield|2006|p=65}}

With limited need for officers late in the war, Leary was briefly assigned as a [[private first class]] to the [[Pacific War]]-bound [[2d Combat Cargo Group]] (which he later characterized as "a suicide command... whose main mission, as far as I could see, was to eliminate the entire civilian branch of American aviation from post-war rivalry") at [[Syracuse Army Air Base]] in [[Mattydale, New York]].{{sfnp|Leary|1983|p=144}} After a fateful reunion with Ramsdell (who was assigned to Deshon General Hospital in [[Butler, Pennsylvania]], as chief psychologist) in [[Buffalo, New York]], he was promoted to [[corporal]] and reassigned to his mentor's command as a staff [[psychometrician]].{{sfnp|Greenfield|2006|p-65}} He remained in Deshon's deaf rehabilitation clinic for the remainder of the war. While stationed in Butler, Leary courted Marianne Busch; they married in April 1945. Leary was discharged at the rank of [[sergeant]] in January 1946, having earned such standard decorations as the [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]], the [[American Defense Service Medal]], the [[American Campaign Medal]], and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Leary__Timothy.html |title=Timothy Leary |publisher=Pabook.libraries.psu.edu |access-date=May 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028072448/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Leary__Timothy.html |archive-date=October 28, 2014 }}</ref>

As the war concluded, Leary was reinstated at the University of Alabama and received credit for his Ohio State psychology coursework. He completed his degree via [[correspondence courses]] and graduated in August 1945.

After receiving his undergraduate degree, Leary pursued an academic career. In 1946, he received a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in psychology at the [[Washington State University|State College of Washington]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], where he studied under educational psychologist [[Lee Cronbach]]. His M.S. thesis was on clinical applications of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]].<ref>{{cite web| title = WSU - Myths and Legends| publisher = Washington State Magazine| date = 2010| url = http://wsm.wsu.edu/s/index.php?id=793#a3| access-date = January 13, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208095736/http://wsm.wsu.edu/s/index.php?id=793#a3| archive-date = December 8, 2015| url-status = live}}</ref>

In 1947, Marianne gave birth to their first child, Susan. A son, Jack, arrived two years later. In 1950, Leary received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[clinical psychology]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Timothy Leary Papers 1910 - 2009| publisher = New York Public Library| date = 2009| url = http://archives.nypl.org/mss/18400| access-date = January 19, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160116034624/http://archives.nypl.org/mss/18400| archive-date = January 16, 2016| url-status = live}}</ref> In the postwar era, Leary was galvanized by the objectivity of [[modern physics]];{{sfnp|Leary|2000|p=13}} his doctoral dissertation (''The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure''){{sfnp|Leary|1950}} approached [[group therapy]] as a "psychlotron"{{sfnp|Leary|2000|pp=13–15}} from which behavioral characteristics could be derived and quantified in a manner analogous to the [[periodic table]], presaging his later development of the [[interpersonal circumplex]].

The new Ph.D. stayed on in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] as an assistant clinical professor of medical psychology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]; concurrently, Leary co-founded Kaiser Hospital's psychology department in [[Oakland, California]], and maintained a private consultancy.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XP02AQAAMAAJ&q=%22timothy+f.+leary%22+%22university+of+california,+san+francisco%22&pg=RA4-PA24 |title=Announcement of the School of Medicine - Fall and Spring Semesters, 1950 - 1951 |publisher=University of California Medical Center |access-date=May 19, 2014 |year=1950 }}</ref>{{efn-ua|name=The Friday Project|{{harvnb|Higgs|2006|p=18}}: "In 1954 he became Director of Psychology Research at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital, and published nearly 50 papers in psychology journals."}} In 1952, the Leary family spent a year in Spain, subsisting on a research grant. According to Berkeley colleague Marv Freedman, "Something had been stirred in him in terms of breaking out of being another cog in society..."{{sfnp|Greenfield|2006|pp=68–77}}

Despite professional success, his marriage was strained by infidelity and mutual [[alcohol abuse]]. Marianne eventually committed suicide in 1955, leaving him to raise their son and daughter alone.<ref name="Mansnerus"/> He described himself during this period as "an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank [[martini (cocktail)|martinis]] ...like several million middle-class, liberal, intellectual robots".<ref name=Torgoff>{{cite book |last=Torgoff |first=Martin |title=Can't Find My Way Home: America in the Great Stoned Age |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |isbn=0-7432-3010-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cantfindmywayhom00torgo/page/72 72] |url=https://archive.org/details/cantfindmywayhom00torgo/page/72 }}</ref>{{sfnp|Leary|Ginsberg|1995|p=4}}

From 1954{{efn-ua|name=The Friday Project}} or 1955 to 1958, Leary directed psychiatric research at the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIU3AAAAMAAJ&q=kaiser |title=Current Biography - Volume 31 |publisher=H. W. Wilson Company |access-date=January 8, 2016 |year=1970 }}</ref> In 1957, Leary published ''The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality''. The ''[[Annual Review of Psychology]]'' exuberantly dubbed it the "most important book on psychotherapy of the year".{{sfnp|Stevens|1983|p=186}}

In 1958 the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] terminated Leary's research grant after he failed to meet with a NIMH investigator. Leary and his children relocated to Europe where he attempted to write his next book while subsisting on small grants and insurance policies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Conners |first1=Peter |title=White Hand Society - The Psychedelic Partnership of Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg |publisher=City Lights Books |year=2010 |isbn=9780872865358 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780872865358/page/22 22] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780872865358/page/22 }}</ref>{{sfnp|Stevens|1983|p=187}} His stay in [[Florence]] was unproductive and indigent, prompting a return to academia. In late 1959 he started as a lecturer in clinical psychology at [[Harvard University]] at the behest of Frank Barron (a colleague from Berkeley) and [[David McClelland]]. Leary and his children lived in nearby [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. In addition to teaching, Leary was affiliated with the Harvard Center for Research in Personality under McClelland. He oversaw the Harvard Psilocybin Project and conducted experiments in conjunction with assistant professor [[Richard Alpert]]. In 1963, Leary was terminated for failing to attend scheduled class lectures,<ref name="termination"/> though he maintained that he had met his teaching obligations. The decision to dismiss him may have been influenced by his promotion of psychedelic drug use among Harvard students and faculty. The drugs were legal at the time.{{sfnp|Stevens|1983|p={{page needed|date=July 2021}}}}

His work in academic psychology expanded on the research of [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] and [[Karen Horney]], which sought to better understand interpersonal processes to help diagnose [[personality disorder|disorders]]. Leary's dissertation developed the interpersonal circumplex model, later published in ''The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality''.{{sfnp|Leary|1957}} The book demonstrated how psychologists could use [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI) scores to predict how respondents might react to various interpersonal situations. Leary's research was an important harbinger of [[transactional analysis]], directly prefiguring the popular work of [[Eric Berne]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Timothy Leary, Pied Piper Of Psychedelic 60's, Dies at 75| newspaper = New York Times| date = June 1, 1996| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/01/us/timothy-leary-pied-piper-of-psychedelic-60-s-dies-at-75.html?pagewanted=all| access-date = January 7, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134906/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/01/us/timothy-leary-pied-piper-of-psychedelic-60-s-dies-at-75.html?pagewanted=all| archive-date = December 8, 2015| url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| title = She Comes in Colors| magazine = Playboy| publisher = HMH Publishing Company Inc.| date = September 1, 1966}}</ref>

==== Introduction to psychedelic mushrooms ====
On May 13, 1957, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published an article by [[R. Gordon Wasson]] about the use of [[psychedelic mushrooms|psilocybin mushrooms]] in religious rites of the indigenous [[Mazatec people]] of Mexico.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Life on LSD |url=http://www.life.com/image/50711262/in-gallery/50751/life-on-lsd  |url-status=dead|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026205242/http://www.life.com/image/50711262/in-gallery/50751/life-on-lsd |archive-date=October 26, 2010}}</ref> Anthony Russo, a colleague of Leary's, had experimented with [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' mushrooms on a trip to Mexico and told Leary about it. In August 1960,<ref>Cashman, John. "The LSD Story". Fawcett Publications, 1966</ref> Leary traveled to [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico, with Russo and consumed [[psilocybin]] mushrooms for the first time, an experience that drastically altered the course of his life.<ref name="video">''Ram Dass Fierce Grace'', 2001, Zeitgeist Video</ref> In 1965, Leary commented that he had "learned more about ... (his) brain and its possibilities ... [and] more about psychology in the five hours after taking these mushrooms than ... in the preceding 15 years of studying and doing research".<ref name="video"/>

Back at Harvard, Leary and his associates (notably Richard Alpert, later known as [[Ram Dass]]) began a research program known as the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. The goal was to analyze the effects of [[psilocybin]] on human subjects (first prisoners, and later [[Andover Newton Theological School|Andover Newton Theological Seminary]] students) from a synthesized version of the drug (which was legal at the time), one of two active compounds found in a wide variety of hallucinogenic mushrooms, including ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]''. Psilocybin was produced in a process developed by [[Albert Hofmann]] of [[Sandoz Pharmaceuticals]], who was famous for synthesizing LSD.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Sandison  | first1 = Ronald|title = Psychedelia Britannica - Hallucinogenic Drugs in Britain| publisher = Turnaround| page = 57| date = 1997| isbn = 1873262051}} 'Psilocybin...was synthesised in Dr Hofmann's laboratory in 1958.'</ref>

[[Beat Generation|Beat poet]] [[Allen Ginsberg]] heard about the Harvard research project and asked to join. Leary was inspired by Ginsberg's enthusiasm, and the two shared an optimism that psychedelics could help people discover a higher level of consciousness. They began introducing psychedelics to intellectuals and artists including [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Charles Olson]].<ref>Goffman, K. and Joy, D. 2004. ''Counterculture Through the Ages: From Abraham to Acid House''. New York: Villard, 250–252</ref>

==== Concord Prison Experiment ====
Leary argued that [[psychedelic substance]]s—in proper doses, a stable setting, and under the guidance of psychologists could benefit behavior in ways not easily obtained by regular therapy. He experimented in treating [[alcoholism]] and reforming [[criminal]]s, and many of his subjects said they had profound [[mysticism|mystical]] and spiritual experiences which permanently improved their lives.{{sfnp|Leary|1969}}

The [[Concord Prison Experiment]] evaluated the application of psilocybin and [[psychotherapy]] in the rehabilitation of released prisoners. Thirty-six prisoners were reported to have repented and sworn off criminality after being guided through the psychedelic experience by Leary and his associates. The overall [[recidivism]] rate for American prisoners was 60 percent, whereas the rate for those in Leary's project reportedly dropped to 20 percent. The experimenters concluded that long-term reduction in criminal recidivism could be effected with a combination of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy (inside the prison) along with a comprehensive post-release follow-up support program modeled on [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].{{sfnp|Metzner|Weil|1963}}{{sfnp|Metzner|1965}}

==== Dissension over studies ====
[[File:TimothyLeary-LectureTour-SUNYAB-1969.jpg|thumb|Timothy Leary, family, and band at the State University of New York at Buffalo during his 1969 lecture tour]]

The Concord conclusions were contested in a follow-up study on the basis of time differences monitoring the study group vs. the control group, and differences between subjects re-incarcerated for parole violations and those imprisoned for new crimes. The researchers concluded that statistically only a slight improvement could be attributed to psilocybin in contrast to the significant improvement reported by Leary and his colleagues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n4/09410con.html |title=Dr. Leary's Concord Prison Experiment: A 34 Year Follow-Up Study |publisher=Maps.org |access-date=May 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322200535/http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n4/09410con.html |archive-date=March 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rick Doblin]] suggested that Leary had fallen prey to the [[Halo Effect]], skewing the results and clinical conclusions. Doblin further accused Leary of lacking "a higher standard" or "highest ethical standards in order to regain the trust of regulators". [[Ralph Metzner]] rebuked Doblin for these assertions: "In my opinion, the existing accepted standards of honesty and truthfulness are perfectly adequate.

==== Firing by Harvard ====
Other professors in the Harvard Center for Research in Personality raised concerns about the legitimacy and safety of the experiments.<ref name=Kansra /><ref name=Harvard /><ref name=SaraDavidson>{{cite journal |last=Davidson |first=Sara |title=The Ultimate Trip |journal=[[Tufts Magazine]] |date=Fall 2006 |url=http://www.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/fall2006/features/ultimate-trip.html |access-date=March 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304021804/http://www.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/fall2006/features/ultimate-trip.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Leary and Alpert taught a class that was required for graduation and colleagues felt they were abusing their power by pressuring graduate students to take hallucinogens in the experiments. Leary and Alpert also went against policy by giving psychedelics to undergraduate students, and did not select participants through [[random sampling]]. It was also problematic that the researchers sometimes took hallucinogens along with the subjects they were supposed to be studying.  These concerns were printed in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' leading the university to halt the experiments. The [[Massachusetts Department of Public Health]] launched an investigation that was later dropped, but the university eventually fired Leary and Alpert.

According to [[Andrew Weil]], Leary (who held an untenured teaching appointment) was fired for missing his scheduled lectures, while Alpert (a [[tenure-track]] assistant professor) was dismissed for allegedly giving [[psilocybin]] to an undergraduate in an off-campus apartment.{{sfnp|Weil|1963}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=495775|title=The Crimson Takes Leary, Alpert to Task - News - The Harvard Crimson}}</ref> Harvard University President Nathan Marsh Pusey released a statement on May 27, 1963, reporting that Leary had left campus without authorization and "failed to keep his classroom appointments".

===Millbrook and psychedelic counterculture (1963–1967)===
Leary's psychedelic experimentation attracted the attention of three heirs to the [[Andrew Mellon|Mellon]] fortune, siblings Peggy, Billy, and Tommy Hitchcock. In 1963, they gave Leary and his associates access to a rambling 64-room mansion on an estate in [[exurban]] [[Millbrook, New York]], where they continued their psychedelic sessions. Peggy Hitchcock directed the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF)'s New York branch, and her brother Billy rented the estate to IFIF.{{sfnp|Lee|Shlain|1992|p=97}} Leary and Alpert set up a communal group with former Psilocybin Project members at the [[Hitchcock Estate]] (commonly known as "Millbrook"). The IFIF was reconstituted as the Castalia Foundation after the intellectual colony in [[Hermann Hesse|Herman Hesse's]] 1943 novel ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]''.<ref name=Chevallier>Chevallier, Jim.

The [[Hitchcock Estate|Millbrook estate]] was later described by [[Lucy Sante]] of ''The New York Times'' as:

<blockquote>the headquarters of Leary and gang for the better part of five years, a period filled with endless parties, epiphanies and breakdowns, emotional dramas of all sizes, and numerous raids and arrests, many of them on flimsy charges concocted by the local assistant district attorney, [[G. Gordon Liddy]].<ref name=Sante>{{cite news |last=Sante |first=Lucy |title=The Nutty Professor |series='Timothy Leary: A Biography,' by Robert Greenfield |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=June 26, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25sante.html?pagewanted=all |access-date=July 12, 2008 |url-access=registration |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509165407/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25sante.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=May 9, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

Others contest the characterization of Millbrook as a party house. In ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', [[Tom Wolfe]] portrays Leary as using psychedelics only for research, not recreation. When [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[Merry Pranksters]] visited the estate, they received a frosty reception.{{sfnp|Wolfe|1989|p=99}} Leary himself had the flu and did not play host.{{sfnp|Higgs|2006|p=78}} Following a private meeting with Kesey and [[Ken Babbs]] in his room, he promised to remain an ally in the years ahead.{{sfnp|Leary|1983|p=206}}

In 1964, Leary coauthored a book with Alpert and [[Ralph Metzner]] called ''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'' based on the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''. In it, they wrote:

<blockquote>A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of [[spacetime]] dimensions, and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, [[psilocybin]], [[mescaline]], [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], etc. Of course, the drug does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key — it opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures.{{sfnp|Leary|Alpert|Metzner|2008|p=11}}</blockquote>

Leary married model [[Nena von Schlebrügge|Birgitte Caroline "Nena" von Schlebrügge]] in 1964 at Millbrook. Both Nena and her brother Bjorn were friends of the Hitchcocks. [[D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Pennebaker]], also a Hitchcock friend, and cinematographer Nicholas Proferes documented the event in the short film ''You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You''.<ref>{{cite web| last = Pennebaker| first = D.

The marriage lasted a year before von Schlebrügge divorced Leary in 1965 — she married [[Tibetan Buddhism|Indo-Tibetan Buddhist]] scholar and ex-monk [[Robert Thurman]] in 1967 and gave birth to Ganden Thurman that same year. Actress [[Uma Thurman]], her second child, was born in 1970.

By 1966, use of psychedelics by America's youth had reached such proportions that serious concerns about the nature of these drugs and the impact their use was having on American culture were expressed in the national press and halls of government. In response to these concerns, Senator [[Thomas J. Dodd|Thomas Dodd]] of Connecticut convened Senate subcommittee hearings in order to try to better understand the drug-use phenomenon, eventually with the intention of "stamping out" such usage through the criminalizing of these drugs. Leary was one of several expert witnesses called to testify at these hearings. In his testimony, Leary asserted that "the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them."{{sfnp|Leary|1982|p=144}} He implored the subcommittee not to criminalize psychedelic drug use, which he felt would only serve to exponentially increase its usage among America's youth while removing the safeguards that controlled "set and setting" provided. When subcommittee member Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts asked Leary if LSD usage was "extremely dangerous," Leary replied, "Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly...Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world."{{sfnp|Leary|1982|p=151}} To conclude his testimony, Leary suggested that legislation be enacted that would require LSD users to be adults who were competently trained and licensed, so that such individuals could use LSD "for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development."<ref>{{cite web| title = Legend of a Mind: Timothy Leary and LSD| publisher = The Pop History Dig| date = 2014| url = http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/timothy-leary-1960s/| access-date = May 10, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160324040757/http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/timothy-leary-1960s/| archive-date = March 24, 2016| url-status = live}}</ref> He presciently noted that without such licensing, the United States would be faced with "another era of prohibition."{{sfnp|Leary|1982|p=148}} Leary's testimony proved ineffective; on October 6, 1966, just months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California, and by October 1968 LSD was banned in all states as a result of the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill.{{sfnp|Stevens|1983|p=431}}

On September 19, 1966, Leary reorganized the IFIF/Castalia Foundation under the nomenclature of the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], a religion with LSD as its holy [[sacrament]], in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents, based on a "freedom of religion" argument.<ref name=Lander/><ref name=UlrichJune2012/> Leary incorporated the League for Spiritual Discovery as a religious organization in [[New York State]], and their belief structure was based on Leary's mantra: "drop out, turn on, tune in".<ref name=Lander/> ([[The Brotherhood of Eternal Love]] subsequently considered Leary their spiritual leader, but The Brotherhood did not develop out of International Federation for Internal Freedom.)

Leary was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 [[Human Be-In]] by [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]], the primary organizer of the event,<ref>{{cite web| title = Human Be-In in San Francisco 1967| work = The Allen Ginsburg Project| date = July 9, 2011| url = http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/human-be-in-in-san-francisco-1967-asv8.html| access-date = May 27, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160630044906/http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/human-be-in-in-san-francisco-1967-asv8.html| archive-date = June 30, 2016| url-status = live}}</ref> a gathering of 30,000 [[hippie]]s in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]]. In speaking to the group, Leary coined the famous phrase "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]". In a 1988 interview with [[Neil Strauss]], he said that this slogan was "given to him" by [[Marshall McLuhan]] when the two had lunch in New York City, adding, "Marshall was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of [the well-known Pepsi 1950s singing commercial]. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'"<ref>Strauss, Neil. ''Everyone Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, 337-38</ref> Though the more popular "turn on, tune in, drop out" became synonymous with Leary, his actual definition with the League for Spiritual Discovery was:
"''Drop Out'' – detach yourself from the external social drama which is as dehydrated and ersatz as TV.
''Turn On'' – find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body. Go out of your mind. Get high.
''Tune In'' – be reborn. Drop back in to express it. Start a new sequence of behavior that reflects your vision."<ref name=Lander/>

Repeated [[FBI]] raids ended the Millbrook era. Leary told author and Prankster [[Paul Krassner]] regarding a 1966 raid by Liddy, "He was a government agent entering our bedroom at midnight. We had every right to shoot him. But I've never owned a weapon in my life. I have never had and never will have a gun around."{{sfnp|Krassner|2000|p=304}}

In November 1967, Leary engaged in a [[Leary–Lettvin debate|televised debate]] on drug use with [[MIT]] professor [[Jerry Lettvin]].<ref name="debate">{{Citation |title=LSD: Lettvin vs Leary |date=November 30, 1967 |url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/7df2a7-lsd-lettvin-vs-leary |work=Open Vault from WGBH |access-date=December 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027114834/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/7df2a7-lsd-lettvin-vs-leary |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Post-Millbrook===
At the end of 1967, Leary moved to [[Laguna Beach, California]], and made many friends in Hollywood. "When he married his third wife, Rosemary Woodruff, in 1967, the event was directed by Ted Markland of ''[[Bonanza]]''. All the guests were on acid."<ref name="Mansnerus"/>

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Leary formulated his [[eight-circuit model of consciousness]] in collaboration with writer [[Brian Barritt]]. The essay "The Seven Tongues of God" claimed that human brains have seven circuits producing seven levels of consciousness. An eighth circuit was added in the 1973 pamphlet ''Neurologic'', written with [[Joanna Harcourt-Smith|Joanna Leary]] while he was in prison. This eighth-circuit idea was not exhaustively formulated until the publication of ''Exo-Psychology'' by Leary and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]'' in 1977. Wilson contributed to the model after befriending Leary in the early 1970s, and used it as a framework for further exposition in his book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'', among other works.{{efn-ua|{{harvnb|Wilson|1983|p={{page needed|date=July 2021}}}}: "The eight-circuit model of consciousness in this book derives from the writings of Dr. Timothy Leary..."}}

Leary believed that the first four of these circuits ("the Larval Circuits" or "Terrestrial Circuits") are naturally accessed by most people at transition points in life such as puberty. The second four circuits ("the Stellar Circuits" or "Extra-Terrestrial Circuits"), Leary wrote, were "evolutionary offshoots" of the first four that would be triggered at transition points as humans evolve further. These circuits, according to Leary, would equip humans to live in space and expand consciousness for further scientific and social progress. Leary suggested that some people might trigger these circuits sooner through [[meditation]], yoga, or [[psychedelic drugs]] specific to each circuit. He suggested that the feelings of floating and uninhibited motion sometimes experienced with [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] demonstrated the purpose of the higher four circuits. The function of the fifth circuit was to accustom humans to life at a zero gravity environment.{{sfnp|Wilson|1991|pp=211–213}} Leary did not specify the location of the eight circuits in any brain structures, neural organization, or chemical pathways.{{sfnp|Leary|1977|p=11}} Leary wrote that the eight circuits were given to humans by a higher intelligence "located in interstellar nuclear-gravitational-quantum structures". A "U.F.O. message" was encoded in human DNA.{{sfnp|Leary|1977|p=16}}

In the academic community, many researchers believed that Leary provided little scientific evidence for his claims.  Even before he began working on psychedelics he was known as a theoretician rather than a data collector. His most ambitious pre-psychedelic work was ''Interpersonal Diagnosis Of Personality''. The reviewer for ''The British Medical Journal'' wrote that Leary created a confusing and overly broad rubric for testing psychiatric conditions. "Perhaps the worst failing of the book is the omission of any kind of proof for the validity and reliability of the diagnostic system," wrote reviewer H. J. Eysenck.  "It is simply not enough to say" that the accuracy of the system "can be checked by the reader" in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eysenck |first1=H.

Penn State psychology researcher Jerome E. Singer reviewed the book and singled out Leary as the worst offender in a work containing "melanges of hucksterism". In place of scientific data about the effects of LSD, Leary used metaphors about "galaxies spinning" faster than the speed of light and a cerebral cortex "turned on to a much higher voltage".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Singer |first1=Jerome |title=Review: The Psychedelic Reader |journal=American Sociological Review |date=April 1966 |volume=31 |issue=2 |page=284|doi=10.2307/2090932 |jstor=2090932 }}</ref>

Leary's first run-in with the law came on December 23, 1965, when he was arrested for possession of marijuana.<ref>Harvard Crimson. [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1966/1/3/leary-arrested-on-drug-charge-ptimothy/ “Leary Arrested On Drug Charge"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215083857/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1966/1/3/leary-arrested-on-drug-charge-ptimothy/ |date=December 15, 2017 }}, ''Harvard Crimson'', January 3, 1966</ref>{{sfnp|Graboi|1991|pp=140–146}} Leary took his two children, Jack and Susan, and his girlfriend Rosemary Woodruff to Mexico for an extended stay to write a book. On their return from Mexico to the United States, a [[United States Customs Service|US Customs Service]] official found marijuana in Susan's underwear. They had crossed into [[Nuevo Laredo]], Mexico, in the late afternoon and discovered that they would have to wait until morning for the appropriate visa for an extended stay. They decided to cross back into [[Texas]] to spend the night, and were on the US–Mexico bridge when Rosemary remembered that she had a small amount of marijuana in her possession. It was impossible to throw it out on the bridge, so Susan put it in her underwear.{{sfnp|Leary|1983|p=236}}<ref name=RL /> After taking responsibility for the controlled substance, Leary was convicted of possession under the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] on March 11, 1966, sentenced to 30 years in prison, fined $30,000, and ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment. He appealed the case on the basis that the Marihuana Tax Act was unconstitutional, as it required a degree of [[self-incrimination]] in blatant violation of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

On December 26, 1968, Leary was arrested again in [[Laguna Beach, California]], this time for the possession of two marijuana "roaches". Leary alleged that they were planted by the arresting officer, but was convicted of the crime. On May 19, 1969, The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] concurred with Leary in ''[[Leary v. United States]]'', declared the Marihuana Tax Act unconstitutional, and overturned his 1965 conviction.{{efn-ua|{{harvnb|Higgs|2006|p=99}}: "His lawyers took the appeal against the Laredo arrest all the way to the Supreme Court, and on May 19, 1969 succeeded in getting the antiquated marijuana tax law declared unconstitutional."}}

On that same day, Leary announced his candidacy for [[Governor of California]] against the Republican incumbent, [[Ronald Reagan]]. His campaign slogan was "Come together, join the party." On June 1, 1969, Leary joined [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their [[Montreal]] [[Bed-In]], and Lennon subsequently wrote Leary a campaign song called "[[Come Together]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/cometogether.htm |title=The Beatles - Come Together - History and Information from the Oldies Guide at About.com |publisher=Oldies.about.com |access-date=May 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412224327/http://oldies.about.com/od/thebeatlessongs/a/cometogether.htm |archive-date=April 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 21, 1970, Leary received a 10-year sentence for his 1968 offense, with a further 10 added later while in custody for a prior arrest in 1965, for a total of 20 years to be served consecutively. On his arrival in prison, he was given psychological tests used to assign inmates to appropriate work details. Having designed some of these tests himself (including the "Leary Interpersonal Behavior Inventory"), Leary answered them in such a way that he seemed to be a very conforming, conventional person with a great interest in forestry and gardening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prankexc2.shtml |title=RE/Search Publications – Pranks! – Timothy Leary |access-date=June 28, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050328092027/http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prankexc2.shtml |archive-date=March 28, 2005 }}</ref> As a result, he was assigned to work as a gardener in a lower-security prison from which he escaped in September 1970, saying that his non-violent escape was a humorous prank and leaving a challenging note for the authorities to find after he was gone.{{sfnp|Wilson|1991|p={{page needed|date=July 2021}}}}

For a fee of $25,000, paid by [[The Brotherhood of Eternal Love]], the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] smuggled Leary out of prison in a pickup truck driven by [[Clayton Van Lydegraf]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rudd |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Rudd |title=Underground: My Life with SDS and the Weathermen |year=2009 |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-06-147275-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/undergroundmylif00rudd/page/225 225–7] |url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundmylif00rudd/page/225 }}</ref> The truck met Leary after he had escaped over the prison wall by climbing along a telephone wire.

He then moved to the [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he would reside for the rest of his life. Unable to secure a conventional academic or research appointment due to his reputation, he continued to publish books through the independent press while maintaining an [[upper middle class]] lifestyle by making paid appearances at colleges and nightclubs as a self-described "stand-up philosopher".{{sfnp|Higgs|2006|p=256}} In 1978, he married filmmaker Barbara Blum, also known as Barbara Chase, sister of actress [[Tanya Roberts]]. He adopted Blum's young son Zachary and raised him as his own. He also took on several godchildren, including actress Winona Ryder (the daughter of his archivist [[Michael D.

They toured the lecture circuit in 1982 as ex-cons debating a range of issues, including [[gay rights]], [[abortion]], [[welfare]] and the environment. Leary generally espoused [[left-wing]] views, while Liddy retained his [[right-wing]] perspectives. The tour generated massive publicity and considerable funds for both.

Leary's space colonization plan evolved over the years. Initially, 5,000 of Earth's most virile and intelligent individuals would be launched on a vessel (Starseed 1) equipped with luxurious amenities. This idea was inspired by musician [[Paul Kantner]]'s concept album ''[[Blows Against The Empire]]'', which was derived from [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s [[Lazarus Long]] series. While incarcerated in [[Folsom State Prison]] during the winter of 1975–76, he became enamored by [[Princeton University]] physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]'s plans to construct giant [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like High Orbital Mini-Earths, as documented in the Robert Anton Wilson lecture ''H.O.M.E.s on LaGrange'', using raw materials from the moon, orbital rock, and obsolete satellites.{{efn-ua|{{harvnb|Leary|1982|p=231}}: "O'Neill's proposal for mini-Earths was obviously the next step in human evolution..."}}

In the 1980s, Leary became fascinated by computers, the internet, and virtual reality. He proclaimed that "the PC is the LSD of the 1990s" and enjoined historically technophobic bohemians to "turn on, boot up, jack in."{{sfnp|Leary|Horowitz|Marshall|1994|p={{page needed|date=July 2021}}}}<ref name="Ruthofer 1997">{{cite journal |last=Ruthofer |first=Arno |title=Think for Yourself; Question Authority |year=1997 |url=http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |access-date=February 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225454/http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |archive-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref> He became a promoter of virtual reality systems,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Elmer-Dewitt/Dallas |first=Philip |title=Technology: (Mis)Adventures In Cyberspace |journal=Time Magazine |date=September 3, 1990 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971015-2,00.html |access-date=December 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224134636/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971015-2,00.html |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and sometimes demonstrated a prototype of the [[Mattel]] [[Power Glove]] as part of his lectures (as in ''From Psychedelics to Cybernetics'').

From 1989 on, Leary had begun to re-establish his connection to unconventional religious movements with an interest in altered states of consciousness. In 1989, he appeared with Robert Anton Wilson in a dialog entitled ''The Inner Frontier'' for the [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]], a Cleveland-based group that had been responsible for his first Cleveland appearance in 1979.

Leary was reportedly excited for a number of years by the possibility of freezing his body in [[Cryonics|cryonic suspension]], and he publicly announced in September 1988 that he had signed up with [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]] for such treatment after having appeared at Alcor's grand opening the year before.<ref name="alcor 1988">{{cite news |last=Darwin |first=Mike |title=Dr. Leary Joins Up... |date=September 1988 |publisher=Alcor Life Extension Foundation |url=http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics8809.txt |access-date=August 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520015759/http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics8809.txt |archive-date=May 20, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> He did not believe he would be resurrected in the future, but did believe that cryonics had important possibilities, even though he thought it had only "one chance in a thousand".<ref name="alcor 1988"/> He called it his "duty as a [[Futures studies|futurist]]", helped publicize the process and hoped that it would work for his children and grandchildren if not for him, although he said that he was "lighthearted" about it.<ref name="alcor 1988"/> He was connected with two cryonic organizations{{snd}} first Alcor and then CryoCare{{snd}} one of which delivered a cryonic tank to his house in the months before his death.

He uttered the phrase repeatedly, in different intonations, and died soon after. His last word, according to Zach, was "beautiful".{{sfnp|Leary|n.d.}}

The film ''Timothy Leary's Dead'' (1996) contains a simulated sequence in which he allows his bodily functions to be suspended for the purposes of cryonic preservation. His head is removed and placed on ice. The film ends with a sequence showing the creation of the artificial head used in the film.

Seven grams of Leary's ashes were arranged by his friend at [[Celestis]] to be [[Space burial|buried in space]] aboard a rocket carrying the remains of 23 others, including ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], space colonization advocate Gerard O'Neill and German-American rocket engineer [[Krafft Ehricke]].

Many consider Leary one of the most prominent figures during the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and since those times has remained influential on [[pop culture]], literature, television,<ref name="G. P. Putnam's Sons"/> film and, especially, music.

Leary coined the influential term [[reality tunnel]], by which he means a kind of [[representative realism]]. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "Truth is in the eye of the beholder."{{efn-ua|{{harvnb|Higgs|2006|p=282}}: "[Robert Anton] Wilson is often credited with creating the phrase 'reality tunnels', but when asked about it, he is quick to give Leary the credit."}}

His ideas influenced the work of his friend [[Robert Anton Wilson]].<ref name="SLATE-20170103">{{cite news |last=Lattin |first=Don |title=The War on Drugs Halted Research Into the Potential Benefits of Psychedelics - Now it's finally starting up again. |url=https://slate.com/technology/2017/01/the-war-on-drugs-halted-research-into-the-potential-benefits-of-psychedelics.html |date=January 3, 2017 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=January 27, 2020 }}</ref> This influence went both ways, and Leary admittedly took just as much from Wilson. Wilson's 1983 book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' was an in-depth, highly detailed and inclusive work documenting Leary's [[8-Circuit Model of Consciousness|eight-circuit model of consciousness]]. Although the theory originated in discussions between Leary and a Hindu holy man at Millbrook, Wilson was one of the most ardent proponents of it and introduced the theory to a mainstream audience in 1977's bestselling ''Cosmic Trigger''. In 1989, they appeared together on stage in a dialog entitled ''The Inner Frontier''<ref>Lesie, Michele (1989) ''High Priest of LSD To Drop In''. ''[[The Plain Dealer|The Cleveland Plain Dealer]]''</ref> hosted by the [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]],<ref>''Local Group Hosts Dr. Timothy Leary'' by Will Allison (''The Observer'' September 29, 1989)</ref> (the same group that had hosted Leary's first Cleveland appearance in 1979).<ref>''Two 60s Cult Heroes, on the Eve of the 80s'' by James Neff (''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' October 30, 1979)</ref><ref>''Timothy Leary: An LSD Cowboy Turns Cosmic Comic'' by Frank Kuznik. ''Cleveland'' magazine, November 1979.</ref>

World religion scholar [[Huston Smith]] was "turned on" by Leary after being introduced to him by [[Aldous Huxley]] in the early 1960s. The experience was interpreted as a deeply religious one by Smith, and is described in detailed religious terms in Smith's later work ''Cleansing of the Doors of Perception''.{{sfnp|Smith|2001|p={{page needed|date=July 2021}}}} Smith asked Leary, to paraphrase, whether he knew the power and danger of what he was conducting research with. In ''Mother Jones Magazine'', 1997, Smith commented:

<blockquote>First, I have to say that during the three years I was involved with that [[Harvard Psilocybin Project|Harvard study]], LSD was not only legal but respectable. Before Tim went on his unfortunate careening course, it was a legitimate research project. Though I did find evidence that, when recounted, the experiences of the Harvard group and those of mystics were impossible to tell apart — descriptively indistinguishable — that's not the last word. There is still a question about the truth of the disclosure.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Marilyn Berlin Snell |url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1997/11/world-religion-according-huston-smith?page=1 |title=The World of Religion According to Huston Smith |magazine=Mother Jones |access-date=May 19, 2014 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208111520/http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1997/11/world-religion-according-huston-smith?page=1 |archive-date=December 8, 2013 }}</ref></blockquote>

===In film===
In the 1968 ''[[Dragnet (1967 TV series)|Dragnet]]'' episode "The Big Prophet", [[Liam Sullivan]] played Brother William Bentley, leader of the Temple of the Expanded Mind, a thinly disguised portrayal of Timothy Leary. Brother Bentley held forth for the entire half-hour on the rights of the individual and the benefits of LSD and marijuana, while Joe Friday argued the contrary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/dragnet/the-big-prophet-142783/|title=Dragnet: The Big Prophet|website=TV.com}}</ref>

The movie ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), adapted from a 1971 novel of [[Hunter S. Thompson]], portrays heavy psychedelic drug use and mentions Leary when the protagonist ponders the meaning of the acid wave of the 1960s:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669/trivia?tab=qt&item=qt0471605 |title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) : Quotes |publisher=IMDb.com |access-date=May 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623193336/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669/trivia?tab=qt&item=qt0471605 |archive-date=June 23, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1996, months before his death, Leary appeared in the feminist science fiction feature film ''[[Conceiving Ada]]'' (Dir. Lynn Hershmann Leeson, 1997), which has been described as a "heady, challenging film".<ref>Mark Savlov, [https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1999-06-11/139701/ "Conceiving Ada" review], 'The Austin Chronicle', June 11, 1999. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114044440/https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1999-06-11/139701/ |date=January 14, 2019 }}.</ref>

===In music===
''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'' (1964) was the inspiration for [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]", on [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966).<ref name=Sante/>

James Rado and Gerome Ragni reference Leary in lyrics to the closing medley of "Let The Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)" in the hit 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'': "'Life is around you and in you'. Answer for Timothy Leary, deary."{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

[[The Moody Blues]] recorded two songs about Leary. "[[Legend of a Mind]]", written and sung by [[Ray Thomas]] on their album ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]'' (1968), begins: "Timothy Leary's dead. No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in".<ref name=Lattin/>

Leary recruited Lennon to write a theme song for his [[Governor of California|California gubernatorial]] campaign against Ronald Reagan (which was interrupted by Leary's prison sentence for cannabis possession), inspiring Lennon to come up with "[[Come Together]]" (1969), based on Leary's campaign theme and catchphrase.<ref name=Lattin>{{cite book |last=Lattin |first=Don |title=The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2011 |page=13 |isbn=978-0-06-165594-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/come-together/ |title=Come Together |date=March 15, 2008 |publisher=The Beatles Bible |access-date=May 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726210303/http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/come-together/ |archive-date=July 26, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>
