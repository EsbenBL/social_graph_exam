==Publications==
Ambrosio has published extensively on the relationship between [[ethnic groups]] and [[nation state]]s, examining such topics as: attempts by states to annex the territory of other states where their co-nationals reside ([[Irredentism]]); the status of nations in [[international law]]; the role played by organized [[ethnic interest group]]s in the formulation of governmental [[foreign policy]]; the role that political opportunity structures limit nationalist expression; and, how Russia's conception of itself affects its relationship with the United States and its perceived role in the [[Polarity in international relations|unipolar international system]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22Thomas+Ambrosio%22&acc=on&wc=on|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824103347/https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22Thomas+Ambrosio%22&acc=on&wc=on|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-08-24|title=Search Results: "Thomas Ambrosio"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jstor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Thomas+Ambrosio%22|title = Google Scholar}}</ref>

Ambrosio's most recent articles have examined Russia-China relations, authoritarian learning, American perceptions of the Russian threat, Russia’s perception management campaign over its annexation of Crimea, Russian treaties with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and President Obama’s geopolitical code.  He is currently working on projects on hereditary succession  in the former Soviet Union and U.S. threat perceptions of Russia and China.

Ambrosio's most recently completed a book project was entitled ''Authoritarian Backlash:  Russian Resistance to Democratization in the Former Soviet Union'' and examines five strategies that an increasingly authoritarian Russia has adopted to preserve the Kremlin's political power: insulate, bolster, subvert, redefine and coordinate.  Each strategy seeks to counter or undermine regional democratic trends both at home and throughout the former Soviet Union. Policies such as these are of great concern to the growing literature on how autocratic regimes are becoming more active in their resistance to democracy.  Through detailed case studies of each strategy, this book makes significant contributions to our understandings of Russian domestic and foreign policies, democratization theory, and the policy challenges associated with democracy promotion.
