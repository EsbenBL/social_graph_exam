'''Ralph Johnson Bunche''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ʌ|n|tʃ}}; August 7, 1903 – December 9, 1971) was an American [[political scientist]], diplomat, and leading actor in the mid-20th-century [[decolonization]] process and US [[civil rights movement]], who received the 1950 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his late 1940s mediation in [[Israel]]. Among [[List of black Nobel laureates|black Nobel laureates]] he is the first [[African American]] and first person of African descent to be awarded a Nobel Prize. He was involved in the formation and administration of the [[United Nations]] and played a major role in both the decolonization process and numerous peacekeeping operations sponsored by the UN. In 1963, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="urquhart">{{cite book|last=Urquhart|first=Brian|title=Ralph Bunche: an American life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lsfETlobAkC&pg=PA25|page=25|isbn=978-0-393-31859-3|year=1998}}</ref> At the UN, Bunche gained such fame that ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine proclaimed him perhaps the most influential African American of the first half of the 20th century and "[f]or nearly a decade, he was the most celebrated African American of his time both [in the US] and abroad."<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles P.

Bunche served on the US delegation to both the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] in 1944 and [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in San Francisco in 1945 that drafted the UN charter. He then served on the American delegation to the first session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1946 and joined the UN as head of the [[Trusteeship Department]], beginning a long series of troubleshooting roles and responsibilities related to decolonization. In 1948 he became an acting mediator for the Middle East, negotiating an armistice between Egypt and Israel. For this success he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.

Bunche continued to serve at the United Nations, working on crises in the Sinai (1956), the Congo (1960), Yemen (1963), Cyprus (1964) and Bahrain in 1970, reporting directly to the UN Secretary-General. He also chaired study groups dealing with water resources in the Middle East. In 1957 he was promoted to [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General]] for [[United Nations Department of Peace Operations|special political affairs]], having prime responsibility for peacekeeping roles. In 1965 he supervised the cease-fire following the war between India and Pakistan. He retired from the UN in June 1971, six months before his death.<ref>Bruce W. Jentleson and  Thomas G. Paterson,  eds. ''Encyclopedia of US foreign relations.'' (1997) 1:191</ref>

==Early life and education==
Bunche was born in [[Detroit]], in 1903 and baptized at the city's [[Second Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)|Second Baptist Church]]. When Ralph was a child, his family moved to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]], where his father looked for work. They returned to Detroit in 1909 after his sister Grace was born, with the help of their maternal aunt, Ethel Johnson. Their father did not live with the family again after Ohio and had not been "a good provider." But he followed them when they moved to New Mexico.

Because of the declining health of his mother and uncle, the family moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico, in 1915. His mother, "'a musically inclined woman who contributed much to what her son called a household “bubbling over with ideas and opinions'", died in 1917, and his uncle shortly thereafter.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news|title=Dr. Bunche of U.N., Nobel winner, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 10, 1971|author=Robert D.

In 1918, Lucy Taylor Johnson moved with the two Bunche grandchildren to the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.<ref name="NYTobit"/><ref name="Detnews">{{cite news|title=Michigan History: Dr. Ralph Bunche—from Detroit to the world stage|work=[[The Detroit News]]|publisher=detnews.com|date= August 29, 1997| author=Laurie J. Marzejka| access-date=October 22, 2010|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=89}}</ref> Fred Bunche later remarried, and Ralph never saw him again.

Bunche was a brilliant student, a [[debate]]r, athlete and the [[valedictorian]] of his graduating class at [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Jefferson High School]]. He attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]), and graduated ''[[Wiktionary:summa cum laude|summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.pbk.org/WEB/pbkdocs/NobelLaureates2009.pdf |title= Nobel Laureates Who Are BK Members  | date  = 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150909005827/https://www.pbk.org/WEB/pbkdocs/NobelLaureates2009.pdf |archive-date= September 9, 2015 }}</ref> in 1927 as the valedictorian of his class. Using the money his community raised for his studies and a graduate scholarship at [[Harvard University]], he earned a doctorate in political science.

==Academic career==
Bunche earned a master's degree in [[political science]] in 1928 and a doctorate in 1934, while he was already teaching in the Department of Political Science at [[Howard University]], a [[historically black college]]. At the time, it was typical for doctoral candidates to start teaching before completion of their dissertations. He was the first African American to gain a PhD in political science from an American university. From 1936 to 1938, Ralph Bunche studied [[anthropology]] and conducted postdoctoral research at [[Northwestern University]]<ref name=pbs>{{Cite web|title=Ralph Bunche {{!}} Teacher's Guide {{!}} Timeline|url=https://www.pbs.org/ralphbunche/education/teach_timeline.html|access-date=2021-01-05|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ralph Bunche {{!}} American diplomat|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ralph-Bunche|access-date=2021-01-05|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), and later at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]].

He published his first book, ''World View of Race,'' in 1936, arguing that "race is a social concept which can be and is employed effectively to rouse and rationalize emotions [and] an admirable device for the cultivation of group prejudices." In 1940, Bunche served as the chief research associate to Swedish sociologist [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s landmark study of racial dynamics in the U.S., ''[[An American Dilemma|An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]''.<ref name="Myrdal_1944">{{Cite book| edition = 1| publisher = Harper & Bros| isbn = 978-1-56000-857-6| last = Myrdal| first = Gunnar| title = An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy| location = New York and London| date = 1944}}</ref>

For more than two decades (1928–1950), Bunche served as chair of the Department of Political Science at [[Howard University]], where he also taught. Furthermore, he contributed to the [[Howard School of International Relations]] with his work regarding the effect racism and imperialism had on global economic systems and international relations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vitalis|first=Robert|title=White World Order, Black Power Politics: the Birth of American International Relations|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8014-5669-5|pages=83, 87}}</ref>

Bunche was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1950. He was the first Black member to be inducted into the Society since its founding in 1743.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Ralph+J.+Bunche&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-01-27|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> In 1953-54 he served as the President of the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/About-Dr-Ralph-J-Bunche|title=About Dr. Ralph J. Bunche|website=American Political Science Association}}</ref> He served as a member of the Board of Overseers of his [[alma mater]], [[Harvard University]] (1960–1965), as a member of the board of the Institute of International Education, and as a trustee of [[Oberlin College]], [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], and [[New Lincoln School]].

==World War II years==
In 1941-43 Bunche worked in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the wartime intelligence service, as a senior social analyst on Colonial Affairs. In 1943, he was transferred from the OSS to the [[State Department]]. He was appointed Associate Chief of the Division of Dependent Area Affairs under [[Alger Hiss]]. With Hiss, Bunche became one of the leaders of the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]] (IPR). He participated in the preliminary planning for the United Nations at the [[San Francisco Conference]] of 1945.  In 2008, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration released a 51-page [[PDF]] of his OSS records, which is available online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.nara.gov/oss/Bunche_Ralph.pdf |title=Digital Copies of Selected OSS Personnel Files – Bunche, Ralph |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=August 2008 |website= Archives.gov |publisher= [[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}</ref>

==United Nations==
Near the close of World War II in 1944, Bunche took part in planning for the United Nations at the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]], held in Washington, D.C. He was an adviser to the U.S. delegation for the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|Charter Conference]] of the United Nations held in 1945, when the governing document was drafted. Together with First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], Bunche was instrumental in the creation and adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948.  Bunche urged African-Americans to take UN positions. "Negroes ought to get busy and prepare to obtain some of the jobs in the United Nations' set-up," he counseled. "There are going to be all kinds of jobs and Negroes should attempt to get jobs on all levels. Some organization should be working on this now."<ref>{{cite book|author=Brenda Gayle Plummer|title=Rising Wind: Black Americans and U.S. Foreign Affairs, 1935–1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4eEkAbYTTUC&pg=PA122|year=1996|page=122|isbn=978-0-8078-4575-2}}</ref>

According to the United Nations document, "Ralph Bunche: Visionary for Peace," during his 25 years of service to the United Nations, he

<blockquote> ... championed the principle of equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or creed. He believed in 'the essential goodness of all people, and that no problem in human relations is insoluble.' Through the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|UN Trusteeship Council]], Bunche readied the international stage for a period of rapid transformation, dismantling the old colonial systems in Africa and Asia, and guiding scores of emerging nations through the transition to independence in the post-war era.</blockquote>

===Decolonization===
Bunche was instrumental in ending colonialism. His work to end colonialism began early in his academic career, during which time he developed into a leading scholar and expert of the impact of colonialism on subjugated people, and developed close relationships with many anti-colonialism leaders and intellectuals from the Caribbean and Africa, in particular during his field research and his time at the London School of Economics. Then, "[a]t the United Nations, Bunche had a great deal to do with the end of colonialism, with the organization's evolution from mandates to trusteeship, and with the operation of the UN's Trusteeship Division. Indeed, Bunche, as one of the principal authors of the chapters in the UN charter on non-self-determining territories and trusteeship, and later, as head of the Trusteeship Division of the UN, was a key architect of the institution of trusteeship."<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert A. Hill & Edmond J. Keller (eds)|title=Trustee for the Human Community: Ralph J. Bunche, the United Nations, and the Decolonization of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEWmkdhRAWUC|year=2010|page=93|isbn=978-0-8214-1909-0}}</ref>

===Arab–Israeli conflict and Nobel Peace Prize===
Beginning in 1947, Bunche was involved with trying to resolve the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] in Palestine.  He served as assistant to the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine]], and thereafter as the principal secretary of the [[United Nations Palestine Commission|UN Palestine Commission]]. In 1948, he traveled to the Middle East as the chief aide to [[Sweden]]'s Count [[Folke Bernadotte]], who had been appointed by the UN to mediate the conflict. These men chose the island of [[Rhodes]] for their base and working headquarters. In September 1948, Bernadotte was assassinated in [[Jerusalem]] by members of the underground Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] group, which was led by [[Yitzhak Shamir]].

[[File:Levi Eshkol & Ralph Bunche.jpg|thumb|Bunche with Israeli Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]], 1966]]
Following the assassination, Bunche became the UN's chief mediator; he conducted all future negotiations on Rhodes. The representative for Israel was [[Moshe Dayan]]; he reported in memoirs that much of his delicate negotiation with Bunche was conducted over a billiard table while the two were shooting pool. Optimistically, Bunche commissioned a local potter to create unique memorial plates bearing the name of each negotiator. When the agreement was signed, Bunche awarded these gifts. After unwrapping his, Dayan asked Bunche what might have happened if no agreement had been reached. "I'd have broken the plates over your damn heads," Bunche answered. For achieving the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.<ref>Asle Sveen {{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/bunche/index.html |title=Ralph Bunche: UN Mediator in the Middle East, 1948–1949 |access-date=2008-07-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231222710/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/bunche/index.html |archive-date=December 31, 2008 }} Nobelprize.org.

Bunche was appointed [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]] in 1968.

==Civil Rights Movement==
[[File:Ralph Bunch Headstone 1024.jpg|thumb|The grave of Ralph Bunche]]
Bunche was actively involved in movements for black liberation in his pre-United Nations days, including through leadership positions with various civil rights organizations and as one of the leading scholars on the issue of race in the US and colonialism abroad. During his time at the United Nations, Bunche remained a vocal supporter of the US [[Civil Rights Movement]] despite his activities being somewhat constrained by the codes governing international civil servants. He participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], where [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] gave his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, and also, marching side by side with King, in the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] in 1965, which contributed to passage of the landmark [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and federal enforcement of voting rights.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.black-collegian.com/african/converge2005-2nd.shtml | title = Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Dr. Ralph J.

However, he was never a communist or Marxist, and indeed came under very heavy attack from the pro-Soviet press during his career.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Urquhart|title=Ralph Bunche: An American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lsfETlobAkC&pg=PA251|year=1998|pages=249–251|isbn=978-0-393-31859-3}}</ref>

Bunche lived in the [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]] neighborhood of [[Queens]], New York, in a home purchased with his Nobel Prize money, from 1953 until his death.<ref name="Rimer-2007">{{cite web | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DB153FF93AA25753C1A96F948260 | title = From Queens Streets, City Hall Seems Very Distant | first = Sara | last = Rimer | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1989-10-19  | access-date = 2007-11-13}}</ref> Like many other [[people of color]], Bunche continued to struggle against racism across the United States and sometimes in his own neighborhood. In 1959, he and his son, Ralph, Jr., were denied membership in the [[West Side Tennis Club]] in the [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] neighborhood of Queens.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1959-07-09|title=New York Tennis Club Bars Jews and Negroes; President "explains" Ban|url=https://www.jta.org/1959/07/09/archive/new-york-tennis-club-bars-jews-and-negroes-president-explains-ban|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US}}</ref> After the issue was given national coverage by the press, the club offered the Bunches an apology and invitation of membership. The official who had rebuffed them resigned. Bunche refused the offer, saying it was not based on racial equality and was an exception based only on his personal prestige.<ref name="NYTobit" /> During his UN career, Bunche turned down appointments from Presidents Harry Truman and John Kennedy, because of the [[Jim Crow laws]] still in effect in Washington, DC. Historian John Hope Franklin credits him with "creating a new category of leadership among African-Americans" due to his unique ability "to take the power and prestige he accumulated...to address the problems of his community."<ref name="HarvardMag-2003"/>

==Marriage and family==
While teaching at Howard University in 1928, Bunche met Ruth Harris as one of his students. They later started seeing each other and married June 23, 1930. The couple had three children: Joan Harris Bunche (1931-2015), Jane Johnson Bunche (1933-1966), and Ralph J. Bunche, Jr. (b. 1943).<ref name=pbs/> His grandson, [[Ralph J. Bunche III]], is the General Secretary of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]], an international membership organization established to facilitate the voices of unrepresented and marginalised nations and peoples worldwide.

On October 9, 1966, their daughter Jane Bunche Pierce fell or jumped from the roof of her  apartment building in [[Riverdale, Bronx]]; her death was believed to be [[suicide]]. She left no note. She and her husband Burton Pierce, a [[Cornell University|Cornell]] alumnus and labor relations executive, had three children. Their apartment was on the first floor of the building.<ref name="Jane">{{cite news| title=Ralph Bunche's Daughter Falls to Death| work= The Park City Daily News (Bowling Green, Kentucky)| date=March 10, 1966| page=3| access-date=November 30, 2010| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&dat=19661010&id=CCoeAAAAIBAJ&pg=5155,3683304}}</ref>

==Death==
Bunche resigned from his position at the UN due to ill health, but this was not announced, as [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] hoped he would be able to return soon. His health did not improve, and Bunche died December 9, 1971, from complications of [[heart disease]], [[kidney disease]], and [[diabetes]]. He was 68.<ref name="NYTobit" /> He is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]], New York City.
