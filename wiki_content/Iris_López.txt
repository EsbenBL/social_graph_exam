== Academic involvement and research interests ==
López's main focuses surround the field of feminist anthropology and its intersection with Latin American identity and ethnicity. She has studied Latino issues revolving around gender and education (specifically Puerto Rican women in the United States), as well as subject matter with themes such as reproductive and pre-natal rights, and sterilization abuse. Overall, "many of her works include aspects of both [Puerto Rican Women in the United States and gender], focusing on interactions between history, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, community, and reproductive choice"<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

López also lectures at a variety of higher education institutions, where she speaks on feminist anthropology, specifically reproductive rights and freedoms.<ref name=":0" />

López is an involved member of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA). In December 2009, she was an organizer and chair of, and participant in, discussions on Gender, Health, and the Politics of Reproduction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/meetings/2009_Program_American_Anthropological_Association.pdf|title=The End/s of Anthropology|website=American Anthropological Association|access-date=February 22, 2017}}</ref>

López can be used as an academic resource for the [[Society for Medical Anthropology]]'s urban and applied anthropology sections.<ref name=":0" />

López is a member of The Latina Feminist Group. This group co-authored ''Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios.'' The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at [[Hunter College]] (CENTRO), hosted some of these women, including López, as guest speakers to discuss their publication via an offshoot of their program called "centroTALKS". These are "dialogues on issues concerning Puerto Ricans and Latinos".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prdream.com/patria/centro/aqui.html|title=Puerto Rico and the American Dream|website=www.prdream.com|access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>

In March 2012 (Women's History Month), [[Queens College]] (a college of the City University of New York) held their annual Virginia Frese Palmer Women's Studies Conference. That year's topic was reproductive justice, and Professor López was one of six other panelists to speak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2012/02/27/queens-colleges-womens-history-month-conference-to-explore-the-highly-charged-topic-of-reproductive-justice-march-19/|title=Queens College’s Women’s History Month Conference to Explore the Highly Charged Topic of "Reproductive Justice" March 19 –  CUNY Newswire – CUNY|website=www1.cuny.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-03}}</ref>

== Publications ==
López published one ethnography, ''Matters of Choice: Puerto Rican Women's Struggle for Reproductive Freedom'', in 2008. This book spans 25 years and 3 generations of Puerto Rican families living in New York City, many of whom are poor and do not have high degrees of education. The study focuses on women who have undergone sterilization (either tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or both) and narrates each family's story, from the first to the third generation.<ref name=":0" /> Themes in the ethnography include sterilization abuse, family ties, and gender roles and expectations. Aside from the family narratives, this ethnography provides historical context of the influence the United States had on Puerto Rican legislature, as well as historical context regarding eugenics and the Malthusian approach towards birth control and population control.

López co-authored a full-length book entitled ''Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonies'' in 2001 with fellow members of The Latina Feminist Group.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prdream.com/patria/centro/11_8_01/bio-lfg.html|title=Puerto Rico and the American Dream|website=www.prdream.com|access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>
