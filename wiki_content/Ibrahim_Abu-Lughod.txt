'''Ibrahim Abu-Lughod''' ({{lang-ar|إبراهيم أبو لغد}}, February 15, 1929 – May 23, 2001) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] (later [[Americans|American]]) academic, characterised by [[Edward Said]] as "Palestine's foremost academic and intellectual"<ref name="Said obit">Said 2001</ref> and by [[Rashid Khalidi]] as one of the first [[Arab-American]] scholars to have a really serious effect on the way the [[Middle East]] is portrayed in [[political science]] and in America".<ref>Khalidi quoted in Gerner 2001.</ref> His student [[Deborah J. Gerner]] wrote that he "took on the challenge of interpreting U.S. politics and society for the Palestinian community as well as eloquently articulating Palestinian aspirations to the rest of the world."<ref name="Gerner">Gerner 2001</ref>

==Early life==
{{Palestinians}}
Abu-Lughod was born and raised in [[Jaffa]], a port city in what was then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]]. His father was a metal manufacturer. From his student days, he was involved in the Palestinian struggle; he demonstrated against the British and "skirmished" with local [[Zionism|Zionist]] settlers.<ref name=said/> He completed high school in March 1948, after which he volunteered to work for the National Committee in Jaffa to discourage residents from leaving the city in the face of what Jamal R. Nassar describes as "Zionist assaults." His own family left only weeks later, on April 23 of the same year. Active in the resistance, he remained behind a bit longer, but on May 3, 1948, he left on the Belgian ship, ''Prince Alexander'', "the last" ship out of Jaffa, headed to Beirut.<ref name="Said obit" /><ref name="Nassar">Nassar 2004</ref>

==Exile==
From Beirut (and, briefly, [[Nablus]]), he soon headed as a [[refugee]] to the [[United States]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] (1951), and a [[Ph.D.]] in Middle East studies from [[Princeton University]] (1957).  Then he spent three years as a field expert in [[Egypt]] for [[UNESCO]], where he directed the social science research department. He would later hold several [[United Nations]] consultancies.<ref name="Said obit" /><ref name="Gerner"/><ref name="Nassar"/><ref name="Birzeit Mourns">"Birzeit University Mourns…" 2001</ref>

==Academia==
Returning to North America, he entered a career in academia, serving on the faculties of [[Smith College]] ([[Northampton, Massachusetts]]) and [[McGill University]], ([[Montreal]]) before settling in 1967 at [[Northwestern University]] ([[Evanston, Illinois]]), where he would remain for 34 years as a professor of political science (and department chair 1985–1988), eventually serving as Director of Graduate Studies and founding Northwestern's Institute of African Studies. During this time he founded the Association of Arab-American University Graduates (1968) and the journal ''[[Arab Studies Quarterly]]'' (1978), held two more UNESCO posts, one in Beirut and one in [[Paris]].<ref name=said>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/12/guardianobituaries.internationaleducationnews |title=Ibrahim Abu-Lughod Obituary |work=The Guardian |first=Edward |last=Said |date=12 June 2001 |access-date=24 June 2020}}</ref> He became a U.S. citizen in 1975. According to Edward Said, Abu-Lughod established a reputation as "the leading Arab academic activist in North America", with "an encyclopaedic knowledge - of the third world, Arab culture, history and language, and the western tradition of rationalism and humane understanding…"<ref>Accumulated from the cited obituaries by Said, Nassar, Gerner, and "Birzeit University Mourns…". There seems to be some disagreement as to when he left Northwestern, with the Birzeit site saying he left in 1988, the others saying 1991 or 1992.</ref>

According to Kenneth Janda, "his course on the politics of the Middle East regularly attracted many Jewish students, some of whom enrolled to monitor his lectures. Invariably, they left the class professing admiration for Ibrahim's knowledge and even-handedness in dealing with the difficult political issues in the region."<ref>Kenneth Janda in an e-mail to Jamal R. Nassar, cited in Nassar, 2004.</ref> Noted as an orator, he spoke often on behalf of the Palestinian cause, had a strong interest in other [[liberation movement]]s, and traveled extensively in the Arab world, Asia and Africa.<ref name="Said obit" />

==Statesman==
In 1977, he was elected to the [[Palestine National Council]] (PNC); he remained on the council until 1991. His work under the auspices of UNESCO to establish a Palestine national open university in Beirut was cut short by the [[1982 Lebanon War]] (in which Israel invaded Lebanon after repeated attacks and counter-attacks between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) operating in southern Lebanon and the IDF that had caused civilian casualties on both sides of the border); he returned to Northwestern. With Edward Said, he met in April 1988 with [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George Shultz]]. Said would write in his obituary for Abu-Lughod, "We told him that the Palestinian people were prepared to coexist with Israel if their self-determination was insured by a Middle East peace plan. What was needed was a mode of sharing and coexistence between two national communities in historic Palestine."<ref name="Said obit" />

==Final Years==
In 1991, having resigned from the PNC, his American citizenship allowed him to return to his homeland for the first time since 1948. During the last decade of his life he was a professor and vice-president of [[Bir Zeit University]] on the [[West Bank]], where the university credit him with being "a pioneering champion" in establishing the faculty of graduate studies. "Palestinian society today needs a higher level of competence and specialization which is achievable only through education at the graduate level," he wrote. "We cannot depend on the achievements of other societies; we Palestinians need to generate our own specialists on the ground." During this time he was also founder of the [[Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights]], the [[Centre for Curricular Reform]], and the [[Qattan Cultural Centre]] in [[Ramallah]].<ref name="Nassar" /><ref name="Birzeit Mourns"/><ref>"Palestinian studies today needs…" quoted in Gerner 2001.</ref>

Deborah J. Gerner writes that "…he was critical of the ossification of the Palestinian bureaucracy that he observed in the years following the [[Oslo accords]] and deeply troubled by the autocratic elements within the government. Yet he never gave up working for a free, independent, and democratic Palestine." He died of a lung disease in Ramallah, aged 72, and was buried in the family plot in Jaffa. Bir Zeit University honored him posthumously, naming the Ibrahim Abu-Lughod Institute of International Studies after him.<ref name="Said obit" /><ref name="Gerner" /><ref name="Nassar" /><ref name="Birzeit Mourns"/>

==Family==
Abu-Lughod was married in 1951 to [[Janet Abu Lughod|Janet Abu-Lughod]] (née Lippman); the marriage ended in a 1991 divorce. He was survived by three daughters, [[Lila Abu-Lughod|Lila]], Mariam, and Deena, his son Jawad, and six grandchildren.<ref>Said 2001 misspells Deena's name as "Dina"; it is correctly spelled in Pace 2001.</ref>
