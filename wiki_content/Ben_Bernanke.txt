Bernanke served as a member of the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] from 2002 to 2005.

As a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 20, 2004, Bernanke gave a speech in which he postulated that we are in a new era called the [[Great Moderation]], where modern macroeconomic policy has decreased the volatility of the business cycle to the point that it should no longer be a central issue in economics.<ref>Krugman, Paul R. (2009). ''The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008''. Norton & Company. p. 10.</ref>

In June 2005, Bernanke was named chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and resigned as Fed Governor.

An advocate of more transparent Fed policy and clearer statements than Greenspan had made, he had to back away from his initial idea of stating clearer inflation goals as such statements tended to affect the stock market.<ref name="lowenstein08">{{Cite news | last=Lowenstein | first=Roger | title=The Education of Ben Bernanke | newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=January 20, 2008 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20Ben-Bernanke-t.html }}</ref> [[Maria Bartiromo]] disclosed on [[CNBC]] comments from their private conversation at the [[White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/23/AR2006052300642.html |title=Fed Chief Calls His Remarks A Mistake |work=The Washington Post |date= May 24, 2006|access-date=January 30, 2010 | first=Nell | last=Henderson}}</ref>  She reported that Bernanke said investors had misinterpreted his comments as indicating that he was "dovish" on inflation.

=== Financial crisis of 2007–2008===
[[File:President Bush Discusses Economy 2008-9-19.jpg|thumb|Bernanke (left) in September 2008 as President Bush speaks about the economy]]{{Further|Financial crisis of 2007–08}}
As the Great Recession deepened, Bernanke oversaw some unorthodox measures. Under his guidance, the Fed lowered its [[Federal funds rate|funds interest rate]] from 5.25% to 0.0% within less than a year. When this was considered insufficient to abate the [[liquidity crisis]], the Fed initiated [[Quantitative Easing|quantitative easing]], creating $1.3 trillion from November 2008 to June 2010 and using the created money to buy financial assets from banks and from the government.

Bernanke was succeeded as chair of the Federal Reserve by [[Janet Yellen]], the first woman to hold the position.

==Controversies as Federal Reserve Chairman==
Bernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Bernanke "has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost."<ref name=Paul>{{cite news |last=Chan |first=Sewell |date=December 11, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/weekinreview/12chan.html?src=twrhp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815002318/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/weekinreview/12chan.html?src=twrhp |archive-date=August 15, 2018 |title=The Fed?

===Merrill Lynch merger with Bank of America===
In a letter to Congress from then-[[New York State Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] dated April 23, 2009, Bernanke was mentioned along with former Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of [[Merrill Lynch]] by [[Bank of America]]. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch were not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson. When Bank of America CEO [[Ken Lewis (executive)|Ken Lewis]] informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the "Materially Adverse Change" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/apr/pdfs/BofAmergLetter.pdf | title=Andrew Cuomo letter to Congress, April 23, 2009 | access-date=May 6, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520235631/http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/apr/pdfs/BofAmergLetter.pdf | archive-date=May 20, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Congressional hearings into these allegations were conducted on June 25, 2009, with Bernanke testifying that he did not bully Ken Lewis. Under intense questioning by members of Congress, Bernanke said, "I never said anything about firing the board and the management [of Bank of America]." In further testimony, Bernanke said the Fed did nothing illegal or unethical in its efforts to convince Bank of America not to end the merger. Lewis told the panel that authorities expressed "strong views" but said he would not characterize their stance as improper.<ref>"Lawmakers hit out at Paulson over BofA-Merrill". Reuters.

===AIG bailout===
According to a January 26, 2010, column in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', a [[whistleblower]] has disclosed documents providing {{" '}}troubling details' of Bernanke's role in the AIG bailout". Republican Senator [[Jim Bunning]] of Kentucky said on CNBC that he had seen documents which show that Bernanke overruled recommendations from his staff in bailing out AIG. The columnist says this raises questions as to whether or not the decision to bail out AIG was necessary. Senators from both parties who support Bernanke say his actions averted worse problems and outweighed whatever responsibility this may have created for the financial crisis.<ref>Grim, Ryan (January 27, 2010), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/26/is-bernanke-hiding-a-smok_n_437509.html "Is Bernanke Hiding A Smoking Gun?"], ''[[The Huffington Post]]''</ref>

===Edward Quince===
The crisis in 2008 also made then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke create a pseudonym, Edward Quince. According to the Wall Street Journal, the false name was evidence in a class-action lawsuit against the government by shareholders of AIG, which had been given a Fed-backed bailout when it was near collapse. One of Mr. Quince's emails reads, "We think they are days from failure. They think it is a temporary problem. This disconnect is dangerous."<ref>Paletta, Damian (October 9, 2014), "Meet Edward Quince, the Secret Federal Reserve Chairman in 2008", Wall Street Journal, [https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/10/09/meet-edward-quince-the-secret-federal-reserve-chairman-in-2008/?_ga=1.127706573.1908847502.1399564430]</ref>

Upon the revelation of the Quince pseudonym during the [[Starr v. United States]] trial, ''The New York Times'' created a cocktail inspired by Mr. Bernanke's chosen alias: the "Rye & Quince."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Irwin|first1=Neil|title=A Crisis, an Alias, and a Cocktail with Quince|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/upshot/a-crisis-an-alias-and-a-cocktail-with-quince.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2014}}</ref>

==Economic views==

Bush]] and others after being sworn into the [[Federal Reserve]] post. Also on stage with the President are Mrs. Anna Bernanke and [[Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.]], Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve.]]
Bernanke has given several lectures at the [[London School of Economics]] on [[monetary theory]] and policy. He has written two textbooks: an intermediate-level macroeconomics textbook coauthored with [[Andrew Abel]] (and also Dean Croushore in later editions) and an introductory textbook, covering both microeconomics and macroeconomics, coauthored with [[Robert H. Frank]]. Bernanke was the Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] and the editor of the [[American Economic Review]]. He is among the 50 most published economists in the world according to [[RePEc|IDEAS/RePEc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html|title=Economist Rankings - IDEAS/RePEc|last=zimmermann@stlouisfed.org|website=ideas.repec.org}}</ref>

Bernanke is particularly interested in the economic and political causes of the [[Great Depression]], on which he has published numerous academic journal articles. Before Bernanke's work, the dominant [[monetarist]] theory of the Great Depression was [[Milton Friedman|Milton Friedman's]] view that it had been largely caused by the [[Federal Reserve]]'s having reduced the [[money supply]] and has on several occasions argued that one of the biggest mistakes made during the period was to raise interest rates too early.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opellius.com/commentary/bernanke-vs-yellen-spooky-outlook/|title=Opellius: "Bernanke vs. Yellen: A Spooky Outlook?" By Axel Merk}}</ref> In a speech on Milton Friedman's ninetieth birthday (November 8, 2002), Bernanke said:
<blockquote>"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna [Schwartz, Friedman's coauthor]: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."<ref>FRB Speech: [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm Remarks by Governor Ben S.

Bernanke found that the financial disruptions of 1930–33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand, identifying an effect he called the [[financial accelerator]]. When faced with a mild downturn, banks are likely to significantly cut back lending and other risky ventures. This further hurts the economy, creating a [[vicious cycle]] and potentially turning a mild recession into a major depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/Bernanke20070615a.htm |title=The Financial Accelerator and the Credit Channel, The Credit Channel of Monetary Policy in the Twenty-first Century Conference, Atlanta, Georgia|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta |date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=January 30, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100113161200/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070615a.htm| archive-date= January 13, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Economist [[Brad DeLong]], who had previously advocated his own theory for the Great Depression, notes that the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]] has raised the pertinence of Bernanke's theory.<ref>Brad DeLong.

In 2002, following coverage of concerns about [[deflation]] in the business news, Bernanke gave a speech about the topic.<ref name="speech-Nov2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm |title=Speech, Bernanke -Deflation- November 21, 2002 |publisher=US Federal Reserve Bank |access-date=January 30, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100204075637/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm| archive-date= February 4, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> In that speech, he mentioned that the government in a [[fiat money]] system owns the physical means of creating money and to maintain [[market liquidity]]. Control of the money supply implies that the government can always avoid deflation by simply issuing more money. He said "The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at no cost."<ref name="speech-Nov2002"/>

He referred to a statement made by [[Milton Friedman]] about using a "[[helicopter drop]]" of money into the economy to fight deflation. Bernanke's critics have since referred to him as "Helicopter Ben" or to his "helicopter printing press." In a footnote to his speech, Bernanke noted that "people know that inflation erodes the real value of the government's debt and, therefore, that it is in the interest of the government to create some inflation."<ref name="speech-Nov2002"/>

For example, while Greenspan publicly supported President Clinton's deficit reduction plan and the [[Tax cuts#Tax cuts in the United States|Bush tax cuts]], Bernanke, when questioned about taxation policy, said that it was none of his business, his exclusive remit being monetary policy, and said that fiscal policy and wider society related issues were what politicians were for and got elected for. But Bernanke has been identified by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and a close colleague as a "libertarian-Republican" in the mold of Alan Greenspan.<ref name="reason1"/>

In 2005 Bernanke coined the term [[saving glut]], the idea that relatively high level of worldwide [[savings]] was holding down interest rates and financing the current account deficits of the United States. (Alternative reasons include relatively low worldwide investment coupled with low U.S. savings.)<ref name=BB2005>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/default.htm |title=Governor Ben S.

As the recession began in 2007, many economists urged Bernanke (and the rest of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]]) to lower the [[federal funds rate]] below what it had done. For example, [[Lawrence Summers|Larry Summers]], later named Director of the White House's [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] under President Obama, wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on November 26, 2007—in a column in which he argued that recession was likely—that "maintaining demand must be the {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} macro-economic priority. That means the Federal Reserve System has to get ahead of the curve and recognize—as the market already has—that levels of the Federal Funds rate that were neutral when the financial system was working normally are quite contractionary today."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://natgagu.blogspot.com/2007/11/larry-summers-in-financial-times.html | title=Larry Summers in The Financial Times | date=November 27, 2007}}</ref>

[[David Leonhardt]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote, on January 30, 2008, that "Dr. Bernanke's forecasts have been too sunny over the last six months. [On] the other hand, his forecast was a lot better than Wall Street's in mid-2006. Back then, he resisted calls for further interest rate increases because he thought the economy might be weakening."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/business/30leonhardt.html?pagewanted=2&ref=business |title=Bernanke's Midterm Tests |author=David Leonhardt |work=The New York Times |date=January 30, 2008 | access-date=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

==After the Federal Reserve==

In a speech at the [[American Economics Association]] conference in January 2014, Bernanke reflected on his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He expressed his hope that economic growth was building momentum and stated that he was confident that the central bank would be able to withdraw its support smoothly.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bernanke-celebrates-feds-achievements-highlights-uncompleted-tasks/2014/01/03/0460b26c-74af-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z4 |title= Bernanke Celebrates Fed Achievements|work=The Washington Post|date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

In an October 2014 speech, Bernanke disclosed that he was unsuccessful in efforts to refinance his home. He suggested that lenders "may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/06/ex-fed-chief-bernanke-denied-loan-to-refinance-his-home/ |title= Ex-Fed chief Bernanke denied loan to refinance his home |publisher=Fox News |date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref>

Since February 2014, Bernanke has been employed as a Distinguished [[Fellow]] in Residence with the Economic Studies Program at the [[Brookings Institution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/media-relations/news-releases/2014/0203-bernanke-hutchins-center |title=Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to Join Economic Studies at Brookings |last1=Nordquist |first1=DJ |last2=Tracy |first2=Viselli |date=February 3, 2014 |website=Brookings.edu |access-date=March 31, 2015}}</ref>

In his 2015 book, ''The Courage to Act'', Bernanke revealed that he was no longer a Republican, having "lost patience with Republicans' susceptibility to the know-nothing-ism of the far right.&nbsp;...

==Statements on deficit reduction and reform of Social Security/Medicare==
Bernanke favors reducing the [[U.S. budget deficit]], particularly by reforming the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] [[entitlement programs]]. During a speech delivered on April 7, 2010, he warned that the U.S. must soon develop a "credible" plan to address the pending [[Social Security debate (United States)#Background on funding challenges|funding crisis]] faced by "entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare" or "in the longer run we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth."<ref>Bernanke, Ben S., [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100407a.pdf "Economic Challenges:  Past, Present and Future (PDF version)"] (see pages 13–14 of the speech transcript).
