{{short description|American sociologist}}
'''Judith K. Treas''' (born {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1947) is an American sociologist. She is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Center for Demographic and Social Analysis at the [[University of California, Irvine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=2603 |title=UC Irvine - Faculty Profile System |publisher=Faculty.uci.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref> Treas is recognized for her research on gender, family, inequality, and the life course.

==Education and employment==
Treas earned her B.A. in sociology from [[Pitzer College]] in 1969, and her Ph.D. in sociology from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1976.<ref>http://www.sociology.uci.edu/files/docs/cv/treasCV.pdf</ref>  She began her academic career at the [[University of Southern California]].  In 1989, she joined the [[University of California, Irvine]] as the founding chair of its newly established Department of Sociology.

==Academic contributions==
Treas was among the first researchers to study the social mobility and occupational attainments of women.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2094290|title=The Occupational and Marital Mobility of Women |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=293–302 |year=1974|doi=10.2307/2094290 |last1=Tyree |first1=Andrea |last2=Treas |first2=Judith }}</ref> How men and women organize their relationships is the focus of her work on the sociology of the family. Her many publications address the division of household labor, sexual fidelity, expenditures on domestic help, time spent with family members, and household management. Introducing transaction cost theory to family sociology, Treas showed that the factors that lead firms to merge also explain why couples opt for joint, rather than separate, bank accounts.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2096283 |title=Money in the Bank: Transaction Costs and the Economic Organization of Marriage |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=723–734 |year=1993|doi=10.2307/2096283 |last1=Treas |first1=Judith }}</ref>

''Dividing the Domestic: Women, Men and Household Work in Cross-National Perspective'' argued that who does what around the house depends not only on personal circumstances, but also on societal characteristics, such as employment regulations, state arrangements for children's schooling, and new cultural ideals for a happy marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=16339 |title=Dividing the Domestic: Men, Women, and Household Work in Cross-National Perspective - Edited by Judith Treas and Sonja Drobnic |publisher=Sup.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>

A second line of research concerns intergenerational relationships. Influential early work cautioned that demographic trends could undermine intergenerational supports for older adults.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Marriage and Remarriage Rates Among Older Americans |journal=The Gerontologist |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=132–136 |publisher=Gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org |date=1976-04-01 |doi=10.1093/geront/16.2.132 |pmid=1022624 |last1=Treas |first1=J. |last2=Vanhilst |first2=A. }}</ref> She revised her thinking in a recent cross-national analysis linking cell phone technology to a rise in adult contact with parents.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Farewell to Moms? Trends in Maternal Contact for Seven Countries in 1986 and 2001 |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |year= 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00956.x |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=297–311|last1 = Treas|first1 = Judith|last2=Gubernskaya |first2=Zoya }}</ref>

A leading expert on older adults in America's immigrant families, Treas coined the term .5 (Point-Five) generation to describe the slow incorporation of late-life immigrants to the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://generations.metapress.com/content/w7837055t0w2/?p=209c7dce4e814b47b894d4e153353302&pi=12 |title=Generations - Journal Issue |publisher=Generations.metapress.com |date=2009-04-06 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120710153015/http://generations.metapress.com/content/w7837055t0w2/?p=209c7dce4e814b47b894d4e153353302&pi=12 |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}</ref>
