==Early life and education==
Mokyr was born in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]. His father, a civil servant, and his mother were [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]] who survived the [[Holocaust]]. His father died of cancer when Mokyr was one year old, so he was raised by his mother in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-duel-over-idea-that-technology-will-save-the-world-1402886301|title=Economists Debate: Has All the Important Stuff Already Been Invented?|last=Aeppel|first=Timothy|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref>

He earned an M.Phil. in economics in 1972 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1974, both from [[Yale University]]. His dissertation was about "Industrial Growth and Stagnation in the [[Low Countries]], 1800-1850" and was supervised by William N. Parker.<ref name="cv">{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://sites.northwestern.edu/jmokyr/files/2016/06/Mokyr-CV-296d1iv.pdf|website=Northwestern University|access-date=27 January 2018|date=June 2016}}</ref>

==Research==
===Industrial Revolution===
Mokyr posits that the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the result of culture and institutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|date=1 June 2005|title=The Intellectual Origins of Modern Economic Growth|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/the-intellectual-origins-of-modern-economic-growth/138F07525A5105E29E7113705D393C51|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=65|issue=2|pages=285–351|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000112|issn=1471-6372}}</ref> He argues that the root of modernity is in "the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress", and that "it was a turning point when intellectuals started to conceive of knowledge as cumulative".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/progress-isnt-natural-mokyr/507740|title=Progress Isn't Natural|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|newspaper=The Atlantic|access-date=19 November 2016}}</ref>

Mokyr furthermore argues that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues, and heretics could easily flee to a neighbouring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India. China had both a [[printing press]] and [[movable type]], and India had similar levels of scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of [[Latin]], had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy |website=press.princeton.edu|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref>

====''A Culture of Growth''====
Mokyr presents his explanations for the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 2016 book ''A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy''. The book has received positive reviews. [[Deirdre McCloskey]] described it as a "brilliant book...  It’s long, but consistently interesting, even witty. It sustains interest right down to page 337... The book is not beach reading. But you will finish it impressively learned about how we got to where we are in the modern world."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/ideas-that-built-the-world-joel-mokyr-liberalism|title=Economic history: ideas that built the world|website=www.prospectmagazine.co.uk|access-date=11 March 2017}}</ref> In her review, McCloskey furthermore lauded Mokyr as a "Nobel-worthy economic scientist".<ref name=":1"/>

In a review published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[J. Bradford DeLong|Brad DeLong]] found that while he favored other explanations for the Industrial Revolution, "I would not be greatly surprised if I were wrong, and Mokyr's brief...turned out to be the most broadly correct analysis...''A Culture of Growth'' is certainly making me rethink."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeLong|first=Brad|date=27 October 2016|title=Economic history: The roots of growth |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |language=en |volume=538 |issue=7626|pages=456–57|doi=10.1038/538456a|bibcode=2016Natur.538..456D|issn=0028-0836|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Cambridge economic historian [[Victoria Bateman]] wrote, "In pointing to growth-boosting factors that go beyond either the state or the market, Mokyr's book is very welcome. It could also feed into discussions about the scientific community post-[[Brexit]]. By reviving the focus on culture it will, however, prove controversial, particularly among economists."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-a-culture-of-growth-joel-mokyr-princeton-university-press|title=A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, by Joel Mokyr|date=6 October 2016|work=Times Higher Education|access-date=11 March 2017}}</ref> However, a fine definitional distinction is to be considered between the ″culture as ideas, socially learned" and ″culture as inheritance transmitted genetically".

===Resistance to new technologies===
Mokyr outlined three reasons why societies resist new technologies:
* Incumbents who fear a threat to their power and [[economic rent]]s
* Concern about broader social and political repercussions ("unintended ripple effects")
* [[Risk aversion|Risk]] and [[loss aversion]]: new technologies often have "unanticipated and unknowable consequences"

"These three motives often merge and create powerful forces that use political power and persuasion to thwart innovations. As a result, technological progress does not follow a linear and neat trajectory. It is, as social constructionists have been trying to tell us for decades, a profoundly political process."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eh.net/book_reviews/innovation-and-its-enemies-why-people-resist-new-technologies|title=Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies|website=eh.net|access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref>
