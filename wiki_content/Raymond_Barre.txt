[[Image:Maison natale Leon Dierx Raymond Barre dsc07274.jpg|thumb|The house where Raymond Barre was born in Saint-Denis, Réunion]]
'''Raymond Octave Joseph Barre''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛmɔ̃ baʁ|lang}}; 12 April 1924{{spaced ndash}}25 August 2007) was a French centre-right politician and economist. He was a [[Vice President of the European Commission]] and [[European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs|Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs]] under three presidents ([[Jean Rey (politician)|Rey]], [[Franco Maria Malfatti|Malfatti]] and [[Sicco Mansholt|Mansholt]]) and later served as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] under [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] from 1976 until 1981. As a candidate for the [[1988 French presidential election|presidency in 1988]], he came in third and was eliminated in the first round. He was born in [[Saint-Denis, Réunion|Saint-Denis]], in the French island of [[Réunion]], then still a colony (it became an [[overseas department]] in 1946).

==Career==

===Professional life===
After his education, Raymond Barre was professor of economics at the ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po)'' as well as ''[[École Centrale Paris]]''.

From 1959 to 1962, he was director of [[Jean-Marcel Jeanneney]]'s staff, in the ministry of Industry and Trade. Then, in 1967, President [[Charles de Gaulle]] chose him as [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] for [[European Commissioner for Economic & Financial Affairs|Economic & Financial Affairs]]. He stayed in [[Brussels]] until January 1973, serving in the [[Rey Commission|Rey]], [[Malfatti Commission|Malfatti]] and [[Mansholt Commission]]s. Having come back to France, he joined the cabinet as minister of the External Trade in January 1976.

===Premiership===
Seven months later, while mostly unknown at that time, President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] appointed him [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and Minister of Economy and Finance. He presented him to the French people as "the best economist in France" ({{lang-fr|link=no|meilleur économiste de France}}). Under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], he was the only person to hold these two offices at the same time. He left the ministry of Economy and Finance in 1978, but stayed as Prime minister until the defeat of Giscard d'Estaing at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].

At the head of the cabinet, he was faced with the conflict which divided the parliamentary majority between the "Giscardians" and the neo-Gaullist [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) led by his predecessor [[Jacques Chirac]]. The right majority unexpectedly won the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]].

Barre was primarily confronted with an economic crisis. He advocated numerous complex, strict policies ("Barre Plans"). The first Barre plan emerged on 22 September 1976, with a priority to stop inflation. It included a 3-month price freeze; a reduction in the value added tax; wage controls; salary controls; a reduction of the growth in the money supply; and increases in the income tax, automobile taxes, luxury taxes and bank rates.  There were measures to restore the trade balance, and support the growth of the economy and employment. Oil imports, whose price had shot up, were limited. There was special aid to exports, and an action fund was set up to aid industries. There was increased financial aid to farmers, who were suffering from a drought, and for social security. The package was not very popular, but was pursued with vigor.<ref>J.R. Frears, ''France in the Giscard Presidency'' (1981) p. 135.</ref>

In the face of trade union opposition, he did not use diplomatic language. Instead he mocked "the bearers of banners" ({{lang-fr|link=no|les porteurs de pancartes}}) and he exhorted "instead of grousing, you should work hard".

===Post-premiership===
After his departure from the head of the cabinet, he was elected deputy of [[Rhône (département)|Rhône]] ''département'' under the label of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF), although he never formally joined the party. He held his parliamentary seat until 2002.

In the 1980s, he competed for the leadership of the right against Chirac. Believing that the "[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]" was incompatible with the "[[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]", he let Chirac take the lead of the cabinet after the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative election]]. He ran as UDF candidate for president in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 election]], but some components of his party supported covertly the other right-wing candidate, the Neo-Gaullist Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]]. In this, in spite of positive polls at the beginning of the campaign, he came the third behind the two protagonists of the "cohabitation": the Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac]]. For the second round, he called his voters to transfer to the RPR candidate, who was finally defeated.

After the failure of his presidential candidacy, he focused on his local tenures, in [[Lyon]]. In 1995, the RPR Mayor of Lyon [[Michel Noir]] could not compete for another term in due to a judicial indictment, and consequently, Barre was the conservative candidate to the mayoralty. He was elected but he did not run for a second term in 2001. One year later, he finished his last parliamentary term in the [[French National Assembly]] and retired from politics.

Raymond Barre was probably the only French politician to have reached such high levels of responsibilities without having ever been an official member or leader of any political party. He always kept some distance with what he considered to be the political "[[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]".

Raymond Barre died on 25 August 2007 at age 83 at the [[Val-de-Grâce]] military hospital in Paris,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6963320.stm BBC NEWS, French ex-PM Raymond Barre dies]</ref> where he was being treated for heart problems since his transfer from a hospital in [[Monaco]] on 11 April 2007.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-894744,0.html LeMonde.fr with AFP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509223205/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-894744,0.html |date=9 May 2007 }}, 11 April 2007</ref>

==Allegations of antisemitism==
[[Image:World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 1989-3.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Raymond Barre standing next to Mother [[Tessa Bielecki]] and Rabbi [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] during the 1989 [[World Economic Forum]]]]
On several occasions, Raymond Barre made remarks that were interpreted as antisemitic, or at least supportive of [[antisemitism]]. In 1980, when he was prime minister, a [[1980 Paris synagogue bombing|bombing was attempted]] against the [[Union Libérale Israélite de France]], a synagogue in the rue Copernic, Paris; however the bomb detonated in the street when the Jews attending [[shabbat]] were inside the synagogue, and not when they were out; but as a result some non-Jewish bystanders were killed. Raymond Barre then famously denounced:

:"A hateful attack which wanted to strike at the Jews who were in that synagogue, and which struck innocent French people who were crossing the street."<ref>[[TF1]], [http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=raymond+barre+fran%E7ais+innocents&num_notice=1&total_notices=1 late evening news], 3 October 1980{{dead link|date=November 2019|fix-attempted=no}}</ref><ref name="NYTobit">{{cite web |last1=Bernard |first1=Ariane |title=Raymond Barre, 83, Former French Premier, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/world/europe/27barre.html?ref=world |website=The New York Times|access-date=1 December 2019 |date=27 August 2007 }}</ref>

In 2007, Barre argued on a radio show that "the Jewish lobby" had orchestrated criticism regarding his 1980 remarks. On this same show, Barre defended the [[Collaboration during World War II|collaborationist]] [[Maurice Papon]] at his trial, describing him as "a scapegoat." Barre was criticized for these remarks.<ref name="NYTobit" />
