===Investigation of Kennedy assassination===
His book ''The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F. Kennedy.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=152424994788652&notes_tab=app_2347471856#!/note.php?note_id=135909353121328|title=The Kennedy Half-Century – Notes – Facebook|work=Facebook|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was published in 2013. It focuses on [[John F. Kennedy]]'s life, administration, and [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] and contains research from focus groups, polling, and interviews with colleagues and eyewitnesses.  After analyzing evidence regarding the assassination, Sabato discredited the 1979 United States House Select Committee on Assassinations(HSCA) conclusion of a possible second shooter, stating that it was "blown out the water."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jfk-assassination-conspiracy-theory-blown-out-of-the-water-in-new-book-author-says/|title=JFK assassination conspiracy theory "blown out of the water" in new book, author says|publisher=CBS News|date=October 14, 2013|access-date=November 9, 2020}}</ref>

==Sabato's Crystal Ball==
''Sabato's Crystal Ball'' is run by the [[University of Virginia Center for Politics]] in Charlottesville. The site contains analysis of an array of political races in the United States, including presidential elections, Senate, House, and gubernatorial contests.

===Predictions accuracy until 2016===
Prior to the 2002 midterm elections, where the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] saw gains in both branches of Congress, Sabato's Crystal Ball website accurately predicted the outcome in 433 of the 435 contests for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 32 of 34 [[United States Senate|Senate]] races.<ref name="2002-election">{{cite web |url=http://centerforpolitics.org/downloads/CBpromo2002.pdf |title=ELECTION 2002: How the CB fared...|publisher=Center for Politics, University of Virginia}}</ref>

In 2004, when [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] retained the [[White House]] and gained seats in the House and Senate, Crystal Ball correctly predicted the outcome of 525 of the 530 political races (99% accuracy), missing only one [[United States House of Representatives|House]] race, one [[United States Senate|Senate]] race, one governor's race and two states in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].<ref name="2004-election">{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/LJS2004110901/ |title=A Look Back, A Look Forward |publisher=Center for Politics, University of Virginia |date=November 9, 2004}}</ref>

In August 2006, Crystal Ball predicted that the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] would gain 29 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 6 seats in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], providing them with a majority in both chambers. Sabato's predictions proved correct: each of his 33 Senate predictions were accurate, and in the House, Democrats gained 29 seats on election night, the precise total predicted by the Crystal Ball (Democrats went on to pick up a 30th seat in the December 12, 2006 run-off in Texas' 23rd district).<ref name="2008-election-previous">{{cite news |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/news-networks-recognize-success-sabatos-crystal-ball |title=News Networks Recognize Success of 'Sabato's Crystal Ball' |work=UVA Today |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>

In 2006 Sabato was named the most accurate source of election predictions by MSNBC, CNBC, and Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism. In 2006, he was the only national analyst who correctly predicted the exact [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] gains in Senate and House contests.<ref name="2008-election-previous"/>

In July 2008, Crystal Ball correctly projected that [[Barack Obama]] would win the presidency in a near-landslide.<ref name="2008-election-july">{{cite news |url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/AIA2008072401/ |title=The Myth of a Toss-Up Election |date=July 24, 2008}}</ref> Sabato predicted a 364–174 margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], as well as the popular vote percentages.<ref name="2008-election-predictions">{{cite news |url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/LJS2008110301/ |title=The Last Last Word |date=November 3, 2008}}</ref> The prediction was merely one point off the mark, with the actual result on November 4, 2008, being Obama 365 to McCain 173. It did not predict an Obama win in [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district|Nebraska's 2nd district]], as he did not make separate predictions for individual congressional districts in states that split their electoral votes on such factors (he started making separate predictions for such districts in 2012, probably because of this occurrence). Crystal Ball also accurately predicted 34 of all 35 Senate races, and 11 gubernatorial races correctly.<ref name="2008-election-results">{{cite news |url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/LJS2008120401/ |title=The Election Without End |date=November 6, 2008}}</ref>

In November 2010, Crystal Ball projected that Republicans would pick up 55 seats in the House of Representatives.<ref>[http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/category/2010-house/ 2010 Election Special] November 1, 2012</ref> The Republicans picked up 63 House seats. It predicted a pickup of 8 seats in the Senate for Republicans.<ref>[http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/ljs20101101201001/ Election Eve Special] November 1, 2010</ref> The Republicans picked up 6 Senate seats.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39975505 GOP picks up Senate seats but falls short of majority] November 3, 2010</ref>

In 2012, Crystal Ball projected that Obama would win the presidency with 290 electoral votes to 248 for Romney; there would be no change in partisan makeup of the Senate, with Democrats at 53 and Republicans at 47; and Democrats would pick up 3 seats in the House of Representatives, for a result of 239 Republicans and 196 Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/projection-obama-will-likely-win-second-term/|title=Projection: Obama Will Likely Win Second Term|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> The projection was similar to the [[United States elections, 2012|actual results]], but Crystal Ball under-estimated Obama's number of [[2012 United States presidential election|electoral votes]] (332) and under-estimated Democratic victories in both [[United States Senate elections, 2012|the Senate]] (Democrats picked up two seats) and in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|the House]] (Democrats picked up eight seats).

Crystal Ball made widespread incorrect predictions in 2016, wrongly predicting the outcome of the presidential race, as well as the outcomes of the House and Senate races. The night before voting took place, Sabato appeared on MSBNC and stated that Hillary Clinton would win 322 and Trump would win 216 electoral college votes; in fact, Trump won 306 and Clinton won 232. Sabato and his staff summarized the results in an article entitled "Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/mea-culpa-mea-culpa-mea-maxima-culpa/|title="Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa"|author=J. Sabato, Larry |display-authors=etal |date=November 9, 2016|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

===Earmark controversy===
In June 2009, it was revealed that Sabato's [[University of Virginia Center for Politics|Center for Politics]] had been the recipient of over $7 million in earmarked money from Congressman [[Virgil Goode]], whom Sabato predicted would win re-election in 2008, despite declining poll numbers; Goode ultimately lost the race by fewer than 800 votes out of about 316,000 votes cast.<ref name="earmarks">{{cite web|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F5EA641B-18FE-70B2-A8CA7099244C65DC|title=Ben Smith, ''Sabato's program earmark dries up'', The Politico, June 19, 2009|author=Ben Smith|access-date=26 November 2014| url-status = dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225230652/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F5EA641B-18FE-70B2-A8CA7099244C65DC|archive-date=25 December 2014}}</ref> Political blogger Greg Sargent suggested that Sabato should have revealed his Center's financial connection to Goode or recused himself from making predictions about the race.<ref name="criticism">{{cite web|url=http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/pundits/larry-sabato-and-the-dc-pundit-industrial-complex/ |title=Greg Sargent, ''Larry Sabato And The D.C.
