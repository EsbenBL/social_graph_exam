'''Social influence''' comprises the ways in which individuals change their [[behavior]] to meet the demands of a social environment. It takes many forms and can be seen in [[conformity]], [[socialization]], [[peer pressure]], [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[leadership]], [[persuasion]], [[sales]], and [[marketing]]. Typically social influence results from a specific action, command, or request, but people also alter their attitudes and behaviors in response to what they perceive others might do or think. In 1958, Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three broad varieties of social influence.<ref name="Kelman">{{cite journal|author=Kelman, H.|year=1958|title=Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106|s2cid=145642577|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/files/Compliance_identification_and_internalization.pdf}}</ref>

#'''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]''' is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private.
#'''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]''' is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity.
#'''[[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]]''' is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately.

[[Morton Deutsch]] and Harold Gerard described two psychological [[need]]s that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others. These include our need to be right ([[informational social influence]]) and our need to be liked ([[normative social influence]]).<ref name="Gerard">{{cite journal|author1=Deutsch, M.|author2=Gerard, H. B.|name-list-style=amp|year=1955|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgment|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629–636|pmid=13286010|doi=10.1037/h0046408|url=http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/deutsch55.pdf}}</ref> Informational influence (or ''social proof'') is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality. [[Social proof|Informational influence]] comes into play when people are uncertain, either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement. [[Normative social influence|Normative influence]] is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others. In terms of Kelman's typology, normative influence leads to public compliance, whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance.<ref name=Kelman />

==Types==
Social influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena. Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of [[social psychology]]. For more information, follow the main article links provided.

===Kelman's varieties===
There are three processes of [[attitude change]] as defined by Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] in a 1958 paper published in the ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''.<ref name="Kelman" /> The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence: for example, to separate public conformity (behavior) from private acceptance (personal belief).

====Compliance====
{{Main article|Compliance (psychology)}}
[[File:Silence is compliance - A protester with a message standing on a window ledge in Whitehall. (31903348794).jpg|thumb|Photo: Silence is Compliance]]
Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others. Technically, compliance is a change in [[behavior]] but not necessarily in [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]; one can comply due to mere [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures.<ref name="Aronson">Aronson, Elliot, Timothy D. Wilson, and Robin M. Akert. Social Psychology. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2010. Print.</ref> According to Kelman's 1958 paper, the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence (i.e., people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion).<ref name="Kelman" />

====Identification====
{{Main article|Identification (psychology)}}
Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired. [[Advertisements]] that rely upon [[celebrities|celebrity]] endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon. According to Kelman, the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change.<ref name="Kelman" />

====Internalization====
{{Main article|Internalization}}
Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual. The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding. It is congruent with the individual's value system, and according to Kelman the "reward" of internalization is "the content of the new behavior".<ref name="Kelman" />

===Conformity===
{{Main article|Conformity}}
Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior, belief, or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards. It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. [[Social psychology]] research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties: [[informational social influence|informational conformity]] (also called ''social proof'', or "internalization" in Kelman's terms ) and [[normative social influence|normative conformity]] ("compliance" in Kelman's terms).<ref name="Aronson" />

In the case of [[peer pressure]], a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do (such as taking [[illegal drugs]]) but which they perceive as "necessary" to keep a positive [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with other people (such as their [[friend]]s). Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others.

===Minority influence===
{{Main article|Minority influence}}
Researchers have been studying social influence and [[minority influence]] for over thirty years. The first publication covering these topics was written by social psychologist [[Serge Moscovici]] and published in 1976.<ref>  Mucchi-Faina, A., Pacilli, M. G., & Pagliaro, S. (2010). Minority Influence, Social Change, and Social Stability. Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 4(11), 1111–1123. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00314.x</nowiki></ref> Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority. Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups, the level of consistency of the minority group, and situational factors (such as the affluence or social importance of the minority).<ref name="Moscovici">Moscovici, S. and Nemeth (1974) Minority influence. In C. Nemetn (ed.), Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations (pp. 217–249), Chicago:Rand McNally</ref> Minority influence most often operates through [[informational social influence]] (as opposed to [[normative social influence]]) because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wood, W.|author2=Lundgren, S.|author3=Ouellette, J.|author4=Busceme, S.|author5=Blackstone, T.|year=1994|name-list-style=amp|title=Minority Influence: A Meta-Analytic Review of Social Influence Processes|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=115|number=3|pages=323–345|pmid=8016284|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.3.323}}</ref>

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===
{{Main article|Self-fulfilling prophecy}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between [[belief]] and [[behavior]]. A prophecy declared as truth (when it is actually false) may sufficiently influence people, either through fear or logical confusion, so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy. This term is credited to [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] from an article he published in 1948.<ref name=SFP-48>{{Citation

}}</ref>
===Social contagion===
{{Main article|social contagion}}
Social contagion involves the spontaneous spread of behaviors or emotions through a group, population or social network. Unlike conformity, the emotion or behavior being adopted may not represent a social norm.<ref name ="OSI2017" >{{cite book

===Reactance===
{{Main article|Reactance (psychology)}}
Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept, perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms. This phenomenon has also been called ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]''. While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended, the reactive behavior is a result of [[social pressure]].<ref name="Brehm">Brehm, J. W. (1966). A theory of psychological reactance. Academic Press</ref> It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean ''independence''. In many studies, reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence, even if the influence is clearly correct.<ref name="Frager">{{cite journal | last1 = Frager | first1 = R | year = 1970 | title = Conformity and anti-conformity in Japan | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0029434}}</ref>

===Obedience===
{{Main article|Obedience (human behavior)}}
Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure, based on order or command.<ref>  Gibson, S. (2019). Obedience without orders: Expanding social psychology’s conception of “obedience.” British Journal of Social Psychology, 58(1), 241–259. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12272</nowiki></ref> The [[Milgram experiment]], Zimbardo's [[Stanford prison experiment]], and the [[Hofling hospital experiment]] are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience, and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures.

===Persuasion===
{{Main article|Persuasion}}
Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means. US psychologist [[Robert Cialdini]] defined six "weapons of influence": [[norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], commitment, [[social proof]], [[authority]], liking, and [[scarcity]] to bring about conformity by directed means. Persuasion can occur through [[Reason|appeals to reason]] or [[Appeal to emotion|appeals to emotion]].<ref name="Cialdini">Cialdini, Robert B. (2001). ''Influence: Science and practice (4th ed.)''. Boston: Allyn & Bacon. {{ISBN|0-321-01147-3}}</ref>

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main article|Psychological manipulation}}
Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.<ref name=braiker>{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-07-144672-3}}</ref> By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.
 
Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to [[persuade]] patients to change unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

===Abusive power and control===
{{Main article|Abusive power and control}}
Controlling abusers use various tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The goal of the abuser is to control and [[intimidate]] the victim or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship.<ref name="Cory p. 30">Jill Cory; Karen McAndless-Davis.

[[File:Save freedom of speech. Buy war bonds.jpg|thumb|Photo: Buy war bonds]]

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is information that is not [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using [[loaded language]] to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.<ref name="brit_BLS">{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Bruce L. | author-link = Bruce Lannes Smith | title = Propaganda | website = britannica.com | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | date = 17 February 2016 | url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda | access-date = 23 April 2016 }}</ref>

===Hard power===
{{Main article|Hard power}}
Hard power is the use of [[military]] and [[economics|economic]] means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of [[political power]] is often aggressive ([[coercion]]), and is most effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or [[economic power]].<ref name=hard>{{cite web|title=Hard Power Vs. Soft Power|url=http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|publisher=The Mark|access-date=26 April 2012|author=Daryl Copeland|date=Feb 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501050956/http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|archive-date=1 May 2012}}</ref>  Hard power contrasts with [[soft power]], which comes from [[diplomacy]], [[culture]] and [[history]].<ref name=hard/>

== Antecedents ==
Many factors can affect the impact of social influence.

===Social impact theory===
{{Main article|Social impact theory}}
Social impact theory was developed by [[Bibb Latané]] in 1981. This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Latané | first1 = B | year = 1981 | title = The psychology of social impact | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 343–356 }}</ref>

*''Strength'': The importance of the influencing group to the individual
*''Immediacy'': Physical (and temporal) proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt
*''Number'': The number of people in the group

===Cialdini's "weapons of influence"===
[[Robert Cialdini]] defines six "weapons of influence" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader:<ref name="Cialdini" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://conceptually.org/concepts/6-principles-of-influence/ |title=What are the 6 principles of influence? |website=conceptually.org |access-date= October 25, 2017}}</ref>
*[[norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]]: People tend to return a favor.
*[[Promise|Commitment]] and [[consistency]]: People do not like to be self-contradictory. Once they commit to an idea or behavior, they are averse to changing their minds without good reason.
*[[Social proof]]: People will be more open to things that they see others doing. For example, seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sussman, R.|author2=Gifford, R.|name-list-style=amp|year=2013|title=Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places|journal=Environment & Behavior|volume=45|issue=3|pages=323–343|doi=10.1177/0013916511431274|s2cid=46022154|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0de18b4adf6b128027a3f4c0bc8d757426f20421}}</ref>
*[[Authority]]: People will tend to obey authority figures.
*Liking: People are more easily swayed by people they like.
*[[Scarcity]]: A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand.

===Unanimity===
Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed. Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence. For example, in Milgram's first set of [[Milgram experiment|obedience experiments]], 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer "maximum shocks" to a confederate. In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks (two of whom were confederates), once one confederate disobeyed, only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks.<ref name=ObedStudy>{{cite journal|last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=371–378 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717013242/http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-17 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 |citeseerx=10.1.1.599.92 }} [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf Full-text PDF.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611105753/http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf |date=June 11, 2011 }}</ref>

=== Status ===
{{Main article|Appeal to authority}}
{{See also|Reputation}}
Those perceived as [[experts]] may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise. This involves [[credibility]], a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust. People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons, such as perceived experience, attractiveness, knowledge, etc. Additionally, pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group. This phenomenon is known as [[groupthink]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/books/05deba.html?scp=5&sq=Shiller%20groupthink&st=cse Ivory Tower Unswayed by Crashing Economy]. ''New York Times''.</ref> Appeals to authority may especially effect norms of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous [[Milgram experiment]] demonstrate the [[Power (social and political)|power]] of perceived authority.

Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public. For example, a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public. This is often referred to as using the "[[bully pulpit]]." Likewise, celebrities don't usually possess any political power, but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and, therefore, possess [[social status]].

Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another. A person who possesses more authority (or is perceived as being more powerful) than others in a group is an icon or is most "popular" within a group. This person has the most influence over others. For example, in a child's school life, people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children.<ref>C. Mugny; L Souchet; C Codaccioni; A Quiamzade (2008). Social Representation and Social Influence. 53 (2), pp. 223–237.</ref>

=== Culture ===

[[Culture]] appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group. [[Stanley Milgram]] found that conformity was higher in [[Norway]] than in [[France]].<ref>Blass, T. (2004). The man who shocked the world: The life and legacy of Stanley Milgram. New York: Basic Books.</ref> This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility, compared to France's cultural focus on individualism. Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity. However, a 1970 [[Asch conformity experiments|Asch-style study]] found that when alienated, Japanese students were more susceptible to ''anticonformity'' (giving answers that were ''incorrect'' even when the group had collaborated on ''correct'' answers) one third of the time, significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past.<ref name="Frager" />

While [[gender]] does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform, under certain conditions  [[gender roles]] do affect such a likelihood. Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men. But a 1971 study found that [[experimenter bias]] was involved; all of the researchers were male, while all of the research participants were female. Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders. Furthermore, men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics, and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics. In other words, ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to [[informational social influence|"social proof"]].<ref>Sistrunk, Frank; McDavid, John W.; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 17(2), Feb, 1971. pp. 200–207.</ref>

=== Emotions ===
{{Main article|Appeal to emotion}}
Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity.<ref name="Brehm" /> In 2009, a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group, while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group.<ref>EurekAlert. (2009). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/uom-for032309.php Fear or romance could make you change your mind, U of Minnesota study finds].</ref>

== Social structure ==

===Social networks===
{{Main article|Social network analysis}}
A [[social network]] is a [[social structure]] made up of nodes (representing individuals or organizations) which are connected (through ''ties'', also called ''edges'', ''connections'', or ''links'') by one or more types of interdependency (such as friendship, common interests or beliefs, sexual relations, or kinship). [[Social network analysis]] uses the lens of [[network theory]] to examine [[social relationships]]. Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence. For example, [[Nicholas A. Christakis|Christakis]] and [[James H. Fowler|Fowler]] found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity,<ref name="content.nejm.org">{{cite journal | last1 = Christakis | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Fowler | first2 = J.H. | year = 2007 | title = The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network Over 32 Years | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 4| pages = 370–379 | doi=10.1056/nejmsa066082 | pmid=17652652| citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.4893 }}</ref> smoking,<ref name="J.H.
