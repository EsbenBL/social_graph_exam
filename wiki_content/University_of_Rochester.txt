==History==
[[File:RushRheesLibraryInWinterObliqueFromLeft.jpg|thumb|The facade of [[Rush Rhees Library]]]]

=== Early history ===
The University of Rochester traces its origins to The First Baptist Church of Hamilton (New York), which was founded in 1796. The church established the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York, later renamed the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution, in 1817.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstbaptistchurchhamilton.org/history.html|title=History|website=First Baptist Church|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206005848/http://www.firstbaptistchurchhamilton.org/history.html|archive-date=December 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This institution gave birth to both [[Colgate University]] and the University of Rochester. Its function was to train clergy in the Baptist tradition. When it aspired to grant higher degrees, it created a collegiate division separate from the [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|theological division]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/2308|title=University of Rochester History: Chapter 2, Hamilton vs. Rochester: RBSCP|website=rbscp.lib.rochester.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129081808/https://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/2308|archive-date=November 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Colgate origins">{{cite web |title=Origins of Colgate University |url=http://www.colgate.edu/about/colgates-origins |publisher=Colgate University |access-date=4 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201004020/https://www.colgate.edu/about/colgates-origins |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>
 
The collegiate division was granted a charter by the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] in 1846, after which its name was changed to Madison University.<ref name="Colgate origins" /> John Wilder and the Baptist Education Society urged that the new university be moved to Rochester, New York. However, legal action prevented the move. In response, dissenting faculty, students, and trustees defected and departed for Rochester, where they sought a new charter for a new university.

Madison University was eventually renamed as Colgate University.<ref name="Colgate origins" />

=== Founding ===
[[Asahel C. Kendrick]], professor of Greek, was among the faculty that departed Madison University for Rochester. Kendrick served as acting president while a national search was conducted. He reprised this role until 1853, when [[Martin Brewer Anderson]] of the [[Andover Newton Theological School|Newton Theological Seminary]] in [[Massachusetts]] was selected to fill the inaugural posting.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/2309|title=University of Rochester History: Chapter 3, The Year of Decisions: 1850 RBSCP| website= rbscp.lib.rochester.edu | language=en|access-date=2017-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205143618/http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/2309|archive-date=December 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The University of Rochester's new charter was awarded by the Regents of the State of New York on January 31, 1850. The charter stipulated that the university have $100,000 in endowment within five years, upon which the charter would be reaffirmed. An initial gift of $10,000 was pledged by John Wilder, which helped catalyze significant gifts from individuals and institutions.<ref name=":2" />

Classes began that November, with approximately 60 students enrolled, including 28 transfers from Madison.<ref name=":2" /> From 1850 to 1862, the university was housed in the old United States Hotel in downtown Rochester on Buffalo Street near Elizabeth Street, today, West Main Street near the [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] overpass. On a February 1851 visit, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] said of the university:<blockquote>''<nowiki>'They had bought a hotel, once a railroad terminus depot, for $8,500, turned the dining room into a chapel by putting up a pulpit on one side, made the barroom into a Pythologian Society's Hall, & the chambers into Recitation rooms, Libraries, & professors' apartments, all for $700 a year. They had brought an omnibus load of professors down from Madison bag and baggage... called in a painter and sent him up the ladder to paint the title "University of Rochester" on the wall, and they had runners on the road to catch students. And they are confident of graduating a class of ten by the time green peas are ripe.''</nowiki>''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_r_AwAAQBAJ&q=ralph+waldo+emerson+journal+university+of+rochester+hotel+ladder&pg=PA422|title=An Uneasy Solitude: Individual and Society in the Work of Ralph Waldo Emerson|last=Gonnaud|first=Maurice|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400858903|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>For the next 10 years, the college has expanded its scope and secured its future through an expanding endowment, student body, and faculty. In parallel, a gift of 8 acres of farmland from local businessman and Congressman [[Azariah Boody]] secured the first campus of the university, upon which Anderson Hall was constructed and dedicated in 1862. Over the next sixty years, this Prince Street Campus grew by a further 17 acres and was developed to include fraternities houses, dormitories, and academic buildings including Anderson Hall, Sibley Library, Eastman and Carnegie Laboratories, the [[Memorial Art Gallery]], and Cutler Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/2312|title=University of Rochester History: Chapter 6: A Critical Decade RBSCP|website=rbscp.lib.rochester.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205143600/http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/2312|archive-date=December 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Twentieth century===
==== Coeducation ====
The first female students were admitted in 1900, the result of an effort led by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Helen Barrett Montgomery]]. During the 1890s, a number of women took classes and labs at the university as "visitors" but were not officially enrolled nor were their records included in the college register. President [[David Jayne Hill]] allowed the first woman, Helen E. Wilkinson, to enroll as a normal student, although she was not allowed to matriculate or to pursue a degree. Thirty-three women enrolled among the first class in 1900, and Ella S. Wilcoxen was the first to receive a degree, in 1901.<ref name="May, Arthur J. 1977">May, Arthur J. (1977) ''A History of the university of Rochester'', Princeton: Princeton University</ref> The first female member of the faculty was [[Elizabeth Denio]] who retired as Professor Emeritus in 1917. Male students moved to River Campus upon its completion in 1930 while the female students remained on the Prince Street campus until 1955.

==== Expansion ====
[[File:BenjaminRushRhees1902.jpg|thumb|The university saw expansion under the tenure of president [[Benjamin Rush Rhees]]]]
Major growth occurred under the leadership of [[Benjamin Rush Rhees]] over his 1900-1935 tenure.

====Financial decline and name change controversy====
Following the princely gifts given throughout his life, George Eastman left the entirety of his estate to the university after his death by suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V52/PDF/V52-N15.pdf|title=Eastman dies by own hand|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810114423/http://tech.mit.edu/V52/PDF/V52-N15.pdf|archive-date=August 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The total of these gifts surpassed $100 million, before inflation, and, as such, Rochester enjoyed a privileged position amongst the most well endowed universities.

In response, the University commissioned a study to determine if the name of the institution should be changed to "Eastman University" or "Eastman Rochester University". The study concluded a name change could be beneficial because the use of a place name in the title led respondents to incorrectly believe it was a public university, and because the name "Rochester" connoted a "cold and distant outpost." Reports of the latter conclusion led to controversy and criticism in the Rochester community. Ultimately, the name "University of Rochester" was retained.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19860217&id=rAkhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TXIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1098,70161] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101194032/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19860217&id=rAkhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TXIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1098,70161 |date=January 1, 2016 }}, University of Rochester Urged to Change Name</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19860419&id=_mxJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pQoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3151,5556624] What's in a Name?

In 2019 students from [[China]] mobilized by the [[Chinese Students and Scholars Association]] (CSSA) defaced murals in the University’s access tunnels which had expressed support for the [[2019 Hong Kong Protests]], condemned the oppression of the Uighurs, and advocated for Taiwanese independence. The act was widely seen as a continuation of [[overseas censorship of Chinese issues]]. In response a large group of students recreated the original murals, there have also been calls for Chinese government run CSSA to be banned from campus.<ref>{{cite web |last1=AGYARE-KUMI |first1=EFUA |title=UR becomes battleground in China, Hong Kong conflict |url=https://www.wxxinews.org/post/ur-becomes-battleground-china-hong-kong-conflict |website=www.wxxinews.org |publisher=WXXI |access-date=5 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205181103/https://www.wxxinews.org/post/ur-becomes-battleground-china-hong-kong-conflict |archive-date=December 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Campuses==
=== River Campus ===
The '''River Campus''' is in a bend of the [[Genesee River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of downtown Rochester and covers around {{convert|200|acre}}. It is bounded by Bausch & Lomb Riverside Park, an {{convert|18|acre|adj=on}} public park along the east bank of the Genesee River formerly known as the [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmstead]] River Walk, and [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester|Mount Hope Cemetery]], where the grave sites of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Frederick Douglass]] can be found. The River Campus was acquired in the late 1920s from the Oak Hill Country Club through a land swap deal orchestrated in part by Edwin Sage Hubbell and funded largely by George Eastman.

Sculpted by Marc Mellon and unveiled on October 10, 2009 during Meliora Weekend.]] -->

After a period of landscaping, grading, and construction, the original buildings of the campus were dedicated in 1930 when the first class of River Campus were welcomed to the Men's college. The main academic buildings are examples of the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style in 20th century collegiate architecture. The main buildings situated upon the [[George Eastman|Eastman Quadrangle]] are [[Rush Rhees Library]] at the head, flanked by the Morey Hall, Bausch & Lomb Hall, Lattimore Hall, and Dewey Hall. The Rush Rhees Library, the unofficial symbol of the university, is also home to the [[List of carillons#Eastern United States|Hopeman Memorial Carillon]], the largest carillon in New York State, featuring 50 bells that chime on the quarter-hour. During the summer, the carillon features a recital series in which various artists perform on the instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sas.rochester.edu/mur/carillon/faq.html|title=FAQ : Hopeman Memorial Carillon : University of Rochester|website=www.sas.rochester.edu|access-date=February 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218061328/http://www.sas.rochester.edu/mur/carillon/faq.html|archive-date=February 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Just off the quadrangle, in parallel, are Strong Auditorium and the Simon School of Business with the Interfaith Chapel opposite the Library. A Marc Mellon bronze of George Eastman was placed on the quadrangle in 2009.

Over the course of the last several decades, other academic buildings have been built south of the Eastman Quad, including Gavett Hall (dedicated with the Eastman Quad in 1930), Harkness Hall (1946), Hoyt Hall (1962), the Hopeman Engineering Building (1963), and Meliora Hall (1972). The southernmost part of the River Campus contains the new Science and Engineering Quadrangle: Wilmot Building (1961), Hylan Building (1971), Hutchison Hall (1972), the Computer Studies Building and Carlson Library (1987), the [[Robert B. Goergen]] Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics (2007), and Wegmans Hall for the Goergen Institute for Data Science (2017) and the department of Computer Science. LeChase Hall (2013) and the Ronald Rettner Hall for Media Arts and Innovation (2013) were added to the north of the Eastman Quad on the Wilson Quadrangle behind Lattimore Hall and Morey Hall, respectively.<ref>[http://www.rochester.edu/maps/river_campus/index.html Interactive Map of the River Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916131307/http://www.rochester.edu/maps/river_campus/index.html |date=2009-09-16 }}</ref>

{{main|Memorial Art Gallery}}

The university's first permanent campus was at the former farm of [[Azariah Boody]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V71N6/feature1.html|title=Rochester Review :: University of Rochester|website=www.rochester.edu|access-date=2018-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414010342/https://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V71N6/feature1.html|archive-date=April 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> While a number of buildings still stand including Anderson Hall, the Eastman Laboratories, and a number of student dormitories, these buildings have been absorbed by private companies or the Rochester School of the Arts. The university retains control of a few acres of land including the land under the Sibley Library (razed), old campus gates, the Memorial Art Gallery old and new wings, and the Culter Union, a prime example of the [[Collegiate Gothic]] style of 20th century architecture.

The Memorial Art Gallery was founded in 1913 as a part of the University of Rochester through a gift from [[Emily Sibley Watson]] as a memorial to her son, James George Averell.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/magnumopusstoryo00bray|title=Magnum opus : the story of the Memorial Art Gallery, 1913-1988|last=Elizabeth.|first=Brayer|date=1988|publisher=The Gallery|isbn=9780918098023|edition=1st|location=Rochester, N.Y.|oclc=18496839|url-access=registration}}</ref> It was designed by the prominent American architectural firm [[McKim, Mead & White|McKim, Mead, and White]] and occupies the southern half of the university's Prince Street campus.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000606566|title=College architecture in America and its part in the development of the campus|last1=Klauder|first1=Charles Zeller|last2=Wise|first2=Herbert Clifton|date=1929|publisher=C.

==Academics==
[[File:Campus view at the University of Rochester.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Lattimore Hall on the main quadrangle]]

The University of Rochester's [[undergraduate]] enrollment includes approximately 5,800 full-time and about 200 part-time students from across the U.S. and over 115 countries.<ref>[http://enrollment.rochester.edu/admissions/living/diversity.shtm Diversity at Rochester, Office of Admissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507123325/http://enrollment.rochester.edu/admissions/living/diversity.shtm |date=2007-05-07 }}</ref> Graduate enrollment includes approximately 3,900 full-time and about 1,100 part-time [[graduate student]]s.
The university has more than 103,000 living alumni and employs nearly 2,300 tenure-track faculty, with more than 20,000 faculty and staff across the university and the Strong Health System.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.rochester.edu/aboutus/|work=University of Rochester|publisher=University of Rochester|access-date=18 February 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IGhMB8oK?url=http://www.rochester.edu/aboutus/|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The only required undergraduate course is the first year writing seminar. In lieu of a core curriculum, undergraduates complete coursework in each of three disciplines: [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], and [[natural sciences]]. Students choose a major, consisting of more than ten courses, and a cluster, consisting of three related courses. The student must ensure at least a cluster is met in each discipline; however, second majors and minors are often used to fulfill these requirements. Students who pursue [[ABET|accredited]] [[engineering]] fields including [[biomedical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[electrical engineering|electrical and computer engineering]] or [[mechanical engineering]], are exempt from this system and are only required to have one humanities or social science cluster.
[[File:Science building at the University of Rochester.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Hylan Hall, home of the mathematics department]]
Rochester offers juniors and seniors the opportunity to apply for full funding for a fifth year of study. These programs include '''Take Five Scholars''' program and the '''Kauffman Entrepreneurial Year''' ('''KEY''') '''Scholarship'''. "Take-Five" and "Key", as they are colloquially known, allow for study in a field unrelated to an undergraduate major or the pursuit of an innovative entrepreneurial project with an impact on the local area, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/TakeFive/ |title=Take Five Scholars Program |access-date=2009-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006091833/http://www.rochester.edu/College/CCAS/TakeFive/ |archive-date=2009-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/ccas/handbook/e5.html|title=e5 Program : College Center for Advising Services : University of Rochester|website=www.rochester.edu|access-date=February 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212011636/http://www.rochester.edu/college/ccas/handbook/e5.html|archive-date=February 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The University further offers a number of combined undergraduate - graduate tracks. These include [[University of Rochester Medical Center|Rochester Early Medical Scholars]] (REMS), Rochester Early Business Scholar (REBS), Graduate Engineering At Rochester (GEAR), and Guaranteed Rochester Accelerated Degree in Education (GRADE) programs. These programs are open to prospective students, who must apply for these prior to entering the university.<ref>[http://enrollment.rochester.edu/admissions/learning/programs.shtm Combined Admissions Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001065551/http://enrollment.rochester.edu/admissions/learning/programs.shtm |date=2012-10-01 }}</ref>

The official mascot of the university is a predatory wasp found throughout Rochester, the [[Yellowjacket]]. From 1983 to 2008, the yellowjacket mascot was named "URBee." However, when the university re-designed the mascot during the 2007–2008 academic year, a new name was chosen and as of February 1, 2008, the school's mascot is now known as "Rocky".<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3100|title=New University of Rochester Yellowjacket to Debut Feb. 1|website=http|access-date=February 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311112635/http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3100|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Residences===
The majority of undergraduate students at the university live and take classes on the River Campus. Underclassmen are generally required to live on campus while upperclassmen have the option to live off campus. Some graduate housing is provided by the university, but a significant number also live off campus. Housing is provided at multiple locations spread across the several campuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/reslife/|title=Residential Life : University of Rochester|website=www.rochester.edu|access-date=February 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212011612/http://www.rochester.edu/reslife/|archive-date=February 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''River Campus'''
River Campus residences house primarily undergraduates, with some graduate students serving as Graduate Head Residents (GHRs). Residences include:
[[File:Fraternity quad and flag at the University of Rochester.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Fraternity quadrangle]]
*'''Fraternity Quadrangle''' consists of nine houses, including six fraternities ([[Alpha Delta Phi]], [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], [[Psi Upsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]); in addition, two special interest housing groups—the Douglass Leadership House and the Drama House—maintain housing here.
*'''Freshman Housing''' - Consists of Susan B. Anthony Halls (Gannett, Gates, Hollister, and Morgan), near Rush Rhees Library, Hoeing Hall, Tiernan Hall, Gilbert Hall, and Lovejoy Hall which are on the Residence Quad. Freshmen live together in these specially designated residences that feature increased supervision, regulation, and residence-related activities by upperclassmen Dandelions (affectionately known as D'Lions) and Freshman Fellows, along with Residential Advisers in living areas.
*'''Hill Court''' - Upperclass housing consisting of Chambers, Fairchild, Gale, Kendrick, Munro, and Slater houses, which are connected by tunnels. This residence area, opened in 1969, is colloquially known as "Phase" and was the newest residential area on the River Campus prior to the construction of the Riverview Complex.
*'''Residence Quad (ResQuad)''' - Consists of Burton, Lovejoy and Crosby Halls for upperclassmen, as well as Hoeing, Gilbert, Tiernan and Lovejoy Halls for freshmen. Burton and Crosby were the original dormitories on the River Campus, constructed in 1930, while the other four were built during the 1950s. All ResQuad buildings were fully renovated in the 1990s. (Lovejoy Hall is mostly upperclassmen but has included a freshman floor due to an increase in enrollment.)
*'''River Campus Towers''' - Consists of O'Brien Hall, and Anderson and Wilder Towers. It houses upperclassmen and several Special Interest Housing groups. The formal name for the area is '''Jackson Court''' (formerly known as "Founders Court"), but it is simply called "Towers" by most students. Built in 1962, they are scheduled to undergo extensive renovations in the near future. O'Brien Hall opened up to students in 2012.
*'''Southside''' - Southside consists of the Valentine and deKiewiet Towers, as well as several single-story house-style "maisonettes", which offer apartment style living to upperclassmen. The residences are south of the River Campus near the medical center, but house River Campus undergraduate students. The campus master plan shows that this complex will eventually be razed.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}
*'''Riverview''' - The only housing complex on the western side of the [[Genesee River]], Riverview opened for the 2008–2009 school year, making it the first addition to the campus's housing in nearly 40 years. The complex consists of five buildings, which can house up to 400 undergraduates. The complex is made up of fully furnished two-to-four person apartments.

Special Interest floors and Fraternity floors also exist within the residence halls. Special Interest Housing groups include Greenspace (Burton 1), Tiernan Project (Burton 2), Inter-Class Living Community (Crosby 1), [[Delta Upsilon]] (Wilder 3), [[Sigma Delta Tau]] (Wilder 4), [[Chi Omega]] (Wilder 5), [[Kappa Delta]] (Wilder 6), Music Interest Floor (Wilder 9), Computer Interest Floor (Anderson 3), Anime Interest Floor (Anderson 7), Phi Kappa Tau (Munro 1), Alpha Phi (Munro 2), Sigma Nu (Kendrick 1), Phi Sigma Sigma (Kendrick 2), Alpha Epsilon Pi (Gale 2), Delta Gamma (Fairchild 2), and [[Gamma Phi Beta]] (Fairchild 1).

'''Eastman School of Music Campus'''
Housing is provided at the [[Eastman School of Music]] campus at the '''Eastman Student Living Center''' at 100 Gibbs Street in downtown Rochester. The new building was opened in 1991 at the northeast corner of Main and Gibbs Streets, replacing the University Avenue dormitories built nearly 70 years earlier. It is a four-story quadrangle and 16-story tower surrounding a landscaped inner courtyard.

'''URMC and Mount Hope Campuses'''
Graduate student housing is provided at several locations near the URMC. These facilities also house select River Campus, non-traditional students who have been deemed too old for traditional housing.

*'''George Washington Goler House''' ('''GHS''') immediately adjacent to the grounds of the URMC. It is a high-rise apartment building with 321 apartments. The building also houses university community members, including faculty and staff.
*'''University Park''' ('''UPK''') is a complex of two-story buildings that include 40 studio, 86 one-bedroom, and 80 two-bedroom unfurnished apartments. UPK is near the URMC, directly across from Southside off of Kendrick Road. Graduate students and their families are the primary occupants of these apartments, but some non-traditional undergraduate students are housed here who have been deemed too old for traditional undergraduate housing on the River Campus. Students who live here typically take up residence year round.

'''South Campus'''
The South Campus has graduate student housing at the '''Whipple Park''' ('''WPK''') complex, which features 250 garden apartments and townhouses with ample storage space. WPK also features a park-like setting with large wooded and lawn areas, playgrounds, areas for gardens and low street noise. Some housing is also provided at the '''River Road''' complex, which tends to serve as overflow housing for both undergraduate and graduate students.

===Students' Association===
The '''Students' Association (SA)''' is the primary student governing body and includes most of the student groups at UR. It is governed by the SA Senate, President and Vice President, all of whom are elected by the student body. The SA President may choose to appoint an advisory cabinet made up of a group of volunteer students. There is also a judicial branch, composed of the All Campus Judicial Council (ACJC), the members of whom are nominated by an interview committee and approved by the SA Senate. The SA Senate meets weekly and the longest meeting on record lasted longer than 8 hours. The offices of the SA are in the Wilson Commons student union.<ref>[http://sa.rochester.edu/studentgov/ SA Student Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223075241/http://www.sa.rochester.edu/studentgov/ |date=2007-02-23 }}</ref>

All student groups are required to have a constitution, elected officers, and approval from senate in order to be recognized by the SA and have access to university funds. These funds are given yearly based on budgets submitted to the Students' Association Appropriation Committee (SAAC)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sa.rochester.edu/sa/saac/ |title=Rochester.edu |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129161125/http://sa.rochester.edu/sa/saac/ |archive-date=2016-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with supplemental funds available through special forms. All funds are derived from the mandatory Student Activities Fee.

===Campus and area transportation===
[[File:Shuttle bus at the University of Rochester.jpg|thumb|right|Parking is restricted on campus; here a shuttle bus takes parents and prospective students from a distant lot for campus tours.]]
{{See also|Rochester, New York#Transportation}}
The UR campuses have their own University-sponsored system of buses, or shuttles, which provide free transportation from the River Campus to the Medical Center, South Campus, Eastman Campus, and Riverview. There are also lines that run between the River Campus and local shopping and entertainment in [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]] and [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford]]. On the weekends, a shuttle loops to the Rochester [[Public Market]]. Most of the University-sponsored buses are named using a color system (i.e. Red Line) that indicates their respective route and allows for easy identification. Several bus lines of the [[Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTS) also make stops at the University.

The university participates in the [[Zipcar]] program, which allows students to rent cars on an hourly or daily basis.<ref name=tws08janxxx>{{cite news|title= University of Rochester students, faculty, and staff can join Zipcar|quote= Members age 18-20 can use a dedicated group of Zipcars that live on campus...|publisher= zipcar|date= 2010-01-08|url= http://www.zipcar.com/rochester/|access-date= 2010-01-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091215031053/http://www.zipcar.com/rochester/|archive-date= December 15, 2009|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=tws08janyyy>{{cite news|title= Zipcars|quote= How Does Zipcar Work?|publisher= University of Rochester|date= 2010-01-08|url= http://www.rochester.edu/parking/zipcars.html|access-date= 2010-01-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084851/http://www.rochester.edu/parking/zipcars.html|archive-date= December 17, 2009|url-status= live}}</ref>

=== Formal academic events ===
'''[[Convocation]]''' celebrates the start of the academic year and provides the opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to come together. The ceremony opens with a processional by faculty and administrators in traditional [[regalia]], features presentation of the Goergen Awards for contributions to undergraduate education, and is accompanied by a picnic, activities fair and performances.

'''Commencement''' is the formal end of the academic year. The university community gathers for a large ceremony of the Eastman Quadrangle. Members of the Board of Trustees, the President of the University, the President of the Senior Class, and a speaker selected by the administration offer [[Commencement speech|remarks and advice]]. Degrees are then conferred at separate ceremonies by school and department.

=== University community weekends ===
'''Yellowjacket Weekend''' directly follows Freshman Orientation. With the entire student body reunited, this weekend serves as the first official welcome to the Fall semester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sa.rochester.edu/sao/ccw/yjw/|title=Yellowjacket Weekend 2011|website=sa.rochester.edu|access-date=2013-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126042932/http://sa.rochester.edu/sao/ccw/yjw/|archive-date=2014-11-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Various musical groups or performers have headlined the festivities, including [[Jason Derulo]] in a virtual Fall 2020 concert.

'''Meliora Weekend''' combines [[homecoming]], [[class reunion]]s, and family weekend. Events run from Thursday through Sunday and unite all campuses through common programming and events. The keynote is given each Saturday morning in [[Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre|Kodak Hall]] at the Eastman School. Past keynote speakers include [[Amartya Sen]], [[Anderson Cooper]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Sanjay Gupta]], [[Robert Gates|Bob Gates]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], former [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]], and former [[United States Secretary of Energy]] and University of Rochester alumnus [[Steven Chu]].

'''Winterfest Weekend''' is the kickoff to the second semester and allows students to bask in the snowy Rochester winters. Highlights of the weekend include comedic performances (previous comedians include [[Demetri Martin]], [[B.J. Novak]] and [[Michael Ian Black]]), sleigh rides and ice skating.

'''Dandelion Day''', colloquially known as '''D-Day''', was a Saturday late in the spring semester established as an annual respite around final exams with extensive celebrations, recently accompanied by a carnival and musical guests. Previous years have featured Super Mash Bros., [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Eve 6]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]], [[OK Go]], and [[AJR (band)|AJR]]. In 2012, D-Day was moved from Saturday to Friday and has since been rebranded as the start of Springfest Weekend in an effort by the administration to refocus the event from revelry and debauchery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.campustimes.org/2012/02/16/ur-to-hold-dandelion-day-2012-on-friday/|title=Dandelion Day 2012 set for weekday - Campus Times|date=2012-02-16|work=Campus Times|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222054145/http://www.campustimes.org/2012/02/16/ur-to-hold-dandelion-day-2012-on-friday/|archive-date=December 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Boar's Head Feast ===
In 1934, the men of the River Campus held the first Boar's Head Dinner. While the women of Prince Street moved to the River Campus in 1955, the event remained single gender until 1971 when women joined the men in 17th century garb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rochester.edu/aboutus/traditions.html|title=Traditions at the University of Rochester|website=www.rochester.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216083024/http://www.rochester.edu/aboutus/traditions.html|archive-date=December 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This [[Boar's Head Feast|yearly feast]] was begun at Queen's College Oxford; the University of Rochester's variation on this theme includes performances by university a cappella, circus arts, and performance groups. The student body selects one faculty member each year to tell the story of the student and the boar. While each raconteur takes their own poetic liberties, the arc is the same: the wayward student in the forest defeats the boar with their calculus textbook.

=== Wilson Day ===
Wilson Day, named for university benefactor [[Joseph C. Wilson (entrepreneur)|Joseph C. Wilson]], is a day of community service for all incoming university students which includes working on neighborhood picnics, voter registrations, painting, landscaping, meal service, and various other service efforts in the community.
