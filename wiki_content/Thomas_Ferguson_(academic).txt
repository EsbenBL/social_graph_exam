==Investment theory of party competition==
{{details|Investment theory of party competition}}
Ferguson is best known for his ''investment theory of party competition'', which was detailed most extensively in his 1995 book ''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems''. The theory states that political systems featuring party competition are best understood as competitions for investment from wealthy segments of society. This is because political campaigns are expensive, and so political parties whose policies are most attractive to wealthy 'investors' will tend to be more successful as they are better able to attract the finances required to win election campaigns.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Golden Rule : The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems|url=https://archive.org/details/goldenruleinvest00ferg|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226243176}}</ref>

The theory contrasts with the [[median voter theorem]], which states that the outcome of elections will be the preferences of the median voter as political parties converge on the 'center ground' as they compete for votes.

In 2009, the documentary ''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Politics'' about the theory was released, it featured speakers including Thomas Ferguson, [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Michael Albert]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Politics|url=https://gb.imdb.com/title/tt1851943/|website=IMDb|access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>

==MIT controversy== 
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], Ferguson was warned while at MIT that his research might get him denied [[tenure (academic)|tenure]] in the political science department. In Chomsky's account, Ferguson was told "If you ever want to get tenure in this department, keep away from anything after the [[New Deal]]; you can write all of your radical stuff up to the New Deal, but if you try and do it for the post-New Deal period, you're never going to get tenure in this department." Although not explicitly mentioned, the research was ostensibly the [[investment theory of party competition]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chomsky |first1=Noam |editor-last1=Mitchell |editor-first1=Peter R. |editor-last2=Schoeffel |editor-first2=John|title=Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky |publisher=Vintage |date=2003 |isbn=0099466066}}</ref>
