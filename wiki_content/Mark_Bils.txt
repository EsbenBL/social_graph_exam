'''Mark Bils''' (December 1, 1958) is a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomist]] at the [[University of Rochester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5568606|title=Shopping for the Consumer Price Index|date=19 July 2006|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=9 May 2011}}</ref> Bils obtained his PhD in economics from [[MIT]] in 1985 and BA in economics from [[Ohio State University]] in 1979. He has taught at the University of Chicago GSB and is currently professor and chair of the Department of Economics at the University of Rochester.

In 1987, Bils published ''The Cyclical Behavior of Marginal Cost and Price'' in the [[American Economic Review]] where he argued that [[marginal cost]] is [[procyclical]]. This is driven from the [[counterintuitive]] fact that [[employment]] is high when [[wages]] are high. Thus, Bils argues, an increase untrained [[Labour (economics)|labor]] must increase [[marginal costs]] (in the same way an increase in [[demand]] increases wages). He is in the top 5% of most cited economists.
