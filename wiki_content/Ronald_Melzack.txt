'''Ronald Melzack''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|OQ|FRSC}} (July 19, 1929 &ndash; December 22, 2019) was a Canadian [[psychologist]] and professor of psychology at [[McGill University]].<ref name="Obituary">{{Cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.remembering.ca/obituary/ronald-melzack-1078144704/|title=Remembering the life of Ronald Melzack 1929 - 2019|website=montrealgazette.remembering.ca|access-date=Jan 8, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/science/ronald-melzack-dead.html|title=Ronald Melzack, Cartographer of Pain, Is Dead at 90|first=Benedict|last=Carey|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Jan 12, 2020|access-date=Jan 8, 2021}}</ref> In 1965, he and [[Patrick David Wall]] revolutionized{{According to whom|date=April 2020}} pain research by introducing the [[gate control theory]] of pain. In 1968, Melzack published an extension of the gate control theory, in which he asserted that pain is subjective and multidimensional because several parts of the brain contribute to it at the same time. During the mid-1970s, he developed the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]] and became a founding member of the [[International Association for the Study of Pain]]. He also became the founding editor of ''[[Wall & Melzack's Textbook of Pain]]''

Melzack has received numerous honors including [[Prix du Québec]] (1994), the [[Order of Canada]] (1995), and the [[National Order of Quebec]] (2000). In 2010, he won the [[Grawemeyer Award]] for  his research on the science of pain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Melzack, Stanovich win Grawemeyer awards|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/02/grawemeyer.aspx|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|access-date=27 April 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Melzack was born in Montreal, the son of Joseph Melzack, who worked in a clothing factory and opened a second-hand bookstore. He grew up in a working-class Jewish neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://maisonneuve.org/article/2002/11/18/mastering-pain/|title=Mastering the Pain|first=Michael|last=Gliserman|date=Nov 18, 2002|website=Maisonneuve|access-date=Jan 8, 2021}}</ref> Due to financial constraint, Ron was the only sibling in his family to attend university. His brothers worked in the family bookstore known as "Classic Bookshops" which became a successful chain. He received his M.Sc. from McGill in 1951 and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1954. [[Donald O. Hebb]] was Melzack's research advisor at university during the time he worked on his doctoral thesis. Hebb was doing experiments with dogs who had not been normally socialized and Melzack became interested in their unusual response to pain when they would stick their nose in a flame repeatedly.<ref name="cdnmedhall.org">[http://www.cdnmedhall.org/dr-ronald-melzack]{{dead link|date=January 2021}}</ref>

==Career ==
After studying for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1954 with Hebb at McGill University in [[Montreal]], he began to work with patients who suffered from "[[phantom limb]]" pain — people who feel [[pain]] in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that pain often has little survival value, and some pains are entirely out of proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuing long after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoral student, Melzack began collecting "pain words" and putting them into classes that belonged together, like "hot," "burning," "scalding," and "searing".

In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Melzack R.|title=The McGill Pain Questionnaire: major properties and scoring methods|journal=Pain |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=277–99 |date=Sep 1975 |pmid=1235985 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(75)90044-5|s2cid=20562841}}</ref> now used in pain clinics and [[cancer]] hospices around the world. Melzack spent time at the [[University College of London]], and the [[University of Pisa]] in Italy. He eventually became a faculty member at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) where he met Dr. Patrick Wall. The two shared similar thoughts and ideas surrounding the phenomenon of pain. Melzack and Wall noticed that some individuals felt immense pain when damage to the body was minimal, and some people with traumatic injuries experienced little or no pain until a later time.<ref>[http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/GCPWS/Melzack/Biography/Melzack_bio3.htmlhttp://www.cdnmedhall.org/dr-ronald-melzack]{{dead link|date=January 2021}}</ref>

In 1965 at [[MIT]], Melzack and Wall developed the [[Pain#Gate control|gate control theory of pain]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Melzack R, Wall PD|title=Pain mechanisms: a new theory|journal=Science |volume=150 |issue=3699 |pages=971–9 |date=Nov 1965 |pmid=5320816 |doi=10.1126/science.150.3699.971|bibcode=1965Sci...150..971M}}</ref> which states that pain is "gated" or modulated by past experience. Gate control theory led to the valuable discovery of [[endorphin]]s and [[enkephalin]]s, the body's natural [[opiate]]s. He is also noted for work on stress-induced analgesia, phantom-limb pain and the theory of neuromatrix.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Melzack R|title=Pain and the Neuromatrix in the Brain|journal=J Dent Educ |volume=65 |issue=12 |pages=1378–82 |date=Dec 2001 |doi=10.1002/j.0022-0337.2001.65.12.tb03497.x|pmid=11780656 }}</ref> He proposes that we are born with a genetically determined neural network that generates the perception of the body, the sense of self, and can also generate chronic pain, even when no limbs are present.<ref name="cdnmedhall.org"/>

Melzack's recent research at McGill indicates that there are two types of pain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathways in the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such as the pain of cutting a finger, is transmitted by a group of pathways that Melzack calls the "lateral" system, because they pass through the [[brain stem]] on one side of its central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic back pain, is transmitted by the "medial" system, whose [[neuron]]s pass through the central core of the brain stem.

In 1974, Melzack co-founded the first pain clinic in Canada at the Montreal General Hospital with Dr. Joseph Stratford (then Chief of Neurosurgery at the hospital and who was the medical director of the pain clinic). Melzack served as Research Director from 1974 to 2000.  The clinic became part of the McGill University Health Centre which has grown to be one of the best organized centres for pain treatment in the world. Melzack also supervised graduate students at McGill, one of whom —[[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]]— would later go on to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2014.

==Recognition==
Melzack was a founding member of the [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] (IASP) and a past president as well as an honorary life member.  Melzack was a Member of the [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]]. He was also elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1982), holds two Canadian honorary degrees, and was the first recipient of the E.P. Taylor Chair in Pain Studies at McGill (1986).<ref name="cdnmedhall.org"/> He is the author of several [[textbook]]s on pain, and was co-editor of ''Handbook of Pain Assessment'', 1992. He has also published books of [[Inuit]] stories and won the [[Canada Council Molson Prize]] in 1985.

He received the Prix du Québec for research in pure and applied science (1994), recognizing him as a laureate of the highest honor for a scientist in his home province.<ref name="qprn.ca">{{Cite web|url=https://qprn.ca/fr/membre-honoraire/|title=Membre honoraire|website=Réseau québécois de recherche sur la douleur|access-date=Jan 8, 2021}}</ref> In 1995, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. Melzack has been honoured with a Killam Prize (2001). On April 29, 2009, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame, in recognition of his “outstanding contributions to medical science and the improved health and well-being of people everywhere.”<ref>http://publications.mcgill.ca/headway/magazine/the-king-of-understanding-pain-qa-with-ronald-melzack/ {{dead link|date=September 2021}}</ref> Melzack was the recipient of the 2010 [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in psychology for his studies and explanation of experiencing pain.<ref name=grawemeyer.org>{{Cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/scientist-who-helps-explain-pain-wins-grawemeyer-award/|title=Scientist who helps explain pain wins Grawemeyer Award – Grawemeyer Awards|access-date=Jan 8, 2021}}</ref> The International Association for the study of pain created the Ronald Melzack Lecture Award in 2010, in recognition of Melzack's exceptional contributions to the field of pain research.<ref>[http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?q=melzack&x=9&y=9]{{dead link|date=January 2021}}</ref> In 2011, he wrote the foreword of a Ronald Melzack special issue about the influence of the Melzack's works on
