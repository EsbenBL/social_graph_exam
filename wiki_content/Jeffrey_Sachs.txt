== Academic career ==
=== Harvard University ===
In 1980, Sachs joined the Harvard faculty as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1982. A year later at the age of 28, he became a professor of economics with tenure at Harvard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Columbia gets Star Professor from Harvard|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 April 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/nyregion/columbia-gets-star-professor-from-harvard.html|last1=Uchitelle|first1=Louis}}</ref>

=== Columbia University ===
Professor Sachs serves as the Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. He is University Professor at Columbia University. From 2002 to 2016, Sachs served as director of the [[Earth Institute]] of Columbia University,<ref name="UCL"/><ref name="CSD"/> a university-wide organization of more than 850 professionals from natural science and social science disciplines with a common mission to address complex issues facing the Earth, in support of sustainable development. Sachs's classes are taught at the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] and the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]], and his course "Challenges of Sustainable Development" is taught at the undergraduate level.<ref>{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Program in Sustainable Development|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2594|access-date=2017-11-24|archive-date=2017-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222213941/http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2594|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Sachs has consistently advocated for the expansion of university education on sustainable development. He helped to introduce the PhD in sustainable development at Columbia University, one of the first PhD programs of its kind in the United States and championed the new{{when|date=April 2021}} Masters of Development Practice (MDP) which led to a consortium of major universities around the world offering the new degree. The Earth Institute also guided the adoption of sustainable development as a new major at Columbia College.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

== Scholarship and commentary ==

=== Bolivia ===
When Bolivia was shifting from a dictatorship to a democracy through national elections in 1985, Sachs was invited by the party of Bolivian dictator [[Hugo Banzer]] to advise him on an anti-inflation economic plan to implement once he was voted to office. This stabilization plan centered around price deregulation, particularly for oil, along with cuts to the national budget. Sachs stated that his plan could end Bolivian hyperinflation which had reached up to 14,000% in a single day.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Economic Possibilities for Our TimeThe End of Poverty|last = Sachs|first = Jeffrey D.|publisher = Penguin|year = 2005|location = New York|pages = 90–93}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=April 2021}} Although Banzer ultimately lost the race to the party of former elected president and traditionally developmentalist [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], Sachs's plan was still implemented through plans that excluded most of Paz's cabinet. Inflation quickly stabilized in Bolivia.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Unsettling Statecraft: Democracy and Neoliberalism in the Central Andes|last = Conaghan and Malloy|publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press|year = 1994|location = Pittsburgh|page = 198}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Dallas Morning News|last = Bridges|first = Tyler|date = June 29, 1987|work = Bolivia Turns to Free Enterprise Among Hard Times}}</ref>

When Sachs began advising Bolivia, it was the poorest country in South America and had an annual inflation rate of 24,000 percent. His suggestion for reducing inflation was to apply fiscal and monetary discipline and end economic regulation that protected the elites and blocked the free market. [[Hyperinflation]] reduced within weeks of the Bolivian government instituting his suggestions and the government settled its large debt to international lenders for about 11 cents on the dollar.<ref name="nyt270693" />

=== Advising in post-communist economies ===
Sachs has worked as an economic adviser to governments in [[Latin America]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. A practice trained [[macroeconomist]], he advised a number of national governments in the transition from [[Marxism–Leninism]] or [[developmentalism]] to market economies.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In 1989, Sachs advised Poland's [[anticommunist]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and the government of Prime Minister [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]. He wrote a comprehensive plan for the transition from [[Soviet-type economic planning|central planning]] to a [[market economy]] which became incorporated into Poland's reform program led by Finance Minister [[Leszek Balcerowicz]]. Sachs was the main architect of Poland's debt reduction operation. Sachs and IMF economist David Lipton advised the rapid conversion of all property and assets from public to private ownership. Closure of many uncompetitive factories ensued.<ref name="Hardy 2009">{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Jane|title=Poland's New Capitalism|year=2009|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London}}</ref> In Poland, Sachs was firmly on the side of rapid transition to capitalism. At first, he proposed American-style corporate structures, with professional managers answering to many shareholders and a large economic role for stock markets. That did not bode well with the Polish authorities, but he then proposed that large blocks of the shares of privatized companies be placed in the hands of private banks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doug Henwood |url=http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Sachs.html |title=Left Business Observer #111, August 2005 |publisher=Leftbusinessobserver.com |access-date=2014-02-19|author-link=Doug Henwood }}</ref> As a result, there were some economic [[shortages]] and [[inflation]], but prices in Poland eventually stabilized.<ref name="Foreign Affairs">{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Sachs and David Lipton |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19900601faessay5998/jeffrey-sachs-david-lipton/poland-s-economic-reform.html |title=Lipton, David and Sachs, Jeffrey.

Sachs's ideas and methods of transition from central planning were adopted throughout the transition economies. He advised [[Slovenia]] (1991) and [[Estonia]] (1992) in the introduction of new stable and convertible currencies. Based on Poland's success, he was invited first by Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and then by Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] on the transition to a market economy. He served as adviser to Prime Minister [[Yegor Gaidar]] and Finance Minister Boris Federov during 1991–1993 on macroeconomic policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} Sachs' methods for stabilising economies became known as [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] and were similar to successful approaches used in Germany after the two world wars.<ref name="nyt270693" /> When Russia fell into poverty after adopting his market-based shock therapy in the early 1990's, some Western media called him cold-hearted [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]].<ref name="ds101120">{{cite web |last1=Bidder |first1=Benjamin |title=Economist Jeffrey Sachs on the U.S. After the Election |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/economist-jeffrey-sachs-on-the-u-s-after-the-election-a-18b6cc82-8db3-48e9-a55e-85a87c042b0d |website=www.spiegel.de |access-date=25 April 2021 |language=en |date=10 November 2020}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Marangos|first=John|title=The Shock Therapy Process of Transition|date=2013|url=https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137327260_5|work=Consistency and Viability of Islamic Economic Systems and the Transition Process|pages=139–186|editor-last=Marangos|editor-first=John|place=New York|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137327260_5|isbn=978-1-137-32726-0|access-date=2021-05-03}}</ref>

=== Work on global economic development ===
More recently,{{when|date=April 2021}} Sachs has turned to global issues of [[economic development]], [[poverty alleviation]], [[health policy|health and aid policy]] and [[environmental sustainability]]. He has written extensively on [[climate change]], [[public health|disease control]] and [[globalization]]. Since 1995, he has been engaged in efforts to alleviate [[poverty in Africa]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

[[File:Sachs at UN.jpg|thumb|Sachs at a UN meeting in 2009]]
In his 2005 work ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Sachs wrote that "Africa's governance is poor because Africa is poor". According to Sachs, with the right policies and key interventions, [[extreme poverty]]—defined as living on less than $1 a day—can be eradicated within 20 years. India and China serve as examples, with the latter lifting 300 million people out of extreme poverty during the last two decades. Sachs has said that a key element to accomplishing this is raising aid from $65 billion in 2002 to $195 billion a year by 2015. He emphasizes the role of geography and climate as much of Africa is landlocked and disease-prone. However, he stresses that these problems can be overcome.<ref name="UNMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/who/sachs.htm|title=United Nations Millennium Project, 2006|publisher=Unmillenniumproject.org|date=2007-01-01|access-date=2014-02-19|archive-date=2014-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527233014/http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/who/sachs.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=July 2015}}

Sachs suggests that with improved seeds, irrigation and fertilizer, the [[crop yields]] in Africa and other places with [[subsistence farming]] can be increased from 1 ton per hectare to 3 to 5 tons per hectare. He reasons that increased harvests would significantly increase the income of subsistence farmers, thereby reducing poverty. Sachs does not believe that increased aid is the only solution. He also supports establishing [[microcredit|credit and microloan programs]] which are often lacking in impoverished areas.<ref name="UUNCDF">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncdf.org/english/microfinance/pubs/newsletter/pages/2005_04/news_sachs.php |title=Booth, Mindy.

The economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion per year. Sachs estimates that malaria can be controlled for $3 billion per year, therefore suggesting that anti-malaria projects would be an economically justified investment.<ref name="Medical News Today">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/74907.php|title=Medical News Today, 2007|publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com|date=2007-06-24|access-date=2014-02-19|archive-date=2011-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510114901/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/74907.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Millennium Villages Project]] (MVP) which he directs operates in more than a dozen African countries and covers more than 500,000 people. The MVP has created controversy because critics have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success. In 2012, ''[[The Economist]]'' reviewed the project and concluded "the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2012/05/jeffrey-sachs-and-millennium-villages?zid=295&ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0|title=Jeffrey Sachs and the millennium villages: Millennium bugs|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 May 2012|access-date=September 10, 2015}}</ref> Critics have pointed to the failure to include suitable controls that would allow an accurate determination of whether the MVP methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 ''Lancet'' paper claiming a three-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology and the authors later admitted that the claim was "unwarranted and misleading".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/24/does-it-take-a-village|title=Does It Take a Village?|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref>

Sachs works closely with the [[Islamic Development Bank]] to scale up programs of integrated rural development and sustainable agriculture among the bank's member countries. One such project supports pastoralist communities in Eastern Africa, with six participating nations, namely [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[South Sudan]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, Sachs was among the leading academic scholars and practitioners on the MDGs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} He chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–2001) which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5 and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] in 2000–2001 to design and launch [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].<ref name="Mountains Beyond Mountains">{{cite book|last1=Kidder|first1=Tracy|title=Mountains Beyond Mountains|url=https://archive.org/details/mountainsbeyond000kidd|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/mountainsbeyond000kidd/page/257 257]|isbn=9780375506161}}</ref> He also worked with senior officials of the [[George W. Bush administration]] to develop the PEPFAR program to fight [[HIV/AIDS]] and the PMI to fight [[malaria]]. On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the [[UN Millennium Project]] which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005. The recommendations for rural Africa are currently{{when|date=April 2021}} being implemented and documented in the MVP and in several national scale-up efforts such as in Nigeria.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Previously a special adviser to secretary-general [[António Guterres]],<ref name="UCL"/><ref name="Shaw"/> Sachs is an advocate for the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals which build upon and supersede the MDGs.

== Critical reception ==
===Economics===
Sachs's economic philosophies have been the subject of both praise and criticism. [[Nina Munk]], author of the 2013 book ''The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty'', says that, although well intended, poverty eradication projects endorsed by Sachs have years later "left people even worse off than before".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/09/10/the-quest-to-end-poverty-nina-munk/ |title=Anna Maria Tremonti, "The Quest to End Poverty: Nina Munk", CBC Radio, 2013-09-10 |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2013-09-10 |access-date=2014-02-19 |archive-date=2014-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227000044/http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/09/10/the-quest-to-end-poverty-nina-munk/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Vice2020">{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxqb74/celebrated-rwanda-based-nonprofit-faces-harrowing-misconduct-accusations |title=Celebrated Rwanda-Based Nonprofit Faces Harrowing Misconduct Accusations|first=Leah |last=Feiger |date=August 13, 2020 |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}</ref>

[[William Easterly]], a professor of economics at [[New York University]], reviewed ''[[The End of Poverty]]'' for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', calling Sachs' poverty eradication plan "a sort of [[Great Leap Forward]]".<ref name="WPost">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25562-2005Mar10.html |title=A Modest Proposal |work=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-03-13 |access-date=2014-02-19}}</ref> According to Easterly's cross-country statistical analysis in his book ''The White Man's Burden'', from 1985 to 2006, "When we control both for initial poverty and for bad government, it is bad government that explains the slower growth. We cannot statistically discern any effect of initial poverty on subsequent growth once we control for bad government. This is still true if we limit the definition of bad government to corruption alone." Easterly deems the massive aid as proposed by Sachs to be ineffective, as its effect will be hampered by bad governance and/or [[corruption]].<ref name="Easterly Easterly 2006">{{cite book | last1=Easterly | first1=W. | last2=Easterly | first2=W.R. | title=The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good | publisher=[[Penguin Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-59420-037-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Iw5IZCTh-kC | access-date=April 23, 2021 | page=}}</ref>

Commenting on Sachs' $120 million effort to aid Africa, American travel writer and novelist [[Paul Theroux]] says these temporary measures failed to create sustained improvements. Theroux focuses on a project in a sparsely populated community of [[nomadic]] camel herders in Dertu, [[Kenya]], funded by Sachs' Millennium Villages Project, which cost {{USD|2.5}} million over a three-year period. Theroux says that the project's [[latrine]]s were clogged and overflowing, the dormitories it built quickly became dilapidated, and the livestock market it established ignored local customs and was shut down within a few months. He says that an angry Dertu citizen filed a 15-point written complaint against Sachs' operation, claiming it "created dependence" and that "the project is supposed to be bottom top approached but it is visa {{sic}} versa."<ref name="barr_Africa's_Aid">{{Cite web |title=Africa's Aid Mess |last=Theroux |first=Paul |newspaper=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date=November 30, 2013 |access-date=April 25, 2021 |url= https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424053111903747504579185800700741812}}</ref>

===China===
In December 2018, [[Huawei]] [[Chief Financial Officer]] [[Meng Wanzhou]] was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S., which was seeking her extradition to face charges of allegedly violating [[sanctions against Iran]]. Soon after Meng's arrest, Sachs wrote an article in which he said her arrest was part of efforts to contain China and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for seeking her extradition. He wrote that none of the executives of several U.S. companies which had been fined for sanctions violations were arrested. After he was criticised for the article, Sachs closed his [[Twitter]] account, which had 260,000 followers.<ref name="bloo_Columbia's_Jeffrey">{{Cite web|author=|date=January 1, 2019|title=Columbia's Jeffrey Sachs Quits Twitter After Criticism of Huawei Article|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-02/columbia-s-sachs-quits-twitter-after-criticism-of-huawei-article|access-date=April 23, 2021|agency=[[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref> Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at [[Asia Society]], noted that Sachs had written a foreword to a Huawei [[position paper]], and questioned whether Sachs had been paid by Huawei.
