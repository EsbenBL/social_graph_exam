She was a pioneer in the academic study of [[small power]]s and [[middle power]]s and the books and articles she wrote on that subject are highly regarded in the field.  She was director of the institute's Canadian Studies Program from 1977 to 1984.

==Life and career==
Annette May Baker was born and raised in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name="gt-obit">{{cite news | url=http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Service-to-remember-longtime-volunteer-3419154.php | title=Service to remember longtime volunteer | newspaper=[[Greenwich Time (newspaper)|Greenwich Time]] | date= March 19, 2012}}</ref>  She attended the [[Buffalo Seminary]], an all-girls preparatory school.<ref name="gt-obit" />

In 1930 she entered [[Wellesley College]], but after two years was looking for a place with a greater research impact, and transferred to the [[University of Chicago]], where [[political science]] was undergoing a transformation to a modern social science.<ref name="gt-obit" />  She earned a B.A. there in 1934.<ref name="siwps-abf">{{cite news |url=http://www.siwps.com/news/the-institute-mourns-the-passing-of.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121221065234/http://www.siwps.com/news/the-institute-mourns-the-passing-of.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 21, 2012 |title=The Institute Mourns the Passing of Annette Baker Fox |publisher=[[Arnold A.

Meanwhile, she had met [[William T. R. Fox]] during her first year at Chicago, who was also a Ph.D. student there.<ref name="gt-obit" /><ref name="wtrf-nyt-obit" />  They married in 1935.<ref name="gt-obit" />  The couple raised two children together,<ref name="wtrf-nyt-obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/25/obituaries/william-t-r-fox-76-professor.html | title=William T.

In a two-career couple, she was what later would become known as the [[trailing spouse]].

Dunn]], she switched her area of study from [[public administration]] to international relations.<ref name="preface-essay" />  There she published her first book, ''Freedom and Welfare in the Caribbean: A Colonial Dilemma'', in 1949.<ref name="puw-51" />  It examined the post-World War II move to independence and modernization by ex-colonial states and the resulting political and economic problems and conflicts.

In 1950, her husband left Yale to go to [[Columbia University]].<ref name="wtrf-nyt-obit" />  In 1951, she became a part-time research associate at Princeton's new [[Center of International Studies]], which was founded by a number of scholars who had left the Yale Institute.<ref name="puw-51" />  She remained there until 1957.  She then became a lecturer in international relations at [[Hunter College]],<ref name="siwps-abf" /> teaching there from 1958 to 1961.  She also taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]],<ref name="siwps-abf" /> serving as a visiting political scientist there in 1962.

In 1963, she joined [[Columbia University]]'s [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]] as a research associate.<ref name="siwps-abf" />  Her husband was the founding director of the institute, which had been created in 1951.<ref name="wtrf-nyt-obit" />  During her time there, she also lectured at Columbia's [[Barnard College]]<ref name="siwps-abf" /><ref name="nyt-csp" /> during the years 1966–79.  In addition she became a senior lecturer at Columbia University as well.  But Fox was known most for her research and writing.

In 1959, she published her book ''The Power of Small States: Diplomacy in World War II'', which examined the role that [[small power]]s play in international relations by looking at how several small European countries conducted diplomacy during the war.  It was a departure from the usual focus in the field on the interactions that take place between great powers.<ref name="gt-obit" />   Fox looked in detail at Turkey, Spain, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and analyzed and grouped them by the kind of security problems they faced and by the fate of their foreign policies.<ref name="chubin-zabih" />  She developed theories as to why some such states had done better than others, such as: that geographical distance from the straight line between belligerents is helpful; and somewhat counter-intuitively, that having two great powers interested in a small state is better for it than having just one being interested.<ref name="chubin-zabih" /><ref>{{cite book | title=Weak States in the International System | first=Michael I. | last=Handel | publisher=[[Frank Cass]] | edition=2nd | location=London | year=1990 <!--isbn=0-7146-3385-2--> | page=72}}</ref>  The book has been termed a "pioneering" study by several subsequent scholars<ref name="chubin-zabih">{{cite book | title=The Foreign Relations of Iran: A Developing State in a Zone of Great-power Conflict | url=https://archive.org/details/foreignrelations0000chub | url-access=registration | first=Shahram | last=Chubin | first2=Sepehr | last2=Zabih | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=Berkeley, California | year= 1974 <!--isbn=0-520-02683-7--> | pages=[https://archive.org/details/foreignrelations0000chub/page/29 29]–32, 45}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Small Powers in Alignment | first=Omer | last=de Raeymaeker | publisher=[[Leuven University Press]] | location= Leuven, Flanders | year= 1974 | page=15}}</ref> as well as a "classic".<ref name="steinmetz-wivel">{{cite book | title=Small States in Europe: Challenges and Opportunities | editor2-first=Anders | editor2-last=Wivel | editor-first=Robert | editor-last=Steinmetz | publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] | location=Farnham, Surrey | year= 2010 <!--isbn= --> | page=217 | first2=Anders | last2=Wivel | first=Robert | last=Steinmetz | chapter=Conclusion}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Portugal, the U.S. and NATO | first=Luc | last=Crollen | publisher=[[Leuven University Press]] | location= Leuven, Flanders | year=1973 | page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Foreign Policy Behavior of Caribbean States: Guyana, Haiti, and Jamaica | first=Georges A. | last=Fauriol | publisher=[[University Press of America]] | location=Lanham, Maryland | year=1984 <!--isbn=0819136719--> | page=7}}</ref>  In related published work, she examined the Cold War prospects of small states and the role that the United Nations could play with respect to them.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/02/07/119096264.pdf | title=In the Diplomat's Pouch Is Also the Destiny of Man | first=Samuel Flagg | last=Bemis | author-link=Samuel Flagg Bemis | newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]] | date=February 7, 1960 | page=BR3}}</ref>

Fox's work also addressed the characteristics of [[middle power]]s, and her 1977 book, ''The Politics of Attraction: Four Middle Powers and the United States'', discussed U.S. relations with Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.<ref name="mahant-mount" />  In the words of a subsequent scholar, it made her a "pioneer" in the comparative study of Australia and Canada as middle powers.<ref name="macmillan-mckenzie">{{cite book | title=Parties Long Estranged: Canada and Australia in the Twentieth Century | editor-first=Margaret | editor-last=MacMillan | editor-link=Margaret MacMillan | editor2-first=Francine | editor2-last=McKenzie | publisher=[[UBC Press]] | location=Vancouver | year=2003 <!--isbn=0-7748-0976-0--> | pages=4, 10n, 272}}</ref>  The book argued that the relationships between middle powers and great powers reveal more intricate behaviors and bargaining schemes than previous literature had assumed.<ref name="fa-morse">{{cite news | url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/30997/edward-l-morse/the-politics-of-attraction-four-middle-powers-and-the-united-sta | title=The Politics of Attraction: Four Middle Powers and the United States | first=Edward L. | last=Morse | author-link=Edward L.

One reviewer praised her "careful analysis" in the work.<ref name="fa-morse" />  Other scholars followed up on her work while exploring the area of Canadian and Australian experiences;<ref name="macmillan-mckenzie" /> the book was also used as a starting point by scholars exploring American policy towards Canada.<ref name="mahant-mount">{{cite book | title=Invisible and Inaudible in Washington: American Policies Towards Canada During the Cold War | first=Edelgard | last=Mahant | author-link=Edelgard Mahant | first2=Graeme S. | last2=Mount | author-link2=Graeme S.

In addition to her books, she published over thirty articles in scholarly journals.<ref name="siwps-abf"/>  She also engaged in a number of joint authorships with her husband on academic work,<ref name="wtrf-nyt-obit"/> including the 1967 book ''NATO and the Range of American Choice'', which sought to identify desirable choices for the alliance that were politically feasible.  As she later remarked drily, these efforts were "happily completed without the collaboration ending in divorce."<ref name="preface-essay">{{cite book | title=The Evolution of Theory in International Relations | editor-first=Robert L. | editor-last=Rothstein | publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]] | location=Columbia, South Carolina | year=1991 | pages=iii–vi | first=Annette Baker | last=Fox | chapter=Preface }}</ref>

Despite the level of her scholarship, Fox suffered from building an academic career as a married woman with children in the 1940s and 1950s, when such a path was not at all the norm.<ref name="gt-obit"/>  She was never offered [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] or a tenure-track position.<ref name="gt-obit"/>  Indeed, Columbia's Department of Political Science would not have its first female tenured professor until the 1980s.<ref name="abf-hist">{{cite web | url=http://saltzman.obiki.org/about.attachment/fox-manuscript/Fox%20Manuscript%201.pdf | title=The Institute of War and Peace Studies: The First Thirty-Five Years | first=Annette Baker | last=Fox | publisher=[[Columbia University]] | year=2001 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003934/http://saltzman.obiki.org/about.attachment/fox-manuscript/Fox%20Manuscript%201.pdf | archive-date=2013-12-03 }} <!-- This document is linked to from the institute's "About Us" page --></ref>

She was, however, director of the institute's Canadian Studies Program from 1977 to 1984.<ref name="siwps-abf"/>  This program made use of a quarter-million-dollar grant from the [[William H. Donner Foundation]] for fellowships, expanded courses, and faculty exchanges.<ref name="nyt-csp">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/12/27/83709533.pdf | title=Columbia Is Given $236,000 For Canadian Studies Program | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 27, 1976 }}</ref>

In addition to her own works, Fox served with [[Richard Howard]] as co-translators from the French for [[Raymond Aron]]'s ''Peace and War: A Theory of International Relations'', published in 1966.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/01/06/82557599.pdf | title=Listing of New Books | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 6, 1967}}</ref>  She also wrote an internal history of the institute's first thirty-five years.<ref name="siwps-abf"/>

Anne Fox (as she was informally known) and her husband were residents of the [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside neighborhood]] of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] from 1950 on and she was active in the First Congregational Church of Old Greenwich.<ref name="gt-obit"/>  She was active in the [[League of Women Voters]] and as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in local politics, serving three terms  on Greenwich's [[representative town meeting]] and serving on the town's charter revision committee while in her early nineties.<ref name="gt-obit"/>

She died at her home in Riverside on December 26, 2011, at age 99.<ref name="gt-obit"/>
