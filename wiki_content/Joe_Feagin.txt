Other notable books:
*In 2014, he published a book about Asian Americans with Rosalind S. Chou titled ''Myth of the Model Minority: Asian Americans Facing Racism'' (2nd ed., Paradigm Publishers, 2014). The second edition of this popular book adds important new research on how racial stereotyping is gendered and sexualized. New interviews show that Asian American men feel emasculated in America’s male hierarchy. Women recount their experiences of being exoticized, subtly and otherwise, as sexual objects. The new data reveal how race, gender, and sexuality intersect in the lives of Asian Americans. The text retains all the features of the renowned first edition, which offered the first in-depth exploration of how Asian Americans experience and cope with everyday racism. The book depicts the “double consciousness” of many Asian Americans—experiencing racism but feeling the pressures to conform to popular images of their group as America’s highly achieving “model minority.” <ref>{{cite web|author=Civil Rights |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1612054781 |title=Myth of the Model Minority: Asian Americans Facing Racism, Second Edition: Rosalind S. Chou, Joe R. Feagin: 9781612054780: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref>
*In 2007 he finished a book titled ''Two-Faced Racism: Whites in the Backstage and Frontstage'' with Leslie Houts Picca (Routledge, 2007). Two-Faced Racism examines and explains the racial attitudes and behaviours exhibited by whites in private settings. While there are many books that deal with public attitudes, behaviours, and incidences concerning race and racism (frontstage), there are few studies on the attitudes whites display among friends, family, and other whites in private settings (backstage). The core of this book draws upon 626 journals of racial events kept by white college students at twenty-eight colleges in the United States. The book seeks to comprehend how whites think in racial terms by analyzing their reported racial events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415954762 |title=Two-Faced Racism: Whites in the Backstage and Frontstage: Leslie Picca, Joe Feagin: 9780415954761: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref>
*In 1996, he published ''The Agony of Education: Black Students at a White University'' with Hernan Vera and Nikitah Imani (Routledge, 1996). The Agony of Education is about the life experience of African American students attending a historically white university. Based on seventy-seven interviews conducted with black students and parents concerning their experiences with one state university, as well as published and unpublished studies of the black experience at state universities at large, this study captures the painful choices and agonizing dilemmas at the heart of the decisions African Americans must make about higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415915120 |title=The Agony of Education: Black Students at a White University: Joe R.
