'''Herbert Gintis''' (born February 11, 1940) is an American [[economist]], [[behavioral scientist]], and educator known for his theoretical contributions to [[sociobiology]], especially [[altruism]], [[cooperation]], epistemic [[game theory]], [[gene-culture coevolution]], [[efficiency wages]], [[strong reciprocity]], and [[human capital]] theory. Throughout his career, he has worked extensively with economist [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]]. Their landmark book, ''[[Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|Schooling in Capitalist America]]'', has had multiple editions in five languages since it was first published in 1976. Their most recent book, ''A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and its Evolution'' was published by Princeton University Press in 2011.

==Life and career==
Gintis was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] where his father had a retail furniture business. He grew up there and later in [[Bala Cynwyd]] (just outside Philadelphia).  Gintis completed his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in three years, one of which was spent at the [[University of Paris]], and received  his B.A. in mathematics in 1961. He then enrolled at [[Harvard University]] for post-graduate work in mathematics. After receiving his M.A. in 1962, he grew disillusioned with the subject area, and although still registered at Harvard, became a sandal maker with a shop in [[Harvard Square]]. During that time, he became very active in the student movements of the 1960s, including the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and grew increasingly interested in [[Marxism]] and economics. In 1963, he switched his PhD program at Harvard from mathematics to economics, completing his PhD in 1969 with his dissertation, ''Alienation and power: towards a radical welfare economics''. He was subsequently hired as an assistant professor in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] and then as an assistant professor and later associate professor in Harvard's Economics Department.<ref name = "Alberto">Alberto, Carlos Torres (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITaBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA107 ''Education, Power, and Personal Biography: Dialogues With Critical Educators''], pp. 107–129.

Towards the end of his postgraduate studies in economics, Gintis had come into contact with the economist [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] who had returned to Harvard after research work in Nigeria. It was to be the beginning of a collaboration that has lasted throughout their careers. In 1968 Gintis and Bowles were part of a group of graduate students and young faculty members at Harvard that included [[Michael Reich]], Richard Edwards, [[Stephen Marglin]], and Patricia Quick. The group held seminars to develop their ideas on a new economics that would encompass issues of [[alienation of labor]], racism, sexism, and imperialism. Many of their ideas were tried out in a Harvard class which they collectively taught, "The Capitalist Economy: Conflict and Power". They also became founding members of the [[Union of Radical Political Economists]].<ref name = "Arestis">{{cite book |title=A biographical dictionary of dissenting economists |last=Arestis |first=P. |author2=Sawyer, M.C. |year=2000 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-85898-560-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gi1-hW3cfo4C&pg=PA226|pages=226}}</ref><ref>Lee, Frederic (2009).

In 1974 Gintis, along with Bowles, [[Stephen Resnick]], [[Richard D.

Like Gintis's 2009 ''The Bounds of Reason'', the book reflects his increasing emphasis since the 1990s on the unification of economic theory with sociobiology and other behavioral sciences.<ref name = "Foster">Foster, Jacob G.

Gintis retired from the University of Massachusetts Amherst as [[professor emeritus]] in 2003. As of 2014, he remains a visiting professor in the Economics Department of [[Central European University]] where he has taught since 2005, visiting professor at the [[University of Siena]], a position he has held since 1989, and an external professor at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] where he has taught since 2001.<ref>[[Santa Fe Institute]].
