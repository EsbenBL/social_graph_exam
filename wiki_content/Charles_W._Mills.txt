Over his career, Mills published six books and over 100 articles.<ref name="taiwo2021" /> [[Shannon Sullivan]] argues that Mills's oeuvre can be understood through the concept of ''smadditizin'', a word Mills used in the title of a 1997 article. Sullivan, quoting Mills, describes ''smadditizin'' as "the struggle to have one's personhood ''recognized''" [emphasis in original]. She argues that, no matter whether he embraced [[Marxism]], Black radicalism, or racial liberalism, Mills's work opposed the non-recognition of persons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Shannon|author-link=Shannon Sullivan|date=2017|title=Smadditizin' Across the Years: Race and Class in the Work of Charles Mills|journal=[[Critical Philosophy of Race]]|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.5325/critphilrace.5.1.0001}}</ref> According to an obituary in ''[[CBC News]]'', Mills is regarded as a pioneer in [[critical race theory]] and the philosophy of [[Race (human categorization)|race]].<ref name="raza2021" /> Philosopher Christopher Lebron described him in ''[[The Nation]]'' as a "black [[Socrates]]".<ref name="smith2021" />

Mills's book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' (1997) won a [[Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award]] for the study of bigotry and human rights in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roberts|first=Neil|date=April 3, 2017|title=The Critique of Racial Liberalism: An Interview with Charles W.

Later in his career, according to [[Tommie Shelby]], Mills launched a sustained critique of [[John Rawls]]'s [[Social contract|contractarian]] theory of justice. Shelby notes that Mills rejected the Rawlsian turn to [[Ideal theory (politics)|ideal theory]] in political philosophy in favor of an approach that takes careful account of the realities of oppression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shelby|first=Tommie|author-link=Tommie Shelby|date=2013|title=Racial Realities and Corrective Justice|journal=Critical Philosophy of Race|volume=1|issue=2|pages=145–162|doi=10.5325/critphilrace.1.2.0145}}</ref> Despite his critique of Rawls, however, Mills came to endorse a version of liberalism in ''Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism'', suggesting that the history of liberalism reveals the dismantling of social hierarchies.<ref name=":1" /> Reviewing ''Black Rights/White Wrongs'' in [[Political Theory (journal)|''Political Theory'']], Ainsley LeSure observes that "[t]hough [Mills] acknowledges that racial justice need not be realized through the liberal tradition, he affirms that it can."<ref name=":2" />
