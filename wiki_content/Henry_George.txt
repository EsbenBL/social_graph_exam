'''Henry George''' (September 2, 1839 – October 29, 1897) was an American [[political economist]] and journalist. His writing was immensely popular in 19th-century America and sparked several reform movements of the [[Progressive Era]]. He inspired the economic philosophy known as [[Georgism]], the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from [[land (economics)|land]] (including [[natural resource]]s) should belong equally to all members of society. George famously argued that a [[single tax]] on land would create a more productive and just society.

His most famous work ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879) sold millions of copies worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=American History: Excerpt from Henry George Progress and Poverty 1879|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1876-1900/excerpt-from-henry-george-progress-and-poverty-1879.php|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-02|website=University of Groningen}}</ref> The treatise investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the [[business cycle]] with its cyclic nature of industrialized economies, and the use of rent capture such as [[land value tax]] and other anti-[[monopoly]] reforms as a remedy for these and other social problems. Other works by George defended [[free trade]], the [[secret ballot]], and public ownership of certain natural monopolies.

A journalist for many years, the popularity of his writing and speeches brought him to run for election as [[Mayor of New York City]] in [[1886 New York City mayoral election|1886]]<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=George, Henry |volume=11 |page=747}}</ref> as the [[United Labor Party (New York)|United Labor Party]] nominee and in [[New York City mayoral elections#1897 to 1913|1897]] as the Jefferson Democracy Party nominee, receiving 31 percent and 4 percent of the vote respectively and finishing ahead of former [[New York State Assembly]] [[Minority leader|Minority Leader]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the first race. After his death during the second campaign, his ideas were carried forward by organizations and political leaders through the United States and other Anglophone countries. The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist [[George Henry Soule Jr.|George Soule]] wrote that George was by far "the most famous American economic writer" and "author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written."<ref>Soule, George. ''Ideas of the Great Economists'' (1955) p. 81.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Henry George Birthplace.JPG|thumb|upright|Birthplace in Philadelphia]]
George was born in [[Philadelphia]] to a lower-middle-class family, the second of ten children of Richard S. H. George and Catharine Pratt George (née Vallance). His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout Episcopalian, and he sent George to the [[Episcopal Academy]] in Philadelphia. George chafed at his religious upbringing and left the academy without graduating.<ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' 1st. ed., s.v. "George, Henry," edited by Allen Johnson and Dumas Malone, Vol. VII (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931), pp. 211–212.</ref><ref>David Montgomery, ''American National Biography Online,'' s.v. "George, Henry," February 2000, http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00261.html Accessed September 3, 2011</ref> Instead he convinced his father to hire a tutor and supplemented this with avid reading and attending lectures at the [[Franklin Institute]].<ref name="ReferenceA">"American National Biography Online."</ref> His formal education ended at age 14, and he went to sea as a foremast boy at age 15 in April 1855 on the ''Hindoo'', bound for [[Melbourne]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. He ended up in the American West in 1858 and briefly considered prospecting for gold but instead started work the same year in San Francisco as a type setter.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In California, George fell in love with Annie Corsina Fox from Sydney, Australia. They met on her seventeenth birthday on October 12, 1860. She had been orphaned and was living with an uncle. The uncle, a prosperous, strong-minded man, was opposed to his niece's impoverished suitor. But the couple, defying him, eloped and married on December 3, 1861, with Henry dressed in a borrowed suit and Annie bringing only a packet of books.

The marriage was a happy one, and four children were born to them. On November 3, 1862 Annie gave birth to future [[United States Representative]] from New York, [[Henry George Jr.]] (1862–1916). Early on, even with the birth of future sculptor [[Richard F. George]] (1865–1912),<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/09/30/100550867.pdf Obituaries, New York Times, September 30, 1912],</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/31/104936447.pdf "Single Taxers Dine Johnson; Medallion Made by Son of Henry George Presented to Cleveland's Former Mayor"], ''The New York Times'' – May 31, 1910</ref> the family was near starvation. George's other two children were both daughters. The first was Jennie George, (c. 1867–1897), later to become Jennie George Atkinson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/05/04/100424035.pdf|title=Obituary – ''The New York Times'', May 4, 1897}}</ref> George's other daughter was [[Anna George de Mille|Anna Angela George]] (b. 1878), who would become mother of both future dancer and choreographer, [[Agnes de Mille]] and future actress [[Peggy George]], who was born Margaret George de Mille.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss11_bioghist.html|title=Finding aid to the Agnes De Mille papers SSC.MS.00046|first=Agnes|last=De Mille|website=asteria.fivecolleges.edu}}</ref>

Following the birth of his second child George had no work and no money and had to beg for food. As he approached the first well-dressed stranger he saw in the street, George, normally a lawful man, decided to rob him if he was unwilling to help. Fortunately, the man took pity on him and gave him five dollars.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Enemy of injustice : the life of Andrew MacLaren, Member of Parliament|last=Hill|first=Malcolm|date=1999|publisher=Othila Press|isbn=1901647196|location=London|oclc=42137055}}</ref>

George was raised as an Episcopalian, but he believed in "deistic humanitarianism". His wife Annie was [[Irish Catholic]], but [[Henry George Jr.]] wrote that the children were mainly influenced by Henry George's [[deism]] and [[humanism]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=How Henry George, Jr., Got into the Catholic 'Who's Who'|journal=The Fortnightly Review|date=1911|volume=18|page=704|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrUOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA704|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Montgomery |first1=David |title=George, Henry (1839–1897), economist and reformer. |date=February 2000}}</ref>

=== Career in journalism ===
[[File:Henry George.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George in 1865, age 26]]

After deciding against [[Placer mining|gold mining]] in British Columbia, George was hired as a printer for the newly created San Francisco ''Times''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Formaini |first1=Robert L. |title=Henry George Antiprotectionist Giant of American Economics |journal=Economic Insights of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas |volume=10 |issue=2 |url=http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/ei/ei0502.pdf |access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> He was able to immediately submit editorials for publication, including the popular ''What the Railroads Will Bring Us'',<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ahj1472.1-01.004|title=What the Railroad Will Bring Us |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=October 1868 |pages=297–306|first=Henry|last=George|journal=Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine}}</ref> which remained required reading in California schools for decades.  George climbed the ranks of the ''Times'', eventually becoming managing editor in the summer of 1867.<ref>Henry, George, Jr. ''[https://archive.org/details/lifehenrygeorge01georgoog The Life of Henry George]''. New York: Doubleday & McClure, 1900, chap. 11.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George, Henry |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Henry_George.aspx |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref>  George worked for several papers, including four years (1871–1875) as editor of his own newspaper, the ''San Francisco Daily Evening Post'', and for a time running the ''Reporter'', a Democratic anti-monopoly publication.<ref>Charles A. Barker, "Henry George and the California Background of ''Progress and Poverty''," ''California Historical Society Quarterly'' 24, no. 2 (Jun. 1945), 103–104.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' s.v.

"George, Henry," http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00261.html Accessed September 3, 2011.</ref>  George experienced four tough years of trying to keep his newspaper afloat and was eventually forced to go to the streets to beg. The George family struggled, but George's improving reputation and involvement in the newspaper industry lifted them from poverty.

===Political and economic philosophy===
George began as a [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but then became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. He was a strong critic of railroad and mining interests, corrupt politicians, land speculators, and labor contractors. He first articulated his views in an 1868 article entitled "What the Railroad Will Bring Us." George argued that the boom in railroad construction would benefit only the lucky few who owned interests in the railroads and other related enterprises, while throwing the greater part of the population into abject poverty. This had led to him earning the enmity of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]'s executives, who helped defeat his bid for election to the [[California State Assembly]].<ref name="anb.org" /><ref name="grundskyld.dk">Henry George, "What the Railroad Will Bring Us," ''Overland Monthly'' 1, no. 4 (Oct. 1868), http://www.grundskyld.dk/1-railway.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426080607/http://www.grundskyld.dk/1-railway.html |date=April 26, 2012 }} Accessed September 3, 2011.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' s.v. "George, Henry," 213.</ref>

One day in 1871 George went for a horseback ride and stopped to rest while overlooking [[San Francisco Bay]]. He later wrote of the revelation that he had:

{{quote|I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to say, what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off that they looked like mice, and said, "I don't know exactly, but there is a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre." Like a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with advancing wealth. With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.<ref>[[Albert Jay Nock|Nock, Albert Jay]]. [http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/nock_henry_george_01.html Henry George: Unorthodox American, Part IV]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}

[[File:Henry George.png|thumb|upright|Portrait photo, taken shortly after writing ''Progress and Poverty'']]

Furthermore, on a visit to New York City, he was struck by the apparent paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was a great success, selling over three million copies. In it George made the argument that a sizeable portion of the wealth created by social and technological advances in a [[free market]] economy is possessed by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] via [[economic rent]]s, and that this concentration of unearned wealth is the main cause of poverty. George considered it a great injustice that private profit was being earned from restricting access to natural resources while productive activity was burdened with heavy taxes, and indicated that such a system was equivalent to [[slavery]]{{snd}}a concept somewhat similar to [[wage slavery]]. This is also the work in which he made the case for a [[land value tax]] in which governments would tax the value of the land itself, thus preventing private interests from profiting upon its mere possession, but allowing the value of all improvements made to that land to remain with investors.<ref>Jurgen G. Backhaus, "Henry George's Ingenious Tax: A Contemporary Restatement," ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' 56, no. 4 (Oct. 1997), 453–458</ref><ref>Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CjcqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&f=false, ''Progress and Poverty,''] (1879; reprinted, London: Kegan Paul, Tench & Co., 1886), 283–284.</ref>

George was in a position to discover this pattern, having experienced poverty himself, knowing many different societies from his travels, and living in California at a time of rapid growth.  In particular he had noticed that the construction of railroads in California was increasing land values and rents as fast as or faster than wages were rising.<ref name="grundskyld.dk" /><ref>Charles A. Barker, "Henry George and the California Background of ''Progress and Poverty''," ''California Historical Society Quartery'' 24, no. 2 (Jun. 1945), 97–115.</ref>

==Political career==
In 1880, now a popular writer and speaker,<ref>According to his granddaughter [[Agnes de Mille]], ''Progress and Poverty'' and its successors made Henry George the third most famous man in the US, behind only [[Mark Twain]] and [[Thomas Edison]]. [http://www.henrygeorgefoundation.us/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203164125/http://www.henrygeorgefoundation.us/ |date=February 3, 2006 }}</ref> George moved to New York City, becoming closely allied with the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] community despite being of [[English Americans|English]] ancestry. From there he made several speaking journeys abroad to places such as [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] where access to land was (and still is) a major political issue.

[[File:Henry George 1897 by Walter Russell.jpg|thumb|200px|Campaigning for mayor in 1897, just before his death]]
[[1886 New York City mayoral election|In 1886]], George campaigned for mayor of New York City as the candidate of the United Labor Party, the short-lived political society of the [[United Labor Party (New York)|United Labor Party]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Genovese|first=Frank C.|date=1991|title=Henry George and Organized Labor: The 19th Century Economist and Social Philosopher Championed Labor's Cause, but Used Its Candidacy for Propaganda|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3487043|journal=The American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=50|issue=1|pages=113–127|issn=0002-9246}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=O’Donnell|first=Edward|date=October 22, 2015|title=Henry George and the Crisis of Inequality|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?402336-1/henry-george-crisis-inequality|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-07|website=www.c-span.org|language=en-us}}</ref>  He polled second, more than the Republican candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The election was won by [[Tammany Hall]] candidate [[Abram Stevens Hewitt]] by what many of George's supporters believed was fraud.

George had particular trouble with [[Terrence Powderly|Terrence V. Powderly]], president of the [[Knights of Labor]], a key member of the United Labor coalition. While initially friendly with Powderly, George vigorously opposed the tariff policies which Powderly and many other labor leaders thought vital to the protection of American workers. George's strident criticism of the tariff set him against Powderly and others in the labor movement.<ref>Robert E.

==Death and funeral==
George's first stroke occurred in 1890, after a global speaking tour concerning land rights and the relationship between rent and poverty. This stroke greatly weakened him, and he never truly recovered. Despite this, George tried to remain active in politics. Against the advice of his doctors, George campaigned for New York City mayor again in 1897, this time as an Independent Democrat, saying, "I will make the race if I die for it." The strain of the campaign precipitated a second stroke, leading to his death four days before the election.<ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' s. V.

This procession was "all the way ... thronged on either side by crowds of silent watchers."

The procession then went on to [[Brooklyn]], where the crowd at [[Brooklyn Borough Hall|Brooklyn City Hall]] "was the densest ever seen there." There were "thousands on thousands" at City Hall who were so far back that they could not see the funeral procession pass. It was impossible to move on any of the nearby streets. ''The Times'' wrote, "Rarely has such an enormous crowd turned out in Brooklyn on any occasion," but that nonetheless, "[t]he slow tolling of the City Hall bell and the regular beating of drums were the only sounds that broke the stillness. ... Anything more impressive ... could not be imagined."<ref>{{cite news |title=The Funeral Procession |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/11/01/102544571.pdf |access-date=16 July 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 1, 1897}}</ref> At Court Street, the casket was transferred to a hearse and taken to a private funeral at [[Fort Hamilton]].

Commentators disagreed on whether it was the largest funeral in New York history or the largest since the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]].

== Views and policy proposals ==

===Socialization of land and natural resource rents===
[[File:Everybody works but the vacant lot (cropped).jpg|thumb|Everybody works but the vacant lot.]]
Henry George is best known for his argument that the [[economic rent]] of land (location) should be shared by society. The clearest statement of this view is found in ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'': "We must make land common property."<ref>{{cite book |last=George |first=Henry |title=Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth |year=1879 |volume=VI |chapter=The True Remedy |chapter-url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPP26.html |access-date=May 12, 2008 |isbn=0914016601 |publisher=Robert Schalkenbach Foundation |location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lough |first1=Alexandra |title=The Last Tax: Henry George and the Social Politics of Land Reform in the Gilded Age and Progressive Era |url=https://www.academia.edu/4996856 |website=Academia.edu |quote=George only sought to make land common property through the socialization of land rent, or what many have called the "unearned increment" of land value.}}</ref> By [[land value tax|taxing land values]], society could recapture the value of its common inheritance, raise wages, improve land use, and eliminate the need for taxes on productive activity. George believed it would remove existing incentives toward land speculation and encourage development, as landlords would not suffer tax penalties for any industry or edifice constructed on their land and could not profit by holding valuable sites vacant.<ref>Backhaus, "Henry George's Ingenious Tax," 453–458.</ref>

Broadly applying this principle is now commonly known as "[[Georgism]]." In George's time, it was known as the "single-tax" movement and sometimes associated with movements for land nationalization, especially in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Supplement to Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VlU_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA720 |date=1889 |quote=The labor vote in the election was trifling until Henry George had commenced an agitation for the nationalization of land.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The American: A National Journal, Volumes 15–16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSEgAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA21 |date=1888|last1 = Thompson|first1 = Robert Ellis|last2 = Barker|first2 = Wharton}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A Reception to Mr. George |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00EEDB1F3EE433A25752C2A9669D94639FD7CF |website=The New York Times |date=21 October 1882 |quote=Mr. George expressed his thanks for the reception and predicted that soon the movement in favor of land nationalization would be felt all over the civilized world.}}</ref> However, in ''Progress and Poverty'', George did not favor the idea of nationalization.

<blockquote>I do not propose either to purchase or to confiscate private property in land. The first would be unjust; the second, needless. Let the individuals who now hold it still retain, if they want to, possession of what they are pleased to call their land. Let them continue to call it their land. Let them buy and sell, and bequeath and devise it. We may safely leave them the shell, if we take the kernel. It is not necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary to confiscate rent.<ref>{{cite book |last=George |first=Henry |title=Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth |year=1879 |volume=VIII |chapter=How Equal Rights to the Land May Be Asserted and Secured |chapter-url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPP33.html |access-date=Nov 27, 2016 |isbn=0914016601 |publisher=Robert Schalkenbach Foundation |location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>

===Municipalization of utilities and free public transit===
George considered businesses relying on exclusive [[right-of-way]] land privilege to be [[natural monopoly|"natural" monopolies]]. Examples of these services included the transportation of utilities (water, electricity, sewage), information (telecommunications), goods, and travelers. George advocated that these systems of transport along "public ways" should usually be managed as [[public utilities]] and [[Free public transport|provided for free]] or at [[marginal cost]]. In some cases, it might be possible to allow competition between private service providers along public "rights of way," such as parcel shipping companies that operate on public roads, but wherever competition would be impossible, George supported complete [[municipalization]]. George said that these services would be provided for free because investments in beneficial public goods always [[Henry George theorem|tend to increase land values by more than the total cost of those investments]]. George used the example of urban buildings that provide free vertical transit, paid out of some of the increased value that residents derive from the addition of elevators.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=K.

===Intellectual property reform===
George was opposed to or suspicious of all intellectual property privilege, because his classical definition of [[land (economics)|"land"]] included "all natural forces and opportunities." Therefore, George proposed to abolish or greatly limit intellectual property privilege. In George's view, owning a monopoly over specific arrangements and interactions of materials, governed by the forces of nature, allowed title-holders to extract royalty-rents from producers, in a way similar to owners of ordinary land titles. George later supported limited copyright, on the ground that temporary property over a unique arrangement of words or colors did not in any way prevent others from laboring to make other works of art. George apparently ranked patent rents as a less significant form of monopoly than the owners of land title deeds, partly because he viewed the owners of locations as "the robber that takes all that is left." People could choose not to buy a specific new product, but they cannot choose to lack a place upon which to stand, so benefits gained for labor through lesser reforms would tend to eventually be captured by owners and financers of location monopoly.

===Free trade===
George was opposed to [[tariffs]], which were at the time both the major method of [[protectionist]] trade policy and an important source of federal revenue, the [[federal income tax]] having not yet been introduced. He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power. Free trade became a major issue in federal politics and his book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' was the first book to be read entirely into the [[Congressional Record]].<ref>{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = The annotated works of Henry George | publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson University Press The Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Inc., Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = Madison, NJ; Lanham, MD; New York| year = 2016 | isbn = 978-1611477016 }}</ref> It was read by five Democratic congressmen.<ref>Weir, "A Fragile Alliance," 425–425</ref><ref>Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qlMAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=protection%20or%20free%20trade ''Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor''](New York: 1887).</ref>

In 1997, [[Spencer MacCallum]] wrote that Henry George was "undeniably the greatest writer and orator on free trade who ever lived."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacCallum |first1=Spencer H. |title=The Alternative Georgist Tradition |journal=Fragments |date=Summer–Fall 1997 |volume=35 |url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/maccallum-spencer_alternative-georgist-tradition-1997-02.pdf |access-date=30 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071947/http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/maccallum-spencer_alternative-georgist-tradition-1997-02.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2009, [[Tyler Cowen]] wrote that George's 1886 book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' "remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Anti-Capitalist Rerun |journal=The American Interest |date=May 1, 2009 |volume=4 |issue=5 |url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2009/05/01/anti-capitalist-rerun/ |access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref>

[[Jim Powell (historian)|Jim Powell]] said that ''Protection or Free Trade'' was probably the best book on trade written by anyone in the [[Americas]], comparing it [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''. [[Milton Friedman]] said it was the most rhetorically brilliant work ever written on trade.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Jim|title=Milton Friedman's Favorite Book on Trade|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedmans-favorite-book-on-trade-1465597043|access-date=17 March 2018|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> Friedman also paraphrased one of George's arguments in favor of free trade: "It's a very interesting thing that in times of war, we blockade our enemies in order to prevent them from getting goods from us. In time of peace we do to ourselves by tariffs what we do to our enemy in time of war."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Obenhaus|first1=Matthew|title=Free Trade Lessons for the Economically Challenged|url=https://gymnasiumsite.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/free-trade-lessons-for-the-economically-challenged/|website=The Gymnasium|access-date=17 March 2018|date=March 7, 2016}}</ref>

===Secret ballot===
[[File:George de Forest Brush - Henry George - NPG.67.53 - National Portrait Gallery.jpg|thumb|Artist: [[George de Forest Brush]], Sitter: Henry George, Date: 1888]]

George was one of the earliest and most prominent advocates for adoption of the [[secret ballot]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/13/081013fa_fact_lepore |title=Rock, Paper, Scissors: How we used to vote |first=Jill |last=Lepore |author-link=Jill Lepore |work=New Yorker |publisher=New Yorker |date=October 13, 2008}}</ref> [[Harvard]] historian [[Jill Lepore]] asserts that Henry George's advocacy is the reason Americans vote with secret ballots today.<ref name="nytimes.com" /> George's first article in support of the secret ballot was entitled "Bribery in Elections" and was published in the ''Overland Review'' of December 1871.  His second article was "Money in Elections," published in the ''North American Review'' of March 1883. The first secret ballot reform approved by a state legislature was brought about by reformers who said they were influenced by George.<ref>{{cite book |last=Saltman |first=Roy |title=The history and politics of voting technology : chads and other scandals |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |year=2008 |page=97 |isbn=978-0230605985}}</ref> The first state to adopt the secret ballot, also called The Australian Ballot, was Massachusetts in 1888 under the leadership of Richard Henry Dana III. By 1891, more than half the states had adopted it too.<ref>For a more complete discussion of the adoption of the Australian Ballot, see Saltman, Roy G., (2006), ''The History and Politics of Voting Technology,'' Palgrave Macmillan, NY, pp.&nbsp;96–103.</ref>

===Money creation, banking, and national deficit reform===
George supported the use of "debt free" (sovereign money) currency, such as the [[United States Note|greenback]], which governments would spend into circulation to help finance public spending through the capture of [[seigniorage]] rents. He opposed the use of metallic currency, such as gold or silver, and fiat money created by private commercial banks.<ref>"To illustrate: It is not the business of government to interfere with the views which any one may hold of the Creator or with the worship he may choose to pay him, so long as the exercise of these individual rights does not conflict with the equal liberty of others; and the result of governmental interference in this domain has been hypocrisy, corruption, persecution and religious war. It is not the business of government to direct the employment of labor and capital, and to foster certain industries at the expense of other industries; and the attempt to do so leads to all the waste, loss and corruption due to protective tariffs."

"On the other hand it is the business of government to issue money. This is perceived as soon as the great labor saving invention of money supplants barter. To leave it to every one who chose to do so to issue money would be to entail general inconvenience and loss, to offer many temptations to roguery, and to put the poorer classes of society at a great disadvantage. These obvious considerations have everywhere, as society became well organized, led to the recognition of the coinage of money as an exclusive function of government. When in the progress of society, a further labor-saving improvement becomes possible by the substitution of paper for the precious metals as the material for money, the reasons why the issuance of this money should be made a government function become still stronger. The evils entailed by wildcat banking in the United States are too well remembered to need reference. The loss and inconvenience, the swindling and corruption that flowed from the assumption by each State of the Union of the power to license banks of issue ended with the war, and no one would now go back to them. Yet instead of doing what every public consideration impels us to, and assuming wholly and fully as the exclusive function of the General Government the power to issue money, the private interests of bankers have, up to this, compelled us to the use of a hybrid currency, of which a large part, though guaranteed by the General Government, is issued and made profitable to corporations. The legitimate business of banking{{snd}}the safekeeping and loaning of money, and the making and exchange of credits{{snd}}is properly left to individuals and associations; but by leaving to them, even in part and under restrictions and guarantees, the issuance of money, the people of the United States suffer an annual loss of millions of dollars, and sensibly increase the influences which exert a corrupting effect upon their government." ''The Complete Works of Henry George''. "Social Problems," p. 178, Doubleday Page & Co, New York, 1904 {{ISBN?}}</ref>

===Citizen's dividend and universal pension===
George advocated for a [[citizen's dividend]] paid for by a [[land value tax]] in an April 1885 speech at a [[Knights of Labor]] [[Local union|local]] in [[Burlington, Iowa]] titled "The Crime of Poverty" and later in an interview with former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House Representative]] [[David Dudley Field II]] from [[New York's 7th congressional district]] published in the July 1885 edition of the ''[[North American Review]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=George|first=Henry|author-link=Henry George|year=1901|orig-year=1885|title=Our Land and Land Policy: Speeches, Lectures and Miscellaneous Writings|chapter=The Crime of Poverty|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday and McClure Company]]|pages=217–218|isbn=978-0526825431|quote=As an English friend of mine puts it: No taxes and a pension for everybody; and why should it not be? To take land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might, without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug. The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade. Charity schools do degrade children that are sent to them, but public schools do not.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=George|first=Henry|year=1901|orig-year=1885|title=Our Land and Land Policy: Speeches, Lectures and Miscellaneous Writings|chapter=Land and Taxation: A Conversation Between David Dudley Field and Henry George|place=New York|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday and McClure Company]]|page=230|isbn=978-0526825431|author-link=Henry George}}</ref> George proposed to create a pension and disability system, and an unconditional [[basic income]] from surplus land rents. It would be distributed to residents "as a right" instead of as charity. Georgists often refer to this policy as a [[citizen's dividend]] in reference to a similar proposal by [[Thomas Paine]].

===Bankruptcy protection and an abolition of debtors' prisons===
George noted that most debt, though bearing the appearance of genuine capital interest, was not issued for the purpose of creating true capital, but instead as an obligation against rental flows from existing economic privilege. George therefore reasoned that the state should not provide aid to creditors in the form of sheriffs, constables, courts, and prisons to enforce collection on these illegitimate obligations. George did not provide any data to support this view, but in today's developed economies, much of the supply of credit is created to purchase claims on future land rents, rather than to finance the creation of true capital. [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] and [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Adair Turner]] estimate that about 80 percent of credit finances real estate purchases, mostly land.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Adair |title=A new era for monetary policy |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVQdeb0EdWA&t=994 |date=April 13, 2012 |location=Berlin |publisher=INET |access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hudson |first1=Michael |title=Scenarios for Recovery: How to Write Down the Debts and Restructure the Financial System |url=http://nowandfutures.com/large/HowToWriteDownTheDebtsAndRestructureTheFinancialSystem-hudson-michael-berlin-paper.pdf |access-date=15 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080443/http://nowandfutures.com/large/HowToWriteDownTheDebtsAndRestructureTheFinancialSystem-hudson-michael-berlin-paper.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

George acknowledged that this policy would limit the banking system but believed that would actually be an economic boon, since the financial sector, in its existing form, was mostly augmenting rent extraction, as opposed to productive investment. "The curse of credit," George wrote, was "... that it expands when there is a tendency to speculation, and sharply contracts just when most needed to assure confidence and prevent industrial waste." George even said that a [[debt jubilee]] could remove the accumulation of burdensome obligations without reducing aggregate wealth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=George |first1=Henry |title=Consequences of a Growing National Debt |url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/george-henry_consequences-of-a-growing-national-debt-1888.htm |access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref>

===Women's suffrage===
George was an important and vocal advocate for women's political rights. He argued for extending suffrage to women and even suggested filling one house of Congress entirely with women: "If we must have two houses of Congress, then by all means let us fill one with women and the other with men."<ref>George, Henry, and Kenneth C. Wenzer. ''An Anthology of Henry George's Thought''. Rochester, NY. University of Rochester Press, 1997.</ref>

===Other proposals===
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2017}}
Henry George also proposed and advocated for the following reforms:
* Dramatic reductions in the size of the military.
* Replacement of contract patronage with the direct employment of government workers, with civil-service protections.
* Building and maintenance of free mass transportation and libraries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brechin |first1=Gray |title=Indestructable By Reason of Beauty: The Beaumanance of a Public Library Building |date=2003 |publisher=Greenwood Press |url=http://graybrechin.net/_docs/books/Indestructible-by-Reason-of-Beauty-Gray-Brechin.pdf |access-date=23 December 2014}}</ref>
* Campaign finance reform and political spending restrictions.
* Careful regulation of all monopolies. George advocated regulations to eliminate monopolies when possible and government ownership of monopolies as a policy of last resort.

==Legacy==
{{See also|Georgism}}

Henry George's ideas on politics and economics had enormous influence in his time. His ideas gave rise to the economic philosophy now known as [[Georgism]]. However, his influence slowly waned through the 20th century.  Nonetheless, it would be difficult to overstate George's impact on turn-of-the-century reform movements and intellectual culture.  George's self-published ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' was the first popular economics text and one of the most widely printed books ever written.  The book's explosive worldwide popularity is often marked as the beginning of the [[Progressive Era]] and various political parties, clubs, and charitable organizations around the world were founded on George's ideas. George's message attracts support widely across the [[political spectrum]], including labor union activists, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, reformers, conservatives, and wealthy investors. As a result, Henry George is still claimed as a primary intellectual influence by both [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] and [[socialists]]. [[Edwin Markham]] expressed a common sentiment when he said, "Henry George has always been to me one of the supreme heroes of humanity."<ref>The Single Tax Review Volume 15. New York: Publ. Off., 1915</ref>

A large [[Georgism#Notable Georgists|number of famous individuals]], particularly Progressive Era figures, claim inspiration from Henry George's ideas.

The social scientist and economist [[John A.

London: Hurst and Blackett, 1911.</ref>  The controversial [[People's Budget]] and the ''Land Values (Scotland) Bill'' were inspired by Henry George and resulted in a constitutional crisis and the [[Parliament Act 1911]] to reform of the [[House of Lords]], which had blocked the land reform.  In Denmark, the [[Justice Party of Denmark|Danmarks Retsforbund]], known in English as the Justice Party or Single-Tax Party, was founded in 1919. The party's platform is based upon the land tax principles of Henry George. The party was elected to parliament for the first time in 1926, and they were moderately successful in the post-war period and managed to join a governing coalition with the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party from the years 1957–60, with diminishing success afterwards.

Non-political means have also been attempted to further the cause. A number of "Single Tax Colonies" were started, such as [[Arden, Delaware]] and [[Fairhope, Alabama]].  In 1904, [[Lizzie Magie]] created a board game called [[The Landlord's Game]] to demonstrate George's theories. This was later turned into the popular board game [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. [[File:Landlords Game board based on 1924 patent.png|thumb|right|250px|''Landlords Game'' board, based on Magie's 1924 US patent (no. 1,509,312).]]

[[Joseph Jay Pastoriza|Joseph Jay "J.J." Pastoriza]] led a successful Georgist movement in [[Houston]]. Though the Georgist club, the Houston Single Tax League, started there in 1890, Pastoriza lent use of his property to the league in 1903. He retired from the printing business in 1906 in order to dedicate his life to public service, then traveled the United States and Europe while studying various systems of taxing property. He returned to Houston and served as Houston Tax Commissioner from 1911 through 1917. He introduced his "Houston Plan of Taxation" in 1912: improvements to land and merchants' inventories were taxed at 25 percent of appraised value, unimproved land was taxed at 70 percent of appraisal, and personal property was exempt. However, in 1915, two courts ruled that the Houston Plan violated the Texas Constitution.<ref name=davis>{{cite news|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Stephen-Davis-Joseph-Jay-Pastoriza-and-the-Single-Tax-in-Houston-1911-1917.pdf |title=Joseph Jay Pastoriza and the Single Tax in Houston, 1911{{endash}}1917|publisher=Houston Review: history and culture of the Gulf Coast|year=1986|last=Davis|first=Stephen|volume=8|number=2}}</ref>

Henry George's popularity waned gradually during the 20th century. However, there are still [[Georgism|Georgist]] organizations. Many influential people who remain famous, such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], were inspired by George or [[Georgism#Notable Georgists|identify as Georgists]].  In his last book, ''[[Where do we go from here: Chaos or Community?]]'', [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] referred to Henry George in support of a [[guaranteed minimum income]]. [[Bill Moyers]] quoted Henry George in a speech and identified George as a "great personal hero."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za-TYGOE1O0&t=38m0s |title=Bill Moyers at the Howard Zinn Lecture |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-11-12 |access-date=2012-07-26}}</ref> [[Albert Einstein]] wrote that "Men like Henry George are rare unfortunately.

[[Mason Gaffney]], an American [[economist]] and a major Georgist critic of [[neoclassical economics]], argued that neoclassical economics was designed and promoted by landowners and their hired economists to divert attention from George's extremely popular philosophy that since land and resources are provided by nature, and their value is given by society, land value{{snd}}rather than labor or capital{{snd}}should provide the tax base to fund government and its expenditures.<ref>Gaffney, Mason and Harrison, Fred.

[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|British MP]], [[Andrew MacLaren]] believed George's ideas of land taxation would bring about economic justice and argued in favour of them in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Together with his son [[Leon MacLaren]] he founded the [[School of Economic Science]], a global organisation teaching Georgist principles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Standing for justice : a biography of Andrew MacLaren, MP|last=Stewart|first=John|date=2001|publisher=Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0856831948|location=London|oclc=49362105}}</ref>

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote that "One of the most important but underappreciated ideas in economics is the Henry George principle of taxing the economic rent of land, and more generally, natural resources."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://masongaffneyreader.com/quotes.htm|title=The Mason Gaffney Reader|website=masongaffneyreader.com}}</ref> Stiglitz also claims that we now know [[land value tax]] "is even better than Henry George thought."

The [[Robert Schalkenbach Foundation]] publishes copies of George's works and related texts on economic reform and sponsors academic research into his policy proposals.  The [[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]] was founded to promote the ideas of Henry George but now focuses more generally on land economics and policy.  The Henry George School of Social Science of New York and its satellite schools teach classes and conduct outreach.

===Henry George theorem===
{{main|Henry George theorem}}
In 1977, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] showed that under certain conditions, spending by the government on [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s will increase aggregate land rents by at least an equal amount. This result has been dubbed by economists the [[Henry George theorem]], as it characterizes a situation where Henry George's "single tax" is not only efficient, it is also the only tax necessary to finance public expenditures.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arnott |first=Richard J. |author2=Joseph E. Stiglitz |title=Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |date=Nov 1979 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=471–500 |jstor=1884466 |doi=10.2307/1884466|s2cid=53374401 |url=http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:160390/CONTENT/4624867.pdf }}</ref>

==Economic contributions==
George reconciled the issues of efficiency and equity, showing that both could be satisfied under a system in harmony with natural law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://masongaffney.org/essays/Henry_George_100_Years_Later.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303234646/http://www.masongaffney.org/essays/Henry_George_100_Years_Later.pdf |archive-date=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> He showed that Ricardo's Law of Rent applied not just to an agricultural economy, but even more so to urban economics. And he showed that there is no inherent conflict between labor and capital provided one maintained a clear distinction between classical factors of production, capital and land.

George developed what he saw as a crucial feature of his own theory of economics in a critique of an illustration used by [[Frédéric Bastiat]] in order to explain the nature of [[interest]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Bastiat had asked his readers to consider James and William, both carpenters. James has built himself a plane, and has lent it to William for a year. Would James be satisfied with the return of an equally good plane a year later? Surely not! He'd expect a board along with it, as interest. The basic idea of a theory of interest is to understand why. Bastiat said that James had given William over that year "the power, inherent in the instrument, to increase the productivity of his labor," and wants compensation for that increased productivity.<ref>Frédéric Bastiat, [http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html ''That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen,"] 1850.</ref>

George did not accept this explanation. He wrote, "I am inclined to think that if all wealth consisted of such things as [[plane (tool)|planes]], and all production was such as that of carpenters – that is to say, if wealth consisted but of the inert matter of the universe, and production of working up this inert matter into different shapes – that interest would be but the robbery of industry, and could not long exist."<ref>Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CjcqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&f=false, ''Progress and Poverty,''], 161.</ref> But some wealth is inherently fruitful, like a pair of breeding cattle, or a vat of grape juice soon to ferment into wine. Planes and other sorts of inert matter (and the most lent item of all – money itself) earn interest indirectly, by being part of the same "circle of exchange" with fruitful forms of wealth such as those, so that tying up these forms of wealth over time incurs an [[opportunity cost]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

George's theory had its share of critiques. [[Austrian school]] economist [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], for example, expressed a negative judgment of George's discussion of the carpenter's plane. In his treatise, ''Capital and Interest'', he wrote:

{{quote|(T)he separation of production into two groups, in one of which the vital forces of nature form a distinct element in addition to labour, while in the other they do not, is entirely untenable... The natural sciences have long ago told us that the cooperation of nature is universal. ... The muscular movement of the man who planes would be of very little use, if the natural powers and properties of the steel edge of the plane did not come to his assistance.<ref>Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KmUPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage ''Capital and Interest: A Critical History of Economic Theory''] transl. William Smart (London: Macmillan and Co., 1890), 417.</ref>}}

Later, George argued that the role of time in production is pervasive.  In ''The Science of Political Economy'', he writes:

{{quote|[I]f I go to a builder and say to him, "In what time and at what price will you build me such and such a house?" he would, after thinking, name a time, and a price based on it. This specification of time would be essential. ... This I would soon find if, not quarreling with the price, I ask him largely to lessen the time. ... I might get the builder somewhat to lessen the time ... ; but only by greatly increasing the price, until finally a point would be reached where he would not consent to build the house in less time no matter at what price. He would say [that the house just could not be built any faster]. ...

The importance ... of this principle – that all production of wealth requires time as well as labor – we shall see later on; but the principle that time is a necessary element in all production we must take into account from the very first.<ref>Henry George, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TgJLAAAAYAAJ <!-- quote=if i go to a builder. --> ''The Science of Political Economy''] (New York: Doubleday & McClure Co., 1898), 369–370.</ref>}}

According to Oscar B. Johannsen, "Since the very basis of the Austrian concept of value is subjective, it is apparent that George's understanding of value paralleled theirs. However, he either did not understand or did not appreciate the importance of [[marginal utility]]."<ref>Johannsen, Oscar B. [https://archive.today/20120709154713/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_60/ai_82469377/ Henry George and the Austrian economists.] ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]''  (Am. j. econ. sociol.)  {{ISSN|0002-9246}}. Abstract.</ref> On the contrary, George explicitly used marginal utility in his analyses of both the 'margin of production' in macroeconomics and microeconomic decision theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politicaleconomy.org/speIII_5.htm#marg|title=The Science of Political Economy, Part III, Chapter 5|website=politicaleconomy.org}}</ref>

Another spirited response came from British biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] in his article "Capital – the Mother of Labour," published in 1890 in the journal ''The Nineteenth Century''. Huxley used the scientific principles of energy to undermine George's theory, arguing that, energetically speaking, labor is unproductive.<ref>T.H. Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE9/CaML.html "Capital – the Mother of Labour: An Economical Problem Discussed from a Physiological Point of View,"] ''The Nineteenth Century'' (Mar. 1890).</ref>
