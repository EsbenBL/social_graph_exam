'''Arthur Naftalin''' (June 28, 1917 – May 16, 2005) was an American [[political scientist]] and politician.  A member of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL), he served as [[mayor]] of [[Minneapolis]] from July 3, 1961, to July 6, 1969. He was the first [[Jewish]] mayor of Minneapolis.

==Early life==
Naftalin was born in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]], one of four children of Sandel and Tillie Naftalin. He was married to Frances Healy Naftalin; among their children is [[Mark Naftalin]], a musician.  Their other notable children are David Michael Bismarck and Gail Marie Naftalin.

==University of Minnesota and Hubert Humphrey==
Naftalin came to [[Minneapolis]] to attend the [[University of Minnesota Twin Cities|University of Minnesota]], from which he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1939 and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1948. His [[dissertation]] was a history of the [[Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota]]. During this time, he became acquainted with [[Hubert Humphrey]] and helped Humphrey lead the merger of [[Minnesota]]'s Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties into the DFL in 1944.

In 1945, Humphrey was elected mayor and Naftalin was appointed to work in his office. Naftalin later became a professor in the department of political science at the [[University of Minnesota]]. He served as commissioner of administration under [[Governor of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Orville L. Freeman]].

==Mayor==
In 1961, he won the first of his four two-year terms as mayor, defeating incumbent Republican Mayor [[P. Kenneth Peterson]] by a margin of 52.04% to 47.96%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=712750|title=Our Campaigns – Minneapolis Mayor Race – June 13, 1961|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref> He attended the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and was present at [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s  "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech. He ran for the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|DFL]] endorsement for [[lieutenant governor of Minnesota|lieutenant governor]] in 1966. In 1967, he called in the [[Minnesota National Guard|National Guard]] to quell the [[1967 Plymouth Avenue civil unrest]]. Naftalin declined to seek reelection in 1969, becoming the only mayor of Minneapolis in the period 1913–1979 who never resigned or lost an [[election]]. Naftalin was succeeded by [[Charles Stenvig|Charlie Stenvig]], a police officer with no previous political experience who promised a "law and order" approach to any future civil unrest.

==Life after leaving office==
After leaving office, Naftalin became a professor in the department of public affairs at the [[University of Minnesota]] (now the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs). In 1971, he joined the Board of Directors of the [[Citizens League]], and served as President of the Board in 1975–1976. From 1976 to 1987, he produced and hosted 500 installments of ''Minnesota Issues'', a weekly [[Public affairs programming|public-affairs]] program on local [[public television]] station [[KTCA]]. In 1980 he produced, wrote, and narrated a series of one-hour television documentaries about former [[Minnesota]] governors. He retired in 1987.

On the morning of May 16, 2005, Naftalin struck his head in a fall, went into a [[coma]], and died later in the day at [[Abbott Northwestern Hospital]] in [[Minneapolis]]. He donated his body to the [[University of Minnesota]] for research.
