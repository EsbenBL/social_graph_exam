'''Maksim Maksimovich Kovalevsky''' (8 September 1851 – 5 April 1916) was a Russian jurist and the main authority on [[sociology]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. He was vice-president (1895) and president (1905) of the [[International Institute of Sociology]]. He also held a chair in sociology at the [[Bekhterev Research Institute|Psycho-Neurological Institute]]. Kovalevsky was elected into the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1914. The [[Russian Sociological Society]] adopted his name in 1916.

==Life==
Maksim Kovalevsky was born into a Ukrainian noble family and spent his childhood in a manor near [[Kharkov]]. He studied at the [[University of Kharkov]] under [[Dmitri Kachenovsky]]. He furthered his education in [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], and [[London]], where he made the acquaintance of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]. He also became involved in the [[Freemasonry in Russia|Masonic movement]], contributing to its revival in Russia.

After 1878, he read lectures in law at the [[University of Moscow]], where he studied the [[obshchina|Russian peasant commune]] and legal institutions of [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] highlanders. Some of his materials were later used by [[Frederick Engels]]. Minister [[Ivan Delyanov]] did not approve of Kovalevsky's liberal views. In 1886, Kovalevsky was kicked out of the university and then settled in Western Europe, where he came to know all major sociologists and anthropologists of his day.

His cousin's widow, mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]], arranged for him a lecture program at the [[University of Stockholm]]. He is portrayed as her lover and fiancé in the Soviet film "[[Sofia Kovalevskaya (film)|Sofia Kovalevskaya]]" (1985) and in "Too Much Happiness" (2009), a short story by [[Alice Munro]] published in the August 2009 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. Sofia was "adamant that she would not marry Maksim, fearing that if she did, he would begin to take her for granted and look for a mistress".<ref>Quoted from: Vadim B. Kuznetsov. ''The Kowalewsky Property''. American Mathematical Soc., 2002. Page 18.</ref> They parted in 1890 and she died from influenza the following year.

After the [[First Russian Revolution]], Kovalevsky resumed his lectures in Russia (in the [[University of Saint Petersburg]]), became involved in politics, established a centrist party of democratic reforms (see [[Progressist Party]]), was elected into the first [[State Duma]], and appointed into the [[State Council of the Russian Empire]]. In 1912 he was nominated for a [[Nobel peace prize]]. He was scheduled to take part in the peace negotiations for ending [[World War I]] but died in April 1916. The crowd that had attended the funeral at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]] was enormous.

==Ideas==
Among Kovalevsky's contributions to Russian jurisprudence and social science was a new [[historical method]] which combined traditional descriptive comparative analysis with sociological/ethnographic methods. Among his disciples were [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]], and [[Nicholas Timasheff]] (see [[Sociology in Russia]]). His early work on the peasant commune influenced [[Georgy Plekhanov]].

As a scholar Kovalevsky was a [[Sociocultural evolution|social evolution]]ist and called himself a disciple of [[Auguste Comte]]. He defined sociology as "the science dealing with the organization and evolution of societies".<ref name="thought">Quoted from: Andrzej Walicki. ''A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism''. Stanford University Press, 1979. Pages 367–368.</ref> He believed in [[Progress (history)|progress]] as one of the inexorable laws of history. For him progress was "the constant expansion of the environment of peaceful coexistence from tribal unity through [[patriotism]] to [[cosmopolitanism]]".<ref name="thought"/>

According to Kovalevsky, economic relations are bound to expand ever further, and the growth of international trade "would bring about the economic integration of the whole world, eliminating the causes of war, and ultimately lead to a world federation of democratic states".<ref name="thought"/> Progress depends on population growth as its main driving force.
