'''Gordon Howard Bower''' (December 30, 1932 – June 17, 2020) was a [[cognitive psychologist]] studying [[human memory]], [[language comprehension]], emotion, and behavior modification. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]] from [[Yale University]] in 1959. He held the A. R. Lang Emeritus Professorship at [[Stanford University]]. In addition to his research, Bower also was a notable adviser to numerous students, including [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R. Anderson]], [[Lawrence W. Barsalou]], [[Lera Boroditsky]], [[Keith Holyoak]], [[Stephen Kosslyn]], [[Alan Lesgold]], [[Mark A. Gluck]], and [[Robert Sternberg]], among others.

He was voted number 42 in the list of most notable psychologists of the 20th century, published by the ''Review of General Psychology''.<ref>Haggbloom, S.J. et al, 2002, The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century, Review of General Psychology, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139–152.</ref> 
He was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 2005.

==General Information==
Gordon H. Bower was a cognitive social psychologist. His main areas of study include human memory, [[mnemonic]] devices, retrieval strategies, recording strategies, and [[category learning]]. He was interested in [[cognitive processes]], [[emotion]], imagery, language and [[reading comprehension]] as they relate to memory.<ref>Bower, Gordon H (2010). In Stanford University Department of Psychology. Retrieved April 21, 2012.</ref> He was married to Sharon, the founder of a communication consulting firm who has published three self-help books on speech anxiety. Together, they have three children.<ref name="Bower 2007">Bower, G. H. (2007). Gordon H. Bower. In G. Lindzey, W. M. Runyan, G. Lindzey, W. M.

==Early life==
Bower was born on December 30, 1932, in [[Scio, Ohio]], to Clyde Ward and Mabel (Bosart).<ref name = Marquis>{{cite web | title = Profile details: Gordon Howard Bower | url = http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100003810087 | access-date = August 7, 2012 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who}}</ref> His father worked as a grocery store owner and his mother was a teacher. During high school, he was encouraged by his teachers to pursue a career in psychiatry. Out of high school, he accepted a four-year scholarship to play baseball at Cleveland's Western Reserve University and during his freshman year, began working in the Cleveland State Mental Hospital. In order to avoid the military draft, Bower opted for graduate school, but his experiences in the mental hospital dissuaded him from a career as a psychiatrist.<ref name = Autobiography>{{cite journal | title = The Evolution of a Cognitive Psychologist: A Journey from Simple Behaviors to Complex Mental Acts | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093722 | journal=[[Annual Review of Psychology]] | publisher = Annual Reviews |year=2008 |volume=59 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093722 | pages=1–27 | pmid=18154497 | last1 = Bower | first1 = GH}}</ref>

While Bower was attending Yale for his degree in Experimental Psychology, under [[Neal E. Miller|Neal Miller]], he discovered a passion for learning theory and presented his findings on dual reward-punishment in rats to the American Psychological Association. During this time, he and [[William Kaye Estes|Bill Estes]] also revised [[Edward C. Tolman|Edward Tolman]]'s vicarious trial and error model to include human choices among commodity options.<ref name="Bower 2007"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=2020-07-19|title=Gordon Bower, Inventive Memory Researcher, Is Dead at 87|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/science/gordon-bower-dead.html|access-date=2020-07-23|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Bower married Sharon Anthony on January 30, 1957.<ref name = Marquis />

==Career==
Bower earned his Ph.D. in psychology from Yale University in 1959 and was hired at the [[Stanford]] Psychology Department.<ref name=":0" /> Until the late 1960s, he continued the animal research he had begun as a graduate student, but when Bill Estes and Dick Atkinson joined the faculty, his focus shifted to mathematical models of memory. One model they produced explained "hypothesis testing behavior of subjects learning very simple classifications  (concepts)  in  the  standard  trial-by-trial procedures  that  overtaxed  memory." After wearying of studying models of memory, Bower shifted his focus to study [[short-term memory]]. He worked on a team that created both the time-decay queuing model and the fixed-space displacement model to describe how items in short-term memory might be lost before they could be encoded in [[long-term memory]]. This spawned into research into how organizational devices could expand the capacity of short-term memory past the traditional 7 items. A particular mnemonic device that Bower researched that is still popular today is [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]], in which a person groups objects together to improve memory.<ref name="Bower 2007"/> His works during this time also included the huge benefits of mnemonic aids and how these aids are often converted into visual images, human associative memory and propositional learning, state dependent memory, connectionist modeling for categorical learning, and how we remember narratives.<ref name="Bower 2007"/> 

In 1979 he was honored with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contribution by the American Psychological Association.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Awards for Distinguished Scientific Contributions: Gordon H.

Bower died on June 17, 2020 at his home in Stanford, California.<ref>[https://www.paloaltoonline.com/obituaries/memorials/gordon-howard-bower?o=6302]</ref>
