==Education and early career==

Upon completing her PhD, Wood became a professor in the department of politics at [[New York University]].<ref name=profile1/> She remained a professor in that department until 2004, when she moved to Yale University. During this time she also began a professorship at the [[Santa Fe Institute]]<ref name=sfi>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jenna |url=https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/righting-balance-new-apsr-editors-meet-sfi-discuss-gender-and-race-scientific-publishing |date=2019-07-26 |title=Righting the balance: New APSR editors meet at SFI to discuss gender and race in scientific publishing | publisher=Santa Fe Institute |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> in 2002 which she held until 2010. From 2010 to 2017, she was a member of the external faculty at the Santa Fe Institute.<ref name=profile1/>

==Career==
In 2000, Wood published her first book, ''Forging Democracy from Below: Insurgent Transitions in South Africa and El Salvador''. In this book, Wood uses micro-level [[ethnography|ethnographic data]] obtained from fieldwork in the two cases of [[El Salvador]] and [[South Africa]] to argue that the process of democratization can be prompted by alliances of workers and impoverished people who confront established [[elites]].<ref name=pearce01>{{cite journal |title=Reviewed Work(s): Forging Democracy from below: Insurgent Transitions in South Africa and El Salvador by Elisabeth Wood |first=Jenny |last=Pearce |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=95 |number=3 |date=September 2001 |pages=758–759 |publisher=American Political Science Association|doi=10.1017/S0003055400500458 |s2cid=147060752 }}</ref> In ''Forcing Democracy from Below'', Wood studies the conditions in which this sort of democratization process can be successful.<ref name=pearce01/>

Wood's second book, ''Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador'', was published in 2003. Wood studies the cooperation of rural people and agricultural cooperatives with a political insurgency in El Salvador, arguing that many individuals overcame the [[collective action problem]] to participate in a dangerous insurgency because of a combination of beliefs that the insurgency would have positive effects, a desire to express defiance, and the pleasure of expressing individual agency.<ref name=shefner04>{{cite journal |title=Reviewed Work: Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador by Elisabeth Jean Wood |first=Jon |last=Shefner |journal=Contemporary Sociology |volume=33 |number=5 |date=September 2004 |pages=585–586|doi=10.1177/009430610403300548 |s2cid=143791137 }}</ref> In reviewing the book, Jon Shefner noted that the field sites that Wood spent time in to research the book were particularly challenging and dangerous, and that she documented her findings with noteworthy methodological precision.<ref name=shefner04/>
