Harper recruited acclaimed Yale baseball and football player [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] from the [[YMCA|Young Men's Christian Association]] training school at [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield]] to coach the school's football program. Stagg was given a position on the faculty, the first such athletic position in the United States. While coaching at the university, Stagg invented the numbered football jersey, the huddle, and the lighted playing field.

In the 1890s, the university, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: [[Des Moines College]], [[Kalamazoo College]], [[Butler University]], and [[Stetson University]]. In 1896, the university affiliated with [[Shimer College]] in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except for travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.<ref>Gilbert Lycan, ''Stetson University: The First 100 Years at 70â€“72,'' pp. 165â€“185 (Stetson University Press, 1983)</ref>

In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial [[Hyde Park, Chicago#Urban renewal|urban renewal project for Hyde Park]], which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.<ref>Boyer, John W.

The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962 when then-freshman [[Bernie Sanders]] helped lead a [[University of Chicago sit-ins|15-day sit-in at the college's administration building]] in a protest over the university's off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report.

When ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education.
