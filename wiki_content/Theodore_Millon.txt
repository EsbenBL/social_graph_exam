==Theoretical work==
Millon has written numerous popular works on personality, developed diagnostic questionnaire tools such as the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]], and contributed to the development of earlier versions of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].

Among other diagnoses, Millon advocated for an expanded version of [[Passive aggressive behavior|passive aggressive personality disorder]], which he termed 'negativistic' personality disorder and argued could be diagnosed by criteria such as "expresses envy and resentment toward those apparently more fortunate" and "claims to be luckless, ill-starred, and jinxed in life; personal content is more a matter of whining and grumbling than of feeling forlorn and despairing" (APA, 1991, R17). Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder was expanded somewhat as an official diagnosis in the DSM-III-R but then relegated to the appendix of DSM-IV, tentatively renamed 'Passive-Aggressive (Negativistic) Personality Disorder'.<ref name="Lane">{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=C.|title=The Surprising History of Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder|journal=Theory & Psychology|date=1 February 2009|volume=19|issue=1|pages=55–70|doi=10.1177/0959354308101419|url=http://www.christopherlane.org/documents/Lane.PAPDisorder.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.532.5027}}</ref>
