'''Harold Demsetz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|m|s|ɛ|t|s}}; May 31, 1930 – January 4, 2019)<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wMTAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Demsetz,+Harold%22+AND+%221930%22 |title=Enciclopedia italiana di scienze, lettere ed arti |last1=Istituto Giovanni Treccani |first1=Rome |year=1938}}</ref> was an American professor of [[economics]] at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA).

==Career==
Demsetz grew up on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago, the grandchild of [[Jewish]] immigrants from central and eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Read |first=C. |date=2015|title=The Corporate Financiers |chapter=Harold Demsetz |location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}</ref> He  studied engineering, forestry, and philosophy at four universities before being awarded a B.A. (1953) in economics from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], and an MBA (1954) and a Ph.D. (1959) from [[Northwestern University]]. While a graduate student, he published an article each in ''[[Econometrica]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.

Demsetz taught at the [[University of Michigan]] (1958–60), UCLA, 1960–63, and the Graduate School of Business at the [[University of Chicago]], 1963–71. In 1971, he returned permanently to UCLA's Economics Department, which he chaired 1978–80. He held the Arthur Andersen UCLA Alumni Chair in Business Economics, 1986–95. He has been affiliated with the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] and the [[Hoover Institution]].

Demsetz was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a director of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], and a past (1996) president of the Western Economics Association.

==Work==
Demsetz belonged to the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] of economic theory, and was one of the pioneers of the approach now called [[New Institutional Economics]]. He is a founder of the field of [[managerial economics]]. He has expanded the theory of [[property rights]] now prevalent in [[law and economics]]. Even though Demsetz never employed [[game theory]], he is a major figure in [[industrial organization]] through his writings on the [[theory of the firm]], [[antitrust law|antitrust policy]], and business [[regulation]]. His expository style is devoid of mathematical formalism to an extent unusual for someone who began his career after 1950. His principal influences include [[Frank Knight]] and a number of colleagues: [[Armen Alchian]], [[Ronald Coase]], [[Aaron Director]], and [[George Stigler]].

Demsetz coined the term "[[nirvana fallacy]]" in 1969.<ref>{{Citation |last=Demsetz |first=Harold |year=1969 |title=Information and Efficiency: Another Viewpoint |journal=Journal of Law & Economics |volume=12 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1086/466657 |s2cid=222327886 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/06/peter-t-leeson/anarchy-unbound-or-why-self-governance-works-better-than-you-think/ |title = Anarchy Unbound, or: Why Self-Governance Works Better than You Think|date = 2007-08-06}}</ref>
<!--Darüber hinaus legte Demsetz in der Regulierungstheorie die formalen Grundsteine für eine zeitweise Versteigerung von [[natürliches Monopol|natürlichen Monopolen]]. Seine Arbeiten können als frühe Ansätze der [[Theorie der bestreitbaren Märkte]] angesehen werden.-->

The 1972 Demsetz and [[Armen Alchian]] article ''Production, Information Costs and Economic Organization'' was selected as one of the twenty most important articles published in the first century of the ''American Economic Review''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1257/aer.101.1.1| title=100 Years of the ''American'' Economic Review: The Top 20 Articles| journal=American Economic Review| volume=101| pages=1–8| year=2011| last1=Arrow| first1=Kenneth J.| last2=Bernheim| first2=B.
