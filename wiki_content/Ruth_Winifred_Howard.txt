==Early life==
Ruth Winifred Howard was born on March 25, 1900, in [[Washington D.C.]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Held|first=Lisa|title=Profile of Ruth Howard|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/ruth-howard/|publisher=Psychology's Feminist Voices Multimedia Internet Archive|year=2010}}</ref> to Reverend William J. Howard and Alverda Brown Howard. She was the youngest of 8 children.<ref name="Moore" /> As a child, she enjoyed reading and aspired to be a librarian.<ref name=Moore />  Howard's mother strongly encouraged her reading habit. She considered her father's active work in the community as one of the main sources of her passion to help other people and as what influenced her work with disabled children. In 1916, she graduated from the historic M Street High school, now known as [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]].<ref name="Guthrie 178">Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 178.</ref>

==Education and career==
After graduating from high school, Howard attended [[Simmons College]] in Boston, Massachusetts where she majored in [[social work]]. In 1921, she received her [[bachelor's degree]] and moved to Cleveland, Ohio where she started as a social worker. Shortly after, she went back to Simmons College and received her [[master's degree]] in 1927.

Howard received the [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller fellowship]] in 1929 and again in 1930.

Howard studied the development of [[triplets]] for her [[doctoral dissertation]]. One of her main conclusions was that triplets were less developed in general abilities compared to single children. She was awarded an internship at the [[Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research]] after receiving her doctorate and eventually began her own [[clinical psychology]]-based private practice.

From 1940-1964, Howard co-directed the [[Center for Psychological Services]] with her husband [[Albert Sidney Beckham]]. During this time, Howard also held the staff psychologist position at the [[Provident Hospital School of Nursing]] in Chicago, which trained African American nurses. Additionally, she held the position of a psychological consultant at Florida and Missouri schools of nursing while lecturing, working at psychology clinics, and consulting for other organizations.

From 1964-1966, she worked at the [[McKinley Center for Retarded Children]] as a psychologist. Afterwards, she worked at [[Worthington and Hurst Psychological Consultants]] as a staff psychologist until 1968. She then became a psychologist for the [[Chicago Board of Health]] until 1972.<ref name="Moore" />
