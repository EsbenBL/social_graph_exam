Retrieved September 23, 2020.</ref> (see, [[Black swan theory]]).

In a testimony given in 1985 to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], Arzac stated, ''testified without [[rebuttal]] that the appropriate method for calculating delay damages to make [the plaintiff] whole would be by using [[compound interest]] and showed the inequity of using [[simple interest]]''. His testimony persuaded the Court that "compound interest may more nearly fit with the policy to accomplish complete justice as between the plaintiff and the United States" under the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment.<ref name="30lTk" /> This landmark case effectively changed the centuries-old interpretation of the just compensation clause of the [[Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution]] and has been the basis of compensation judgements ever since.<ref name="v6trK" />
