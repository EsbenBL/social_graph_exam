==Life and work==
Behar was born in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] in 1956 to a Jewish-Cuban family of Sephardic Turkish, and Ashkenazi Polish and Russian ancestry.

More than 94% of Cuban Jews left the country at that time,<ref name="virtual">[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Cuba.html "Cuba"], Jewish Virtual Library</ref> together with many others of the middle and upper classes.

She studied [[cultural anthropology]] at [[Princeton University]], earning her doctorate in 1983.

=== ''Lucky Broken Girl'' ===
''Lucky Broken Girl'' (2017) is multicultural coming-of-age novel for young adults, based on the author's childhood in the 1960s.
Ruthie Mizrahi and her family recently emigrated from Castro's Cuba to New York City. Just when she's finally beginning to gain confidence in her mastery of English –and enjoying her reign as her neighborhood's hopscotch queen – a horrific car accident leaves her in a body cast and confined to her bed for a long recovery. As Ruthie's world shrinks because of her inability to move, her powers of observation and her heart grow larger and she comes to understand how fragile life is, how vulnerable we all are as human beings, and how friends, neighbors, and the power of the arts can sweeten even the worst of times. Writing for Cuba Counterpoints, Julie Schwietert Collazo writes, "Behar, without fail, always seems to be writing with the goal of honoring her own history, experiences, and feelings, without ever denying or excluding those of others, and in Lucky Broken Girl the achievement of this goal is evident on every page."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cubacounterpoints.com/archives/5189|title=Ruth Behar's Lucky Broken Girl.

=== ''Traveling Heavy'' ===
''Traveling Heavy'' (2013) is a memoir about her Cuban-American family, descended from both Askenazi and Sephardic Jews in Cuba, as well as the strangers who ease her journey in life. Her probings about her complicated Jewish Cuban ancestry and family's immigration to America explore issues about identity and belonging.<ref name="kirkus">[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ruth-behar/traveling-heavy/ : Ruth Behar, ''Traveling Heavy''], ''Kirkus Reviews''</ref> Kirkus Reviews described her book as "A heartfelt witness to the changing political and emotional landscape of the Cuban-American experience."<ref name="kirkus"/> Behar studies the revitalization of Cuban Jewish life as an anthropologist, but her personal journey back to the island she left as a little girl is the heart of this "memoir I snuck in, between journeys."<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/05/07/book-review-traveling-heavy-ruth-behar/63bQLREGr3TWK6bOtobcSN/story.html Review: Ruth Behar, ''Traveling Heavy'"], ''Boston Globe'', 7 May 2013</ref>

=== ''An Island Called Home'' ===
''An Island Called Home'' (2007) was written in Behar's quest for a better understanding of Jewish Cuba and particularly her family's roots.<ref name="heritage">{{cite news|last=Veciana-Suarez|first=Ana|title=Author's heritage draws her back to Cuba's Jews|url=http://ruthbehar.com/ruth,%20miami,%20book%20fair,%20miami%20herald,%2011%2003%2007.pdf|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=November 3, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114230/http://ruthbehar.com/ruth,%20miami,%20book%20fair,%20miami%20herald,%2011%2003%2007.pdf|archivedate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> She noted, "I knew the stories of the Jews in Cuba, but it was all about looking at them as a community".<ref name="heritage"/> Traveling the island, Behar becomes the confidante to a host of Jewish strangers, building connections for further anthropological research. Conducting one-on-one interviews, combined with black-and-white photography, she builds readers an image of the diasporic thread connecting Cuban Jews to one another.<ref name="heritage"/>

Beginning with Jewish immigrants of the 1920s, who fled unrest in Turkey, Russia and Poland, she moves on to stories of later immigrants, Polish and German Jews who fled to Cuba in the 1930s and 1940s in order to escape persecution and the concentration camps of the [[Nazis]]. In Cuba immigrants opened mom-and-pop shops, peddled, and gradually adopted Spanish while still speaking [[Yiddish]], settling into Latino life in La Habana Vieja. In the early part of the century, many Jewish immigrants worked in the Cuban garment industry.<ref name="virtual"/> More than 94% left during and after the 1959 revolution.<ref name="virtual"/><ref name="Island review">{{cite magazine|title=Nonfiction Review: An Island Called Home: Returning to Jewish Cuba by Ruth Behar|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8135-4189-1|magazine=Publisher's Weekly|date=September 24, 2007}}</ref> As her family was among those who left Cuba, Behar intertwines her personal thoughts and feelings with her professional, analytical observations of the current society.<ref name="heritage"/>

=== ''The Vulnerable Observer'' ===
''The Vulnerable Observer'' recounts Behar's passage to integrating subjective aspects into her anthropological studies. Suffering her grandfather's death while on a field trip to Spain to study funeral practices, she decided the ethnographer could never be fully detached, and needed to become a "vulnerable observer".<ref name="Vulnerable review">{{cite magazine|title=Nonfiction Review: The Vulnerable Observer by Ruth Behar|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8070-4630-2|magazine=Publisher's Weekly|year=1996}}</ref> She argues that the ethnographic fieldworker should identify and work though, his or her own emotional involvement with the subject under study.<ref name="Vulnerable review"/> She strongly critiques conventional ideas of objectivity.<ref name="DeVault">M. L. DeVault, "Book Review: Behar/'The Vulnerable Observer'," ''Contemporary Sociology,'' 1998</ref> She suggested that the ideal of a "scientific," distanced, impersonal mode of presenting materials was incomplete.<ref name="DeVault"/> Other anthropologists, including [[Claude Levi-Strauss]], [[George Devereux|Georges Devereux]], and [[Clifford Geertz]], had also suggested that the researcher had to claim being part of the process more openly. Behar's six personal essays in ''The Vulnerable Observer'' are examples of her subjective approach.<ref name="Vulnerable review"/>

Behar's grandparents emigrated to Cuba from Russia, Poland and Turkey during the 1920s. In 1962 they fled Cuba to escape Castro's communism.<ref name="DeVault"/> At the age of nine, Behar suffered a broken leg from the crash of her family's car. She was immobilized for a year.<ref name="Vulnerable review"/> The experience and recovery period led her to the recognition that "the body is a homeland" of stored memory and pain.<ref name="DeVault"/>

=== ''Translated Woman'' ===
In 1985, Behar was working in Mexico when she befriended an Indian witch working as a street peddler.<ref name="Translated">{{cite web|title=Nonfiction Review: Translated Woman by Ruth Behar|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8070-7052-9|date=January 4, 1993}}</ref> Townspeople said the witch, Esperanza Hernandez, had used black magic to blind her ex-husband after he regularly beat her and then left her for his mistress.<ref name="Translated"/> Behar's portrayal of Esperanza's story in ''Translated Woman'' suggests she alienated her own mother, inspiring Behar to portray Esperanza as a feminist heroine.<ref name="Translated"/> Esperanza claims she found redemption in a spiritualist cult constructed around Pancho Villa. She blamed pent-up rage about her husband and life as the reason for the deaths in infancy of the first six of her 12 children.<ref name="Translated"/> Esperanza's rage led her to beat up her husband's lover, throw her son out of the house, beat a daughter for refusing to support her, and disown another son for having an affair with an uncle's ex-mistress because she considered it to be incestuous.<ref name="Translated"/> Behar reflects on her own life and begins to think that her Latina-gringa conflicts result from a feeling of loss after having tried to model herself according to the American Dream, thus losing some sense of her Cuban Jewish family's past in that island nation.<ref name="Sanchez">B. Sanchez, "Book Review: 'Translated Woman'," ''Hispanic Magazine,'' 1993</ref> Esperanza's odyssey examines physical borders, margins and separations.<ref name="Sanchez"/> ''Translated Woman'' contributes to the feminist argument that studying women in anthropology has been undervalued due to traditional academic prejudices that view women-centered analysis as too personally biased.<ref name="Perez">E. Perez, "Book Review: Behar/Translated Woman," ''Journal of American History,'' September 1994</ref>
