'''David Charles Stark''' is Arthur Lehman Professor of [[Sociology]] at [[Columbia University]], where he served as chair of the sociology department and currently directs the [[Center on Organizational Innovation]]. He is also Professor of Social Science at the [[University of Warwick]]. He was formerly an External Faculty Member of the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. He is well-cited in the fields of [[economic sociology]], [[social networks]], science and technology studies, and social change and development.

==Biography==

He received a B.A. (<i>summa cum laude</i>) from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1972 and a Ph.D. in [[sociology]] from [[Harvard]] in 1982.  Stark was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 2002.  He is the former president of the [[Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics]], and has been a visiting fellow at numerous institutions, including at the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Sciences Po]] in Paris, the Institute for Advanced Study at [[Zhejiang University]] in China, [[Copenhagen Business School]], the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]], the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] in New York City, the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] in [[Palo Alto]], the Institute for Advanced Study/Collegium Budapest, the [[Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, the [[WZB|Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB)]], and the [[Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen|Institute for Human Sciences]] in [[Vienna]].  Stark won the  2009 [[W. Richard Scott]] Award for Distinguished Scholarship from the American Sociological Association for his paper, “Social Times of Network Spaces” (with Balazs Vedres), which appeared in ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' (2006). In 2013 he received a Doctor Honoris Causa (Honorary Doctorate) from the [[École normale supérieure de Cachan]].

==Work==

He has been a leading contributor in developing the concept of [[heterarchy]], referring to the process of distributed intelligence and diversity of evaluative principles in organizations.  He coined the term "recombinant property" to analyze asset ambiguity during the transformation of the economies of the former Soviet bloc.  It has been adopted to study processes of innovation in high technology sectors of the United States and Western Europe.

Stark has been a leading contributor to the new [[economic sociology]]. His research uses ethnographic fieldwork and [[social network]] analysis. In examining organizational forms as sites of multiple evaluative principles, or frames of worth, he has carried out field research in Hungarian factories before and after 1989, in new media startups in Manhattan before and after the dot.com crash of hi-tech firm stocks in 2000, and in a [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]] [[trading room]] before and after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  His work with Balazs Vedres developed a combination of network and sequence analytic methods, a key development in the emerging field of [[social sequence analysis]].

In his book,'' The Sense of Dissonance: Accounts of Worth in Economic Life,'' published in 2009, Stark draws on much of his recent research in post-socialist transformations in Hungary, his study of new media firms in Silicon Alley, and his work on decision making in trading rooms.  Stark ties these examples together and suggests a number of key determinants of innovation within organization.  Foremost of these determinants is a wealth of different goals and notions of worth motivating actors in an organization.  With different conceptions of what is valuable, he argues, organizations can be equipped to succeed in a search in which what they are searching for is unclear (how Stark defines innovation).<ref name="Book's page on Stark's website">{{cite book|last=Stark|first=David|title=The Sense of Dissonance: Accounts of Worth in Economic Life|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton and Oxford|url=http://www.thesenseofdissonance.com/book.php|access-date=2011-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106224823/http://www.thesenseofdissonance.com//book.php|archive-date=2012-01-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As of 2016 Stark has been principal investigator on the [[European Research Council]] Horizon 2020 project BLINDSPOT: Diversity and Performance in Networks and Teams.<ref>BLINDSPOT website https://blindspot.cim.warwick.ac.uk/</ref>

In 2020, Stark co-edited with Noortje Marres a special issue of the <i>[[British Journal of Sociology]]</i> on the sociology of testing. In the same year, Stark also edited the [[Oxford University Press]] book <i>The Performance Complex: Competition and Competitions in Social Life </i>.

In 2021, Stark co-edited with Ivana Pais a special issue of <i>[[Sociologica]]</i> titled 'Power and Control in Platform Monopoly Capitalism.'
