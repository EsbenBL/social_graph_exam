'''Philip Cowley''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political scientist]] and an [[academic]] at [[Queen Mary University of London]] in the School of Politics and International Relations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cowley, Philip|url = http://www.politics.qmul.ac.uk/staff/cowleyphilip.html|website = www.politics.qmul.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-01-26|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205050403/http://www.politics.qmul.ac.uk/staff/cowleyphilip.html|archive-date = 2016-02-05|url-status = dead}}</ref> He previously held the same title at the [[University of Nottingham]]. Within academia he is particularly notable for his analysis of [[Parliamentary]] voting behaviour in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]] and secondly his opposition to a lowering of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[voting age]] below 18.

==Parliamentary Revolts==
Cowley is involved in the continuous production of highly detailed and closely analysed briefing papers and reports of divisions in the [[UK Parliament]], with eye-witness accounts of [[whip (politics)|whipping]] practices in action, counts and comparisons of rebellious voting by [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarians]] and discussion of how such activity impacts on its political context.  He co-ordinates this work through the maintenance of a [[website]] produced in a blog format.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Clocking On And Off? I'd Vote For That| pages = 71| publisher = [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]| date = April 22, 2005}}</ref>  He is assisted by his colleagues [[Mark Stuart (political scientist)|Mark Stuart]], also of the [[University of Nottingham]], and [[Philip Norton, Baron Norton of Louth|Lord Norton]] of the [[University of Hull]].  They are funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] and through previous research by their respective universities and the [[Leverhulme Trust]]. The project is not affiliated to any political party, nor does it receive funding from any other source.

=="Votes for Adults"==
He has produced a [[website]] entitled "Votes for Adults" in which he claims to dismiss comprehensively the arguments put forward in support of a reduction of the [[voting age]] to 16.  This is in opposition to the [[Votes at 16]] campaign, supported by a broad coalition of youth charities and other organisations.
