== Writings ==
=== Culture ===
The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has described Cowen as "a man who can talk about [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian voodoo]] flags, [[Cinema of Iran|Iranian cinema]], [[Hong Kong cuisine]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Zaire|Zairian]] music and [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican folk art]] with seemingly equal facility".<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/07/entertainment/et-akst7 The joy of thinking globally], February 7, 2003, Daniel Akst, ''Los Angeles Times''</ref> One of Cowen's primary research interests is the economics of culture. He has written books on fame (''What Price Fame?''), art (''In Praise of Commercial Culture'') and cultural trade (''Creative Destruction: How Globalization Is Changing the World's Cultures''). In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zK6slb9fZykC&dq=Tyler+Cowen&pg=PP1&ots=cFu0Wi6NJw&sig=4CnAf6BfoL1LPo67tDwzFI0p0pI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPP1,M1 Markets and Cultural Voices]'', he relays how [[globalization]] is changing the world of three [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[amatl|amate]] painters. Cowen argues that [[free markets]] change culture for the better, allowing them to evolve into something more people want. Other books include ''Public Goods and Market Failures'', ''The Theory of Market Failure'', ''Explorations in the New Monetary Economics'', ''Risk and Business Cycles'', ''Economic Welfare'' and ''New Theories of Market Failure''.

== Political philosophy ==
Cowen has written papers on political philosophy and ethics. He co-wrote a paper with philosopher [[Derek Parfit]] arguing against the [[social discount rate]].<ref>"Against the social discount rate" by Derek Parfit and Tyler Cowen, in Peter Laslett & James S. Fishkin (eds.) ''Justice between age groups and generations'', Yale University Press: New Haven, 1992, pp. 144–161.</ref> In a 2006 paper, he argued that the [[uncertainty|epistemic problem]] fails to refute [[consequentialism]].<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.357.2120&rep=rep1&type=pdf "The Epistemic Problem Does Not Refute Consequentialism"] by Tyler Cowen, Utilitas (2006), 18: 383–399, [https://web.archive.org/web/20210926182645/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.357.2120&rep=rep1&type=pdf archived] 26 September 2021 at the [[Wayback Machine]].</ref>

Cowen has been described as a "[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] bargainer" who can influence practical policy making,<ref>[[Daniel B. Klein|Klein, Daniel B.]] "[http://www.ratio.se/pdf/wp/wp_dk_mere.pdf Mere Libertarianism: Blending Hayek and Rothbard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529174751/http://www.ratio.se/pdf/wp/wp_dk_mere.pdf |date=May 29, 2008 }}". ''Reason Papers''. Vol. 27: Fall 2004.</ref> yet he endorsed bank bailouts in his March 2, 2009 column in ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/economy/01view.html?_r=1&scp=5&sq=Cowen&st=cse | work=New York Times | first=Tyler | last=Cowen | title=Message to Regulators: Bank Fix Needed Quickly | date=March 1, 2009}}</ref> In a 2007 article entitled "The Paradox of Libertarianism", Cowen argued that libertarians "should embrace a world with growing wealth, growing positive liberty, and yes, growing government. We don't have to favor the growth in government ''per se'', but we do need to recognize that sometimes it is a package deal".<ref>[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/03/11/tyler-cowen/the-paradox-of-libertarianism/ "The Paradox of Libertarianism"].</ref>

In 2012, [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] called Cowen "one of the most influential bloggers on the [[Right-wing politics|right]]", writing that he is among those who "start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a [[Dogma|doctrinaire]] way".<ref>{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=David|title=The Conservative Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/opinion/brooks-the-conservative-future.html?ref=davidbrooks&_r=2&|access-date=28 November 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=2012-11-19}}</ref>

In an August, 2014 blog post, Cowen wrote: "Just to summarize, I generally favor much more immigration but not [[open borders]], I am a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] on most but not all [[social issues]], and I am market-oriented on economic issues. On most current foreign policy issues I am genuinely agnostic as to what exactly we should do but skeptical that we are doing the right thing at the moment. I don't like voting for either party or for third parties".<ref name="auto">{{cite news |last=Cowen |first=Tyler |date=4 August 2014 |title=Matt Yglesias on Tyler Cowen |url=http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/08/matt-yglesias-on-tyler-cowen.html|newspaper=Marginal Revolution|access-date=24 March 2017 }}</ref>

In a 2020 New Year's Day Marginal Revolution post, Cowen outlined a philosophical framework he dubbed "State Capacity Libertarianism". State Capacity Libertarianism differs from [[classical liberalism]] in that it acknowledges the State's role in funding and executing [[megaprojects]] and a non-isolationist foreign policy.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowen |first=Tyler |date=1 January 2020 |title=What libertarianism has become and will become — State Capacity Libertarianism |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html | newspaper=Marginal Revolution|access-date=17 October 2021 }}</ref>

Cowen has described himself as a liberal on most social issues<ref name="auto"/> and supports same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowen |first= Tyler |date=9 April 2009 |title=A Bayesian approach to legal gay marriage |url= https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/04/blogging-gay-marriage.html |newspaper= Marginal Revolution |access-date= 30 September 2018 }}</ref> After the Supreme Court issued its holding regarding same-sex marriage, Cowen said that "this is exciting and very positive news. Most of all, it is a breakthrough for those people who can now marry, or exercise the choice not to marry".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowen |first= Tyler |date=26 June 2015 |title=Legal gay marriage |url= https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/06/legal-gay-marriage.html |newspaper= Marginal Revolution |access-date= 2 December 2018 }}</ref>

Cowen is a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]], stating he is "with the Mormons" on alcohol,<ref>{{cite news |last= Cowen |first=Tyler |date=12 August 2017 |title=I'm with the Mormons on this one — how about you? |url= https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/08/im-mormons-one.html |newspaper= Marginal Revolution|access-date=27 October 2018 }}</ref> later stating: "I encourage people to just completely, voluntarily abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowen |first=Tyler |date=16 October 2018 |title=Rob Wiblin interviews Tyler on *Stubborn Attachments* (BONUS) |url= https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-robert-wiblin-stubborn-attachments-80000-hours-podcast-359aa62aa8ab |access-date=27 October 2018 }}</ref>
