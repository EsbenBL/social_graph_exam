In [[ancient Rome]], the ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' (plural in Latin ''genii'') was the guiding spirit or [[tutelary deity]] of a [[person]], family (''[[gens]]''), or place (''[[genius loci]]'').<ref>genius.

==Historical development==
===Galton===
[[Image:Cervantes Jáuregui.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Miguel de Cervantes]], novelist who is acknowledged as a [[literature|literary]] genius]]

The assessment of intelligence was initiated by [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911) and [[James McKeen Cattell]]. They had advocated the analysis of reaction time and sensory acuity as measures of "neurophysiological efficiency" and the analysis of sensory acuity as a measure of [[intelligence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Fancher |first=Raymond E |title=Alfred Binet, General Psychologist |pages=67–84 |series=Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology |volume=III |editor-first=Gregory A |editor-last=Kimble |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Wertheimer |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=1998 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=978-1-55798-479-1}}</ref>

Galton is regarded as the founder of [[psychometrics|psychometry]]. He studied the work of his older half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]] about biological evolution. Hypothesizing that eminence is inherited from ancestors, Galton did a study of families of eminent people in Britain, publishing it in 1869 as ''[[Hereditary Genius]]''.<ref name=":0">{{harvnb|Galton|1869}}</ref> Galton's ideas were elaborated from the work of two early 19th-century pioneers in [[statistics]]: [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Gauss discovered the [[normal distribution]] (bell-shaped curve): given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions, they vary at [[Randomness|random]] from a most frequent value, the "average", to two least frequent values at maximum differences greater and lower than the most frequent value. Quetelet discovered that the bell-shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the French government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military. His initial work in criminology led him to observe "the greater the number of individuals observed the more do peculiarities become effaced...". This ideal from which the peculiarities were effaced became "the average man".<ref>{{cite book|page= [https://archive.org/details/againstgodsremar00pete_0/page/160 160]|title=Against the gods|first=Peter L.|last=Bernstein|publisher=Wiley|year=1998|isbn=0-471-12104-5|url=https://archive.org/details/againstgodsremar00pete_0/page/160 }}</ref>

Galton was inspired by Quetelet to define the average man as "an entire normal scheme"; that is, if one combines the normal curves of every measurable human characteristic, one will, in theory, perceive a syndrome straddled by "the average man" and flanked by persons that are different. In contrast to Quetelet, Galton's average man was not statistical but was theoretical only. There was no measure of general averageness, only a large number of very specific averages. Setting out to discover a general measure of the average, Galton looked at educational statistics and found bell-curves in test results of all sorts; initially in mathematics grades for the final honors examination and in entrance examination scores for [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]].

Galton's method in ''Hereditary Genius'' was to count and assess the eminent relatives of eminent men. He found that the number of eminent relatives was greater with a closer degree of kinship. This work is considered the first example of [[historiometry]], an analytical study of historical human progress. The work is controversial and has been criticized for several reasons. Galton then departed from Gauss in a way that became crucial to the history of the 20th century AD. The bell-shaped curve was not random, he concluded. The differences between the average and the upper end were due to a non-random factor, "natural ability", which he defined as "those qualities of intellect and disposition, which urge and qualify men to perform acts that lead to reputation…a nature which, when left to itself, will, urged by an inherent stimulus, climb the path that leads to eminence."<ref>Bernstein (1998), page 163.</ref> The apparent randomness of the scores was due to the randomness of this natural ability in the population as a whole, in theory.

Criticisms include that Galton's study fails to account for the impact of social status and the associated availability of resources in the form of economic inheritance, meaning that inherited "eminence" or "genius" can be gained through the enriched environment provided by wealthy families. Galton went on to develop the field of [[eugenics]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gillham |first1=Nicholas W. |title=Sir Francis Galton and the birth of eugenics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |date=2001 |pmid=11700278 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.090055}}</ref> Galton attempted to control for economic inheritance by comparing the adopted nephews of popes, who would have the advantage of wealth without being as closely related to popes as sons are to their fathers, to the biological children of eminent individuals.<ref name=":0" />

{{see also|Creativity and mental illness}}

Genius is expressed in a variety of forms (e.g., mathematical, literary, musical performance). Persons with genius tend to have strong intuitions about their domains, and they build on these insights with tremendous energy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Carl Rogers]], a founder of the [[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic Approach to Psychology]], expands on the idea of a genius trusting his or her intuition in a given field, writing: "[[El Greco]], for example, must have realized as he looked at some of his early work, that 'good artists do not paint like that.' But somehow he trusted his own experiencing of life, the process of himself, sufficiently that he could go on expressing his own unique perceptions. It was as though he could say, 'Good artists don't paint like this, but ''I'' paint like this.' Or to move to another field, Ernest Hemingway was surely aware that 'good writers do not write like this.' But fortunately he moved toward being Hemingway, being himself, rather than toward someone else's conception of a good writer."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Carl|title=On Becoming a Person|url=https://archive.org/details/onbecomingperson00roge_969|url-access=limited|date=1995|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=0-395-75531-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/onbecomingperson00roge_969/page/n190 175]}}</ref>

A number of people commonly regarded as geniuses have been or were diagnosed with mental disorders, for example [[Vincent van Gogh]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/misc/mental.html |title=Van Gogh's Mental and Physical Health |access-date=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206110353/http://www.vangoghgallery.com/misc/mental.html |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Virginia Woolf]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/virginia-woolf-9536773 |title = Virginia Woolf}}</ref> [[John Forbes Nash Jr.]],<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/nash-bio.html John F.

It has been suggested that there exists a connection between mental illness, in particular [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], and genius.<ref>''[[Vladimir Pavlovich Efroimson|Efroimson, V. P.]]'' The Genetics of Genius. 2002</ref> Individuals with bipolar disorder and [[schizotypal personality disorder]], the latter of which being more common amongst relatives of schizophrenics, tend to show elevated creativity.<ref>{{harvnb|Thys|2014|p=146}}.</ref>

One of the investigators explained that "Fewer D2 receptors in the thalamus probably means a lower degree of signal filtering, and thus a higher flow of information from the thalamus." This could be a possible mechanism behind the ability of healthy highly creative people to see numerous uncommon connections in a problem-solving situation and the bizarre associations found in the schizophrenics.<ref name=deManzano2010/>

=== IQ and genius ===
[[Image:Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Albert Einstein]], [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] who is considered a genius]]
{{Main|IQ classification}}

Galton was a pioneer in investigating both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book ''Hereditary Genius'', written before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose "'near' genius or genius" as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test.<ref name="Terman1916p79" /> By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called [[Genetic Studies of Genius]], which he conducted for the rest of his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, ''The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses'',<ref name="Cox 1926"/> published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds,<ref name="PintneronCox" /><ref name="Shurkin1992pp70–71" /><ref name="EysenckonCox" /> Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius.<ref name="Cox1926pp215–219" /> By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term "genius" as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test.<ref name="TermanMerrill1960p18" /><ref name="Kaufman2009p117" /> In 1939, [[David Wechsler]] specifically commented that "we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score".<ref name="Wechsler1939p45" />

The Terman longitudinal study in California eventually provided historical evidence regarding how genius is related to IQ scores.<ref name="Eysenck1998pp127–128" /> Many California pupils were recommended for the study by schoolteachers. Two pupils who were tested but rejected for inclusion in the study (because their IQ scores were too low) grew up to be Nobel Prize winners in physics, [[William Shockley]],<ref name="Simonton1999p4" /><ref name="Shurkin2006p13" /> and [[Luis Walter Alvarez]].<ref name="Leslie2000" /><ref name="ParkLubinskiBenbow2010" /> Based on the historical findings of the Terman study and on biographical examples such as [[Richard Feynman]], who had a self-reported IQ of 125 and went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and become widely known as a genius,<ref name="Gleick2011p32" /><ref name="Robinson2011p47" /> the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of IQ (approximately 125) is necessary for genius but not sufficient, and must be combined with personality characteristics such as drive and persistence, plus the necessary opportunities for talent development.<ref name="Jensen1998p577" /><ref name="Eysenck1998p127a" /><ref name="Pickover1998p224"/> For instance, in a chapter in an edited volume on achievement, IQ researcher [[Arthur Jensen]] proposed a multiplicative model of genius consisting of high ability, high productivity, and high creativity.<ref>Jensen, A. R. (1996). “Giftedness and genius: Crucial differences”. In C. P. Benbow and D. Lubinski (Eds.), ''Intellectual talent: Psychometric and social issues'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Pp. 393—411.</ref> Jensen's model was motivated by the finding that eminent achievement is highly positively skewed, a finding known as [[Derek J. de Solla Price#Scientific contributions|Price's law]], and related to [[Lotka's law]].

Some high IQ individuals join a [[High IQ society]]. The most famous and largest is [[Mensa International]], but many other more selective organizations also exist, including [[Intertel]], [[Triple Nine Society]], [[Prometheus Society]], and [[Mega Society]].

==Philosophy==
[[Image:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] is widely acknowledged as having been a genius and a [[polymath]].]]

Various [[philosopher]]s have proposed definitions of what genius is and what that implies in the context of their [[Philosophy|philosophical]] theories.

In the philosophy of [[David Hume]], the way society perceives genius is similar to the way society perceives the ignorant. Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away from the rest of the world. <blockquote>On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hume|first=David|title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. — "Of the different Species of Philosophy"|url=http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/|publisher=Bartleby.com|location=New York|date=2001|access-date=2 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019195333/http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/1.html|archive-date=19 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>

In the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person. For Kant, originality was the essential character of genius.<ref>Howard Caygill, Kant Dictionary ({{ISBN|0-631-17535-0}}).</ref> The artworks of the Kantian genius are also characterized by their exemplarity which is imitated by other artists and serve as a rule for other aesthetical judgements.<ref name="oclc_7626030498">{{cite journal|author=Emine Hande Thuna|url=https://academic.oup.com/jaac/article/76/2/163/5997988?searchresult=1|title=Kant on Informed Pure Judgments of Taste|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume= 76|issue =2|date= April 1, 2018|pages= 163–174|doi=10.1111/jaac.12455|issn=0021-8529|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=May 20, 2021|oclc=7626030498}} (KU 5:308, cited in the section III-Products of Genius)</ref> This genius is a talent for producing ideas which can be described as non-imitative. Kant's discussion of the characteristics of genius is largely contained within the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' and was well received by the [[romanticism|Romantics]] of the early 19th century. In addition, much of Schopenhauer's theory of genius, particularly regarding talent and freedom from constraint, is directly derived from paragraphs of Part I of Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kant |first1=Immanuel |title=Kritik der Urteilskraft |trans-title=The Critique of Judgment |year=1790 |at=§46–§49}} E.g. §46: "Genius is a talent for producing something for which no determinate rule can be given, not a predisposition consisting of a skill for something that can be learned by following some rule or other." (trans. W.S. Pluhar).</ref>

{{quote|Genius is a talent for producing something for which no determinate rule can be given, not a predisposition consisting of a skill for something that can be learned by following some rule or other.|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]}}

In the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], a genius is someone in whom intellect predominates over "[[will (philosophy)|will]]" much more than within the average person. In [[Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics|Schopenhauer's aesthetics]], this predominance of the intellect over the will allows the genius to create artistic or academic works that are objects of pure, disinterested contemplation, the chief criterion of the aesthetic experience for Schopenhauer. Their remoteness from mundane concerns means that Schopenhauer's geniuses often display [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] traits in more mundane concerns; in Schopenhauer's words, they fall into the mire while gazing at the stars, an allusion to Plato's dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theætetus]]'', in which Socrates tells of [[Thales]] (the first philosopher) being ridiculed for falling in such circumstances. As he says in Volume 2 of ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'':

{{quote|Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.|author=[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]<ref name="Schopenhauer">{{cite book | author = Schopenhauer, Arthur | translator = Haldane, R.

In the philosophy of [[Bertrand Russell]], genius entails that an individual possesses [[Quality (philosophy)|unique qualities]] and [[Aptitude|talents]] that make the genius especially valuable to the society in which he or she operates, once given the chance to contribute to society. Russell's philosophy further maintains, however, that it is possible for such geniuses to be crushed in their youth and lost forever when the environment around them is unsympathetic to their potential maladaptive traits. Russell rejected the notion he believed was popular during his lifetime that, "genius will out".<ref>Page 91, ''The Conquest of Happiness'', {{ISBN|0-415-37847-8}}</ref>

In his classic work ''The Limitations of Science'',<ref name="sullivan">{{cite book | author = Sullivan, JWN | year = 1933 | title = The Limitations of Science | page = 167-168 | location = NY | publisher = Viking Press}}</ref> [[J. W. N. Sullivan]] discussed a utilitarian philosophy on the retrospective classification of genius. Namely, scholarship that is so original that, were it not for that particular contributor, would not have emerged until much later (if ever) is characteristic of genius. Conversely, scholarship that was ripe for development, no matter how profound or prominent, is not necessarily indicative of genius. In this context, Sullivan counted [[Albert Einstein]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as geniuses, but not [[Isaac Newton]] or [[Charles Darwin]].

==Literature and pop culture==
Geniuses are variously portrayed in literature and film as both [[protagonist]]s and [[antagonist]]s, and may be the [[hero]] or [[villain]] of the story. In [[Popular culture|pop culture]], the genius is often stereotypically depicted as either the wisecracking whiz or the tortured genius.<ref name="highability.org">{{Cite web|date=2020-12-26|title=Pop Culture Stereotypes and the Self-Concept of Gifted People|url=http://highability.org/511/how-pop-culture-stereotypes-impact-the-self-concept-of-highly-gifted-people/|access-date=2021-01-08|website=High Ability|language=en-US}}</ref>

Throughout both literature and movies, the tortured genius character is often seen as an imperfect or [[tragic hero]] who wrestles with the burden of superior intelligence, arrogance, eccentricities, addiction, awkwardness, mental health issues, a lack of social skills, isolation, or other insecurities.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-10|title=10 Best Movies About Tortured Geniuses, Ranked|url=https://screenrant.com/movies-tortured-geniuses-ranked/|access-date=2021-01-08|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Wolf|first=Elizabeth R.|date=2018|title=The trope of the tortured genius : an examination of 19th century British and American poetry|url=https://wlu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay/alma991010460729004161/01WLU_INST:01WLU|access-date=2021-01-08|website=wlu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com|language=en}}</ref> They regularly experience existential crises, struggling to overcome personal challenges to employ their special abilities for good or succumbing to their own tragic flaws and vices. This common motif repeated throughout fiction is notably present in the characters of [[Dr. Bruce Banner]] in ''[[The Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll]] in ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', among others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Incredible Hulk turns 30|url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1992/03/06/incredible-hulk-turns-30/|access-date=2021-01-08|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mills|first=Ryan|date=2019-10-11|title=Using the Incredible Hulk to Teach Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|url=https://classroom.popcultureclassroom.org/blog/using-the-incredible-hulk-to-teach-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/|access-date=2021-01-08|website=Pop Culture Classroom|language=en-US}}</ref> Although not as extreme, other examples of literary and filmic characterizations of the tortured genius stereotype, to varying degrees, include: [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] in ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|Dr. John Nash]] in ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in ''[[Da Vinci's Demons]]'', [[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]] in ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', [[Will Hunting]] in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', and [[Sheldon Cooper|Dr. Sheldon Cooper]] in ''[[The Big Bang Theory]].''

One of the most famous genius-level rivalries to occur in literary fiction is between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and his nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]], the latter character also identified as the modern archetype of an [[Mad scientist|evil genius]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Case of the Evil Genius|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/the-case-of-the-evil-genius.html|access-date=2021-01-08|website=Association for Psychological Science - APS|language=en-US}}</ref>

Since [[Film industry|Hollywood]] seems to have trouble capturing the actual nuance and complexity of genius in movies,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2009-10-15|title=The Problem With 'Geniuses' In Movies|url=https://www.overthinkingit.com/2009/10/15/the-problem-with-geniuses-in-movies/|access-date=2021-01-08|website=Overthinking It|language=en}}</ref> screenwriters and filmmakers usually appear to settle for unsatisfactory stereotypes instead. This further spreads misrepresentations and misunderstandings about genius in society.<ref name="highability.org"/> A recent comprehensive analysis of over 10,000 movie transcripts also suggests that there is a pattern of gender bias in the [[Western world]] that more frequently associates male characters with higher cognitive abilities and terms like "genius" in films.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Gálvez|first1=Ramiro|last2=Tiffenberg|first2=Valeria|last3=Altszyler|first3=Edgar|date=2018-04-01|title=Quantifying stereotyping associations between gender and intellectual ability in films|url=https://voxeu.org/article/gender-and-intellectual-ability-stereotypes-films|access-date=2021-01-08|website=VoxEU.org}}</ref>

So she proceeded to make a statistical correction in each case for lack of knowledge; this bumped up the figure considerably for the geniuses about whom little was in fact known…. I am rather doubtful about the justification for making the correction. To do so assumes that the geniuses about whom least is known were precocious but their previous activities were not recorded. This may be true, but it is also possible to argue that perhaps there was nothing much to record! I feel uneasy about making such assumptions; doing so may be very misleading." }}</ref>

Seventy–seven who were tested with the newly translated and standardized Binet test had IQs of 170 or higher–well at or above the level of Cox's geniuses. What happened to these potential geniuses–did they revolutionize society?… The answer in brief is that they did very well in terms of achievement, but none reached the Nobel Prize level, let alone that of genius…. It seems clear that these data powerfully confirm the suspicion that intelligence is not a sufficient trait for truly creative achievement of the highest grade.}}</ref>

This ''g'' threshold is probably at least one standard deviation above the mean level of ''g'' in the general population. Besides the traits that Galton thought necessary for "eminence" (viz., high ability, zeal, and persistence), ''genius'' implies outstanding creativity as well. Though such exceptional creativity is conspicuously lacking in the vast majority of people who have a high IQ, it is probably impossible to find any creative geniuses with low IQs. In other words, high ability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the emergence of socially significant creativity. Genius itself should not be confused with merely high IQ, which is what we generally mean by the term 'gifted'" (emphasis in original) }}</ref>

Indeed, they may have achieved very little; there are large numbers of Mensa members who are elected on the basis of an IQ test, but whose creative achievements are nil.
