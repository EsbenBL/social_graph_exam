'''Göran Therborn''' [[FAcSS]] (23 September 1941, [[Kalmar]], [[Sweden]]) is a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Cambridge University]] and is amongst the most highly cited contemporary [[Marxist sociology|Marxian-influenced sociologists]]. He has published widely in journals such as the ''[[New Left Review]]'', and is notable for his writing on topics that fall within the general political and sociological framework of [[post-Marxism]]. Topics on which he has written extensively include the intersection between the class structure of society and the function of the [[Ideological_State_Apparatus|state apparatus]], the formation of [[ideology]] within subjects, and the future of the Marxist tradition. Therborn was awarded the 2019 [[Lenin Award (Sweden)|Lenin Award]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leninpriset.se/pristagare/goran-therborn-2/|title=Göran Therborn {{!}} Leninpriset|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>

==Education==
Therborn attended [[Lund University]] in [[Sweden]], where he received a Fil. Dr. in 1974.<ref>[https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/professor-goran-therborn Department of Sociology, Cambridge University], Academic page</ref>

==Works==
In his book ''The Ideology of Power and the Power of Ideology'' (1980) Therborn departs from [[Louis Althusser]]'s writings on the formation of ideology by addressing ideological change, the ideological constitution of classes, and ideological domination. He develops a material matrix of ideologies, and a general outline of how ideologies are formed from a post-Marxist perspective.

''From Marxism to Post Marxism?'' (2008), attempts to convey in a relatively small amount of space a comprehensive history of the development of Marxist theory and the trajectory of Marxist thought in the 21st century.
