The concept first appeared in Brainard and Tobin's 1968 article "Pitfalls in Financial Model Building"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brainard |first1=W. C. |first2=J. |last2=Tobin |year=1968 |title=Pitfalls in Financial Model Building |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=99–122 |jstor=1831802 }}</ref> The letter "Q," however, was not introduced until Tobin's 1969 article "A general equilibrium approach to monetary theory."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tobin |first=J. |year=1969 |title=A General Equilibrium Approach To Monetary Theory |journal=[[Journal of Money, Credit and Banking]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–29 |doi=10.2307/1991374 |jstor=1991374 }}</ref> So, while references to "Q theory" generally carry only Tobin's name, Brainard and Tobin jointly introduced the concept.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[American Economic Association]]|title= Biography of William C. Brainard|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Brainard_bio.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> Brainard was co-editor with [[George Perry (American economist)|George Perry]] of the ''[[Brookings Papers on Economic Activity]]'' from 1980 through 2007, and continues to serve on its advisory panel.
