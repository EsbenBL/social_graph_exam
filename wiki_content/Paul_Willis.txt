==Background==

Paul Willis’s work has focused mainly, but not exclusively, on the ethnographic study of lived cultural forms in a wide variety of contexts. From highly structured to weakly structured ones, Willis examines how practices of `informal cultural production` help to produce and construct cultural worlds `from below`.<ref name="sassatelli_interview">Sassateli, Roberta.

Trained in literary criticism at Cambridge,<ref name="sassatelli_interview"/> Paul Willis received his PhD in 1972 from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University where he  remained as Senior Research Fellow until 1981. He gave a paper at the 9th Symposium of the [[National Deviancy Conference]] in January 1972 entitled 'A Motor-Bike Subculture'.<ref>Taylor, L. & Taylor, I. (eds) (1972) ''Politics and Deviance'', Harmondsworth: Penguin pg.213</ref> During the 1980s Willis served as youth policy adviser to Wolverhampton Borough Council in the English Midlands. There he produced The Youth Review (published by the Council and Ashgate) which formed the basis for youth policy and for the formation of the democratically elected Youth Council, both still functioning. During the 1990s he served first as Head of the Division of Media, Communications and Cultural Studies, and then as a member of the Professoriate at the University of Wolverhampton. In 2000 Willis co-founded the Sage journal, ''[[Ethnography (journal)|Ethnography]]''.  In 2003 Willis was hired as a Head Professor of social and cultural ethnography at Keele University.

Most recently, Paul Willis is a lecturer with the rank of professor in the Department of Sociology at [[Princeton University]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10358.html|isbn = 9780691163697|title = Profane Culture|date = 24 August 2014|last1 = Willis|first1 = Paul E.}}</ref> giving the Clifford Geertz Commemorative Lecture at Princeton in 2011.<ref>https://www.princeton.edu/anthropology/overview/</ref> He is also the founder and editor of the international journal ''Ethnography'' of Sage Publishing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal/ethnography|title = Ethnography|date = 29 October 2015}}</ref> At Princeton he teaches seminars for juniors and seniors in research methods, the [[sociology of work]], as well as the required course for concentrators, "Claims and Evidence in Sociology."<ref name="Willis CV">{{cite web|url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/kms/staff/willis/|title=Prof Paul Willis}}</ref> He has been published widely on work, culture, education, and method.  Among his many works are ''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs'' and ''The Ethnographic Imagination''.

==Famous works==
Paul Willis is best known for his rich ethnographic studies of working-class youth culture.  Willis is a prominent member of the celebrated Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, and is the joint founding editor of the journal ''Ethnography''. His most famous works include ''[[Learning to Labour]]'', ''Profane Culture'', and ''The Ethnographic Imagination''. Willis' studies thrived on distinct fieldwork experiences with everyday people.

In 'Learning to Labour', Willis conducted an in-depth ethnography of a set of working class 'lads' in a town in the West Midlands referred to as 'Hammertown'. Published in 1975, ''Learning To Labour'' has become a standard in the field of sociology and portrays the enduring relevance of class in its cognitive and symbolic dimensions. In this book, Willis conducts a series of interviews and observations within a school, with the aim of discovering how and why 'working class kids get working class jobs'.  Willis' raw interviews with 'rebel' students suggests that this counter-school culture of resistance and opposition to academia and authority has a strong resemblance to the culture one may find in the industrial workplaces, ironically the very same environment the 'rebel' lads were heading for.<ref name="Learning to Labour">Hechter, Michael. Christine Horne. ''Theories of Social Order: Paul Willis Learning to Labor''. Stanford, California: the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, 2009.</ref> Willis stresses that structural conditions constrain symbolic work to rigid boundaries, more specifically the ever-shifting, unrelenting structure of 'class'.  Willis states that symbolic resistance is short-lived, but still, it may be favored, as well as undermined, by structural conditions which may include public policies.<ref name="sassatelli_interview"/>

Willis states that the motive for his ethnographic recording of life  was to show forms of humanistic creativity, and this is still the case today. "As a humanist, I'm attempting to make a theorized humanism which still preserves some element of creativity."<ref name="Kleijer Interview">Kleijer, Henk. Ger Tillekens.

==Critiques of Willis' work==

Joan McFarland argues in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' that in many of Willis' works, such as ''Learning to Labor'', he is only coming from a male standpoint. She states that while it is important to highlight unemployment as a major form of inequality, as many of his works portray, his male orientation has the effect of marginalizing and misrepresenting the interests of women.<ref name=McFarland>McFarland, Joan. Cole, Mike. "An Englishman’s Home Is His Castle? A Response to Paul Willis’s Unemployment: The Final Inequality." British Journal of Sociology of Education, Vol. 9, No. 2 (1988), pp. 199-203. Taylor & Francis, Ltd. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1393034</ref> She also suggests that Willis' recommendations are somewhat anachronistic, and also too class orientated. McFarland states "While class should be a central analysis of unemployment, its important to stress that [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] are also central issues when discussing this topic".<ref name=McFarland/>

Other arguments suggest that Willis' work suffers from two essential errors: [[essentialism]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)]]<ref>Walker, J.C.  "Romanticising Resistance, Romanticising Culture: Problems in Willis’s Theory of Cultural Production" ''British Journal of Sociology of Education'', Vol. 7 No. 1 (1986), pp 59-80. Taylor & Francis, Ltd. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1392779</ref>

However, Willis interprets his own work differently. In a 2003 interview, Willis states "I see ''Learning to Labour'' — and my more recent work — as studies of forms of cultural production of meaning in everyday life. In this respect, I always feel pushed into a sociological straight-jacket when people take the outcomes of my work in terms of resistance or anomie, because my point is the general production of meanings within a context."<ref name="Kleijer Interview"/>
