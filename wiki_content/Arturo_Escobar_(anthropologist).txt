His academic research interests include [[political ecology]], [[development anthropology|anthropology of development]], [[social movements]], [[anti-globalization movement]]s, and [[postdevelopment theory]].<ref name=guard>{{cite news|author1=Simon Reid-Henry|title=Arturo Escobar: a post-development thinker to be reckoned with|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/nov/05/arturo-escobar-post-development-thinker|work=The Guardian|date=5 November 2012}}</ref>

==Education and career==

He received a Bachelor of Science in [[chemical engineering]] in 1975 from the [[University of Valle]] in [[Cali, Colombia|Cali]], Colombia, and completed one year of studies in a [[biochemistry]] graduate program at the Universidad del Valle Medical School. He subsequently traveled to the United States to earn a master's degree in [[food science]] and international [[nutrition]] at [[Cornell University]] in 1978. After a brief stint in government working in Colombia's Department of National Planning, in [[Bogota]], from 1981 to 1982,<ref name=person>{{cite web|title=People: Arturo Escobar|url=http://anthropology.unc.edu/person/arturo-escobar/|website=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Anthropology|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> in 1987 he received an interdisciplinary Ph.D from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in Development Philosophy, Policy and Planning.<ref name=person/>

He has taught mainly at [[U.S. universities]], including the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], but also abroad at institutions in Colombia, [[Finland]], [[Spain]], and England. He is currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he teaches courses in development theory and social change, often co-teaching with long-time mentee Dr. Michal Osterweil of UNC's Department of Global Studies.

==Scholarship==

=== Anthropological approach ===
Escobar's approach to anthropology is largely informed by the [[poststructuralist]] and [[postcolonialist]] traditions and centered around two recent developments: [[subaltern studies]] and the idea of a World Anthropologies Network (WAN).  His research interests are related to [[political ecology]]; the [[development anthropology|anthropology of development]], social movements; [[Latin American]] development and politics. Escobar's research uses critical techniques in his provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general. He also explores possibilities for alternative visions for a [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] era.

He is a major figure in the post-development academic discourse, and a serious critic of development practices championed by western industrialized societies. According to Escobar, the problem with development is that it is external and based on the model of the industrialized world; instead, what is needed instead are more "endogenous discourses"(Pieterse, 2010).

===Criticism of development===
Escobar contends in his 1995 book, ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World,'' that [[international development]] became a mechanism of control comparable to [[colonialism]] or "[[cultural imperialism]] that poor countries had little means of declining politely".<ref name=guard/> The book, which won the 1996 Best Book Prize of the New England Council of Latin American Studies,<ref name=umass>{{cite news|title=UMass Amherst Anthropology Professor Arturo Escobar Wins Guggenheim Fellowship|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-anthropology-professor-arturo-escobar-wins-guggenheim-fellowship|work=[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] News & Media Relations|date=23 April 1997}}</ref> traced the rise and fall of development through [[Michel Foucault]]'s [[discourse analysis]], which regards development as [[ontological]]ly cultural (i.e., by examining linguistic structure and meaning). This led him to conclude that "development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live".<ref name=guard/> Citing Foucault marked a shift in the study of development from realism to interpretivist or [[post-structuralist]] approaches, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned, giving rise to a coordinated and coherent set of interventions that Escobar calls the "development apparatus".

Escobar theorizes that the development era was produced by a discursive construction contained in [[Harry S. Truman]]'s official representation of his administration's foreign policy. By referring to the three continents of South America, Africa, and Asia as "underdeveloped" and in need of significant change to achieve progress, Truman set in motion a reorganization of bureaucracy around thinking and acting to systematically change the "[[third world]]". In addition, he argues that Truman's discursive construction was infused with the imperatives of American [[social reproduction]] and [[American imperialism|imperial pretensions]]. As a result, the development apparatus functioned to support the consolidation of [[American hegemony]].

Escobar encourages scholars to use [[ethnographic]] methods to further the post-development era by advancing the deconstructive creations initiated by contemporary social movements (without claiming universal applicability). Indeed, the Colombia case study in ''Encountering Development'' demonstrates that development economists' "economization of food" resulted in ambitious plans but not necessarily less hunger. A new 2011 edition of the book begins with a substantial new introduction, in which he argues that "postdevelopment" needs to be redefined and that a field of "pluriversal studies" would be helpful.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'', Arturo Escobar (with a new preface by the author)|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9564.html|website=[[Princeton University Press]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>

===Political ecology===
Escobar received a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in 1997 to study "Cultural and Biological Diversity in the Late Twentieth Century".<ref name=umass/> This project culminated in the publication of his latest book, ''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' by [[Duke University Press]] in 2008, which "analyzes the politics of difference enacted by specific place-based ethnic and environmental movements in the context of [[Neoliberalism#Globalization|neoliberal globalization]]".<ref name=amazon>{{cite book|title=''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' (New Ecologies for the Twenty-First Century)|isbn=0822343274}}</ref> It was written after years of [[fieldwork]] in Colombia with a group of [[Afro-Colombian]] activists of [[Pacific/Chocó natural region|Colombia’s Pacific rainforest region]] called the ''Proceso de Comunidades Negras'' (PCN).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Claudia|title=Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes (review)|journal=The Americas|date=April 2011|volume=67|issue=4|pages=573–574|doi=10.1353/tam.2011.0062|s2cid=144641620}}</ref>
