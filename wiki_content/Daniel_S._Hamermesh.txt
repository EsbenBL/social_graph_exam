==Resignation over gun safety concerns==
After the University of Texas allowed [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed firearms]] in classrooms, Hamermesh resigned due to safety concerns, saying that he believed the law has increased the chance of injury or death to him or others in the classroom from the impulsive action of a disgruntled student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/8/daniel-hamermesh-texas-professor-against-campus-ca/|title = This story is no longer available - Washington Times}}</ref>
