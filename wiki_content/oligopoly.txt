An '''oligopoly''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὀλίγος, ''oligos'' "few" and πωλεῖν, ''polein'' "to sell") is a [[market structure|market form]] wherein a [[market (economics)|market]] or [[Industry (economics)|industry]] is dominated by a small group of large sellers (oligopolists). For example, it has been found that insulin and the electrical industry are highly oligopolist in the US.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 August 1982|title=The estimation of the degree of oligopoly power|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304407682900069|journal=Journal of Econometrics|language=en|volume=19|issue=2–3|pages=287–299|doi=10.1016/0304-4076(82)90006-9|issn=0304-4076|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Elie}}</ref>

== Description ==
Oligopolies can result from various forms of [[collusion]] that reduce market competition. This leads to higher prices for consumers and lower wages for the employees of oligopolies. In the absence of collusion among market participants, an oligopoly will develop into a situation similar to [[perfect competition]].<ref>Opentextbc.ca. n.d. ''10.2 Oligopoly''. [online] Available at: <<nowiki>https://opentextbc.ca/principlesofeconomics/chapter/10-2-oligopoly/</nowiki>> [Accessed 24 April 2021]. </ref> Oligopolists have their own [[market structure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bc/edu/pubs/consumer/general/zgen01.shtm|title=Competition Counts|date=11 June 2013|access-date=23 March 2018}}</ref> 

With few sellers, each oligopolist is likely to be aware of the actions of the others. According to [[game theory]], the decisions of one firm therefore influence and are influenced by the decisions of other firms. [[Strategic planning]] by oligopolists needs to take into account the likely responses of the other market participants.  Entry barriers include high [[investment]] requirements, strong [[Brand loyalty|consumer loyalty]] for existing brands, and [[economies of scale]], and these barriers effectively facilitate the formation and sustainability of collusion.

The fundamental reason is related to future retaliation (deviation). In other words, firms will lose less for deviation and thus have more incentive to undercut collusion price (obtain short-term deviated profit) when future entry continues.<ref name=":0">Ivaldi, M., Jullien, B., Rey, P., Seabright, P., & Tirole, J. (2003). The economics of tacit collusion. </ref> There are other factors that could also facilitate collusion such as [[market transparency]] and frequent interaction.<ref name=":0" /> In developed economies oligopolies dominate the economy as the perfectly competitive model is of negligible importance for consumers. Specifically, oligopolists will implement a practice called [[price fixing]] to dominate the economy. Taking an example from the US in 2013 that most new prosecuted oligopolist cases were based on price-fixing.<ref>Margaret C. Levenstein, & Valerie Y. Suslow. (2016). Price Fixing Hits Home: An Empirical Study of US Price-Fixing Conspiracies.

As a quantitative description of oligopoly, the four-firm [[concentration ratio]] is often utilized and is the most preferable ratio for analyzing [[market concentration]].<ref>Sys, C. (2009). Is the container liner shipping industry an oligopoly?. ''Transport policy'', ''16''(5), 259-270.</ref> This measure expresses, as a percentage, the market share of the four largest firms in any particular industry. For example, as of fourth quarter 2008, if we combine the total market share of Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, we see that these firms, together, control 97% of the U.S. cellular telephone market.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chitkara|first=Hirsh|title=US Cellular and Charter are challenging the Big Four's dominance in the US wireless market|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/us-cellular-charter-challenge-big-four-in-us-wireless-market-2019-10|access-date=19 April 2021|website=Business Insider|language=en-US}}</ref> These four cellular telephone firms have become the top-tier in US carriers and were protected by the US government that acted as an intervention for other firms entering the market.<ref>{{Cite web|title=THE CASE FOR HUAWEI IN AMERICA|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265426201|access-date=25 April 2021|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref>

Oligopolistic [[competition]] can give rise to a wide range of outcomes. In some situations, particular companies may employ restrictive trade practices ([[collusion]], market sharing etc.) in order to inflate prices and restrict production in much the same way that a [[monopoly]] does. Whenever there is a formal agreement for such collusion between companies that usually compete with one another, this practice is known as a [[cartel]]. A prime example of such a cartel is [[OPEC]], where oligopolistic countries manipulate the worldwide oil supply and ultimately leaves a profound influence on the international price of oil.<ref>{{Cite web|title=OPEC (cartel) - Energy Education|url=https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/OPEC_(cartel)|access-date=24 April 2021|website=energyeducation.ca|language=en}}</ref> 

There are legal restrictions on such collusion in most countries and relevant regulations or enforcements against cartels (anti-competitive behaviours) enacted since the late of 1990s.<ref>Evenett, S. J., Levenstein, M. C., & Suslow, V. Y. (2001). ''International cartel enforcement: lessons from the 1990s''. The World Bank. </ref> For example, [[European Union competition law|EU competition law]] has prohibited some unreasonable [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive practises]] such as directly or indirectly fix selling prices, manipulate market supply or control trade among competitors etc., either by means of formal contracts or oral agreements.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Practical Law UK Signon|url=https://signon.thomsonreuters.com/?productid=PLCUK&viewproductid=UKPL&lr=0&culture=en-GB&returnto=https%3a%2f%2fuk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com%2fCosi%2fSignOn%3fredirectTo%3d%252f0-381-3369%253ftransitionType%253dDefault%2526contextData%253d(sc.Default)%2526firstPage%253dtrue&tracetoken=0424210259360n1cMPE9r2zBcmLl5Vni5smGRCidgJ8YaaCs7pt7ef6yTRgPKrlQn_eHH0h0EVmdA8HS0IRI-5LfZ8fEjOtyfFl-1WUC2CbGVNiRTcLHay67-J4hd57X8zmJbko3IhCiis9qEQpNGTB3a4cz0G6Rp4mBqkIZK0jHz2w3TUzGOU0fTT0Gcb8GsmQyuL5FBlM4G3g3DsarvMpL7qeJSElrwgP1tXqwf8bncqjw5qjbqGRNohGfFkTE0ngW6TY3O_uwHL3iCY2Bmy9XR2XsDLWUbSpOVhGyS44Unh2zOk1y5CXwmPKoR7LXiwpX5JE5q8YHkeMjvFLSE_KRgVAu5NXjV1aeDgUT9BFo-IvbIU4C-js0wn-MVrRkhS1HTQjAdu0Kb|access-date=24 April 2021|website=signon.thomsonreuters.com}}</ref> In US, ''Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission'' are created for banning collusion on cartels''.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reading: Collusion or Competition? {{!}} Microeconomics|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-microeconomics/chapter/collusion-or-competition/|access-date=24 April 2021|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}</ref> However, there does not have to be a formal agreement for collusion to take place, which called [[tacit collusion]] that less competitive outcome is achieved through mutual understanding among firms (although for the act to be illegal there must be actual and direct communication between companies)&ndash;for example, in some industries there may be an acknowledged market leader which informally sets prices to which other producers respond, known as [[price leadership]].<ref>Harrington, J. E. (2012). ''A theory of tacit collusion'' (No. 588). Working Paper.</ref> Within the development of [[Competition law|anti-trust law]] on most countries that [[tacit collusion]] is becoming more popular.<ref>Ivaldi, M., Jullien, B., Rey, P., Seabright, P., & Tirole, J. (2003). The economics of tacit collusion.</ref>

In other situations, competition between sellers in an oligopoly can be fierce, with relatively low prices and high production. This could lead to an efficient outcome approaching [[perfect competition]]. The competition in an oligopoly can be greater when there are more competitors in an industry. Theoretically, it is harder to sustain cartels ( anti-competitive behaviors) in an industry with a larger number of firms in that it will yield less collusive profit for each firm.<ref name=":1">Choi, J. P., & Gerlach, H. Forthcoming. Cartels and Collusion: Economic Theory and Experimental Economics. ''Oxford Handbook on International Antitrust Economics (Oxford University Press, Oxford, England)''.</ref> Consequently, existing firms may have more incentive to deviate. However, this conclusion is a bit more intuitive and empirical evidence has shown this conclusion or relationship is a bit more ambitious and mixed.<ref>Fonseca, M. A., & Normann, H. T. (2014). Endogenous cartel formation: Experimental evidence. ''Economics Letters'', ''125''(2), 223-225.</ref> 

Thus the [[Welfare Economics|welfare]] analysis of oligopolies is sensitive to the parameter values used to define the market's structure. In particular, the level of [[dead weight loss]] is hard to measure. The study of [[product differentiation]] indicates that oligopolies might also create excessive levels of differentiation in order to stifle competition, as they could gain certain marker power by offering somewhat differentiated products.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Prerequisites of Oligopoly {{!}} Boundless Economics|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/prerequisites-of-oligopoly/|access-date=20 April 2021|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}</ref>   

Oligopoly theory makes heavy use of [[game theory]] to model the behavior of oligopolies:
* [[Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg|Stackelberg]]'s [[duopoly]]. In this model, the firms move sequentially (see [[Stackelberg competition]]).
* [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]'s duopoly. In this model, the firms simultaneously choose quantities (see [[Cournot competition]]).
* [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Bertrand]]'s oligopoly. In this model, the firms simultaneously choose prices (see [[Bertrand competition]]).
When compared with Cournot and Bertrand's model, it can be seen that price competition is more aggressive and competitive, and also it is easier to sustain collusion under price competition.<ref>Shapiro, C. (1989). Theories of oligopoly behavior. ''Handbook of industrial organization'', ''1'', 329-414.</ref>

== Characteristics ==
;Profit maximization conditions: An oligopoly [[profit maximization|maximizes profits]].
;Ability to set price: Oligopolies are price setters rather than price takers.<ref name=Perloff_445>Perloff, J. ''Microeconomics Theory & Applications with Calculus''. page 445. Pearson 2008.</ref>
;Entry and exit: Barriers to entry are high.<ref name=Hirschey_451>Hirschey, M. ''Managerial Economics''. Rev. Ed, page 451. Dryden 2000.</ref> The most important barriers are government licenses, [[economies of scale]], patents, access to expensive and complex technology, and strategic actions by incumbent firms designed to discourage or destroy nascent firms. Additional sources of barriers to entry often result from government regulation favoring existing firms making it difficult for new firms to enter the market.<ref name="ReferenceA">Negbennebor, A: Microeconomics, The Freedom to Choose CAT 2001{{page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>
;Number of firms: "Few" &ndash; a "handful" of sellers.<ref name=Hirschey_451/> There are so few firms that the actions of one firm can influence the actions of the other firms.<ref>Negbennebor, A: Microeconomics, The Freedom to Choose page 291. CAT 2001</ref>
;Long run profits: Oligopolies can retain long run abnormal profits. High barriers of entry prevent sideline firms from entering the market to capture excess profits.
;Product differentiation: Product may be homogeneous (steel) or differentiated (automobiles).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
;Perfect knowledge: Assumptions about [[perfect knowledge]] vary but the knowledge of various economic factors can be generally described as selective. Oligopolies have perfect knowledge of their own cost and demand functions, but their inter-firm information may be incomplete. Buyers have only imperfect knowledge as to price,<ref name=Hirschey_451/> cost, and product quality.
;Interdependence: The distinctive feature of an oligopoly is [[interdependence]].<ref>Melvin & Boyes, Microeconomics 5th ed. page 267. Houghton Mifflin 2002</ref> Oligopolies are typically composed of a few large firms. Each firm is so large that its actions affect market conditions. Therefore, the competing firms will be aware of a firm's market actions and will respond appropriately. This means that in contemplating a market action, a firm must take into consideration the possible reactions of all competing firms and the firms' countermoves.<ref name=Colander_288>Colander, David C. Microeconomics 7th ed. Page 288 McGraw-Hill 2008.</ref> It is very much like a game of [[chess]], in which a player must anticipate a whole sequence of moves and countermoves in order to determine how to achieve his or her objectives; this is known as [[game theory]]. For example, an oligopoly considering a price reduction may wish to estimate the likelihood that competing firms would also lower their prices for retaliation and possibly trigger a ruinous [[price war]]. Or if the firm is considering a price increase, it may want to know whether other firms will also increase prices or hold existing prices constant. This anticipation leads to [[price rigidity]], as firms will only be willing to adjust their prices and quantity of output in accordance with a "price leader" in the market. An example for this interdependence among oligopolists such that [[Texaco]] needs to take into consideration whether its own price cut will trigger Shell's incentive to match, and so that the benefit or privilege gained by low price would be eliminated.<ref>{{Cite web|date=20 January 2020|title=Oligopoly - characteristics|url=https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Oligopoly.html|access-date=26 April 2021|language=en-US}}</ref> This high degree of interdependence and need to be aware of what other firms are doing or might do stands in contrast with the lack of interdependence in other market structures. In a [[perfectly competitive]] (PC) market there is zero interdependence because no firm is large enough to affect market price. All firms in a ''PC'' market are price takers, as the current market selling price can be followed predictably to maximize short-term profits. In a [[monopoly]], there are no competitors to be concerned about. In a [[monopolistic competition|monopolistically-competitive]] market, each firm's effects on market conditions is so negligible as to be safely ignored by competitors.
;Non-price competition: Oligopolies tend to compete on terms other than price. Loyalty schemes, advertisement, and product differentiation are all examples of [[non-price competition]], which is perceived less risky and brings less disastrous impacts to business. In other words, oligopolists are able to extract more rents (charge prices above normal competition level without losing large consumers) by offering differentiated products or initiating promotion efforts.<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 March 2018|title=Non-Price Competition in Oligopoly {{!}} Microeconomics|url=https://www.microeconomicsnotes.com/oligopoly-2/non-price-competition-in-oligopoly-microeconomics/14296|access-date=20 April 2021|website=Micro Economics Notes|language=en-US}}</ref> However, collusion among oligopolists is harder or more difficult to sustain along such non-price dimensions such as differentiation, marketing, product design.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kaplow|first1=Louis|title=Chapter 15 Antitrust|date=2007|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1574073007020154|work=Handbook of Law and Economics|volume=2|pages=1073–1225|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/s1574-0730(07)02015-4|isbn=978-0-444-53120-9|access-date=25 April 2021|last2=Shapiro|first2=Carl}}</ref>
For fighting collusion and cartels in an oligopoly market, competition authorities have taken measures or practices to effectively discover, prosecute and penalize them.<ref>Harrington, J. E. (2006). Behavioral screening and the detection of cartels. ''European competition law annual'', 51-68.</ref> [https://www.justice.gov/atr/leniency-program Leniency program] and economic analysis (screening) are currently two popular mechanisms.

=== Leniency program ===
Competition authorities prominently have roles and responsibilities on prosecuting and penalizing existing cartels and desisting new ones. Thus, authorities have created an effective tool called the leniency program, which makes antitrust firms to be more proactive participants in confessing their collusion behaviors in that they will be granted immunity from fines and still have a right to plea bargaining if not receive a full reduction.<ref>Harrington, J. (2006). Corporate leniency programs and the role of the antitrust authority in detecting collusion. ''Competition Policy Research Center Discussion Paper, CPDP-18-E''.</ref> Nowadays, leniency program has been implemented by several countries like US, Japan and Canada.  However, it causes negative impacts to competition authorities themselves in the wake of abusing of leniency program that there are still many cartels in society and the expected sanctions for colluded firms will experience a sharp drop.<ref>Marvão, C., & Spagnolo, G. (2015). Pros and Cons of Leniency, Damages and Screens. ''CLPD'', ''1'', 47.</ref> As a result, the total effect of the leniency program is ambiguous and an optimal leniency program is required.<ref name=":1" />

=== Economic analysis ===
There are two screening methods that are currently available for competition authorities: structural and behavioral.<ref>Harrington, J. E. (2006). Behavioral screening and the detection of cartels. ''European competition law annual'', 51-68.</ref> In terms of structural screening, it refers to identify industry traits or characteristics, such as homogenous goods, stable demand, less existing participants, which are prone to cartel formation. While regarding behavioral one, is mainly implemented when a cartel formation or agreement has reached and subsequently authorities start to look into firms' data and figure out whether their price variance is low or has a significant price increase or decrease.<ref name=":1" />

== Oligopolies in countries with competition laws ==
Oligopolies become "mature" when competing entities realize they can maximize profits through joint efforts designed to maximize price control by minimizing the influence of competition. As a result of operating in countries with enforced [[Competition law|antitrust laws]], oligopolists will operate under [[tacit collusion]], which is collusion through a mutual understanding among the competitors of a market without any direct communication or contact that by collectively raising prices, each participating competitor can achieve economic profits comparable to those achieved by a monopolist while avoiding the explicit breach of market regulations.<ref>Green, E. J., Marshall, R. C., & Marx, L. M. (2014). Tacit collusion in oligopoly. ''The Oxford handbook of international antitrust economics'', ''2'', 464-497.</ref> Hence, the kinked demand curve for a joint profit-maximizing oligopoly industry can model the behaviors of oligopolists' pricing decisions other than that of the price leader (the price leader being the entity that all other entities follow in terms of pricing decisions). This is because if an entity unilaterally raises the prices of their good/service and competing entities do not follow, the entity that raised their price will lose a significant market as they face the elastic upper segment of the demand curve. 

As the joint profit-maximizing efforts achieve greater economic profits for all participating entities, there is an incentive for an individual entity to "cheat" by expanding output to gain greater market share and profit. In the case of oligopolist cheating, when the incumbent entity discovers this breach in collusion, competitors in the market will retaliate by matching or dropping prices lower than the original drop. Hence, the market share originally gained by having dropped the price will be minimized or eliminated. This is why on the kinked demand curve model the lower segment of the demand curve is inelastic. As a result, in such markets price rigidity prevails.

== Modeling ==
There is no single model describing the operation of an oligopolistic market.<ref name=Colander_288/> The variety and complexity of the models exist because two to 10 firms can compete on the basis of price, quantity, technological innovations, marketing, and reputation. However, there are a series of simplified models that attempt to describe market behavior by considering certain circumstances. Some of the better-known models are the [[dominant firm model]], the [[Cournot–Nash model]], the [[Bertrand model]] and the [[kinked demand]] model.

=== Cournot–Nash model ===
{{Main|Cournot competition}}
The [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]–[[John Nash (mathematician)|Nash]] model is the simplest oligopoly model. The model assumes that there are two "equally positioned firms"; the firms compete on the basis of quantity rather than price and each firm makes an "output of decision assuming that the other firm's behavior is fixed."<ref> This statement is the Cournot conjectures. Kreps, D.: A Course in Microeconomic Theory page 326. Princeton 1990.</ref> The market demand curve is assumed to be linear and marginal costs are constant. To find the [[Nash equilibrium]] one determines how each firm reacts to a change in the output of the other firm. The path to equilibrium is a series of actions and reactions. The pattern continues until a point is reached where neither firm desires "to change what it is doing, given how it believes the other firm will react to any change."<ref>Kreps, D. ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory''. page 326.  Princeton 1990.</ref> The equilibrium is the intersection of the two firm's reaction functions. The reaction function shows how one firm reacts to the quantity choice of the other firm.<ref>Kreps, D. ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory''. Princeton 1990.{{page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> For example, assume that the firm 1's demand function is ''P'' = (''M'' − ''Q''<sub>2</sub>) − ''Q''<sub>1</sub> where ''Q''<sub>2</sub> is the quantity produced by the other firm and Q<sub>1</sub> is the amount produced by firm 1,<ref>Samuelson, W & Marks, S. ''Managerial Economics''. 4th ed. Wiley 2003{{page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> and M=60 is the market. Assume that marginal cost is C<sub>M</sub>=12. Firm 1 wants to know its maximizing quantity and price. Firm 1 begins the process by following the profit maximization rule of equating marginal revenue to marginal costs. Firm 1's total revenue function is ''R''<sub>''T''</sub> = ''Q''<sub>1</sub> ''P'' = ''Q''<sub>1</sub>(''M'' − ''Q''<sub>2</sub> − ''Q''<sub>1</sub>) = ''MQ''<sub>1</sub> − ''Q''<sub>1</sub> ''Q''<sub>2</sub> − ''Q''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>. The marginal revenue function is <math>R_M = \frac{\partial R_T}{\partial Q_1} = M - Q_2 - 2 Q_1</math>.<ref group="note">R<sub>M</sub> = M − Q<sub>2</sub> − 2Q<sub>1</sub>. can be restated as R<sub>M</sub> = (M − Q<sub>2</sub>) − 2Q<sub>1</sub>.</ref>

: ''R''<sub>''M''</sub> = ''C''<sub>''M''</sub>
:M − Q<sub>2</sub> − 2Q<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>M</sub>
:2Q<sub>1</sub> = (M − C<sub>M</sub>) − Q<sub>2</sub>
:Q<sub>1</sub> = (M − C<sub>M</sub>)/2 − Q<sub>2</sub>/2 = 24 − 0.5 Q<sub>2</sub> [1.1]
:Q<sub>2</sub> = 2(M − C<sub>M</sub>) − 2Q<sub>1</sub> = 96 − 2 Q<sub>1</sub> [1.2]

Equation 1.1 is the reaction function for firm 1. Equation 1.2 is the reaction function for firm 2.

To determine the Nash equilibrium you can solve the equations simultaneously. The equilibrium quantities can also be determined graphically. The equilibrium solution would be at the intersection of the two reaction functions. Note that if you graph the functions the axes represent quantities.<ref>Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D: Microeconomics 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001{{page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The reaction functions are not necessarily symmetric.<ref>Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D: Microeconomics 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001</ref> The firms may face differing cost functions in which case the reaction functions would not be identical nor would the equilibrium quantities.

=== Bertrand model ===
{{Main|Bertrand competition}}
The Bertrand model is essentially the Cournot–Nash model except the strategic variable is price rather than quantity.<ref name=Samuelson_415>Samuelson, W. & Marks, S. ''Managerial Economics''. 4th ed. page 415 Wiley 2003.</ref>

The model assumptions are:
* There are two firms in the market
* They produce a homogeneous product
* They produce at a constant marginal cost
* Firms choose prices P<sub>A</sub> and P<sub>B</sub> simultaneously
* Firms outputs are perfect substitutes
* Sales are split evenly if P<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>B</sub><ref> There is nothing to guarantee an even split. Kreps, D.: A Course in Microeconomic Theory page 331. Princeton 1990.</ref>

The only Nash equilibrium is P<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>B</sub> = MC.

Neither firm has any reason to change strategy. If the firm raises prices it will lose all its customers. If the firm lowers price P < MC then it will be losing money on every unit sold.<ref>This assumes that there is no capacity restriction. Binger, B & Hoffman, E, 284–85. Microeconomics with Calculus, 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998.</ref>

The Bertrand equilibrium is the same as the competitive result.<ref>Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D: Microeconomics 5th ed.page 438 Prentice-Hall 2001.</ref> Each firm will produce where P = marginal costs and there will be zero profits.<ref name=Samuelson_415/> A generalization of the Bertrand model is the [[Bertrand–Edgeworth model]] that allows for capacity constraints and a more general cost function.  

=== Oligopolistic market: Kinked demand curve model ===
{{Main|Kinked demand}}
According to this model, each firm faces a demand curve kinked at the existing price.<ref name=Pindyck_446>Pindyck, R. & Rubinfeld, D. ''Microeconomics'' 5th ed. page 446. Prentice-Hall 2001.</ref> The conjectural assumptions of the model are; if the firm raises its price above the current existing price, competitors will not follow and the acting firm will lose market share and second, if a firm lowers prices below the existing price then their competitors will follow to retain their market share and the firm's output will increase only marginally.<ref>Simply stated the rule is that competitors will ignore price increases and follow price decreases. Negbennebor, A: Microeconomics, The Freedom to Choose page 299. CAT 2001</ref> In other words, oligopolist's pricing logic is that competitors will match and respond to any price cut - retaliating to obtain more market share, while they will stick with the current or initial price for any price rising among competitors.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalai|first1=Ehud|title=The Kinked Demand Curve, Facilitating Practices, and Oligopolistic Coordination|date=1994|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-011-1370-0_2|work=Imperfections and Behavior in Economic Organizations|volume=11|pages=15–38|editor-last=Gilles|editor-first=Robert P.|place=Dordrecht|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-1370-0_2|isbn=978-94-010-4599-5|access-date=25 April 2021|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A.|editor2-last=Ruys|editor2-first=Pieter H. M.}}</ref> 

If the assumptions hold then:
* The firm's marginal revenue curve is discontinuous (or rather, not differentiable), and has a gap at the kink<ref name=Pindyck_446/>
* For prices above the prevailing price the curve is relatively elastic<ref name=Negbennebor_299>Negbennebor, A. ''Microeconomics: The Freedom to Choose''. page 299. CAT 2001</ref>
* For prices below the point the curve is relatively inelastic<ref name=Negbennebor_299/>

The gap in the marginal revenue curve means that marginal costs can fluctuate without changing equilibrium price and quantity.<ref name=Pindyck_446/> Thus prices tend to be rigid.

== Demand curve ==
[[File:Kinked demand.JPG|thumb|Above the kink, demand is relatively elastic because all other firms' prices remain unchanged. Below the kink, demand is relatively inelastic because all other firms will introduce a similar price cut, eventually leading to a [[price war]]. Therefore, the best option for the oligopolist is to produce at point '''E''' which is the equilibrium point and the kink point. This is a theoretical model proposed in 1947, which has failed to receive conclusive evidence for support.<ref name=":2">Maskin, E., & Tirole, J. (1988). A Theory of Dynamic Oligopoly, II: Price Competition, Kinked Demand Curves, and Edgeworth Cycles. Econometrica, 56(3), 571-599. doi:10.2307/1911701</ref>]]

In an oligopoly, firms operate under [[imperfect competition]]. With the fierce price competitiveness created by this [[Sticky (economics)|sticky-upward]] [[demand curve]], firms use [[non-price competition]] in order to accrue greater revenue and market share.

"Kinked" demand curves are similar to traditional demand curves, as they are downward-sloping. They are distinguished by a hypothesized convex bend with a discontinuity at the bend&ndash;"kink". Thus the first [[derivative]] at that point is undefined and leads to a jump discontinuity in the [[marginal revenue|marginal revenue curve]].

Classical [[economics|economic theory]] assumes that a profit-maximizing producer with some market power (either due to oligopoly or [[monopolistic competition]]) will set marginal costs equal to marginal revenue. This idea can be envisioned graphically by the intersection of an upward-sloping marginal cost curve and a downward-sloping marginal revenue curve (because the more one sells, the lower the price must be, so the less a producer earns per unit). In classical theory, any change in the marginal cost structure (how much it costs to make each additional unit) or the marginal revenue structure (how much people will pay for each additional unit) will be immediately reflected in a new price and/or quantity sold of the item. This result does not occur if a "kink" exists. Because of this jump discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve, [[marginal cost]], s could change without necessarily changing the price or quantity.

The motivation behind this kink is the idea that in an oligopolistic or monopolistically competitive market, firms will not raise their prices because even a small price increase will lose many customers. This is because competitors will generally ignore price increases, with the hope of gaining a larger market share as a result of now having comparatively lower prices (price rigidity). However, even a large price decrease will gain only a few customers because such an action will begin a [[price war]] with other firms. The curve is, therefore, more [[Elasticity (economics)|price-elastic]] for price increases and less so for price decreases. Theory predicts that firms will enter the industry in the long run since market price for oligopolists is more stable or 'focal' in the long run under this kinked demand curve situation.<ref name=":2" />
