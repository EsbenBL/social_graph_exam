'''John Couch Haltiwanger''' (born December 12, 1955) is the Dudley and Louisa Dillard Professor of Economics and Distinguished University Professor of [[Economics]] at the [[University of Maryland-College Park]].  He is best known for his work developing and studying longitudinal firm-level microdata, which formed the foundation of his influential work on the determinants of firm-level job creation, job destruction, and economic performance.

==Biography==
Haltiwanger received a B.S. in applied mathematics and economics from [[Brown University]] in 1977 and a Ph.D. in economics from [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in 1981.<ref name="Bio">[http://www.econ.umd.edu/faculty/profiles/haltiwanger John Haltiwanger UMD Faculty Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927143429/http://www.econ.umd.edu/faculty/profiles/haltiwanger |date=2013-09-27 }}</ref><ref name="CV">[http://econweb.umd.edu/~haltiwan/ John Haltiwanger's Curriculum Vitae]</ref>

Prior to arriving at the University of Maryland-College Park in 1987, he held positions on the faculty at the [[University of California-Los Angeles]] and The Johns Hopkins University.<ref name="CV" /><ref>[http://www.conference-board.org/bio/index.cfm?bioid=487 Conference Board Profile of John Haltiwanger]</ref><ref>[http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/photos/index_html?key=552 IZA Profile of John Haltiwanger]</ref>  He is also a research associate at the Center for Economic Studies at the [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]], and served as Chief Economist of the U.S. Bureau of the Census between 1997 and 1999.

In addition these positions, Haltiwanger is a senior research fellow of the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program, which he helped to found along with [[John M. Abowd]] and [[Julia Lane]]. He is a member of the Federal Economics Statistics Advisory Council and a research associate at both the [[Institute for the Study of Labor]] (IZA) and the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER).<ref name="CV" /><ref name="MPRC">[http://www.popcenter.umd.edu/mprc-associates/halt Maryland Population Research Center Profile of John Haltiwanger]</ref>

Haltiwanger served as chief economist of the U.S. Bureau of the Census between 1997 and 1999. He was also previously a member of the Committee on National Statistics for the [[National Academy of Sciences]], a consultant for the [[Conference Board]], and a member of the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity.<ref name="CV" />

He is married to [[Lucia Foster]].

==Work==
Haltiwanger is known for his influential work using firm-level [[longitudinal data]] to explore the dynamics of job creation, job destruction, and economic performance. In his 1996 book ''Job Creation and Destruction'' (co-authored with [[Steven Davis (economist)|Steven Davis]] and Scott Schuh), he uses plant-level data from the [[manufacturing industry]] to examine how businesses and workers respond to changes in their economic environments.<ref name="MPRC" /> Among the most striking findings in the book are the large and persistent gross job flows, which dwarf the net job flows that are commonly observed in employment data. ''Job Creation and Destruction'' laid the groundwork for subsequent research that not only confirmed the existence of such large gross job flows in other time periods, sectors, and countries, but also delved into the mechanisms and theories that would explain these flows.<ref>[http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q2/pdf/interview.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Profile of and Interview with John Haltiwanger]</ref>

In a review published in the [[Journal of Economic Literature]] in 1997, [[David Blanchflower]] concluded that ''Job Creation and Destruction'' "is an important piece of work. Not many books start literatures. This one is likely to. Buy it." (page 1400).<ref>Blanchflower, D. 1997. "Review of ''Job Creation and Destruction''." Journal of Economic Literature 35(3).</ref> In a review published in [[Economica]] in 1998, [[Jonathan Haskel]] noted that ''Job Creation and Destruction'' "is a definitive documentation of job creation and destruction in the United States and has already proved to be the starting point for a rich body of work. How many other books can claim to be so influential in their field?" (page 156).<ref>Haskel, J. 1998. "Review of ''Job Creation and Destruction''." Economica 65(257).</ref> ''Job Creation and Destruction'' was a Choice Outstanding Academic Title in 1996.<ref>[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/job-creation-and-destruction MIT Press Profile of ''Job Creation and Destruction'']</ref><ref>[http://www.ala.org/acrl/choice/outstanding Choice Outstanding Academic Titles]</ref>

More recently, Haltiwanger has empirically explored the basis for the conventional view that small firms are responsible for the majority of growth in the U.S. economy. His research on the subject suggests that it is young firms, not small firms per se, that create the disproportionate number of jobs.<ref>[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/young-firms-not-new-ones-are-the-engines-of-job-growth/?_r=0 Rampell, C. 2010. "Young Firms, Not Small Firms, Are the Engines of Growth." New York Times, August 26.]</ref>

Haltiwanger has also published widely cited articles in the [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]], the [[American Economic Review]], the [[Review of Economic Studies]], the [[Review of Economics and Statistics]], the [[Journal of Economic Literature]], and other major economics and statistics journals.<ref name="CV" />
