'''Sidney James Webb, 1st Baron Passfield''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|OM|PC}} (13 July 1859 – 13 October 1947) was a [[History of the socialist movement in the United Kingdom|British socialist]], economist and reformer, who co-founded the [[London School of Economics]]. He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]] in 1884, joining, like [[George Bernard Shaw]], three months after its inception. Along with his wife [[Beatrice Webb]] and with [[Annie Besant]], [[Graham Wallas]], [[Edward R. Pease]], [[Hubert Bland]] and [[Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier|Sydney Olivier]], Shaw and Webb turned the Fabian Society into the pre-eminent politico-intellectual society in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. He wrote the original, pro-nationalisation [[Clause IV]] for the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

==Background and education==
Webb was born in London to a professional family. He studied law at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]] for a degree of the [[University of London]] in his spare time, while holding an office job. He also studied at [[King's College London]], before being [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1885.

==Professional life==
In 1895, Webb helped to found the London School of Economics with a bequest left to the Fabian Society. He was appointed its Professor of Public Administration in 1912 and held the post for 15 years. In 1892, he married [[Beatrice Potter]], who shared his interests and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sidney-and-Beatrice-Webb |title=Sidney and Beatrice Webb {{!}} British economists |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-08-25 |language=en}}</ref> The money she contributed to the marriage enabled him to give up his clerical job and concentrate on his other activities. Sidney and Beatrice Webb founded the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1913.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/media/magazines/2013/04/leader-world-movement-towards-collectivism The world movement towards collectivism], Beatrice and Sidney Webb, [[New Statesman]], 12 April 1913;<br/>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/04/leader-bending-arc-history-towards-justice-and-freedom Bending the arc of history towards justice and freedom], [[New Statesman]], 12 April 2013, retrieved 13 May 2014.</ref>

==Political career==
[[File:Beatrice and Sidney Webb, 1932.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sidney Webb and [[Beatrice Webb]]]]
Webb and Potter were members of the Labour Party and took an active role in politics. Sidney became Member of Parliament for [[Seaham (UK Parliament constituency)|Seaham]] at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]].<ref>The History of the Fabian Society, Edward R. Pease, Frank Cass and Co. LTD, 1963</ref> The couple's influence can be seen in their hosting of the [[The Coefficients|Coefficients]], a dining club that drew in some leading statesmen and thinkers of the day. In 1929, he was created '''Baron Passfield''' of Passfield Corner in the County of Southampton.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33509 |date=25 June 1929 |page=4189}}</ref> He served as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and as [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Government 1929–1931|second Labour Government]] in 1929. 

As Colonial Secretary he issued the [[Passfield White Paper]] that revised the government policy on [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], previously set by the [[Churchill White Paper]] of 1922. In 1930, failing health caused him to step down as Dominions Secretary, but he stayed on as Colonial Secretary until the fall of the Labour government in August 1931.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

The Webbs ignored mounting evidence of atrocities being committed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and remained supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] until their deaths. Having reached their seventies and early eighties, their books, ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?'' (1935) and ''The Truth About Soviet Russia'' (1942), still gave a positive assessment of Stalin's regime. The [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] historian [[Al Richardson (historian)|Al Richardson]] later dubbed ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?'' "pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious".<ref>Al Richardson, "Introduction" to [[C. L. R. James]], ''World Revolution 1917–1936: The Rise and Fall of the Communist International''. Humanities Press (reprint), 1994; {{ISBN|0-391-03790-0}}</ref>

==Writings==
Webb co-authored with his wife ''[[The History of Trade Unionism]]'' (1894). For the Fabian Society he wrote on poverty in London,<ref>{{Citation |last=Webb |first=Sidney |title=Facts for Londoners: An exhaustive collection of statistical and other facts relating to the metropolis: with suggestions for reform on socialist principles |journal=Fabian Tract |volume=8 |year=1889 |url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:lov364xic}}</ref> the [[eight-hour day]],<ref>{{Citation |last=Webb |first=Sidney |title=An Eight Hours Bill in the form of an amendment of the Factory Acts, with further provisions for the improvement of the conditions of labour |journal=Fabian Tract |volume=9 |date=May 1890 |url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:yak803cus}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Webb |first=Sidney |title=The case for an Eight Hours Bill |journal=Fabian Tract |volume=23 |year=1891 |url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:vix669nag}}</ref> land [[nationalisation]],<ref>{{Citation |last=Webb |first=Sidney |title=Practicable land nationalization |journal=Fabian Tract |volume=12 |year=1890 |url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:yej679kex}}</ref> the nature of socialism,<ref>{{Citation |last=Webb |first=Sidney |title=Socialism: true and false.

==References in literature==
[[File:Beatrice and Sidney Webb, c1895 (9259293969).jpg|thumb|right|Beatrice and Sidney Webb working together in 1895]]
In [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' (1911), the Webbs, as "the Baileys", are mercilessly lampooned as short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. The Fabian Society, of which Wells was briefly a member (1903–1908), fares no better in his estimation.

Beatrice Webb in her diary records that they "read the caricatures of ourselves... with much interest and amusement. The portraits are very clever in a malicious way."<ref>[http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/collections/webb#diary/].</ref><ref>Beatrice Webb's typescript diary, 2 January 1901 – 10 February 1911, LSE Digital Library http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:won715bor/read#page/622/mode/2up</ref> She reviews the book and Wells's character, summarising: "As an attempt at representing a political philosophy the book utterly fails..."<ref>Beatrice Webb's typescript diary, 2 January 1901 – 10 February 1911, LSE Digital Library http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:won715bor/read#page/622/mode/2up/.</ref>

==Personal life==
{{Moresources|section|date=November 2021}}
When his wife, Beatrice, died in 1943, the casket of her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in Passfield Corner, as were those of Lord Passfield in 1947.

Shortly afterwards, [[George Bernard Shaw]] launched a [[petition]] to have both reburied in [[Westminster Abbey]], which was eventually granted – the Webbs' ashes are interred in the nave, close to those of [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Ernest Bevin]].

The Passfields were also friends of philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref>''Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'' (London: Allen and Unwin, 1969).</ref>

In 2006, the London School of Economics, alongside the Housing Association, renamed its Great Dover Street student residence Sidney Webb House in his honour.
