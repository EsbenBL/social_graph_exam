'''Francisco Javier Varela García''' (September 7, 1946 – May 28, 2001) was a [[Chile]]an [[biology|biologist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[cybernetician]], and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] who, together with his mentor [[Humberto Maturana]], is best known for introducing the concept of [[autopoiesis]] to biology, and for co-founding the [[Mind and Life Institute]] to promote dialog between science and [[Buddhism]].

==Life and career==
Varela was born in 1946 in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] in Chile, the son of Corina María Elena García Tapia and Raúl Andrés Varela Rodríguez.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.com/ftm/v/a/r/Andrs-Varela/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0015.html|title=Andrs-Varela - User Trees - Genealogy.com|website=www.genealogy.com}}</ref> After completing secondary school at the Liceo Alemán del Verbo Divino in Santiago (1951–1963), like his mentor [[Humberto Maturana]], Varela temporarily studied medicine at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and graduated with a degree in biology from the [[University of Chile]]. He later obtained a Ph.D. in biology at [[Harvard University]]. His thesis, defended in 1970 and supervised by [[Torsten Wiesel]], was titled ''Insect Retinas: Information processing in the compound eye''.

After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 military coup]] led by [[Augusto Pinochet]], Varela and his family spent 7 years in [[exile]] in the United States before he returned to Chile to become a professor of biology at the Universidad de Chile.

Varela became familiar, by practice, with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] in the 1970s, initially studying, together with [[Keun-Tshen Goba]] (''né'' Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta), with the meditation master [[Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]], founder of [[Vajradhatu]] and [[Shambhala Training]], and later with [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], a Tibetan meditation master of higher [[tantra]]s.

In 1986, he settled in France, where he first taught cognitive science and epistemology at the [[École Polytechnique]], and later neuroscience at the [[University of Paris]]. From 1988 until his death, he led a research group, as Director of Research at the [[CNRS]] (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique).

In 1987, Varela, along with [[R. Adam Engle]], founded the [[Mind and Life Institute]], initially to sponsor a series of dialogues between scientists and [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] about the relationship between modern science and [[Buddhism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindandlife.org/history/|title=History|website=Mind & Life Institute}}</ref> The Institute continues today as a major nexus for such dialog as well as promoting and supporting multidisciplinary scientific investigation in mind sciences, contemplative scholarship and practice and related areas in the interface of science with [[meditation]] and other [[Contemplative|contemplative practices]], especially [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist practices]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindandlife.org/mission/|title=Mission|website=Mind & Life Institute}}</ref>

Varela died in 2001 in [[Paris]] of [[Hepatitis C]] after having written an account of his 1998 liver transplant.<ref>"[http://www.oikos.org/varelafragments.htm Intimate Distances - Fragments for a Phenomenology of Organ Transplantation]"</ref> Varela had four children, including the actress, environmental spokesperson, and model [[Leonor Varela]].

==Work and legacy==
Varela was trained as a biologist, mathematician and philosopher through the influence of different teachers, [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]].

He wrote and edited a number of books and numerous journal articles in [[biology]], [[neurology]], [[cognitive science]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]]. He founded, with others, the [[Integral Institute]], a [[thinktank]] dedicated to the cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines.

Varela supported [[embodied philosophy]], viewing human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in terms of the [[enaction|enactive structures]] in which they arise. These comprise the body (as a biological system and as personally experienced) and the physical world which it enacts.<ref>p. 148 'This shift requires that we move away from the idea of the world as independent and extrinsic, to the idea of a world as inseparable from the structure of these processes of self-modification.' Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan T., and Rosch, Eleanor. (1991). The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience. Cambridge, MA: The [[MIT Press]]. {{ISBN|0-262-72021-3}}</ref>

Varela's work popularized within the field of neuroscience the concept of [[neurophenomenology]]. This concept combined the phenomenology of [[Edmund Husserl]] and of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], with "first-person science." Neurophenomenology requires observers to examine their own conscious experience using scientifically verifiable methods.

In the 1996 popular book ''The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems'', physicist [[Fritjof Capra]] makes extensive reference to Varela and Maturana's theory of [[autopoiesis]] as part of a new, [[Systems thinking|systems-based]] scientific approach for describing the interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Capra |first=Fritjof |date=1996 |title=The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems |url=https://archive.org/details/weboflifenewscie00capr |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books |isbn=978-0385476768 }}</ref> Written for a general audience, ''The Web of Life'' helped popularize the work of Varela and Maturana, as well as that of [[Ilya Prigogine]] and [[Gregory Bateson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/capra.html |title=THE WEB OF LIFE: Book Review |last=London |first=Scott |date=1998 |website=Scottlondon.com |access-date=9 Dec 2018}}</ref>

Varela's 1991 book ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience'', co-authored with [[Evan Thompson]] and [[Eleanor Rosch]], is considered a classic in the field of cognitive science, offering pioneering phenomenological connections and introducing the Buddhism-informed [[enactivist]] and [[embodied cognition]] approach.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metapsychology.net/index.php/book-review/the-embodied-mind-cognitive-science-and-human-experience/ |title=Review - The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience Revised Edition |last=Walmsley |first=Lachlan Douglas  |date=2 May 2017 |website=Metapsychology Online |publisher=Metapsychology (Volume 21, Issue 18) |access-date=10 Dec 2018}}</ref> A revised edition of ''The Embodied Mind'' was published in 2017, featuring substantive introductions by the surviving authors, as well as a preface by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/embodied-mind-revised-edition |title=The Embodied Mind, Revised Edition |date=January 2017|website=mitpress.mit.edu |publisher=The MIT Press |access-date=10 Dec 2018}}</ref>
