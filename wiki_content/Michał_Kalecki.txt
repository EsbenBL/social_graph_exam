'''Michał Kalecki''' ({{IPAc-pl|'|m|i|h|a|U|-|k|a|'|l|e|c|k|i}}; 22 June 1899&nbsp;– 18 April 1970) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]]. Over the course of his life, Kalecki worked at the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warsaw School of Economics]] and was an economic advisor to the governments of [[Poland]], [[France]], [[Cuba]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]] and [[India]]. He also served as the deputy director of the [[United Nations Economic Department]] in New York City.

Kalecki has been called "one of the most distinguished economists of the 20th century" and "likely the most original one". It is often claimed that he developed many of the [[Keynesian economics|same ideas]] as [[John Maynard Keynes]] before Keynes, but he remains much less known to the English-speaking world. He offered a synthesis that integrated [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class analysis]] and the new literature on [[Oligopoly|oligopoly theory]], and his work had a significant influence on both the [[Neo-Marxian economics|neo-Marxian]] (''[[Monopoly Capital]]'')<ref name="google1"/> and [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] schools of economic thought. He was one of the first [[macroeconomics|macroeconomists]] to apply [[mathematical model]]s and [[statistics|statistical]] [[data]] to economic questions. Being also a [[Political economy|political economist]] and a person of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] convictions, Kalecki emphasized the [[society|social]] aspects and consequences of economic policies.<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/>

Kalecki made major theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of the [[business cycle]], [[economic growth|growth]], [[full employment]], [[income distribution]], the political boom cycle, the oligopolistic economy, and [[risk]]. Among his other significant interests were [[money|monetary]] issues, [[economic development]], [[finance]], [[interest]], and [[inflation]]. In 1970, Kalecki was nominated for the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], but he died the same year.<ref name="Figura"/>

==Biography==

===Early years: 1899–1933===

Michał Kalecki was born on 22 June 1899 in [[Łódź]], [[Congress Poland]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Information about his early years is very sparse, part of it being lost during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi occupation]], but he grew up in a major labor-turbulent industrial center, which affected his future views.<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/> In 1917 Kalecki enrolled at the [[Warsaw University of Technology|Warsaw Polytechnic]] to study [[civil engineering]].<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> He was a very able student and formalized a generalization of [[Pascal's theorem]], concerning a [[hexagon]] drawn within a second-degree curve: Kalecki generalized it for a [[polygon]] of 2n sides.

Because his father lost a small textile workshop, Kalecki had to obtain a job as an accountant; during his first year in [[Warsaw]] he continued working sporadic jobs. After finishing his first year of engineering, he had to interrupt his studies from 1918 to 1921 to complete military service. Upon leaving the military he joined [[Gdańsk University of Technology|Gdańsk Polytechnic]], where he stayed until 1923, but because of the family financial situation had to leave the institution just before graduating.<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/>

[[File:Myhaylo Tuhan-Baranovsky.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Statue of [[Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky]], near [[Donetsk]] Commercial University. Tugan-Baranovsky was one of the few economists read by the young Kalecki]]

During these years he first approached economics, although informally. He read mostly "unorthodox" works, particularly those of [[Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. Years later they influenced some of his writings related to the potential growth of a capitalist system.

Having to enter the job market full-time, Kalecki abandoned his formal studies for good. His first job was to collect data on companies seeking credit. In this same period he tried unsuccessfully to start a newspaper, but instead ended up writing articles for two existing periodicals, ''Polska gospodarcza'' ('Economic Poland') and ''Przegląd gospodarczy'' ('The Economic Review'). Probably when writing these articles he began to acquire skills in obtaining and analyzing empirical information, which he later used in his professional works.

In 1929 Kalecki applied for work at the Institute of Research on Business Cycles and Prices (''Instytut Badania Koniunktur Gospodarczych i Cen'') in Warsaw and obtained a job there because of his ability to use [[statistics]]. He stayed there for seven years.<ref name="Figura"/> On 18 June 1930 he married Ada Szternfeld. At the Institute he met [[Ludwik Landau]], whose knowledge of statistics influenced Kalecki's work. His first publications were of a practical character and were concerned with establishing relationships between macro-magnitudes. The first article that anticipated many subsequent contributions was published in 1932 in ''Przegląd socjalistyczny'' ('The Socialist Review') magazine, under the pseudonym Henryk Braun. The article dealt with the impact of wage cuts during an economic downturn.

===Revolution of Kalecki and Keynes: 1933–1939===

In 1933 Kalecki wrote ''Próba teorii koniunktury'' ('An Attempt at the Theory of the Business Cycle'), an essay that brought together many of the issues that dominated his thought for the rest of his life. In the essay Kalecki for the first time developed a comprehensive theory of [[business cycle]]s. The foundations of his [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory of [[effective demand]] presented in the paper anticipated similar ideas published three years later by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''.<ref name="The Last Phase 13–14"/> According to [[Lawrence Klein]] (1951), Kalecki "created a system that contains everything of importance in the Keynesian system, in addition to other contributions".<ref name="The Last Phase 13–14"/> In an introduction to the essay's 1966 English translation, [[Joan Robinson]] wrote: "Its sharp and concentrated statement provides a better introduction to the general theory of employment, interest and money than any that has yet been produced."<ref name="The Last Phase 13–14"/>

Except for a small number of economists (in particular [[Econometrics|econometrists]]) familiar with his work, Kalecki's contributions, originally in Polish, failed to gain recognition.<ref name="Figura"/> In October 1933 he read his essay to the International Econometrics Association in [[Leiden]] and in 1935 published it in two major journals: ''Revue d'Economie Politique'' and ''[[Econometrica]]''.<ref name="Figura"/> Readers of neither journal were particularly impressed, but the article received favourable comments from such leading economists as [[Ragnar Frisch]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]].

In 1936 Kalecki protested the politically motivated actions taken by the Institute of Research against his colleagues, including Landau. Kalecki resigned, and having been granted a [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s Traveling Fellowship, proceeded to work abroad.<ref name="Figura"/> Had he not received the fellowship, the war would have caught Kalecki in Poland and, given his Jewish origins, he would probably not have survived.

[[File:Cam colls from johns.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]

The scholarship enabled Kalecki to travel with his wife to [[Sweden]], where followers of [[Knut Wicksell]] were trying to formalize a theory similar to Kalecki's. In Sweden in 1936 he learnt of the publication of Keynes's ''General Theory''. Kalecki was working on a comprehensive elaboration of the economic ideas he had previously developed, but having found in Keynes's book much of what he was going to say, he interrupted his work and traveled to [[England]].<ref name="The Last Phase 13–14"/> He first visited the [[London School of Economics]] and afterward went to [[Cambridge]].<ref name="Figura"/> Thus began his friendships with [[Richard Kahn, Baron Kahn|Richard Kahn]], Joan Robinson and [[Piero Sraffa]], which left an indelible mark on all of them. In 1937 Kalecki met Keynes. The meeting was cool and Keynes kept aloof. Although the conclusions they had reached in their work were very similar, their characters could not have been more different. Kalecki graciously neglected to mention that he had a [[Priority right|priority of publication]]. As Joan Robinson stated:
{{quote|"Michal Kalecki's claim to priority of publication is indisputable. With proper scholarly dignity (which, however, is unfortunately rather rare among scholars) he never mentioned this fact. And, indeed, except for the authors concerned, it is not particularly interesting to know who first got into print. The interesting thing is that two thinkers, from completely different political and intellectual starting points, should come to the same conclusion. For us in Cambridge it was a great comfort."<ref name="Problems of Economic Dynamics and Planning: Essays in Honour of Michal Kalecki"/>}}

Later Kalecki always acknowledged that the "[[Keynesian Revolution]]" was an appropriate name for the movement in economics, as he realized the importance of Keynes's established position, the recognition Keynes enjoyed and his decisive role in the promotion and causing eventual acceptance of the ideas that Kalecki pioneered.<ref name="The Last Phase 13–14"/>

In 1939 Kalecki wrote one of his most important works, ''Essays in the Theory of Economic Fluctuations''. Although his conception changed through the years, all the essential elements of Kaleckian economics were already present in this work: in a sense his subsequent publications would consist of mere elaborations on the ideas propounded here.

While Kalecki was generally enthusiastic about the Keynesian Revolution, in his article ''Political Aspects of Full Employment'', which [[Anatole Kaletsky]] called one of the most prescient economic papers ever published, he predicted it would not endure.<ref name="cap4"/> Kalecki believed that the [[full employment]] delivered by Keynesian policy would eventually lead to a more assertive [[working class]] and weakening of the social position of business leaders, causing the elite to react to the erosion of their political power and force a [[Postwar displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of that policy]], in spite of profits being higher than under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' system.<ref name = "cap4"/><ref name="Political Aspects of Full Employment"/>{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

===World War II years: 1939–1945===

[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|right|200px|thumb|During his stay in England, Kalecki met [[John Maynard Keynes]] (pictured) and discussed with him some of the ideas they shared]]

Kalecki was hired by the Oxford Institute of Statistics (OIS) early in 1940. His job there consisted mainly of writing statistical and economic analysis for the British government of the management of [[war economy]].<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> Occasionally he gave lectures at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. The elaborate reports Kalecki prepared for the government were chiefly about the [[rationing]] of goods, and the scheme he developed was very close to the policies adopted later when rationing was introduced.<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> According to George Feiwel, "Kalecki's work of the war period is far less known than it deserves to be".<ref name="george"/>

Several of Kalecki's wartime articles were devoted to the subject of [[inflation]]. He argued, on economic grounds, against the government's efforts to suppress inflation by official regulation of prices and by government wage stabilization (freezing of wages), recommending in each case economic rationing instead (especially the full rationing system rather than the wage stabilization program).<ref name="Figura"/>

Some of Kalecki's major works were written during this period. In 1943 he produced two articles, one dealing with new additions to the traditional business cycle theory, and one presenting his completely original theory of business cycles caused by political events. The latter was published in 1944 and was based on the premise of full employment. It was a compilation of studies by Kalecki and his colleagues at the OIS, who were strongly influenced by Kalecki'.<ref name="eumed"/>

In 1945 Kalecki left the OIS because he felt his talents were insufficiently appreciated. He displayed great modesty about his work and did not expect a high salary, but was offended at being discriminated against on account of his immigrant status. One reason he was not appointed to a more senior position was that he had not applied to become a British subject.

===Postwar years: 1945–1955===

Kalecki went to [[París]] for a while, then moved to [[Montreal]], where he stayed for fifteen months working at the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Office]].<ref name="Figura"/> In July 1946 he accepted the Polish government's invitation to head the Central Planning Office of the Ministry of Economics, but he left some months later. By the end of 1946, he assumed the job of Deputy Director in the Department of Economic Affairs of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] in [[New York City|New York]]. He remained there until 1955, mainly preparing the World Economic Reports.<ref name="Figura"/><ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> Kalecki resigned that position as a result of [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] pressures.<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> It was argued that he was punished on political grounds (a non-merited economic planner stance was attributed to him). He became depressed by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s witch-hunt, as many of his close friends were directly affected. Denounced in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] as a supporter of [[communism]], Kalecki ultimately failed to achieve professional success in the US (although he influenced the future post-Keynesians there),<ref name="Kalecki New School"/> unlike in England, where he had a large following and was supported especially by his friend [[Joan Robinson]].<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/>

===In communist Poland: 1955–1968===

[[File:Wroclaw AE Lange 2005.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Statue of [[Oskar R. Lange|Oskar Lange]] at the [[Wrocław University of Economics]]. In Poland, Kalecki and Lange, the other great Polish economist of the time, collaborated in economic seminars]]

In 1955 Kalecki returned to Poland, never to work abroad for any extended period again. Hopeful for an opportunity to participate there in reforms that were [[Progressivism|socially advantageous]], he believed that [[socialism]] would avoid the miseries brought by capitalist policies.<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/> He became economic advisor to the Office of the Council of Ministers. In 1957, he was appointed chairman of the Central Commission for Perspective Planning.<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> The perspective plan had a time horizon of 1961 to 1975 and basically meant a practical implementation of Kalecki's theories of growth in [[Socialist economics|socialist economies]].<ref name="The Last Phase 41–47"/> However, the final plan developed by Kalecki was dismissed by board members as defeatist. Then things got worse, as related by Feiwel:
{{quote|"By 1959 the policy makers had forsaken rationality altogether and had reverted to "hurrah planning". Constraints on the growth rate were disregarded under the spell of optimism engendered by the good performance in 1956–57. Although Kalecki remained with the Commission of the Perspective Plan for another year beyond 1959, all concerned knew that it was a ''pro forma'' function. The end of 1958 had marked the beginning of the erosion of his influence."<ref name="george2"/>}}

Still holding some of his government appointments, Kalecki spent much of the rest of his professional life in teaching and research, as a university professor from 1956 ([[Warsaw School of Economics|Central School of Planning and Statistics]] and the [[University of Warsaw]]) and member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] from 1957.<ref name="Figura"/><ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/> In 1959, he began directing a seminar on socioeconomic problems of the [[Third World]], along with [[Oskar R. Lange]] and [[Czesław Bobrowski]]. He was instrumental in the establishment and functioning of the Department of Economic Problems in Developing Countries, operated jointly by Warsaw University and the School of Planning and Statistics.<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/>

When the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] unfolded, Kalecki retired in protest against the wave of antisemitic dismissals and firings that affected many of his colleagues.<ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/>

He also devoted this period to the study of [[mathematics]]. In part this was a continuation of the interest he had when he was young and generalized Pascal's theorem. His investigations now centered on [[number theory]] and [[probability]]. Kalecki's engagement in mathematics helped him to relieve the extreme disappointment caused by the lack of power to help his country in [[economic policy]].

===In retirement: 1968–1970===

[[File:B-30 ship in shipyard.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Gdańsk Shipyard]], ca 1972. From the 1950s, Kalecki advised the Polish government on economic issues]]

Kalecki kept writing research articles. During his last visit to Cambridge in 1969, his seventieth birthday was celebrated. Kalecki gave a University Lecture on the theories of growth under various social systems, after which he was greatly applauded for the soundness of his arguments as well as for the overall trajectory of his life.<ref name="Figura"/><ref name="The Last Phase 51–53"/>

Keynes had said that knowledge of the laws governing capitalist economy would make people more prosperous, happy and more responsible regarding economic decisions taken. Kalecki contested this view, arguing that the idea of political business cycle (governments can force situations to their advantage) seems to point in the opposite direction. As he grew older, Kalecki was ever more convinced of this, and his view of humanity was getting increasingly pessimistic.

Michał Kalecki died on 18 April 1970 at the age of 70, and although he was bitterly disappointed with political developments, he lived long enough to see the recognition of the value of his many original contributions to economics. Feiwel wrote the following summary of Kalecki's life:
{{quote|"With Michal Kalecki's death, the world lost a unique individual of extremely high principles, powerful energy, and brilliant mind, and economics lost a model and inspiration. His legacy, however, cannot be erased. ... He demanded perfection, or at least an unalloyed commitment to that goal, he could not tolerate slovenly thought or superficial minds, and, most significant, he simply would not compromise his principles. Looking back over his troubled years, Kalecki once made the sad but true observation that the story of his life could be compressed into a series of resignations in protest-against tyranny, prejudice, and oppression."<ref name="george3"/>}}

==Contributions to economics==

===Background and overview===

Despite the fact that Kalecki authored many theoretical economic constructs, his interest in economics was more practical than academic and resulted from his work in engineering, journalism, credit investigation, use of statistics and observation of business operations. Full-time university teaching, for which he did not have formal qualifications (a degree), he did only during the last thirteen years of his career. He was contemptuous of abstract research and declined Keynes's invitation to undertake a critique of [[Jan Tinbergen]]'s [[Econometrics|econometric]] [[business cycle]] work, for which he would also lack an in-depth knowledge of [[statistical theory]].<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/>

Kalecki stressed that the predominant [[economic growth]] models were built on the assumption of an idealized ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism and did not properly take into account the crucial and empirically demonstrable role of the [[public sector|government sector]], the state's intervention and the interaction between the state and private sectors.<ref name="The Last Phase 48"/>

In 1943 Kalecki wrote: '... "discipline in the factories" and "political stability" are more appreciated by the business leaders than are profits. Their class instinct tells them that lasting full employment is unsound from their point of view and that unemployment is an integral part of the normal capitalist system.' The capitalists therefore want to limit government intervention and spending as disruptions to ''laissez-faire'' that reduce their "state of confidence" in the overall economic performance, with the notable exception of armament spending and policies that lead to increased armament spending (the last point Kalecki emphasized again in 1967).<ref name="The Last Phase 76–80"/><ref name="The Last Phase 107–114"/>

The economics of Kalecki was based, more explicitly and systematically than that of Keynes, on the principle of the [[circular flow of income]] that goes back to the [[Physiocracy|Physiocrat]] [[François Quesnay]]. According to that principle, income is determined by expenditure decisions, not by the exchange of resources (capital or labor). Kalecki and Keynes claimed that in capitalist economy, production and employment levels ([[economic equilibrium]]) are determined foremost by the magnitude of [[investment]] by business enterprises (the crucial "driver of the business cycle"), not by price and wage flexibility. Savings are determined by investments, not the other way around. Contrary to the [[Ricardian economics|Ricardian]], [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] and [[neoclassical economics|Neoclassical]] economics, Kalecki asserted that higher wages lead to fuller employment. His [[monetary economics|monetary theory]] was rooted in the business cycle theory of [[Knut Wicksell]]. Quesnay's circular flow of income fell into disrepute in the [[political economy]] of the 19th century, when the idea that prices integrate exchange decisions gained ground, but was revived by [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who pointed out the necessity of considering the circular flow of income (recognition of the [[business cycle|economic cycle]]) as an integrating factor in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the total economic process in a given period. The principle was discarded again with the arrival of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] domination in economics and its main current defined by prices of economic equilibrium.{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Economist [[Jan Toporowski]] said that Kalecki's theory of the business cycle remains "the most serious challenge to [[general equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] macroeconomics", which has prevailed since the late 19th century. More than Keynes, Kalecki was skeptical about government's ability to sustain [[Fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary]] [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus policies]] or of business support for full employment.<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/><ref name="Kalecki and Lange"/><ref name="Kalecki powrot"/>

Like Keynes, Kalecki was concerned with [[demand management]]. Kalecki distinguished three ways of stimulating demand: through the government improving conditions for private investment (a time-consuming and burdensome for the populace process of which he was skeptical), through [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistribution of income]] from profits to wages, and through [[Government spending|public investment]] that increases employment and demand automatically.<ref name="milion bezrobotnych"/>

Kalecki was engaged in the problems of [[Developing country|developing countries]]. He argued that their [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] depended on [[land reform]] and taxation of land owners and the [[middle class]]es. He was skeptical about a positive role of [[foreign direct investment]] in stimulating economic modernization. Polish economist [[Oskar R. Lange|Oskar Lange]], who worked with Kalecki also on [[Economic planning|centrally planned]] [[state socialism|socialist]] economies of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]], characterized him as a "[[left-wing politics|leftist]] [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]".<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/><ref name="Kalecki powrot"/>

According to Toporowski, Kalecki's monetary theory is of particular significance. Unlike Keynes, Kalecki regarded [[credit (finance)|credit]] as a fundamental system of financial reckoning in capitalist economy, not just as clearing of payments between [[commercial bank]]s and a [[central bank]]. He saw [[monetary policy]] as endogenous to the business cycle, dependent on business investment rather than on interest rate and credit policy of central bankers. Unlike Keynes, who followed the [[partial equilibrium]] approach, for Kalecki economic dynamics was synonymous with the business cycle, where "the circular flow of income generates cumulative changes from one period to the next". Kalecki and Lange stressed the necessity of analysis of actually-functioning capitalism in both the advanced and developing countries, before economic theories could be built or courses of action prescribed.<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/><ref name="Kalecki and Lange"/><ref name="Kalecki powrot"/> Kalecki's studies of capitalist [[business|enterprises]] included their finances, investment patterns and factors that influence investment, such as the development of [[financial market]]s, [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] conditions, and governmental [[fiscal policy|fiscal interventions]].<ref name="Toporowski potrzebujemy"/>

===Profit equation===

The volume of economic literature written by Kalecki during his life was very large. Although in most of his articles he returned to the same subjects (business cycles, determinants of investment, [[Planned economy|socialist planning]]), he often did it from a slightly unusual perspective and with original contributions.

Kalecki's most famous contribution is his [[profit (economics)|profit]] equation. Kalecki, whose early influences came from Marxian economists,<ref name="google4"/> thought that the volume of profits and their sharing in a capitalist society were vital points to be treated. This followed from [[Karl Marx]]'s work on relationships such as the rate of [[surplus value]] or the [[organic composition of capital]] (and even a forecast about the overall trend of profits). However, Marx was not able to make a meaningful statement about the total volume of profits in a given period.

Kalecki derived this relationship in an extremely concise, elegant and intuitive way. He starts by making simplifications which he later progressively eliminates. These assumptions are:
* Divide the whole economy into two groups: [[Workforce|workers]], who earn only [[wage]]s, and [[Capitalism|capitalists]], who earn only profits.
*Workers do not save.
* The economy is closed (there is no [[international trade]]) and there is no [[public sector]].

With these assumptions Kalecki derives the following [[accounting identity]]:

{{center|<math> \textstyle  P+W=C_W+C_P+I  \,\ </math>}}

where <math>P \,\ </math> is the volume of gross profits (profits plus [[depreciation]]), <math>W \,\ </math> is the volume of total wages, <math>C_P \,\ </math> is capitalists' consumption, <math>C_W \,\ </math> is workers' consumption and <math>I \,\ </math> is the gross investment that has been made in the economy. Since we have supposed workers who do not save  (that is <math>W=C_W \,\ </math> in the preceding equation), we can simplify the two terms and arrive at:

{{center|<math> \textstyle P=C_P+I</math>}}

This is the famous profits equation, which says that profits are equal to the sum of investment and capitalists' consumption.

At this point, Kalecki goes on to determine the causal link between the two sides of the equation: does capitalists' consumption and investment determine profits or profits instead determine capitalists' consumption and investment? Kalecki says,

{{quote|"The answer to this question depends on which of these items is directly subject to the decisions of capitalists. Now, it is clear that capitalists may decide to consume and to invest more in a given period than in the preceding one, but they cannot decide to earn more. It is, therefore, their investment and consumption decisions which determine profits, and not vice versa".<ref name="kalecki"/>|}}

For someone who has not seen the preceding relationship before, it might, upon examination, seem somewhat paradoxical. If the capitalists consume more, obviously the amount of funds which they have at the end of the year should be less. However, this reasoning, obvious to the individual entrepreneur, is not true for the business class as a whole, as the consumption of one capitalist becomes part of the profits of another.  In a way, "they are masters of their fate".<ref name="maurice"/>

If in the preceding equation we move capitalists' consumption to the left, the equation becomes:

{{center|<math> \textstyle S=I\,\ </math>}}

since profits minus capitalists' consumption are the total saving (<math>S \,\ </math>) in the economy, because the workers do not save. The previous causal relationship still applies, and goes from investment to saving. That is to say, total savings are determined once investment has been determined. Therefore, in some way, investment generates sufficient resources. "Investment finances itself",<ref name="kalecki5"/> so that equality between savings and investment is not caused by any [[interest rate]] mechanism as earlier economists thought.
Finally, we can eliminate the assumptions of the original equation: the economy can be open, there may be a [[Public sector|government sector]] and we can let workers save something. The resulting equation is:

{{center|<math> \textstyle P_N=C_P+I+D_g+E_e-S_w\,\ </math>}}

In this model total profits (net [[tax]]es this time) are the sum of capitalists' consumption, investment, public deficit, net external surplus ([[export]]s minus [[import]]s) minus workers' savings.
Before trying to explain income distribution, Kalecki introduces some behavioural assumptions in his simplified equation of profits. For him, investment is determined by a combination of many factors difficult to explain, which are considered given, [[exogeny|exogenous]].  Regarding capitalists' consumption, he considers that a simplified form is the following equation:

{{center|<math> \textstyle C_P=A+q \cdot P\,\ </math>}}

That is, capitalists' consumption depends on a fixed part (independent part), the term <math> A \,\ </math>, and a proportional share of profits, the term <math>q  \,\ </math>, which is called the [[marginal propensity to consume]] of the capitalists. If this consumption function is substituted into the profit equation, we have:

{{center|<math> \textstyle P=A+q \cdot P+I\,\ </math>}}

Expressed in terms of <math> P \,\ </math>, this gives:

{{center|<math> \textstyle P= \frac{A+I}{1-q} \,\ </math> }}

The advantage of the above manipulation is that we have reduced the two earnings determinants (capitalists' consumption and investment) to only one (investment).

===Income distribution and the constancy of the share of wages===

[[Income distribution]] is the other pillar of Kalecki's efforts to build a business cycle theory. To do this, Kalecki assumes that industries compete in [[Imperfect competition|imperfectly competitive]] markets, more particularly in [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] markets where firms set a [[markup (business)|mark-up]] on their variable average costs (raw materials, wages of employees on the shop floor that are supposed to be variable) in order to cover their [[overhead (business)|overhead]] costs (salaries to senior management and administration), to obtain a certain amount of profit. The mark-up fixed by firms is higher or lower depending on the degree of [[monopoly]], or the ease with which firms can raise price without causing reduction in the quantity demanded.
This can be summarized in the following equation:

{{center|<math> \textstyle  P+B=k \cdot (W+M)  \,\ </math>}}

where <math>P\,\ </math> and <math>W\,\ </math>  are profits and wages, <math>k\,\ </math> is the average mark-up for the whole economy, <math>M\,\ </math> is the cost of raw materials and <math>B\,\ </math> is the total amount of salaries (which must be distinguished from wages, represented by variables, while salaries are considered fixed). The equation allows us to derive the wage share in the [[Measures of national income and output|national income]]. If we add to both members <math>W\,\ </math>, and pass one to the other side, we have:

{{center|<math> \textstyle  Y=k \cdot (W+M)+W  \,\ </math>}}

If we multiply each side by  <math>W\,\ </math>, and pass to the other term, we have:

{{center|<math> \alpha= \frac{W}{W+k \cdot (W+M)}  \,\ </math>}}

or:

{{center|<math> \alpha= \frac{1}{1+k \cdot (1+j)} \,\ </math>}}

where <math>\alpha \,\ </math> is the wage share in the national income and <math>j \,\ </math> is the relation between the cost of raw materials and wages. It follows that the wage share in the national income depends negatively on mark-up and on the relationship of raw material costs to wages.
At this point Kalecki's interest is in finding out what happens to the wage share during the business cycle. During [[recession]]s, firms collaborate among themselves to cope with the fall of profits, so the degree of monopoly increases and this increases the mark-up. The <math>k \,\ </math> parameter goes up. Nonetheless, the lack of demand during recessions causes a fall in the price of raw materials, so the <math>j \,\ </math> parameter goes down. The argument is symmetrical during the [[Business cycle|boom]]: prices of raw materials rise  (<math>j \,\ </math> parameter increases) while the strength of unions due to increased employment level causes the degree of monopoly and thereby the mark-up level, to fall. The conclusion is that the α parameter is roughly constant over the business cycle.

Finally, we need an equation that determines the total product of an economy:

{{center|<math> 1-\alpha= \frac{P+B}{Y} \,\ </math>}}

which is to say that the share of profits and salaries are the complement of the share of wages. Solving for <math>Y \,\ </math> gives:

{{center|<math> Y= \frac{P+B}{1-\alpha} \,\ </math>}}

Now we have the three components necessary to determine total product: an equation of profits, a theory of income distribution and an equation that links the product with profits and income distribution.  It remains only to substitute the expression for <math>P \,\ </math> which we obtained before:

{{center|<math> Y= \frac{\frac{I+A}{1-q}+B}{1-\alpha} \,\ </math>}}

The preceding equation shows the determination of income in a closed system without public sector. It shows that output is completely determined by investment. How will output change from one period to the next?  Insofar as we have assumed that <math>A \,\ </math> and <math>B \,\ </math> are constants, the above formula comes down to the [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]:

{{center|<math> \Delta Y= \frac{\Delta I}{(1-q) \cdot (1-\alpha)} \,\ </math>}}

The problem of the change in output and hence the business cycle is therefore due to changes in the volume of investment. It follows that it is in investment where we must find the reasons for the fluctuations of a capitalist economy.

===Determinants of investment===

The above argument demonstrates the crucial role played by investment in a capitalist system. Finding a well-specified [[investment function]] would facilitate resolution of many problems in the capitalist economy. This subject had been treated for an extended period by Kalecki, and he was never completely satisfied with his solutions. This is because the factors that determine investment decisions are multiple and not always clear.
What follows is the solution Kalecki gave in one of his books.

Kalecki's investment function in the study of business cycles is the following:

{{center|<math> D=a \cdot S+b \cdot \frac {\Delta P}{\Delta t}-c \cdot\frac {\Delta K}{\Delta t}+d \,\ </math>}}

where <math>D \,\ </math> is the amount of investment decisions in [[fixed capital]], <math>a \,\ </math>, <math>b \,\ </math> and <math>c \,\ </math> are parameters that specify a [[Linearity|linear]] relation, <math>d \,\ </math> is a constant which can vary in the long-run, <math>P \,\ </math> are profits, <math>S \,\ </math> is the gross saving generated by the firm, and <math>K \,\ </math> is the stock of fixed capital. The equation shows that investment decisions depend positively on savings generated by the firm, the rate of change of profits, a constant which is subject to long-term changes, and negatively on the increase of fixed capital.

The above equation is able to generate cycles by itself. During booms, firms are able to generate more [[cash flow]] and enjoy increases in profits. However, the increase in orders for capital investment increases the stock of capital, until it becomes unprofitable to make more investments. Ultimately, the variations in the level of investment generate the business cycles. As Kalecki would say:
{{quote|"The tragedy of investment is that it causes crisis because it is useful. Doubtless many people will consider this paradoxical. But it is not the theory which is paradoxical, but its subject – the capitalist economy."<ref name="dobb"/>|}}

==Influence==

In the first half of the 1990s, [[Oxford University Press]] published 7 volumes of ''Collected Works of Michal Kalecki'', referring to him as "one of the most distinguished economists of the 20th century." Many of his works were translated into English for the first time in this collection.

Kalecki's work has inspired the Cambridge (UK) [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesians]], especially [[Joan Robinson]], [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and [[Richard M. Goodwin]], as well as the modern American post-Keynesian economists.<ref name="hetw"/>

{{refbegin}}

''a.''{{Note label|a|a|none}} British economist Jan Toporowski spoke of "the inability of capitalism to secure the rational use of resources because of the blocking political, social and financial power of the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]]", a phenomenon expounded by Kalecki in carefully reasoned analysis, without resorting to the presently commonly practiced accusations of partiality, injustice or bad faith.<ref name="Kalecki's legacy"/>

''b.''{{Note label|b|b|none}}According to Toporowski, the economic profession is now divided into [[school of thought|schools of thought]] which identify themselves with [[doctrine]]s, sets of ''a priori'' principles they do not question. Toporowski said that in the 21st century we urgently need to recover Kalecki's concepts and the rule of the [[circular flow of income]] as an integrating factor of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] analysis. Lacking these, the economists have regressed toward [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] values that praise the supposed virtue of thrift of the wealthy. We must return to the vision of Kalecki and [[Oskar R. Lange|Oskar Lange]] regarding economic development of traditional societies, vision that stressed the role of such development as changing social structures, not as just augmenting the potential of individuals.<ref name="Kalecki and Lange"/><ref name="Kalecki powrot"/>
