'''Louis Chauvel''' (born 2 November 1967)  is a [[France|French]] [[sociology|sociologist]], full professor at [[University of Luxembourg]], PhD [[Université Lille Nord de France|Université de Lille]] (1997), Habilitation [[Sciences Po]] (2003). He is specialized in social generations, in the analysis of social structures, in cohort and [[generational change]]. Chauvel received some international media attention as an expert following the spring 2006 [[First Employment Contract]] protests in France, which underlined the ''déclassement'' (downward [[social mobility]]) of the young generations in France. His analyses on the declining leadership of the "new" (post-1968) middle classes on the French political system explain the 2007 success of  [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. He develops a comparative theory of Welfare regime sustainability based on the age-period-cohort impact of economic stresses on social generations: Southern European countries, including France, prefer the development of seniority rights to the integration of the new generations. A "policy of generation" would be able to restore the long-term balance between age groups.

He has published seventy scientific papers on [[social change]], [[social inequalities]], [[middle class]], [[generational change]] and [[suicide]], he is also a proponent of [[public sociology]]. Member of the Institut universitaire de France, he is also member of the executive committee of the French Association Française de Sociologie and of the [[International Sociological Association]], and had been the General Secretary of the European Sociological Association (2004–2006).
