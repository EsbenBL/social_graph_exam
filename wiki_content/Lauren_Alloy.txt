In the late 1970s, Alloy and her longtime collaborator [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]] demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured [[illusion of control]]. This finding, termed "depressive realism", held true even when the depression was manipulated experimentally.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930105857/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1015922,00.html Time/CNN: How Full Is That Glass, Really?.]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/dont-worry-be-happy|title=Don't Worry, Be Happy|last=Konnikova|first=Maria|journal=The New Yorker|date=2014-06-18|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>
