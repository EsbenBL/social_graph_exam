'''Sir David Edgeworth Butler''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|CBE|FBA}} (born 17 October 1924) is an English [[Political Scientist|political scientist]], with a special interest in [[elections]]. He is based in [[Oxford]].

==Early life==
Butler was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and [[New College, Oxford]], and then at [[Princeton University]] as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]] from 1947 to 1948. He returned to Oxford as a researcher and academic at [[Nuffield College]], where he taught throughout the remainder of his academic career.

==Career==
Between 1956 and 1957, Butler served as personal assistant to [[HM Ambassador in Washington]].<ref>Who's Who 1987, page 257</ref>

Butler is the author of many publications, but perhaps his most important work is the [[Nuffield Election Studies]] of each [[United Kingdom General Election]] since 1945. Early co-authors included [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] and [[Anthony King (professor)|Anthony King]]. From 1974 to 2005, this series was co-authored with [[Dennis Kavanagh]]. He was a prominent on-screen expert on the [[BBC]]'s election night coverage from the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 election]] to the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]], and was a co-inventor of the [[swingometer]]. He has since appeared as an electoral analyst on various television and radio programmes, including for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] on the night of the 1997 general election, and [[Sky News]] election night coverage in 2001. He also appeared as a guest on the BBC's coverage of both the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] and [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] general elections.

His book, ''Political Change in Britain: Forces Shaping Electoral Choice'' (Macmillan, 1969), written with US political scientist [[Donald E. Stokes]], brought modern American science treatments to the United Kingdom and is regarded as a pioneering analysis of its kind. His ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) provides an analysis of the phenomenon of the [[hung parliament]] in Britain.

He is an [[Emeritus]] Fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], and sits on the editorial board of the academic journal ''[[Representation (journal)|Representation]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Representation | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=rrep20#.UhG4yJg7uSo | work = editorial board | publisher = Taylor & Francis | access-date = 19 August 2013}}</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1994. He was appointed CBE in the [[1991 Birthday Honours]] and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2011 New Year Honours]] for services to political science.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |page=1 |supp=y }}</ref> Butler was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Essex]] in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|title = University of Essex :: Honorary Graduates :: Honorary Graduates|url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/|website = www.essex.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-01-21}}</ref>

Since 1973, Butler has been involved in founding and organising the Oxford University Australian Politics Lunch, which "has only one rule, you are not allowed to talk about anything except [[Australian politics]]."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/david-butler-the-man-who-invented-new-labour-steps-away-from-elections-and-the-worm/story-e6frg6z6-1225878428950 | title=Election pioneer calls it a day| date=2010-06-11}}</ref> Notable lunch attendees included [[Kim Beazley]].

==Personal life==
A cousin was the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Rab Butler]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/podcast/great-thinkers-john-curtice-david-butler | title=Great Thinkers: John Curtice FBA on David Butler FBA| date=2019-06-24}}</ref>

His wife, Professor [[Marilyn Butler]] (died March 2014), was a former rector of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], the first woman to head a previously all-male college. They have three sons.
