'''Ahron''' "'''Ronnie'''" '''Bregman''' ({{lang-he|אהרון ברגמן}}, born 1958) is a UK-based [[political scientist]] of Israeli origin,  as well as a writer and journalist, specialising on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2019}}
Bregman was born and raised in Israel. He served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and as an [[artillery]] officer participated in the [[Operation Litani|1978 Litani campaign]] and the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. After the war he left the army to study [[international relations]] and [[political science]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He also worked as a [[parliament]]ary assistant in the [[Knesset]]. After giving an interview in 1988 to the ''[[Haaretz]]'' newspaper declaring that he would refuse to serve as a military [[reservist]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], he left Israel and settled in England. There he joined the Department of War Studies, [[King's College London]], and completed his [[PhD]] in 1994. Bregman is the writer of several books and articles on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and Middle Eastern Affairs. Since 1994 he has been  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s writer of [[obituary|obituaries]], covering the [[Jewish]] world and Israel. A senior teaching fellow at the Department of [[Peace and conflict studies|War Studies]] and a journalist, Bregman lives in [[London]]. He has three children.

==Marwan Affair==
In 2002, Bregman claimed that the Egyptian [[Ashraf Marwan]], the son-in-law of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], was a [[Mossad]] spy. According to Bregman, Marwan volunteered for the Mossad in 1970 but then proceeded to mislead the Israelis before the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. Although Marwan insisted that Bregman's claim was "a stupid detective story", they became friends and Marwan made Bregman a consultant on his memoirs. On 27 June 2007, the day that Bregman and Marwan were due to meet up in central London, Marwan's body was discovered in a small rose garden, just under the balcony of his London flat. A police investigation failed to establish whether Marwan was pushed or jumped. In 2016, Bregman published a book titled ''The Spy who Fell to Earth'' on his relationship with Marwan. In December 2017, Salon Pictures purchased the rights to turn it into a feature documentary. "The Bregman collection", which includes papers and tapes related to the Marwan Affair, is kept at the [[Liddell Hart Archives]], [[King's College London]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/lhcma/collection/b/bregman-ahron/ | title=King's Collections: Archive Catalogues: BREGMAN, Ahron (b 1958) | publisher=King's College London | work=[[Liddell Hart Military Archives]] | access-date=September 14, 2017}}</ref>
