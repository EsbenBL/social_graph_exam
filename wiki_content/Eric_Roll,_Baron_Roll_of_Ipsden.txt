==Biography==

Roll was born in [[Novoselytsia|Nowosielitza]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and grew up near [[Czernowitz]] in [[Bukovina]], which became part of [[Romania]] and is now part of [[Ukraine]]. His parents, Matthias and Fanny Roll, were of Middle European origin.<ref name="burke"/><ref name="independent">{{cite news|last=Faith|first=Nicholas|title=Lord Roll of Ipsden|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lord-roll-of-ipsden-531282.html|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=The Independent|date=2 April 2005}}</ref>

His father was a bank manager, and his mother's brother was a distinguished member of the law faculty at the [[University of Vienna]]. When [[World War I]] saw [[Russia]]n troops burned down the village, his family took refuge in [[Vienna]]. His parents then sent him to [[England]] in the 1920s and he studied at [[Birmingham University]]. Shortly afterwards, he completed his [[PhD]] and published his first book.<ref>Eric Roll. ''An Early Experiment in Industrial Organisation, being a History of the firm of Boulton & Watt, 1775–1805'' [1930]</ref> He mixed with artistic and creative circles.

By the age of 28, Roll became Professor of Economics and Commerce at [[University College, Hull]], appointed with the backing of [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Josiah Stamp, 1st Baron Stamp|Lord Stamp]]. Perhaps his most enduring work from this time was the publication in 1938 of his book ''A [[History of Economic Thought]]'',<ref>Eric Roll 'The History of Economic Thought', [1938]</ref> which subsequently went through several editions. During [[World War II]], however, he was recruited to the [[civil service]] as deputy head of the British Food Mission (1941–1946), where he was principally involved in the procurement of food supplies - most notably dried eggs. He made a number of contacts in the [[United States]] and rejected the offer to head the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], instead joining the British Ministry of Food. His economic experience and contacts made him invaluable in the post-war government and he was the British representative in the [[Paris]] discussions on [[Marshall Plan|Marshall aid]]. He played an important role in the setting up of European and trans-Atlantic institutions before rejoining the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]].

Roll was about to accept the [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellorship]] of [[Liverpool University]], but was asked to go to [[Washington, D.C.]] as economic minister at the British embassy from 1963 to 1964. Then, when [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] won the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], he became [[permanent secretary]] of the new Department of Economic Affairs, despite not agreeing with its development.

Roll was also a director of the [[Bank of England]] between 1968 and 1977,<ref name=whoswho99>{{cite book
|title=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]|year=1999}}</ref> chairman of the [[merchant bank]]ers [[SG Warburg]], and a director of ''[[The Times]]''.

Roll became Joint President of the [[Policy Studies Institute]], London, in 1978. He was Chancellor of Southampton University 1974-84.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lord-roll-ipsden-531282.html|title=Lord Roll of Ipsden|date=2 April 2009}}</ref>
