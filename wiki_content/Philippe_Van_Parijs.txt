'''Philippe Van Parijs''' ({{IPA-fr|filip vɑ̃ paʁɛjs|lang}}; born 1951) is a Belgian political philosopher and political economist, best known as a proponent and main defender of the concept of an [[Universal basic income|unconditional basic income]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/social-europe-jobs/interview/van-parijs-an-unconditional-basic-income-in-europe-will-help-end-the-crisis/|title=Van Parijs: An unconditional basic income in Europe will help end the crisis|date=11 April 2014}}</ref> and for the first systematic treatment of linguistic justice.<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, ''Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World'', Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2011.</ref>

In 2020, he was listed by [[Prospect (magazine)|''Prospect'']] as the eighth-greatest thinker for the COVID-19 era, with the magazine writing, "Today’s young UBI enthusiasts draw on the books and tap the networks of this Belgian polymath, who championed it before it was fashionable. For decades, he has warned that our proclaimed freedoms to start businesses or raise children count for nothing without the real freedom that comes with a basic income".<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=2020|title=The world's top 50 thinkers for the Covid-19 age|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/content/uploads/2020/09/PWTT20.pdf|access-date=2020-09-08|magazine=Prospect}}</ref>

== Work ==

=== Basic income ===
In ''Real Freedom for All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism?''<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, Real Freedom for All, What (if anything) can justify capitalism: Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995</ref> (1995) he argues for both the justice and feasibility of a [[Universal basic income|basic income for every citizen]]. Van Parijs asserts that it promotes the achievement of a [[real freedom]] to make choices. For example, he purports that one cannot really choose to stay at home to raise children or start a business if one cannot afford to. As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of [[income redistribution]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bidadanure|first=Juliana Uhuru|date=2019-05-11|title=The Political Theory of Universal Basic Income|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070954|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=481–501|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070954|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Linguistic justice ===
Another part of Van Parijs' work is about linguistic justice. In order to address the injustice arising from the privilege enjoyed by English as a global ''[[lingua franca]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290060830|title=A Lingua Franca as Condition for Global Justice? Philippe Van Parijs on Linguistic Justice|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> he discusses a wide range of measures such as a [[language tax]]<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_122_%28PVP%29.pdf Europe's three language problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228083819/http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_122_(PVP).pdf |date=28 December 2013 }}, Multilingualism in Law and Politics</ref> which would be paid by English-speaking countries, a ban on the dubbing of films, and the enforcement of a linguistic territoriality principle that would protect weaker languages.<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/linguistic-justice-for-europe-and-for-the-world-9780199208876 Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011.</ref>

Van Parijs's work is sometimes associated with the [[September Group]] of [[analytic Marxism]], though he is not himself a Marxist.
