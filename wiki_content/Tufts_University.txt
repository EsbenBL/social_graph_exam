==History==
{{Main|History of Tufts University}}

===19th century===
[[Image:Tufts1853.jpg|thumb|300px|Tufts College, c. 1854]]
In the 1840s, the [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist Church]] wanted to open a college in New England, and [[Charles Tufts]] donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal. Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]], and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said "I will put a light on it." His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts' now-150 acre campus, straddling [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]. It was also in 1852 that the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote "virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended." During his tenure, Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Now more than 160 years old, Tufts is the third-oldest college in the Boston area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |title=Massachusetts's Oldest Colleges – College Rankings – College Prowler |publisher=Colleges.niche.com |access-date=August 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814054952/http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |archive-date=August 14, 2014 }}</ref>

Having been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the college, [[Hosea Ballou II]] became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year. That building now bears Ballou's name.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dl.tufts.edu//view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&chapter=B00006 |title=Tufts Digital Library: tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001 |access-date=July 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629164157/http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&chapter=B00006 |archive-date=June 29, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The campus opened in August 1854. President Ballou died in 1861 and was succeeded by [[Alonzo Ames Miner]]. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. These include the establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include [[Goddard College|Goddard Seminary]], [[Westbrook College|Westbrook Seminary]], and [[Dean College|Dean Academy]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. By 1869, the [[Crane Theological School]] was organized.<ref>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Tufts College}}</ref>

Miner's successor, [[Elmer Capen]] was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators was [[Amos Dolbear]]. In 1875, as chair of the physics department, he installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later [[Alexander Graham Bell]] would receive the patent. Dolbear's work in Tufts was later continued by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]].<ref name=thennow>{{cite web |url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&now.pdf |title=Then & Now |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=March 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050314/http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then%26now.pdf |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other famous scholars include [[William Leslie Hooper]] who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, [[Frederick Stark Pearson]], would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure is [[Stephen M. Babcock]] who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars [[Arthur Michael]], who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and [[John Sterling Kingsley]], who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.<ref>Tufts College (1952).

[[Image:Interior view of Barnum Museum with Jumbo.jpg|thumb|200px|Jumbo in the Barnum Museum of Natural History]]

[[P. T. Barnum]] was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall) was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of [[Jumbo]] the elephant, who would become the university's mascot. The building stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.

On July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted "that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men." Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women. At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the [[Ph.D.]] degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|university]]. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892–1893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering.<ref name="Russell, Miller E. 1966"/>

[[Image:Tufts1910.jpg|thumb|300px|Walnut Hill as it appeared prior to the construction of Tisch Library and steps, circa 1910. In the center is Eaton Hall. The road to the right no longer exists.]]

The [[Jackson College for Women]] was established in 1910 as a coordinate college adjacent to the Tufts campus. In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the "College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College". Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002.

Tufts expanded in the 1933 with the opening of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and [[Harvard University]], funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain.

During [[World War II]], Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="tuftsv-12">{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |title=General Academic Awards |publisher=[[Medford, Massachusetts]]: Tufts University |access-date=September 26, 2011 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401071609/http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The College of Engineering added graduate study to its curriculum beginning in 1961, with master's degrees available in four departments. It added Ph.D. programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984 CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corporation [[Bernard Marshall Gordon]] founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. As part of the same reorganization the Faculty of Arts and Science became the Faculty of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (AS&E).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/about-us/history | title=History – Tufts University Connection – Gordon Institute | publisher=Tufts University | access-date=May 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523190112/http://gordon.tufts.edu/about-us/history | archive-date=May 23, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Tufts' main campus is located on [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], about {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Boston]] on the site of the original farm of Charles Tufts, the university's namesake. This campus houses all undergraduates in Arts & Sciences and Engineering, the graduate programs at [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] and all of the graduate programs in Arts & Sciences and Engineering. While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms "Uphill" and "Downhill".

The "Uphill" portion of the campus comprises the academic and the residential "Rez" quad, and is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence. Classes that contributed to the building of the fence are commemorated along its length. The academic quad contains the earliest buildings and was primarily built from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. One of Tufts' first buildings, [[Ballou Hall]] was constructed from 1852 to 1854 and was designed in the Italianate style by the well known Boston architect [[Gridley James Fox Bryant]]. Ballou Hall was later restored by [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in 1955–56, and houses the offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans. Other notable buildings include: [[Packard Hall]] (1856), [[East Hall (Tufts University)|East Hall]] (1860), West Hall (1871), [[Goddard Chapel (Tufts University)|Goddard Chapel]] (1882), [[Goddard Hall (Tufts University)|Goddard Hall]] (1883), [[Barnum Museum of Natural History|Barnum Hall]] (1884), and [[Eaton Hall (Tufts University)|Eaton Hall]] (1908).<ref>Tolles, Bryant Franklin. (November 2004) ''Architecture & Academe: College Buildings in New England Before 1860''. University Press of New England, {{ISBN|978-1-58465-891-7}}.</ref> The New York firm [[Whitfield & King]] was responsible for the design of Eaton Hall.

The "Uphill" residential quad contains more modern buildings. The most notable building is Carmichael Hall (1954), designed by [[Arland A. Dirlam]]. Dirlam also designed Bendetson Hall (1947) on the academic quad.<ref name=thennow /><ref>Sauer, Anne. (November 2004) ''Tufts University''. Arcadia, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-0853-5}}.</ref> Adjacent to both quads is the Cabot Intercultural Center designed by [[ARC/Architectural Resources Cambridge, Inc.]] one of the Fletcher School's buildings. Many points on the hill have noted views of the [[Boston]] skyline, particularly the patio on the Tisch Library roof. It has been ranked one of the prettiest college campuses in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The "Uphill" portion can be accessed with the memorial stairs. Designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form one of the main entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic quad. The engineering school is part of the Tufts's "Downhill" portion of campus.  Notable buildings around the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894).  Boston architect [[George Albert Clough]] is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally, Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|title=Historic Resources|access-date=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607141020/http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|archive-date=June 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other notable buildings downhill include the Mayer Campus Center and the Dewick Macphie Dining Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/|title=Medford-Somerville Campus Map|access-date=March 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424014043/https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby [[Davis Square]], where Tufts makes [[payment in lieu of taxes|payments in lieu of taxes]] on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|title=ResiStat: Tufts' Contribution|access-date=August 3, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152654/http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|archive-date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>

===Talloires===
Tufts has a [[satellite campus]] in [[Talloires, France]] at the Tufts European Center, a former [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[priory]] built in the 11th century. The priory was purchased in 1958 by Donald MacJannet and his wife Charlotte and used as a summer camp site for several years before the MacJannets gave the campus to Tufts in 1978. Each year the center hosts a number of summer study programs, and enrolled students live with local families. The Tufts Summit Program is for American high school students during the month of July. Tufts in Talloires is a 6-week program for Tufts undergraduates that extends from the middle of May until the end of June. Additionally Tufts in Annecy is a 4-week program which provides French language learners a chance to practice and learn the language. The site is frequently the host of international conferences and summits, most notably the [[Talloires Declaration]] which united 22 universities toward a goal of sustainability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/europeanCenter/about/|title=Tufts University European Center in Talloires, France|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805001259/http://ase.tufts.edu/europeanCenter/about/|archive-date=August 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Talloires campus has been ranked as one of the best branch campuses by the National Association of Branch Campus Administrators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/talloires-program-ranked-among-best-branch-campuses-1.2844605#.UuKxGxAo7IU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232938/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/talloires-program-ranked-among-best-branch-campuses-1.2844605#.UuKxGxAo7IU |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |title=Talloires program ranked among best branch campuses |first=Abigail |last=Feldman}}</ref>

Tufts is organized into ten schools. Each school has its own faculty, and is led by a [[Dean (education)|dean]] appointed by the [[University president|president]] and the [[provost (education)|provost]] with the consent of the Board of Trustees. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are the only schools that award both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The schools offering undergraduate education are the School of Arts and Sciences (the liberal arts college offering both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree as well as the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), the School of Engineering (which offers the Bachelor of Science degree), and the School of Special Studies. The [[Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service]] and the [[Experimental College (Tufts University)|Experimental College]] are non-degree granting.

The Tisch College was founded in 2000 "to educate for active citizenship" with the help of a $10 million gift from [[eBay]] founder [[Pierre Omidyar]] and his wife Pam. The school was renamed in 2006 after a $40 million gift from [[Jonathan Tisch]]. It has been called the "most ambitious attempt by any research university to make public service part of its core academic mission".<ref>Bombardieri, Marcella.

''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 14, 2004.</ref> The college facilitates and supports a wide range of community service, civic engagement programs, research, and teaching initiatives across the university. The university runs on a semester based calendar with most undergraduate students finishing within four years, however, Tisch College provides an innovative 1+4 Bridge year program where students have the opportunity to take a community service based gap year before starting in Tufts. Current projects undertaken by Bridge Year Fellows involve serving as mentors and teachers to children, caring for rescued wild animals, contributing to renewable energy and sustainability projects. Current projects are based in Brazil, Nicaragua, and Spain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://activecitizen.tufts.edu/tufts1plus4/|access-date=May 16, 2016|title=Tufts 1+4 Bridge-Year Service Learning Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519194001/http://activecitizen.tufts.edu/tufts1plus4/|archive-date=May 19, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Under the purview of the School of Arts and Sciences is the Experimental College (or ExCollege), created in 1964 as a proving ground for innovative, experimental, and [[interdisciplinary]] curricula and courses. It offers the opportunity for students to take for-credit courses with non-academic practitioners in a variety of fields, and also from upper-level undergraduates who have a chance to design and teach their own courses. Another successful component of the Ex College is EPIIC, a year-long program begun in 1985 to immerse students in a global issue, which culminates in an annual symposium of scholars and experts from the field.

Graduate education is offered in eight of the schools. In addition to Arts and Sciences and Engineering, Tufts offers graduate degrees in the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the oldest U.S. school for international relations and foreign affairs, the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Medicine, the School of Biomedical Sciences, the Friedman School of Nutrition, and the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Additionally, the university previously provided master's degrees in religion through the Crane Theological School. The school was dissolved in 1968.

Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Lee Coffin announced on April 7, 2015, that Tufts would be accepting [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]<!--Also called "undocumented" for people who wish to not give them stigma - Wikipedia uses "Illegal immigration" and "Illegal immigrant" in that article, so "illegal immigrant" is the most "neutral" word--> students with and without [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)]]. Coffin said that undocumented students would no longer be considered international students, but rather domestic students. This was due to the activism of social justice group United for Immigrant Justice. The first cohort of undocumented students was in the class of 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/04/07/tufts-accept-undocumented-students-provide-financial-aid/ | title=Tufts to accept undocumented students, provide financial aid | date=April 7, 2015 | access-date=December 2, 2015 | author=Kerstein, Arin | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208054704/http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/04/07/tufts-accept-undocumented-students-provide-financial-aid/ | archive-date=December 8, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The university received 21,501 undergraduate applicants in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ferguson|first1=Laura|title=Record Number of Applications|url=https://now.tufts.edu/articles/record-number-applications|website=Tufts Now|publisher=Tufts University|access-date=February 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208190550/http://now.tufts.edu/articles/record-number-applications|archive-date=February 8, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1856, shortly after Tufts opened, its admissions application asked for statements of good character and for students to complete examinations in Greek, history, Latin, and mathematics. As part of these examinations they were asked to study a list of relevant textbooks. By 1905 the admissions requirements became lengthier and the examinations became more complex; the latter required students to write essays and translations. Julia Ryan of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that because students certified by the New England College Entrance Certificate Board, ones who attended private preparatory schools in New England, were exempt from the examinations, "perhaps only a few students were even taking [the entrance examinations]."<ref name=RyanJuliaHowGetting>{{cite magazine|author=Ryan, Julia|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/how-getting-into-college-became-such-a-long-frenzied-competitive-process/281336/|title=How Getting Into College Became Such a Long, Frenzied, Competitive Process|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=November 11, 2013|access-date=August 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831072040/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/how-getting-into-college-became-such-a-long-frenzied-competitive-process/281336/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> By 1925 Tufts set an admission quota of 650 males; the examinations were of a similar length of the 1905 ones but the entry requirements decreased in size to a level comparable of that of the 1856 ones. Standardized testing, admissions interviews, and other features of current university admissions processes were in place by 1946.<ref name=RyanJuliaHowGetting/>

====Graduate admissions====
The graduate schools each hold their own admission process. Students apply directly to the graduate program to which they are seeking acceptance, and so acceptance rates vary between programs.

===Libraries and museums===
[[File:Biblioteca Ginn.jpg|thumb|150px|Ginn Library at the Fletcher School]]

Completed in 1908, Tufts' first library building, Eaton Memorial Library (now Eaton Hall), was made possible with a donation from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Carnegie's wife requested that the building be named after a Tufts graduate, Reverend Charles Eaton, who had presided over her wedding. The building received an extension in 1950 with the construction of the War Memorial Library in honor of the Tufts alumni who served in [[World War II]]. By 1965 the collection outgrew the building and was moved to a new library named Wessell Library. Additionally the demand for more square footage prompted the expansion of Wessell. In 1995, with the addition of 80,000 more square feet, the library was renamed [[Tisch Library]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&now.pdf |title=Tufts Then & Now |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=August 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050314/http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then%26now.pdf |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Student government====
There are three forms of student government at Tufts University: the Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate, the TCU Judiciary and the CSL (Committee on Student Life). The Senate is chaired by the student body president and led by a six-person executive board consisting of Vice President, Treasurer, Historian, Parliamentarian, and Diversity and Community Affairs Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tcu.tufts.edu/|title=Tufts Community Union|access-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310231310/http://tcu.tufts.edu/|archive-date=March 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Publications and broadcasting====
The ''[[Tufts Daily]]'' is the daily student newspaper, and the ''[[Tufts Observer]]'', established in 1895, is the school's biweekly magazine and the oldest publication on campus. [[The Zamboni (magazine)|The Zamboni]] is Tufts' monthly humor and satire magazine. ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' has named Tufts' college newspaper as one of the best in the country, currently ranking it No. 10.<ref name="Princetonreview.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-college-newspaper|title=Best College Newspaper – The Princeton Review|access-date=March 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331204802/http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-college-newspaper|archive-date=March 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Tufts has a television station (TUTV) which has produced and broadcast films, news, soap operas, and comedy sketch pieces. TUTV has also gone to release web series such as "Jules and Monty". The station went operational in April 1977, from Curtis Hall and consists of 40 student volunteers. Curtis Hall is also home to Tufts' own radio station [[WMFO]], which streams locally on 91.5 FM. The station first aired in 1970 and is funded by the university.

====Activism====
[[File:Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Protest at Tufts University.jpg|200px|thumb|Student protest for [[fossil fuel divestment]]]]

In 1969, Tufts was the center for Civil Rights activism due to the controversy surrounding the construction of Lewis Hall. Students staged a work strike to protest racist hiring policies practiced by the construction company Tufts had commissioned to build the residence hall. In addition to writing letters, students sat in Ballou and East Halls, and collaborated with black workers. These demonstrations eventually attracted support from major metropolitan areas in the Northeast. In 1970, Tufts adopted new hiring policies which were subsequently adopted by other universities. It led to the creation of training programs for minority employees on campus, in addition to the foundation of the Africana Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/protest1969/|title=Tufts Civil Right Protests|access-date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609213428/http://sites.tufts.edu/protest1969/|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Greek life====
About 25% of the student body is involved in Greek life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uss.tufts.edu/studentAffairs/resources/ofsl.asp|title=Tufts University: Student Affairs|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502072610/http://uss.tufts.edu/studentAffairs/resources/ofsl.asp|archive-date=May 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The four national fraternities with active chapters at Tufts are [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Zeta Beta Tau]], and [[Zeta Psi]]. In addition, there are three sororities: [[Alpha Phi]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]. There is also one co-ed fraternity, ATO of Massachusetts.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Tufts Jumbos}}

Tufts competes in the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]]—the NESCAC—in [[NCAA Division III]]. Their [[mascot]] is [[Jumbo]], which is one of two college mascots to appear in [[Webster's Dictionary]] with the other being the Billiken of St. Louis University. The mascot comes from [[P. T. Barnum]]'s circus, as Barnum was one of the original trustees of Tufts College. According to legend, Jumbo the Elephant heroically jumped in front of a train, sacrificing himself to save a younger elephant from dying. Jumbo's stuffed skin was donated to the school, and was displayed until a 1975 fire destroyed the body, except for the tail, which had been removed for conservation work. Now, a statue of the elephant is a prominent landmark on the quad, near Barnum Hall, the Biology building. Some of Jumbo's ashes were recovered in a peanut butter jar that has remained in the athletics director's office where students continue to rub it for good luck.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jumbo the Mascot |url=https://www.tufts.edu/about/jumbo |website=www.tufts.edu |access-date=July 2, 2019 |language=en |date=December 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703205239/https://www.tufts.edu/about/jumbo |archive-date=July 3, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Recently, Tufts has become one of the top athletic schools in Division III. The school has consistently ranked in the top ten of the Learfield Director's Cup, which ranks the top Division I, II, and III athletic programs in the country by awarding points in a pre-determined number of sports for men and women. In 2015–16, Tufts ranked 4th in the country, and in 2014-15 Tufts ranked 9th. Tufts men's lacrosse team won the school's first ever NCAA team championship in 2010, beating [[Salisbury State University]] in the championship game. They lost in 2011 to Salisbury in the championship.<ref>{{cite news |title=Salisbury routs Tufts for title |url=http://archive.boston.com/sports/colleges/articles/2011/05/30/salisbury_routs_tufts_for_title/ |author=Alex Prewitt |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=May 30, 2011 |access-date=February 2, 2020}}</ref> In 2012, the women's field hockey team won their first national championship, beating [[Montclair State University]] 2–1 in the finals.

Tufts also fields a team of runners each year for the [[Boston Marathon]], raising money for the Friedman School's research initiatives. Originally an initiative started by then President Larry Bacow as the Presidential Marathon Challenge, it has been continued by President Monaco.  At one time Tufts was granted 200 race bibs a year and students, alumni, and other affiliates would be trained by Coach Donald Megerle from the Fall until the day itself, the current number of bibs per year is 50. Many of the runners are first-time marathoners, and it is tradition for participants to wear their Boston Marathon medals at graduation.

Performed at most football games, "Tuftonia's Day", the Tufts fight song, was written in 1912 by Elliot W. Hayes. It can also be heard at Tufts' numerous a capella concerts and at homecoming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.tufts.edu/about-tufts/tufts-traditions/|title=Tufts Traditions|access-date=June 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609085617/http://admissions.tufts.edu/about-tufts/tufts-traditions|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Housing and dining===
[[File:West Hall - Tufts University - IMG 0973.JPG|thumb|West Hall, an uphill residence hall]]
Seven out of ten undergraduates live on campus. Students can choose from 40 residences from small special interest houses, to traditional dorms, to shared apartments. There are 25 residence halls. Similar to residential colleges, students would frequently organize discussions and bring in guest speakers and plan several activities together. Upperclassmen have the option of living in special interest housing which are 15 houses reflecting a specific cultural or academic interest. Each house offers organizes several activities and events not limited to residents. Shared apartments are usually the most popular in the university with apartments like Sophia Gordon Hall (SoGo) a primary gathering place for juniors and seniors.

===Naked Quad Run===
Every winter just prior to final exams, students would run naked laps on the Academic Quad as a way to relieve the stress of finals, much akin to similar traditions such as the [[Primal Scream (Harvard)|Primal Scream]] at Harvard. Due to increasing scrutiny from the administration and injuries incurred by slipping on the icy roads, the tradition was banned in 2011 by then-President [[Lawrence S.
