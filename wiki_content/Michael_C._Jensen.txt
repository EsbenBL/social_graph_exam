==Early life==
Born in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Results&id=1785|title=Author page at Institute for Scientific Information|website=Hcr3.isiknowledge.com|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> he received his A.B. in Economics from [[Macalester College]] in 1962. He received both his M.B.A. (1964) and Ph.D. (1968) degrees from the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]], notably working with Professor [[Merton Miller]] (1990 co-winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]).

==Career==
Between 1967 and 1988, Jensen<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.hbs.edu/mjensen/pub1.html|title=Michael C. Jensen CV|website=People.hbs.edu|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> taught finance and business administration at the [[William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration]] of the [[University of Rochester]], culminating in his 1984-1988 appointment as the LaClare Professor of Finance and Business Administration. From 1977 to 1988, he served as the founding director of the University's Managerial Economics Research Center. He joined the [[Harvard Business School]] on a half-time appointment in 1985 (dividing his time between Rochester and Harvard) before taking a full-time appointment at the latter institution in 1988. He cofounded the [[Social Science Research Network]] in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rbj.net/2016/06/03/dutch-company-acquires-firm-in-brighton/|title=Dutch company acquires firm in Brighton|last=Feltner|first=Kerry|date=2016-06-03|website=Rochester Business Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> In 2000, Jensen retired from academic work, retaining emeritus status at Harvard, upon assuming his position at Monitor.

He was also a visiting scholar at the [[University of Bern]] (1976), [[Harvard University]] (1984–1985, when he joined the faculty), and the [[Tuck School of Business]] at [[Dartmouth College]] (2001–2002). In 1992, he held the chair of president of the [[American Finance Association]]. He became a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1996. Since 2002, he has been a board member of the [[European Corporate Governance Institute]]. Jensen is also the founder and editor of the ''[[Journal of Financial Economics]]''.

The [[Jensen Prize]] in [[corporate finance]] and organizations research is named in his honor.

==Research==
He has played an important role in the academic discussion of the [[capital asset pricing model]], of [[stock options]] policy, and of [[corporate governance]]. He developed a method of measuring fund manager performance, the so-called [[Jensen's alpha]].

Jensen's best-known work is the 1976 paper he co-authored with [[William H. Meckling]], ''Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~wainwrig/Econ400/jensen-meckling.pdf|title=Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure|author=Michael C. Jensen|website=Sfu.ca|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> One of the most widely cited economics papers of the last 40 years, it implied the theory of the public corporation as an ownerless entity, made up of only contractual relationships, a field pioneered by [[Ronald Coase]].

His 1983 paper ''Reflections on the Corporation as a Social Invention'' argued that corporations' sole responsibility was to shareholder value via short-term stock price increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/the-stock-buyback-swindle/592774/ |title=The Stock-Buyback Swindle|accessdate=28 July 2019|website=The Atlantic|date=22 July 2019}}</ref>

It was a 1990 ''Harvard Business Review'' article, ''CEO Incentives: It's Not How Much You Pay, But How''<ref>{{cite journal|title=CEO Incentives: It's Not How Much You Pay, But How|first1=Michael|last1=Jensen|first2=Kevin|last2=Murphy|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=12 April 1999|volume=68|issue=3|pages=138–49|ssrn = 146148|pmid = 10104519}}</ref> by Jensen and [[Kevin J. Murphy (professor)|Kevin J. Murphy]], that prescribed executive stock options to maximize shareholder value.  The justification they gave was that shareholders were the "residual claimants" of the corporation so they had the sole right to profits. The idea that shareholders are the sole residual claimants was later challenged by legal scholars, and some (such as Stout 2002<ref>[http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=680074082121112025004090017120081113037035046078090017099116007095094067016016121044126029017014087111078069029049038029069008022093122020122072097068072110051009095082023098017093008110065090086117028002095021069120031111115010117127092127009&EXT=pdf Bad and Not So Bad Arguments for Shareholder Primacy], Social Science Research Network</ref>) actively reject it, in favor of other arguments for shareholder primacy. However, recent literature (such as Rojas 2014<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rojas|first=Claudio|date=2014|title=An Indeterminate Theory of Canadian Corporate Law|ssrn=2391775|journal=University of British Columbia Law Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=59–128}} ("[Canada's] multifaceted approach to the fiduciary duty of directors [incorporates] the basic principle within Jensen's theory of enlightened value maximization that 'we cannot maximize the long-term market value of an organization if we ignore or mistreat any important constituency.'")</ref>) builds upon Jensen's work arguing in favor of a dynamic model of the corporation and theory of corporate governance.

After Jensen and Murphy (1990), Congress passed Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (1993), making it cost effective to pay executives in equity. As a result, executives had a financial incentive to focus their efforts on increasing stock price. In the short run, some executives even manipulated accounting numbers ([[Enron]], [[Global Crossing]]) to achieve the goal. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/business/yourmoney/03guru.html|title = An Early Advocate of Stock Options Debunks Himself|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 3 April 2005|last1 = Deutsch|first1 = Claudia H.}}</ref>

Jensen has collaborated several times with [[Werner Erhard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=433651 |title=Werner Erhard's Scholarly Papers |publisher=Social Science Research Network |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}</ref> The backbone of their study is an ontological/phenomenological model.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682 Creating Leaders: An Ontological/Phenomenological Model], Social Science Research Network - THE HANDBOOK FOR TEACHING LEADERSHIP, Chapter 16, Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana, eds., Sage Publications, 2012.</ref>
