'''James P. Spradley''' (1933–1982) was a professor of [[Anthropology]] at [[Macalester College]] from 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Doing Ethnography at Macalester College "From the Inside Out"|url = https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/22319|website = Anthronotes vol. 14:2|accessdate = 2015-10-04|last = Selig|first = Ruth O.|date = Spring 1992}}</ref> Spradley  wrote or edited 20 books on [[ethnography]] and qualitative research including ''Participant Observation'' and ''The [[Ethnographic]] Interview'' (1979, Wadsworth Thomson Learning). In ''The Ethnographic Interview'', Spradley describes 12 steps for developing an ethnographic study using ethnosemantics. This book followed his 1972 textbook (with David W. McCurdy) ''The Cultural Experience: Ethnography in Complex Society''. He was a major figure in the development of the "new ethnography" which saw every individual as a carrier of the culture rather than simply looking to the outputs of the great artists of the time.<ref name="Maddox1957">{{cite book|last=Maddox|first=Lucy|title=Locating American Studies: The Evolution of a Discipline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6R30uR6J4UC&pg=PA196|accessdate=4 November 2013|year=1957|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860560|pages=196–}}</ref>

He died of leukemia in 1982.

==Reception and impact==
Spradley's work was widely used as college texts for American Studies classes in the 1970s.<ref name="Maddox1957"/>

In ''You Owe Yourself a Drunk'' he conducted interviews and created a "typology of the different kinds" of homeless alcoholic men.<ref name="Elwell2008">{{cite book|last=Elwell|first=Christine Marie|title=From Political Protest to Bureaucratic Service: The Transformation of Homeless Advocacy in the Nation's Capital and the Eclipse of Political Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4gAhA-NeYAC&pg=PA96|accessdate=4 November 2013|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549926450|pages=96–}}</ref> It has been called a "classic" of "good systemic ethnography".<ref name="Morse1994">{{cite book|last=Morse|first=Janice M.|title=Critical Issues in Qualitative Research Methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZlrPlpU1oAC&pg=PA193|accessdate=4 November 2013|year=1994|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780803950436|pages=193–}}</ref>

Spradley's book ''[[Deaf Like Me]]'', written with his brother Tom, records the experience of Tom's daughter Lynn who was born deaf after her mother contracted the German measles. The book follows the family from the first fears that their child may be deformed, the relief of having a healthy baby girl, the anguish at realizing she was deaf and the years of treatment. Spradley provides a deep and meaningful insight into what its like to have a deaf child. At the time, many doctors encouraged a purely oral environment. Lynn's parents explain that their daughters "native language" was not English but sign language. Most of the book explains what led to this revelation.<ref>Gannon, Jack. 1981.

== Types of analysis ==
Spradley describes [[ethnography]] as different from deductive types of [[social research]] in that the five steps of [[ethnographic]] research—selecting a problem, collecting data, analyzing data, formulating hypotheses, and writing—all happen simultaneously (p.&nbsp;93-94).

In ''The Ethnographic Interview'', Spradley describes four types of ethnographic analysis that basically build on each other. The first type of analysis is [[Field of study|domain]] analysis, which is “a search for the larger units of cultural knowledge” (p.&nbsp;94). The other kinds of analysis are taxonomy analysis, componential analysis, and theme analysis.
