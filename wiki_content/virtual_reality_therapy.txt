'''Virtual reality therapy''' ('''VRT'''), also known as '''virtual reality immersion therapy''' ('''VRIT'''), '''simulation for therapy''' ('''SFT'''), '''virtual reality exposure therapy''' ('''VRET'''), and '''computerized CBT''' ('''CCBT'''), is the use of [[virtual reality]] technology for psychological or occupational therapy and in affecting '''virtual rehabilitation'''.  Patients receiving virtual reality therapy navigate through digitally created environments and complete specially designed tasks often tailored to treat a specific ailment; and is designed to isolate the user from their surrounding sensory inputs and give the illusion of immersion inside a computer-generated, interactive virtual environment. This technology has a demonstrated clinical benefit as an adjunctive analgesic during burn wound dressing and other painful medical procedures.<ref>Bermo MS, Patterson D, Sharar SR, Hoffman H, Lewis DH.

It is widely used as an alternative form of [[exposure therapy]], in which patients interact with harmless virtual representations of traumatic stimuli in order to reduce fear responses.  It has proven to be especially effective at treating PTSD, and shows considerable promise in treating a variety of neurological and physical conditions. Virtual reality therapy has also been used to help stroke patients regain muscle control, to treat other disorders such as [[body dysmorphia]], and to improve social skills in those diagnosed with [[autism]].<ref>Kandalaft, Michelle; Didehbani, Nyaz; Krawczyk, Daniel; Allen, Tandra; Chapman, Sandra (2013).

==Description==
Virtual reality therapy (VRT) uses specially programmed computers, visual immersion devices and artificially created environments to give the patient a simulated experience<ref>{{cite web|title=AF doctors use virtual reality to treat PTSD|date=23 April 2009|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123145910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914031943/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123145910|archive-date=14 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> that can be used to diagnose and treat psychological conditions that cause difficulties for patients. In many environmental [[phobia]]s, reaction to the perceived hazards, such as heights, speaking in public, flying, close spaces, are usually triggered by visual and auditory stimuli. In VR-based therapies, the virtual world is a means of providing artificial, controlled stimuli in the context of treatment, and with a therapist able to monitor the patient's reaction. Unlike traditional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], VR-based treatment may involve adjusting the virtual environment, such as for example adding controlled intensity smells or adding and adjusting vibrations, and allow the clinician to determine the triggers and triggering levels for each patient's reaction. VR-based therapy systems may allow replaying virtual scenes, with or without adjustment, to habituate the patient to such environments. Therapists who apply virtual reality exposure therapy, just as those who apply in-vivo [[exposure therapy]], can take one of two approaches concerning the intensity of exposure. The first approach is called [[flooding (psychology)|flooding]], which refers to the most intense approach where stimuli that produce the most anxiety are presented first. For soldiers who have developed PTSD from combat, this could mean first exposing them to a virtual reality scene of their fellow troops being shot or injured followed by less stressful stimuli such as only the sounds of war. On the other hand, what is referred to as [[Systematic desensitization|graded-exposure]] takes a more relaxed approach in which the least distressing stimuli are introduced first.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Johanna S.

Recently there have been some advances in the field of virtual reality medicine. Virtual reality is a complete immersion of the patient into a virtual world by putting on a headset with an LED screen in the lenses of the headset. This is different from the recent advancements in augmented reality. Augmented reality is different in the sense that it enhances the non-synthetic environment by introducing synthetic elements to the user's perception of the world.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal | last1=Baus| first1=Oliver| last2=Bouchard| first2=Stéphane| date=2014| title=Moving from virtual reality exposure-based therapy to augmented reality exposure-based therapy: a review| journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience| volume=8| pages=112| doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00112| issn=1662-5161| pmc=3941080| pmid=24624073| doi-access=free}}</ref>  This in turn "augments" the current reality and uses virtual elements to build upon the existing environment.<ref name=":2" />  Augmented reality poses additional benefits and has proven itself to be a medium through which individuals suffering from specific phobia can be exposed "safely" to the object(s) of their fear, without the costs associated with programming complete virtual environments.  Thus, augmented reality can offer an efficacious alternative to some less advantageous exposure-based therapies.<ref name=":2" />

==History==
Virtual reality therapy (VRT) was pioneered and originally termed by Max North documented by the first known publication (Virtual Environment and Psychological Disorders, Max M. North, and Sarah M. North, ''Electronic Journal of Virtual Culture'', 2,4, July 1994), his doctoral VRT dissertation completion in 1995 (began in 1992), and followed with the first known published VRT book in 1996  (''Virtual Reality Therapy, an Innovative Paradigm'', Max M. North, Sarah M. North, and Joseph R. Coble, 1996. IPI Press. {{ISBN|1-880930-08-0}}). His pioneered virtual reality technology work began as early as 1992 as a research faculty at Clark Atlanta University and supported by funding from U.S. Army Research Laboratory.

In 2005, Skip Rizzo of USC's [[Institute for Creative Technologies]], with research funding from the [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR),<ref>{{Cite web|title = Evaluating Virtual Reality Therapy for Treating Acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – Office of Naval Research|url = http://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2005/Evaluating-Virtual-Reality-Therapy.aspx|website = www.onr.navy.mil|access-date = 2015-11-15}}</ref> started validating a tool he created using assets from the game ''[[Full Spectrum Warrior]]'' for the treatment of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. ''Virtual Iraq'' was subsequently evaluated and improved under ONR funding and is supported by Virtually Better, Inc. They also support applications of VR-based therapy for [[aerophobia]], acrophobia, [[glossophobia]], and substance abuse. ''Virtual Iraq'' proved successful in normalization of over 70% of PTSD sufferers, and that has now become a standard accepted treatment by the [[Anxiety and Depression Association of America]]. However, the VA has continued to emphasize traditional [[prolonged exposure therapy]] as the treatment of choice, and VR-based therapies have gained only limited adoption, despite active promotion by [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], and despite VRT having much lower cost and apparently higher success rates. A $12-million ONR funded study is currently underway to definitively compare the efficacy of the two methods, PET and VRT. Military labs have subsequently set up dozens of VRT labs and treatment centers for treating both [[PTSD]] and a variety of other medical conditions. The use of VRT has thus become a mainstream psychiatric treatment for anxiety disorders and is finding increasing use in the treatment of other cognitive disorders associated with various medical conditions such as addiction, depression and insomnia.<ref name="lat"/>

== Applications ==
=== Psychological therapy ===
==== Exposure therapy ====
Virtual reality technology is especially useful for [[exposure therapy]] – a treatment method in which patients are introduced and then slowly exposed to a traumatic stimulus. Inside virtual environments, patients can safely interact with a representation of their phobia, and researchers don't need to have access to a real version of the phobia itself. One of the primary challenges to the efficacy of Exposure therapy is recreating the level of trauma existing in real environments  inside a virtual environment. Virtual reality aids in overcoming this by engaging with different sensory stimuli of the patient while heightening the realism and maintaining the safety of the environment.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Bush|first=Jimmy|date=May 2008|title=Viability of virtual reality exposure therapy as a treatment alternative|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2007.03.006|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=24|issue=3|pages=1032–1040|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2007.03.006|issn=0747-5632}}</ref>
[[File:Virtual reality PTSD therapy.jpg|thumb|Virtual reality being used in exposure therapy for treating PTSD in documentary crew at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, United States.]]
One very successful example of virtual reality therapy exposure therapy is the PTSD treatment system, Virtual Iraq. Using a [[Head-mounted display|head mounted display]] and a [[Gamepad|game pad]], patients navigate a Humvee around virtual recreations of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States. By being safely exposed to the traumatic environments, patients learned to reduce their anxiety. According to a review of the history of Virtual Iraq, one study found that it reduced PTSD symptoms by an average of fifty percent, and disqualified over seventy-five percent of participants for PTSD after treatment.<ref name=":0" >{{Cite journal|last1=Rizzo|first1=Albert|last2=Hartholt|first2=Arno|last3=Grimani|first3=Mario|last4=Leeds|first4=Andrew|last5=Liewer|first5=Matt|year=2014|title=Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Combat-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|journal=Computer|volume=47|issue=7|pages=31–37|doi=10.1109/mc.2014.199|pmid=20955334|s2cid=18106498}}</ref>
Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is also commonly used for treating specific phobias, especially small animal phobia. Commonly feared animals such as spiders can be easily produced in a virtual environment, instead of finding the real animal.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Parsons|first1=Thomas|last2=Rizzo|first2=Albert|year=2007|title=Affective outcomes of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety and specific phobias: A meta-analysis|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bfb1/012c4a26ace569a4a43fb17aa2d656ce4a16.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315085920/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bfb1/012c4a26ace569a4a43fb17aa2d656ce4a16.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-15|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=39|issue=3|pages=250–261|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.07.007|pmid=17720136|s2cid=6688068}}</ref> VRET has also been used experimentally to treat other fears such as [[glossophobia|public speaking]] and [[claustrophobia]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Shannan|last2=Obasaju|first2=Mayowa|last3=Schmertz|first3=Stefan|last4=Zimand|first4=Elana|last5=Calamaras|first5=Martha|year=2013|title=Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial|url=https://revistas.iberoamericana.edu.co/index.php/ripsicologia/article/view/1454|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=81|issue=5|pages=751–760|doi=10.1037/a0033559|pmid=23796315}}</ref>

Another successful study attempted treating 10 individuals who experienced trauma as a result of events during 9/11. Through repeated exposure to increasingly traumatic sequences of World Trade Center events, immediate positive results were self reported by test subjects.<ref name="Difede, JoAnn 2001">Difede, JoAnn, et al. "Virtual reality exposure therapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder following September 11, 2001." Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 68.11 (2007): 1639.</ref> In a 6-month follow-up, 9 of the test subjects available for follow up maintained their results from exposure.<ref name="Difede, JoAnn 2001"/>

Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) offers a wide range of advantages compared to traditional exposure therapy techniques. Recent years have suggested an increase in familiarly and trust in virtual reality technology as an acceptable mirror of reality. A higher trust in the technology could lead to more effective treatment results as more phobics seek out help. Another consideration for VRET is the cost effectiveness. While the actual cost of VRET may vary based on the hardware and software implementation, it is supposedly more effective than the traditional in vivo treatment used for exposure therapy while maintaining a positive return on investment.<ref name=":6" /> Future research might pave an alternative to extensive automated lab or hospital environments. For instance, in 2011, researchers at [[York University]] proposed an affordable virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) system for the treatment of phobias that could be set up at home.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Haworth|first1=M.

===Virtual rehabilitation===
{{anchor|Virtual rehabilitation}}
The term ''virtual rehabilitation'' was coined in 2002 by Professor [[Daniel Thalmann]] of EPFL (Switzerland) and Professor Grigore Burdea of [[Rutgers University]] (USA). In their view the term applies to both [[physical therapy]] and [[Cognitive Interventions|cognitive interventions]] (such as for patients suffering from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress]] Disorder, phobias, anxieties, attention deficits or [[amnesia]]). Since 2008, the virtual rehabilitation "community" has been supported by the International Society on Virtual Rehabilitation.<ref>International Society on Virtual Rehabilitation website: http://www.isvr.org/</ref>

Virtual rehabilitation is a concept in psychology in which a therapeutic patient's training is based entirely on, or is augmented by, [[virtual reality]] simulation exercises. If there is no conventional therapy provided, the rehabilitation is said to be "virtual reality-based".  Otherwise, if virtual rehabilitation is in addition to conventional therapy, the intervention is "virtual reality-augmented."  Today, a majority of the population uses the virtual environment to navigate their daily lives and almost one fourth of the world population uses the internet.  As a result, virtual rehabilitation and [[gaming rehabilitation]], or rehabilitation through gaming consoles, have become quite common. In fact, virtual therapy has been used over regular therapeutic methods in order to treat a number of disorders.

Some factors to consider when virtual rehabilitation include cultural sensitivity, accessibility, and ability to finance the virtual therapy.

====Advantages====
Virtual rehabilitation offers a number of advantages<ref>Burdea G. “Keynote Address: Virtual Rehabilitation-Benefits and Challenges,” ''1st International Workshop on Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (Mental Health, Neurological, Physical, Vocational) VRMHR 2002'' Lausanne, Switzerland, November 7 and 8, pp. 1-11, 2002. Reprinted in the 2003 ''International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook of Medical Informatics'', Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 170-176 and in Journal of Methods of Information in Medicine, Schattauer, German, (invited), pp. 519-523, 2003.</ref> compared to conventional therapeutic methods:
* It is entertaining, thus motivating the patient;
*Potential for involvement of the patients' [[Stimulus modality|stimulus modalities]] for more realistic environments for treatment. 
* It provides objective outcome measures of therapy efficacy (limb velocity, range of movement, error rates, game scores, etc.);
* These data are transparently stored by the computer running the simulation and can be made available on the Internet. 
* Virtual rehabilitation can be performed in the patient's home and monitored at a distance (becoming ''telerehabilitation'')
* The patient feels more actively involved in the desensitization
*The patient may “forget” they are in treatment or undergoing observation resulting in more authentic expressions.
*Effective for hospitals to reduce their costs<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mosadeghi|first1=Sasan|last2=Reid|first2=Mark William|last3=Martinez|first3=Bibiana|last4=Rosen|first4=Bradley Todd|last5=Spiegel|first5=Brennan Mason Ross|date=2016-06-27|title=Feasibility of an Immersive Virtual Reality Intervention for Hospitalized Patients: An Observational Cohort Study|journal=JMIR Mental Health|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e28|doi=10.2196/mental.5801|issn=2368-7959|pmc=4940605|pmid=27349654}}</ref> because of lowered cost of medicine and equipment.
*Great impact of virtual reality on pain relief

=== Disadvantages ===
Despite all the merits of VR therapy as listed in the sections above, there are pitfalls and obstacles in the development of widespread VR solutions.

* Cost effectiveness: VRET may show promising returns on investment but the fact remains that the true development cost of VRET environments depends heavily on the choice of hardware and software chosen.<ref name=":6" />
* Treatment effectiveness: For the treatment to take effect, a patient should be able to successfully project and experience their anxiety in a virtual environment. Unfortunately, this projection is highly subjective and personalised per patient; and outside the control of the therapists.  This limitation might adversely impact the therapy.<ref name=":6" />
* Migrating back to reality from virtual reality: Another skepticism is the correlation between virtual reality and actual reality. If a patient successfully combats their phobia in a virtual environment, does that guarantee success in real life too? Further, when treating more complicated ailments such as schizophrenia, there is inadequate projection on how delusions and hallucinations may translate from the real world to the virtual one.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Mi Jin|last2=Kim|first2=Dong Jun|last3=Lee|first3=Unjoo|last4=Na|first4=Eun Jin|last5=Jeon|first5=Hong Jin|date=2019-07-19|title=A Literature Overview of Virtual Reality (VR) in Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Recent Advances and Limitations|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|volume=10|page=505|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00505|pmid=31379623|pmc=6659125|issn=1664-0640|doi-access=free}}</ref>
* VR sickness: Movement in a virtual environment is said to cause visual discomfort. Prolonged periods of exposure to VR may lead to side effects like dry eyes, headaches, nausea and sweating; symptoms similar to motion sickness.<ref name=":7" />
* Ethical and legal considerations: Since VR is a relatively new technology, its ethical implications are not as comprehensive as other forms of treatment. There is a need to formalize the limits, side effects, disclaimers, privacy regulations as we increase the breadth of impact of VR therapy; especially in matters related to forensic cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fromberger|first1=Peter|last2=Jordan|first2=Kirsten|last3=Müller|first3=Jürgen L.|date=March 2018|title=Virtual reality applications for diagnosis, risk assessment and therapy of child abusers|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bsl.2332|journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law|volume=36|issue=2|pages=235–244|doi=10.1002/bsl.2332|pmid=29520819|issn=0735-3936}}</ref>
* Acceptance by the medical community: As VR-based therapy increases, it might pose a challenge to licensed therapists and medical professionals who may perceive VR as a threat. Afterall, VR deviates from the pre-established norm of  “talking cure” .<ref>{{Citation|last1=Fernández-Álvarez|first1=Javier|title=Virtual Reality for Anxiety Disorders: Rethinking a Field in Expansion|date=2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-32-9705-0_21|journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|pages=389–414|place=Singapore|publisher=Springer Singapore|isbn=978-981-329-704-3|access-date=2020-11-06|last2=Di Lernia|first2=Daniele|last3=Riva|first3=Giuseppe|volume=1191|doi=10.1007/978-981-32-9705-0_21|pmid=32002939|s2cid=210982243}}</ref>

==Therapeutical targets==
=== Depression ===
In February 2006 the UK's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended that VRT be made available for use within the [[National Health Service|NHS]] across England and Wales, for patients presenting with mild/moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA97|title=Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety|date=February 2006|website=nice.org.uk|access-date=20 October 2015}}</ref> Some areas have developed, or are trialing.

At Auckland University in New Zealand, a team led by Dr. Sally Merry have been developing a [[computerized CBT]] fantasy [[serious game|"serious" game]] to help tackle depression amongst adolescents.

Virtual reality therapy has also been used to attempt to treat [[eating disorder]]s and [[body dysmorphia]]. One study in 2013 had participants complete various tasks in virtual reality environments which could not have been easily replicated without the technology.<ref name=":9" /> Tasks included showing patients the implications of reaching their desired weight, comparing their actual body shape to an avatar created using their perceived body size, and altering a virtual reflection to match their actual body size.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last1=Marco|first1=José|last2=Perpiñá|first2=Conxa|last3=Botella|first3=Cristina|year=2013|title=Effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy supported by virtual reality in the treatment of body image in eating disorders: One year follow-up|journal=Psychiatry Research|volume=209|issue=3|pages=619–625|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2013.02.023|pmid=23499231|hdl=10234/93401|s2cid=7867882|url=http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/bitstream/10234/93401/3/61092.pdf}}</ref>

=== Gender dysphoria ===
Early research suggests that virtual reality experiences may offer therapeutic benefits to transgendered individuals experiencing [[gender dysphoria]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Staniukynas|first=Linas|date=2020|title="Impact Of Virtual Reality On The Expression Of Gender Identity"|url=http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.32802.45769|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.32802.45769}}</ref> More experimentation and professional examination is needed before virtual reality could be prescribed as a treatment in practice.

=== Physical therapy ===

==== Stroke ====
Research suggests that patients who suffered from a stroke found virtual reality (VR) rehab techniques in their [[Physical therapy|Physical Therapy]] treatment plans very beneficial.<ref name="de Rooij 1905–1918">{{Cite journal|last1=de Rooij|first1=Ilona J. M.|last2=van de Port|first2=Ingrid G. L.|last3=Meijer|first3=Jan-Willem G.|date=2016-12-01|title=Effect of Virtual Reality Training on Balance and Gait Ability in Patients With Stroke: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Physical Therapy|language=en|volume=96|issue=12|pages=1905–1918|doi=10.2522/ptj.20160054|pmid=27174255|issn=0031-9023|doi-access=free}}</ref> Throughout a rehabilitation program aimed to restore and/or retain balance and walking skills, patients who have suffered a stroke often must relearn how to control certain muscles. In most physical therapy settings, this is done through high intensity, repetitive, and task-specific practice. Programs of this type can prove to be physically demanding, are expensive, and require several days of training per week. Additionally, regimens may seem redundant, and produce only modest and/or delayed effects in patient recovery. A physical therapy regimen using VR provides an opportunity to individualize training to fit the specific needs of the patient. While the exercises and movements required for proper motor learning can seem repetitive, using VR adds a level of intrigue and engagement for the patient. Training with VR enhances [[motor learning]] by giving the patient opportunities to practice their movements/exercise protocol in different VR environments.<ref name="de Rooij 1905–1918"/> This ensures that patients are always challenged and may be better prepared to perform in their environments. [[Feedback]] is an important element of physical therapy for patients recovering from stroke and/or other neuromuscular disorders.<ref name="de Rooij 1905–1918"/> Within the scope of motor learning, receiving feedback during performance of a task improves the learning rate. According to a Cochrane Review, visual feedback, specifically, has been shown to aid in balance recovery for patients who have had a stroke.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Arienti|first1=Chiara|last2=Lazzarini|first2=Stefano G.|last3=Pollock|first3=Alex|last4=Negrini|first4=Stefano|date=2019-07-19|title=Rehabilitation interventions for improving balance following stroke: An overview of systematic reviews|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=14|issue=7|pages=e0219781|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0219781|issn=1932-6203|pmc=6641159|pmid=31323068|bibcode=2019PLoSO..1419781A|doi-access=free}}</ref> VR can provide continuous visual feedback that a physical therapist may not be able to during their sessions. Results have also suggested that in addition to improvements in balance, positive effects are also seen in walking ability. In one study, patients with VR training coupled with their physical therapy program had better improvements in walking speed than others not using VR training.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Joong Hwi|last2=Jang|first2=Sung Ho|last3=Kim|first3=Chung Sun|last4=Jung|first4=Ji Hee|last5=You|first5=Joshua H.|date=September 2009|title=Use of virtual reality to enhance balance and ambulation in chronic stroke: a double-blind, randomized controlled study|journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation|volume=88|issue=9|pages=693–701|doi=10.1097/PHM.0b013e3181b33350|issn=1537-7385|pmid=19692788|s2cid=46568894}}</ref> The most recent review about the effect of VR training on balance and gait ability showed significant benefits of VR training on gait speed, [[Berg Balance Scale]] (BBS) scores, and [[Timed Up and Go test|Timed “Up & Go” Test]] scores when VR was time dose matched to conventional therapy.<ref name="de Rooij 1905–1918"/>

==== Parkinson's disease ====
Many studies (Cochrane Review) have shown that using VR technology during physical therapy treatments for patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] had positive outcomes.<ref name="Corbetta 117–124">{{Cite journal|last1=Corbetta|first1=Davide|last2=Imeri|first2=Federico|last3=Gatti|first3=Roberto|date=July 2015|title=Rehabilitation that incorporates virtual reality is more effective than standard rehabilitation for improving walking speed, balance and mobility after stroke: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Physiotherapy|volume=61|issue=3|pages=117–124|doi=10.1016/j.jphys.2015.05.017|issn=1836-9561|pmid=26093805|doi-access=free}}</ref> For patients with PD the VR therapy:

* Increased gait and balance.
* Improved functions of [[activities of daily living]] (ADL's). 
* Improved quality of life.
* Improved cognitive function.

It is speculated that these improvements occurred because the VR gave increased feedback to the patient regarding their performance during the VR sessions. VR stimulates a patient's motor and cognitive processes, both of which may be impaired as a result of the disease. Another benefit of VR is that it replicates real life scenarios, allowing patients to practice functional activities.<ref name="Corbetta 117–124"/>

==== Wound care ====
Additionally, VR provides beneficial outcomes when it is implemented for patients who are receiving [[wound care]] rehabilitation. Studies have speculated that the more immersive the VR, the greater the experience and concentration the patient will have on the virtual environment.<ref name="Scapin 1403–1416">{{Cite journal|last1=Scapin|first1=Soliane|last2=Echevarría-Guanilo|first2=Maria Elena|last3=Boeira Fuculo Junior|first3=Paulo Roberto|last4=Gonçalves|first4=Natália|last5=Rocha|first5=Patrícia Kuerten|last6=Coimbra|first6=Rebeca|date=2018-09-01|title=Virtual Reality in the treatment of burn patients: A systematic review|journal=Burns|language=en|volume=44|issue=6|pages=1403–1416|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2017.11.002|pmid=29395400|s2cid=28016732|issn=0305-4179}}</ref> Equally important, VR has shown to reduce pain, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as an increasing their treatment adherence.

In other studies, the results point to the benefits of VR in relation to increased distraction, and patients reported less time thinking about pain, less intense pain and immersion, which facilitates care such as dressing changes and physiotherapy.<ref name="Scapin 1403–1416"/>

[[Wound dressing]] often generates a pain-provoking experience. Therefore, use of VR was related to more efficient dressings, increased distraction from the pain during procedures (e.g. dressing and physical rehabilitation) which reduced the patients’ stress and anxiety.<ref name="Scapin 1403–1416"/>

==== Cardiovascular ====
The use of VR and video games could be considered as complementary tools for physical training in patients with [[Cardiovascular disease]]s.<ref name="García-Bravo 1–10">{{Cite journal|last1=García-Bravo|first1=Sara|last2=Cuesta-Gómez|first2=Alicia|last3=Campuzano-Ruiz|first3=Raquel|last4=López-Navas|first4=María Jesús|last5=Domínguez-Paniagua|first5=Joaquín|last6=Araújo-Narváez|first6=Aurora|last7=Barreñada-Copete|first7=Estrella|last8=García-Bravo|first8=Cristina|last9=Flórez-García|first9=Mariano Tomás|last10=Botas-Rodríguez|first10=Javier|last11=Cano-de-la-Cuerda|first11=Roberto|date=2019-06-30|title=Virtual reality and video games in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

In addition, it has been shown to reduce pain and increase adherence to physical therapy programs in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Finally, virtual reality and video games enhance motivation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs.<ref name="García-Bravo 1–10"/>

=== Occupational therapy ===
==== Autism ====
Virtual reality has been shown to improve the social skills of young adults with [[autism]]. In one study, participants controlled a virtual avatar in different virtual environments and maneuvered through various social tasks such as interviewing, meeting new people, and dealing with arguments. Researchers found that participants improved in the areas of emotional recognition in voices and faces and in considering the thoughts of other people. Participants were also surveyed months after the study for how effective they thought the treatments were, and the responses were overwhelmingly positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kandalaft|first1=Michelle|last2=Didehbani|first2=Nyaz|last3=Krawczyk|first3=Daniel|last4=Allen|first4=Tandra|last5=Chapman|first5=Sandra|year=2013|title=Virtual Reality Social Cognition Training for Young Adults with High-Functioning Autism|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|volume=43|issue=1|pages=34–44|doi=10.1007/s10803-012-1544-6|pmid=22570145|pmc=3536992}}</ref> Many other studies have also explored this [[occupational therapy]] option.

==== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ====
A clinical trial published in the ''[[Journal of Attention Disorders]]'' found that school age children with [[ADHD]] who underwent a virtual classroom cognitive treatment series were able to achieve the same management of symptoms of impulsivity and distractibility as children who were medicated with a stimulant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bioulac|first1=Stéphanie|last2=Micoulaud-Franchi|first2=Jean-Arthur|last3=Maire|first3=Jenna|last4=Bouvard|first4=Manuel P.|last5=Rizzo|first5=Albert A.|last6=Sagaspe|first6=Patricia|last7=Philip|first7=Pierre|date=January 2020|title=Virtual Remediation Versus Methylphenidate to Improve Distractibility in Children With ADHD: A Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial Study|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054718759751|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=326–335|doi=10.1177/1087054718759751|pmid=29562853|s2cid=4084887|issn=1087-0547}}</ref>

==== Post-traumatic stress disorder ====
It may also be possible to use virtual reality to assist those with PTSD.<ref>McLay, R. N., Graap, K., Spira, J., Perlman, K., Johnston, S., Rothbaum, B.

Military Medicine, 177(6), 635–642. https://doi-org/10.7205/MILMED-D-11-00221</ref> The virtual reality allows the patients to relive their combat situations at different extremes as a therapist can be there with them guiding them through the process. Some scholars believe that this is an effective way to treat PTSD patients as it allows for the recreation of exactly what they experienced. "It allows for greater engagement by the patient and, consequently, greater activation of the traumatic memory, which is necessary for the extinction of the conditioned fear."<ref>Goncalves R., Pedrozo A.

==== Stroke ====
Virtual reality also has applications in the physical side of occupational therapy. For [[stroke]] patients, various virtual reality technologies can help bring [[fine motor control|fine control]] back to different muscle groups. Therapy often includes games controlled with [[Haptic technology|haptic-feedback]] controllers that require fine movements, such as playing piano with a virtual hand.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Boian|first1=R.|last2=Sharma|first2=A.|last3=Han|first3=C.|last4=Merians|first4=A.|last5=Burdea|first5=G.|last6=Adamovich|first6=S.|last7=Recce|first7=M.|last8=Tremaine|first8=M.|last9=Poizner|first9=H.|year=2002|title=Virtual Reality-Based Post-Stroke Hand Rehabilitation|url=http://ti.rutgers.edu/publications/papers/2002_mmvr_boian.pdf|journal=Proceedings of Medicine Meets Virtual Reality 2002 Conference|volume=85|pages=64–70|pmid=15458061}}</ref> The [[Wii]] gaming system has also been used in conjunction with virtual reality as a treatment method.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Saposnik|first1=G.|last2=Mamdani|first2=M.|last3=Bayley|first3=M.|last4=Thorpe|first4=K.|last5=Hall|first5=J.|last6=Cohen|first6=L.|last7=Teasell|first7=R.|year=2010|title=Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Exercises in Stroke Rehabilitation (EVREST): Rationale, Design, and Protocol of a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial Assessing the Wii Gaming System|journal=International Journal of Stroke|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47–51|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4949.2009.00404.x|pmid=20088994|pmc=4880012}}</ref>

=== Rehab ===
Virtual reality is also helping patients overcome balance and mobility problems resulting from stroke or head injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/3-ways-virtual-reality-transforming-medical-care-ncna794871|title=3 ways virtual reality is transforming medical care|website=NBC News|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> In the study of VR, the modest advantage of VR over conventional training supports further investigation of the effect of video-capture VR or VR combined with conventional therapy in larger-scale randomized, more intense controlled studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Levin|first1=Mindy F.|last2=Snir|first2=Osnat|last3=Liebermann|first3=Dario G.|last4=Weingarden|first4=Harold|last5=Weiss|first5=Patrice L.|date=2012-08-24|title=Virtual Reality Versus Conventional Treatment of Reaching Ability in Chronic Stroke: Clinical Feasibility Study|journal=Neurology and Therapy|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1007/s40120-012-0003-9|issn=2193-8253|pmc=4389038|pmid=26000209}}</ref> It shows the VR-assisted patients had better mobility when the doctors checked in two months later.

=== Surgery ===
VR smoothly blurs the demarcation between the physical world and the computer simulation as surgeons can use latest versions of virtual reality glasses to interact in a three-dimensional space with the organ that requires surgical treatment, view it from any desired angle and able to switch between 3D view and the real CT images.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newgenapps.com/blog/5-incredible-uses-of-virtual-reality-in-medicine|title=5 Incredible Uses of Virtual Reality in Medicine|last=Anurag|website=www.newgenapps.com|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>

==Efficacy==
Randomized, tightly controlled, acrophobia treatment trials at Kaiser Permanente provided >90% effectiveness, conducted in 1993–94. (Ext. Ref.&nbsp;2, pg.&nbsp;71) Of 40 patients treated, 38 showed marked reduction in phobic reaction to heights and self-reported reaching their goals. Research found that VRT allows patients to achieve victory over virtual height situations they could not confront in real life, and that gradually increasing the height and danger in a virtual environment produced increasing victories and greater self-confidence in the patient that they could actually confront the situation in real life. "Virtual therapy interventions empower people. The simulation technology of virtual reality lends itself to mastery oriented treatment&nbsp;... Rather than coping with threats, phobics manage progressively more threatening aspects in a computer-generated environment&nbsp;... The range of applications can be extended by enhancing the realness and interactivity so that actions elicit reactions from the environments in which individuals immerse themselves" (Ext. Ref.&nbsp;3, pg.&nbsp;331–332).

Another study examined the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy in treating military combat personnel recently returning from the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rauch, Eftekhari and Ruzek conducted a study with a sample of 42 combat servicemen who were already diagnosed with chronic PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). These combat servicemen were pre-screened using several different diagnostic self-reports including the PTSD military checklist, a screening tool used by the military in the determination of the intensity of the diagnosis of PTSD by measuring the presence of PTSD symptoms. Although 22 of the servicemen dropped out of the study,{{Why?|date=October 2014}} the results of the study concerning the 20 remaining servicemen still has merit.{{Why?|date=October 2014}} The servicemen were given the same diagnostic tests after the study which consisted of multiple sessions of virtual reality exposure and virtual reality exposure therapy. The servicemen showed much improvement in the diagnostic scores, signaling a decrease of symptoms of PTSD. Likewise, a three-month follow-up diagnostic screening was also administered after the initial sessions that were undergone by the servicemen. The results of this study showed that 15 of the 20 participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD and improved their PTSD military checklist score by 50% for the assessment following the study. Even though only 17 of the 20 participants participated in the 3-month follow-up screening, 13 of the 17 still did not meet the criteria for PTSD and maintained their 50% improvement in the PTSD military checklist score. These results show promising effects and help to validate virtual reality therapy as an efficacious mode of therapy for the treatment of PTSD (McLay, et al., 2012).

VR combined real instrument training was effective at promoting recovery of patients' upper-extremity and cognitive function, and thus may be an innovative translational neurorehabilitation strategy after stroke. In the study, the experimental group showed greater therapeutic effects in a time-dependent manner than the control group, especially on the motor power of wrist extension, spasticity of elbow flexion and wrist extension, and Box and Block Tests. Patients in the experimental group, but not the control group, also showed significant improvements on the lateral, palmar, and tip pinch power, Box and Block, and 9-HPTs from before to immediately after training.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oh|first1=Young-Bin|last2=Kim|first2=Gi-Wook|last3=Han|first3=Kap-Soo|last4=Won|first4=Yu Hui|last5=Park|first5=Sung-Hee|last6=Seo|first6=Jeong-Hwan|last7=Ko|first7=Myoung-Hwan|date=August 2019|title=Efficacy of Virtual Reality Combined With Real Instrument Training for Patients With Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=100|issue=8|pages=1400–1408|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2019.03.013|issn=1532-821X|pmid=31002812|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 2004, reports stated that 40% of military members experience PTSD but only 23% seek medical help. Emory physicians described one of the strongest indicators of PTSD to be avoidance, saying this inhibits those affected from seeking treatment.<ref name=":5" /> PE requires that the patient close their eyes and relate the pertinent episode in as much detail as possible. The methodology was based on the concept that in facing the event, the charge of the triggers may be attenuated over time. The VRET application BRAVEMIND differs from PE in that the patient does not reimagine the episode but instead wears a headset that places them in the familiar environment. This headset is equipped with two screens (one for each eye), headphones, and a position monitor that shifts the visual scene to match the patient's head movements. Depending on the patient's experience they may be standing or sitting on top of a raised platform with a bass shaker. This allows for vibrations that simulate the experience of riding a military vehicle. Other accessories such as joysticks or mock machine guns are given to the patients, if appropriate, to enhance realism.<ref name=":4" />

The clinician introduces triggers, such as gunfire, explosions, etc.  into the virtual environment as they see fit. The clinician can also adapt sound and lighting conditions to match the patient's description. The researchers who developed the BRAVEMIND system reported that in a 20-patient trial, the patients’ scores on the diagnostic PTSD checklist–military version (PCL-M) dropped from 54.4 pre-treatment to 35.6 post-treatment after eleven sessions. In another clinical trial, consisting of 24 active-duty soldiers, it was reported that after 7 sessions 45% no longer were identified as positive for PTSD while 62% demonstrated symptomatic improvement. These experimental results were compared with those of alternative PE treatments.<ref name=":3" />

The BRAVEMIND software has 14 different environments available including military barracks, Iraqi markets, and desert roads.<ref name=":5" /> Included in these are environments specific to military sexual trauma (MST). Designed environments such as U.S. base settings, shower areas, latrines, remote shelters, and others were developed after consulting subject matter experts from [[Emory University]].<ref name=":3" />

Proponents of this research have said that with military based videogames being so prevalent, this technology may be more appealing to patients and reduce the stigma surrounding treatment. They also have argued that as research on PTSD unfolds, possible subtypes may respond to treatments differently, and therefore diversifying treatment options is best.<ref name=":5" /> Others have expressed reservations about the capacity to properly personalize VRET for individualized treatment and the use of ethnic stereotyping while developing Arab populated environments.<ref name=":4" />

==Treatment for lesions==
Virtual reality therapy has two promising potential benefits for treatment of [[hemispatial neglect]] patients. These include improvement of diagnostic techniques and as a supplement to rehabilitation techniques.

Current diagnostic techniques usually involve pen and paper tests like the line bisection test. Though these tests have provided relatively accurate diagnostic results, advances in virtual reality therapy (VRT) have proven these tests to not be completely thorough. Dvorkin et al. used a camera system that immersed the patient into a virtual reality world and required the patient to grasp or move object in the world, through [[Positional tracking|tracking]] of arm and hand movements. These techniques revealed that pen and paper tests provide relatively accurate qualitative diagnoses of hemispatial neglect patients, but VRT provided accurate mapping into a 3-dimensional space, revealing areas of space that were thought to be neglected but which patients had at least some awareness. Patients were also retested 10 months from initial measurements, during which each went through regular rehabilitation therapy, and most showed measurably less neglect on virtual reality testing whereas no measurable improvements were shown in the line bisection test.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.smpp.northwestern.edu/~smpp_pub/DvorkinEtAl(2008)VirtualRehabilitation.pdf|title=Assessment and monitoring of recovery of spatial neglect within a virtual environment|author1=Assaf Y Dvorkin|author2=William Z.

Virtual reality therapy has also proven to be effective in rehabilitation of lesion patients suffering from neglect.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=3309210|title=The Effect of Virtual Reality Training on Unilateral Spatial Neglect in Stroke Patients|author1=Yong Mi Kim|author2=Min Ho Chun|author3=Gi Jeong Yun|author4=Young Jin Song|author5=Han Eun Young|journal=Annals of Rehabilitation Medicine|year=2011|volume=35|issue=3|pages=309–315|doi=10.5535/arm.2011.35.3.309|pmid=22506138}}</ref> A study was conducted with 24 individuals suffering from hemispatial neglect. A control group of 12 individuals underwent conventional rehabilitation therapy including visual scanning training, while the virtual reality group (VR) were immersed in 3 virtual worlds, each with a specific task.  The programs consisted of
#"Bird and Ball" in which a patient touches a flying ball with his or her hand and turns it into a bird
#"Coconut", in which a patient catches a coconut falling from a tree while moving around
#"Container" in which a patient moves a box carried in a container to the opposite side.

Each of the patients of VR went through 3 weeks of 5-day-a-week 30-minute intervals emerged in these programs. The controls went through the equivalent time in traditional rehabilitation therapies. Each patient took the star cancellation test, line bisection test, and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) 24 hours before and after the three-week treatment to assess the severity of unilateral spatial neglect. The VR group showed a higher increase in the star cancellation test and CBS scores after treatment than the control group (p<0.05), but both groups did not show any difference in the line bisection test and K-MBI before and after treatment. These results suggest that virtual reality programs can be more effective than conventional rehabilitation and thus should be further researched.

==VR advantages over IVE==
The preference of virtual reality exposure therapy over in-vivo [[exposure therapy]] is often debated, but there are many obvious advantages of virtual reality exposure therapy that make it more desirable. For example, the proximity between the client and therapist can cause problems when in-vivo therapy is used and transportation is not reliable for the client or it is impractical for them to travel as far as needed. However, virtual reality exposure therapy can be done from anywhere in the world if given the necessary tools. Going along with the idea of unavailable transportation and proximity, there are many individuals who require therapy but due to various forms of immobilizations (paralysis, extreme obesity, etc.) they can not physically be moved to where the therapy is conducted. Again, because virtual reality exposure therapy can be conducted anywhere in the world, those with mobility issues will no longer be discriminated against. Another major advantage is fewer ethical concerns than in-vivo exposure therapy.

Another advantage to virtual reality rehab over the traditional method is patient motivation. When presented with difficult tasks during a prolonged period, patients tend to lose interest in these tasks. This causes a decrease in compliance due to decreased motivation of completing a given task. Virtual reality rehab is advantageous in such a way that it challenges and motivates the patient to do more. With simple things like high scores, in-game awards, and ranks, not only are patients motivated to do their daily therapies, they are having fun doing it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burdea|first=G. C.|date=2003|title=Virtual rehabilitation--benefits and challenges|journal=Methods of Information in Medicine|volume=42|issue=5|pages=519–523|issn=0026-1270|pmid=14654886|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1634378|s2cid=4772209|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ad64686b8a2f8a19cff4cb99307f5a3f566dda3}}</ref> Not only is this advantageous to the patients, it is advantageous to the physical therapist. With these high scores, and data the game or application collects, therapists can analyze the data to see progression. This progression can be charted and visually shown to the patient for increased motivation on their performance and the progression they have made thus far in their therapies. This data can then be charted with other participants doing similar tasks and can show how they compare to people with similar therapy regimens. This charted data in the program or game can then be used by researchers and scientists alike for further evaluation of optimal therapy regimens. A recent study done in 2016 where a VR based virtual simulation of a city named Reh@City was made. This city in virtual reality evoked memory, attention, visuo-spatial abilities and executive functions tasks are integrated in the performance of several daily routines. This study looked at Activities of Daily Living in post stroke patients and found it to have more of an impact than conventional methods in the recovery process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Faria|first1=Ana Lúcia|last2=Andrade|first2=Andreia|last3=Soares|first3=Luísa|last4=I Badia|first4=Sergi Bermúdez|date=2016|title=Benefits of virtual reality-based cognitive rehabilitation through simulated activities of daily living: a randomized controlled trial with stroke patients|journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation|volume=13|issue=1|pages=96|doi=10.1186/s12984-016-0204-z|issn=1743-0003|pmc=5094135|pmid=27806718}}</ref>

==Concerns==
There are a few ethical concerns concerning the use and development of using virtual reality simulation for helping clients/patients with mental health issues. One example of these concerns is the potential side effects and aftereffects of virtual reality exposure. Some of these side effects and aftereffects could include [[Virtual reality sickness|cybersickness]] (a type of [[motion sickness]] caused by the virtual reality experience), perceptual-motor disturbances, flashbacks, and generally lowered arousal (Rizzo, Schultheis, & Rothbaum, 2003).  If severe and widespread enough, these effects should be mitigated via various methods by those therapists using virtual reality.

Another ethical concern is how clinicians should receive VRT certification. Due to the relative newness of virtual reality as a whole, there may not be many clinicians who have experience with the nuances of virtual reality exposure or VR programs' intended roles in therapy. According to Rizzo et al. (2003), virtual reality technology should only be used as a tool for qualified clinicians instead of being used to further one's practice or garner an attraction for new clients/patients.

Some traditional concerns with virtual reality therapy is the cost. Since virtual reality in the field of science and medicine is so primitive and new, the costs of virtual reality equipment would be a lot higher than some of the traditional methods. With medical costs growing at an exponential level this would be another cost that is added to the growing list of medical bills for a patients recovery process. Regardless of the benefits with virtual reality rehab, the costs of the equipment and the resources for a virtual reality setup would make it difficult for it to be mainstream and available to all patients including the indigent population. However, a new market of lower cost virtual reality hardware is emerging, specifically with improved head-mounted displays.<ref>Coburn, J. Q., Freeman, I., and Salmon, J. L. (July 18, 2017).

September 2017; 17(3): 031013. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4036921</nowiki></ref>

In addition there are some issues which are related to virtual reality that can arise from its use such as social isolation where the users can become detached from real-world social connections and the overestimation of a person's abilities where users – especially the young<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Jakki O.|last2=Bailenson|first2=Jeremy N.|date=2017-01-02|title=Considering virtual reality in children's lives|journal=Journal of Children and Media|volume=11|issue=1|pages=107–113|doi=10.1080/17482798.2016.1268779|s2cid=152067978|issn=1748-2798|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/295e58565ce838b0ad021249cc2a5e0c339bebd1}}</ref> – often fail to distinguish between their feats in real life and virtual reality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/04/10-ethical-concerns-that-will-shape-the-vr-industry/|title=10 ethical concerns that will shape the VR industry|date=2018-01-05|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>
