'''John A. "Skip" Laitner''' (born August 23, 1947) is an American-born economist, author and lecturer. He focuses on developing a more robust technology and behavioral characterization of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] resources for use in energy and climate economic policy models.<ref>[http://aceee.org/node/97 ACEEE Staff, John A. 'Skip' Laitner]</ref>

Laitner leads a team of consultants, the Economic and Human Dimensions Research Associates<ref>[http://www.nppd.com/assets/february12minutes_special.pdf NPPD Meeting Minutes, Feb. 8, 2012, p. 2.]</ref> based in Tucson, Arizona. He is the past president of the [https://aessonline.org Association of Environmental Studies and Sciences] (AESS), an independent interdisciplinary professional association in higher education.  He is also a senior economic research fellow for the [https://www.ranepa.ru/eng/ Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration] (RANEPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ranepa.ru/eng/|title=RANEPA|website=www.ranepa.ru|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>

Laitner is the former Director of Economic and Social Analysis for the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] (ACEEE).<ref>[http://aceee.org/node/97 ACEEE Staff, John A. 'Skip' Laitner]</ref>  He previously served almost 10 years as a senior economist for Technology Policy for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). He left the federal service in June 2006 to focus his research on developing a more robust technology and behavioral characterization of energy efficiency resources for use in energy and climate policy analyses and within economic policy models. He also provides technical support for a variety of local governments in the development of energy and climate profiles, especially as they positively shape and enhance long-term sustainable development goals.   

Laitner is the author of more than 320 book chapters, journal articles, and reports about environmental, energy, and economic policy.<ref>[http://aceee.org/node/97 ACEEE Staff, John A. 'Skip' Laitner] at aceee.org</ref>  His expertise includes benefit-cost assessments, behavioral assessments, resource costs and constraints, and the net employment and macroeconomic impacts of energy and climate policy scenarios.  His research, building on the work of [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert U. Ayres]] and Benjamin Warr, examines links between energy efficiency and economic [[labor productivity|productivity]].<ref>[http://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2013/roundtableonmacroecoemploymentimpactsofee/12_SkipLaitner.pdf The Economic Imperative and Opportunity of Long-Term Energy Efficiency, John A. 'Skip' Laitner, IEA Roundtable on Macroeconomic Impacts, Jan. 2013]</ref> In a new book chapter, Laitner provides a time series dataset that suggests the United States may be only 14 percent energy efficient, a level of inefficiency which could constrain the development of a more robust economy.

==Career==

'''2012 to Present''': Founder of Economic and Human Dimensions Research Associates, based in Tucson, Arizona, where he leads a team of consultants. 

'''2006 to 2012''': Director of Economic and Social Analysis for [[ACEEE]]. In that capacity, he was responsible for a range of benefit-cost assessments of energy policies as they affect both [[climate and energy]] policies and the macroeconomy, including energy prices, net employment, and [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) impacts.<ref>[http://aceee.org/node/97 ACEEE Staff, John A. 'Skip' Laitner]</ref>

'''1997 to 2006''': Senior Economist for Technology Policy within U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]]â€™s Office of Atmospheric Programs. Laitner was responsible for analysis and development of policy options for a variety of energy, climate change, and air pollution problems. This focused on the analysis and assessment of climate change policy options designed to provide further understanding of the macroeconomic benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy at the national and regional level through the better linking of technology costing models and macroeconomic or general equilibrium models.<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/3cdbd09d7c867d9785256c9200548b12/ddb1a8ed5526f21785256d8700764b2f/$FILE/Laitner.PDF Incorporating Industrial Productivity Benefits into the Assessment of Energy Efficiency Investments], EPA-NCEE Symposium, Sept. 9, 2003.</ref>
