'''Tamale''' ([[Dagbani language|Dagbani]] : {{IPA-ak|ˈtamali|}}),{{fix|text=needs tone markings}} officially called [[ Tamale Metropolitan District|Tamale Metropolitan Area]] is the [[capital town|capital city]] of the [[Northern Region, Ghana|Northern Region]] of [[Ghana]]. Tamale is Ghana's third-largest city and an emerging investment hotspot in [[West Africa]]. It has a projected population of 950,124 according to the Tamale Metropolitan Assembly Official Website. It is the fastest-growing city in West Africa.<ref>[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=270959 GhanaWeb.com] ghanaweb.com</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://population.mongabay.com/population/ghana | title=The largest cities in Ghana, ranked by population | publisher=Mongabay.com | date=2013 | access-date=1 May 2014}}</ref> The city is located {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Accra]].<ref>[http://www.icli.nl/en/ghana/tamale.html Tamale, Northern Region (Ghana)]. icli.nl.</ref>
Most residents of Tamale are [[Islam in Ghana|Muslims]] and [[Dagombas]] by tribe, as reflected by the multitude of [[Mosque|mosques]] in Tamale, most notably the Central Mosque, Afa Ajura Mosque (Ambariyyah Mosque), and The Ahmadiyyah Muslim mission Mosque.

Tamale is located in the [[Northern Region, Ghana|Northern Region]] of [[Ghana]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=3 Suspected kidnappers arrested in Tamale|url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/3-suspected-kidnappers-arrested-in-tamale.html?fbclid=IwAR3R1BI2phZV2zd9CdwLjreW_6Q2ofh0rMUELTub8hSFcZ-QLafTSzoAUqY|access-date=2021-05-22|website=Graphic Online|language=en-gb}}</ref> and more precisely in the [[Kingdom of Dagbon]]. The local (neighbourhood) chiefs and the district chief of Tamale are subservient to the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] King in [[Yendi]].The language of the people in Tamale is Dagbani.

Due to its central location, Tamale serves as a hub for all administrative and commercial activities in the Northern Region, doubling as the political, economic and financial capital of the Northern Region. The centre of Tamale hosts regional branches of financial institutions and a considerable number of international and local nongovernmental organisations.<ref name="Tamale, capital of Northern region">[http://ghana-net.com/tamale.aspx Tamale, capital of Northern region, Ghana]. ghana-net.com.</ref>

Tamale has developed and transformed significantly in the last few years.<ref name="catointl.org">[http://www.catointl.org/download/TamaleChildrensHome.pdf Tamale Children's Home Tamale, Northern Region (Ghana)]. catointl.org</ref> The new dimension of Tamale's development is the rush by various companies to open branches in Tamale. The hospitality industry has grown significantly, with new hotels and guest houses built around Tamale.<ref name="Tamale metropolitan">[http://www.tamale.ghanadistricts.gov.gh Tamale metropolitan]</ref> Tamale grew from a conglomeration of towns where one could find an architectural blend of traditional mud houses and more modern buildings. Tamale's new and modern facilities include the newly constructed [[Tamale Stadium]] (now Aliu Mahama sports Stadium named after late Ghana's vice-president, [[Aliu Mahama|Alhaji Aliu Mahama]]), replacing the town's former principal football pitch, [[Kaladan Park]], with a world-class venue. Indeed, many improvements to Tamale's infrastructure occurred in the period leading up to the 2008 African Cup of Nations tournament. Further improvements were made, particularly to Tamale's road system.<ref name="Tamale metropolitan"/> The Tamale sports stadium was renamed after the late Vice president, [[Aliu Mahama|Alhaji Aliu Mahama]] in the year 2018. Upon arriving in the city, one will be quick to notice that the roads of the city are occupied with motorcycles with "''mapukas"'' being the most patronised. This, however, does not interfere with the steady smooth flow of traffic on the major roads of the city.

Tamale is located on the crossing of three ancient trade routes; it started to grow as a commercial centre for the Northern region centuries ago. The north–south road from [[Paga]] and [[Bolgatanga]] to [[Salaga]] had raiders passing, whilst other merchants brought their goods into Tamale. Salt came from [[Daboya, Ghana|Daboya]], to the north-west of Tamale, and followed a road that continued to [[Yendi Phillips|Yendi.]] A third road linked [[Gushegu]] to the capital of the [[Gonja (kingdom)|Gonja kingdom]], [[Damongo]]. The present locations of the central market and the palace of the Gulkpe naa,<ref>The Gulkpe naa is one of the seven district chiefs in the [[Dagomba people|Dagbon]]; in rank directly under the Paramount Chief, he overlooks the local chiefs in and around Tamale.</ref> opposite [[Barclays Bank]] and near the library, mark the junctions of the ancient roads.

Around this palace, a residential neighbourhood began to grow. It is now known as Dagbangdabi-Fong (the name means "Traditional men area"). This was followed by Changli, Belipiela, and BuglanaFong ("Fetish Priest's area") further to the south. Each neighbourhood got its own local chief. As the distances to the market place grew, people started to settle elsewhere around the crossing, so the quarters of Tishigu and Abu-Abu came up. An influx of northerners from present-day Burkina Faso led to the building of Moshi Zongo. In the same time, the remote village of Vitteng came into existence.

Garden cities were brought to Tamale and at the back of [[Sakasaka]] grew [[Kalpohin Estates]], even now a pleasant neighbourhood with plenty trees, big gardens, and small houses. In the 1970s, urban extensions such as [[Zogbeli]], [[Lamakara]], and [[Lamashegu]] were built, neighbourhoods characterised by checkboard planning of square house plots and orthogonal streets and alleys. Since 2000, Tamale seems to have grown more rapidly, so the whole district of Tamale is now urban agglomeration.

==Climate==
Tamale features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's climate classification]]. The metropolis experiences one rainy season from April to September or October, with a peak in July and August. The mean annual rainfall is 1100&nbsp;mm within 95 days of rainfall in the form of tropical showers. Consequently, staple crop farming is highly restricted by the short rainy season.

The dry season is usually from November to early April. It is influenced by the dry north-easterly (''Harmattan'') winds, while the rainy season is influenced by the moist south-westerly winds. The mean daytime temperatures range from 28 (December and mid-April) to 43 (March, early April) degrees Celsius, while mean nighttime temperatures range from 18 (December) to 25 (February, March) degrees Celsius. The mean annual daily sunshine is about 7.5 hours.

==Government==
[[File:Visit tamale own pictures 012 (5348920586).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tamale Metropolitan District]] Mayor–[[Council]] Government Office and Secretary]]
Tamale has a mayor–council government system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers. The mayor is appointed by the Ghana president and approved by the town council, the [[Tamale Metropolitan Assembly]], although suggestions have been made by the residents of Tamale to increase accountability of the office by having the mayor elected. The current mayor of Tamale is Hon. Iddrisu Musah Superior.<ref>{{Cite web|last=MyNewsGH|date=2021-01-30|title=2nd term: I’ll prefer being unemployed than continuing as Tamale Mayor – Musah Superior|url=https://www.mynewsgh.com/ill-prefer-being-unemployed-than-be-tamale-mayor-again-musah-superior/|access-date=2021-09-23|website=MyNewsGh|language=en-US}}</ref> The name [[Tamale Metropolitan Assembly]] serves both for the local parliament and for the local executive. Local policies are always executed in this name, so for example, illegal constructions often show the command "remove by TMA" (meaning that the Tamale Metropolitan Assembly or its executive has ordered to remove the building as it is contrary to current urban land-use planning). As the local executive, Tamale Metropolitan Assembly is the strong arm of the mayor, his or her civil service. If mention is made of assembly women or men, however, the reference is to the elected representatives of the inhabitants of Tamale. They form the assembly properly speaking, and must decide about local by-laws before they can come into force.
The name "Tamale Metropolitan District" is used in the geographical sense, to refer to the area within its borders.

==Education==
[[File:Entrance of the central administration block of the new University for Development Studies (UDS) in Tamale.jpg|thumb|right|The new [[University for Development Studies]] (UDS)]]

Tamale is the principal centre of education in Northern Ghana. Currently, a total of 742 basic schools are within the metropolis. This comprises 94 kindergartens, 304 primary, 112 junior high, and 14 senior high schools. The rest are technical/vocational institutions, two colleges of education, a technical university and two other universities – one public and the other private.<ref name="catointl.org"/>

In the Education Ridge neighbourhood in the north-western part of the town and covering an area around 3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 20 schools ranging from kindergartens through junior high and senior high schools, teachers' training colleges, the Tamale Technical University, and a university are located. The numerous trees lining the streets in this part of the town give it a tropical rainforest outlook. The [[University for Development Studies]] (UDS) has two campuses located in Tamale and one in nearby [[Nyankpala]]. The headquarters of the UDS is also located in Tamale.<ref>[http://www.sclou.org/store/files/introtamale Introduction to Tamale and the Northern Region]. sclou.org.</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Bus Rapid Transit, Tamale.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bus rapid transit]] in Tamale]]
Tamale is served by [[Tamale Airport]]. Located about {{convert|11|km|nmi mi|0|abbr=on}} from downtown Tamale, the airport is mainly used by commercial airlines such as [[Africa World Airlines]] and Passion Air (the only operational companies currently) as well as [[Starbow Airlines]] and [[Antrak Air]], which ran regular flights between Tamale and Accra's [[Kotoka International Airport]], along with other regional capitals.<ref>[http://www.ghana-pedia.org/org/index.php?option=com_directory&listing=Tamale%20Airport&page=viewListing&lid=140&Itemid=36 Tamale Airport Listings]. Ghanapedia.</ref>

There are Public Transports from Tamale to major citie such as [[Kumasi]]; [[Accra]], [[ Mim, Ahafo]] ; [[Cape Coast]], [[ Sunyani]]; [[ Takoradi]]; [[ Tema]]; [[Ho, Ghana| Ho]]; [[Wa, Ghana|Wa]]; [[ Bolgatanga]]; [[ Elubo]]; [[ Aflao]], [[Techiman]];
Public transportation 
in the form of taxis used to be the most convenient means of getting around Tamale for visitors to the town until the arrival of the Tri-cycles, popularly called "Mahama-Cambuu". Mahama Cambuu is a coined name by the local people from the expression "Mahama can do". This is because these Tri-cycles (mostly yellow in color) came in the era of the former president, H.E John Dramani Mahama. It is comparatively cheaper than the Taxis and usually on the move unlike the Taxis that are regularized and stationed at a points. It is however, not very safe compared to the Taxis. The popular means of travel for the locals, however, is by motorbike. This phenomenon is helped by the existence of bike paths in the town, making it one of the most bike-friendly settlements in the Northern region. Transportation out of town is facilitated by the Tamale's [[bus rapid transit]] system, ''[[tro-tro]]'' private mini-bus system, [[Metro mass Transit L.T.D|MetroMass]] [[Public transport bus service|Bus-Based Mass Transit]] system, and STC Bus Lines, along with a host of charter bus companies, all of which provide transport to connect Tamale with the many other surrounding towns and cities.
