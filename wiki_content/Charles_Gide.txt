'''Charles Gide''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒid|lang}}; 1847–1932) was a French [[economics|economist]] and [[history of economic thought|historian of economic thought]].  He was a [[professor]] at the [[University of Bordeaux]], at [[Université de Montpellier|Montpellier]], at [[Université de Paris]] and finally at [[Collège de France]]. His nephew was the author [[André Gide]].

== Academic work ==

An initiator of the ''Revue d'économie politique'' in 1887, Gide was a proponent of the French [[historical school of economics]].<ref name="cepa"/>

Gide was one of the few endorsers of [[Léon Walras]], as they shared a social philosophy, social activism, and disdain for the "Manchester-style" economics of the ''journalistes''.<ref name="cepa">[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/frenchlib.htm "History of Economic Thought"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203033757/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/frenchlib.htm |date=February 3, 2007 }}, The French Liberal School Website.  Note: The French Liberal School had lost interest in serious economic theory by the 1830s.</ref>

== Social activism ==

During the early 1880s Gide worked with Édouard de Boyve, founder in 1884 of the cooperative ''Abeille Nîmoise'', and with the former manufacturer [[Auguste Marie Fabre]]. 
These three men founded the French cooperative philosophy that came to be known as the ''École de Nîmes''.
The ''Sociétés Coopératives de Consommation de France'' had its first national congress in Paris on 27 July 1885.<ref name=Sanders2002/>
The journal ''l'Émancipation'' was initiated at this meeting, and was published first on 15 November 1886 in Nîmes.
Gide, de Boyve and Fabre all contributed to the journal.<ref name=Sanders2002>{{cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/collections/scratchers/background.php

Gide was active in the social Protestant movement, as were other [[Musée social]] members such as [[Jules Siegfried]] (1837–1922), [[Édouard Gruner]] (1849–1933), Henri Monod (1843–1911) and [[Pierre-Paul Guieysse]] (1841–1914).{{sfn|Horne|2002|p=114}}
As a Protestant [[Christian Socialist]], Gide was involved with progressive politics in France, endorsing the ''[[université populaire]]'' philosophy after the [[Dreyfus Affair]].  He promoted the establishment of a School for Advanced Social Studies (''École supérieure de sciences sociales'') (1899). Additionally, he served among the early faculty of the ''[[École supérieure de journalisme de Paris]]''.<ref>[http://www.esj-paris.com/histoire-de-lesj-paris/ "Histoire"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630123438/http://www.esj-paris.com/histoire-de-lesj-paris/ |date=June 30, 2011 }}, Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Paris website, accessed 4 July 2011</ref> Together with the School for Social Studies, it was established in 1899 as one of three ''[[grandes écoles]]'' developing from the ''Collège libre de science sociales'' initiated in 1895.

Gide endorsed the ''Union pour la Verite'' (League for Truth) created by philosopher Paul Desjardins in 1892 promoting the cause of the Jewish army officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]] during the [[Dreyfus Affair|political scandal]] involving him.  Gide was interested in reform projects as well, such as the ''Alliance d'Hygiène Sociale'' (Alliance of Social Hygiene, created in 1905), and reported on the social economy exhibition at the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900.<ref name="Saunier">[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.cgi?path=23101905546243 Pierre-Yves Saunier, "Review of Marc Penin, 'Charles Gide 1847–1932.

Gide was a champion of the [[cooperative]] philosophy, including both [[agricultural cooperatives|agricultural]] and [[Consumers' Co-operative|consumers' cooperatives]], during the first third of the 20th century.  His book, ''Consumers' Co-operative Societies'', which was published first in French in 1904, and in English in 1921, is a classic of [[co-operative economics]], in the tradition of [[Co-operative Federalism]].<ref name="Saunier"/>
