== Research ==
Corrado's research focuses on macroeconomic issues in the United States, China, Europe and Japan. She focuses her research on intangible assets, innovation and economic growth where she has authored a number of papers. Much of her research addresses the changing digital economy and the role that information and communication technology (ICT) has had on economic and productivity growth.<ref name=":1" /> Further, a large portion of her work with [[The Conference Board]] has been on the topic of the knowledge economy and the role of intangible assets in driving innovation and growth on both the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] and [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== "Intangible Capital and U.S. Economic Growth" ===
Corrado's paper "Intangible Capital and U.S. Economic Growth" that she co-authored with Charles Hulten and Daniel Sichel analyzes the exclusion of intangible investment from calculated GDP and the impact it has on measured economic growth. They point out how accounting practices have lagged behind the "technological revolution" which has increased the level of intangible investment in the United States economy.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Corrado|first1=Carol|last2=Hulten|first2=Charles|last3=Sichel|first3=Daniel|date=2009|title=Intangible Capital and U.s. Economic Growth|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4991.2009.00343.x|journal=Review of Income and Wealth|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=661–685|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4991.2009.00343.x|s2cid=54507148|issn=1475-4991}}</ref> Subsequently, modern accounting measures omit a large percentage of actual GDP in their calculated measure. By including intangibles in their measure Corrado, Hulten and Sichel find that over "$3 trillion of business intangible capital stock" has been left out of calculated GDP measures and lead to inaccurate representations of the United States economic growth.<ref name=":3" /> Since being published in 2009 ''Intangible Capital and U.S. Economic Growth'' has received considerable international recognition, winning the Kendricks Prize and being cited in ''Businessweek'', the ''Economist'', and the ''New York Times''.<ref name=":3" />

=== "Improving GDP: Demolishing, Repointing or Extending?*" ===
Corrado's Indigo Prize winning paper "Improving GDP: Demolishing, Repointing or Extending?*" considers the GDP measure and its validity as a measurement of the modern economy which has significantly changed since the introduction of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] measure. Corrado offers a modern re-evaluation of the measure proposing that it should "measure intangible and environmental capital, to quality-adjust prices, to run online experiments on willingness-to-pay for free goods" along with "extending GDP to measure economic well-being better: using some of the components of GDP such as consumption, along with leisure and measures of security" to accurately represent the transformed modern economy.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carolcorrado.com/research|title=Research|website=Carol Corrado|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> She points out that the current measure is susceptible to double counting and does not account for necessary market weights which is currently measured by prices. To fix this Corrado recommends that we need to "repoint" GDP to account for prices that are "quality-adjusted" in the rapidly expanding "knowledge economy" which is experiencing a digital paradigm.<ref name=":4" /> The digitization of the "knowledge economy" is leading to an increase in non-market activities that are not accounted for in the current GDP measure as it strictly measures market production. Thus a reappointed GDP measure needs to redefine and reestablish the "boundary line" between non-market and market production that has become increasingly blurred by digitization.<ref name=":4" />

=== "Innovation and intangible investment in Europe, Japan, and the United States" ===
"Innovation and intangible investment in Europe, Japan, and the United States" measures innovation by analyzing intangible investment and its relation with information and communication technology, spillovers, and policy.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Corrado|first1=Carol|last2=Haskel|first2=Jonathan|last3=Jona-Lasinio|first3=Cecilia|last4=Iommi|first4=Massimiliano|date=2013|title=Innovation and intangible investment in Europe, Japan, and the United States|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/oxford/v29y2013i2p261-286.html|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=261–286|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grt017}}</ref> Corrado's paper examines the various perspective of innovation by providing a clear understanding of the diverse approaches to innovation. She points out that many believe innovation in EU countries is decreasing and more innovation is necessary in order to fix destabilized economies.<ref name=":5" /> Corrado addresses these beliefs by breaking down what exactly innovation is and how can it be measured as well as observing the role and value of policy in innovation. She finds that current measures of innovation are too ambiguous and are in need of additional measures that together form a more complete framework.<ref name=":5" /> She notes that innovation has largely shifted from being tangible to intangible, a reality important to consider when analyzing modern growth and innovation.<ref name=":5" /> As a result, she proposes a new model of measurement that takes into account intangible investment within the framework of computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies in addition to the already measured intangibles of research and development, and software.<ref name=":5" /> From this measurement Corrado finds that in the United States intangible capital accounts for half of their total capital deepening where as in the EU countries it only accounts for 23.8%.<ref name=":5" /> Subsequently, she points out that all variables which mediate the monetization of countries investment in knowledge will be imperative factors contributing to the future growth and innovation in EU countries.<ref name=":5" />

=== Book ===
In 2005 Corrado along with John Haltiwanger and Daniel Sichel released the book ''Measuring Capital in the New Economy.'' The book examines how technology has altered the U.S. economy, increasing the role of intangible assets and technology investment. They propose a variety of new approaches and necessary factors that should be included in calculations of capital in order to create more accurate measures of capital in the changing economy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3534624.html|title=Measuring Capital in the New Economy}}</ref>
