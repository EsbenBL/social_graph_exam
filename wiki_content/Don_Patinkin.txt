==Biography==
Don Patinkin was born January 8, 1922, in Chicago, to a family of Jewish emigrants from [[Poland]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} While doing his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Chicago]], he also studied the [[Talmud]] at the [[Hebrew Theological College]] in Chicago. He continued at Chicago for his graduate studies, earning a Ph.D. in 1947 under the supervision of [[Oskar R. Lange]]. Patinkin was a strong [[Zionist]] and, while doing his graduate studies, planned to [[aliyah|immigrate]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]; in his graduate research he studied Palestinian economics, although he did not complete his thesis in this subject.

After graduating he held lecturer positions at the University of Chicago and the [[University of Illinois]] until he succeeded in emigrating to Israel in 1949, where he was hired by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In 1956 he was appointed the research director of the Falk Institute for Economic Research, which was established by [[Simon Kuznets|Simon Kuznetz]] with the support of the Falk Foundation.<ref>Krampf, A. 2010.

==Academic career==
He remained at the Hebrew University. becoming university president from 1982 to 1986, following [[Avraham Harman]]. He resigned due to the poor state of the university's finances and was succeeded by [[Amnon Pazy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> He retired in 1989, and died August 7, 1995, in Jerusalem.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="independent"/><ref name="new school">{{citation|contribution=Don Patinkin, 1922–1995|publisher=[[The New School]]|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/profiles/patinkin.htm|title=History of Economic Thought and Critical Perspectives in Economics|access-date=2011-10-04|first=Gonçalo L.|last=Fonseca|year=2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031071609/http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/profiles/patinkin.htm|archive-date=2011-10-31}}</ref><ref name="ejhet"/>

==Economic research==
Patinkin's work explored some of the [[microfoundations]] of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macroeconomics]], particularly the role of money demand. His monograph ''Money, Interest, and Prices'' (1956) was for many years one of the most widely used advanced references on monetary economics.<ref name="ejhet">{{citation|url=http://economics.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/don_patinkin_origins.pdf|first=P.|last=Mehrling|year=2002|title=Don Patinkin and the origins of postwar monetary orthodoxy|journal=The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought|volume=9|issue=2|pages=161–185|doi=10.1080/09672560210129668|s2cid=154959883}}</ref>

[[Huw Dixon]] believes that: "''Money, Interest and Prices'' is perhaps as great in its vision as Keynes' ''General Theory''.  Whilst the latter has a greater abundance of originality, the former has a greater clarity of insight and formal expression.  Don Patinkin states his theory of the labour market and corresponding notion of the full employment equilibrium in just three pages of ''Money, Interest and Prices'' (in the 1965 edn. pp.&nbsp;127–30).  These pages deserve great attention: they state the labour market model that became the standard foundation for the aggregate supply curve in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model.  Although Patinkin himself did not formulate the AD/AS representation, it is implicit in his ''Money, Interest and Prices''."<ref>[[Huw Dixon|Dixon H]], [http://huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/index.html Surfing Economics], Chapter 3</ref>
