'''Theodor Julius Geiger''' (9 November 1891 in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] - 16 June 1952)  was a [[Germany|German]] [[socialist]], [[lawyer]] and [[sociologist]] who studied [[Sociology of Law]], [[social stratification]] and [[social mobility]], [[methodology]], and [[intelligentsia]], among other things. He was [[Denmark]]'s first professor of sociology, working at the University of Aarhus (1938–1940).

== Life ==

Geiger grew up in [[Landshut]], [[Bavaria]], showing an interest in [[Scandinavia]] and a talent in [[Scandinavian languages]] from an early age.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate">Mayntz, Renate. 1969. The Heritage of Sociology, Theodor Geiger on Social Order and Mass Society. Chicago, Ill: The University of Chicago Press</ref> The son of a gymnasium teacher, Geiger studied [[law]] and [[political science]], first at the [[University of Munich]] from 1910–1912, then at the [[University of Würzburg]] from 1912 - 1914 where he received his [[doctorate]] in law.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" />

In 1914 Geiger voluntarily joined the army; he served until 1918 and was wounded. Simultaneously he wrote a dissertation on the supervision of criminals, ''Die Schutzaufsicht'', supported by Friedrich Oetker. In 1918 he became a [[Doctor of Laws]].

In 1920 Geiger joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD).<ref name="Trappe, Paul">Trappe, Paul. 1968. International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Vol#6, Geiger, Theodor. p. 83-85. The Macmillan Company & the Free Press.</ref> In the same year he became an assistant at the ''Statistischer Reichsamt'', the statistics office, in Munich, working in the trade statistics department from 1924 to 1933. His home, however, was in [[Berlin]], where he published the magazine ''Fremde Presse'' (Foreign Press), with news on the ''[[Reich]]'' ministry for the army from 1920 - 1929. At the same time he edited the information magazine of the newly founded Berlin ''[[Volkshochschule]]'' ([[adult education]] centre) where he had begun to work as a teacher.

Geiger taught at Volkshochschule during a time when the institution was largely for the basic academic and cultural education of working class adults. Here he used the opportunity to focus on the social and political consequences of adult education by promoting critical thinking and [[intellectualism]] in his students.<ref name= "Mayntz, Renate" /> He eventually became principal but left in 1928 to take up the chair of Sociology at Brunswick Institute of Technology.<ref name="Trappe, Paul" />

Geiger had originally joined the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]] ([[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]) in 1924, progressing from being a visiting lecturer, to an associate professor, and finally becoming a full professor of sociology in 1929; this was the first professorship of the department for cultural studies. Geiger's work is still kept at the "Theodor Geiger Archive" at the university. He worked there until 1933, when, due to his anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] beliefs, he had to emigrate to [[Denmark]];<ref name="Agersnap, Torben">Agersnap, Torben. 2000. "Theodor Geiger: Pioneer of Sociology in Denmark." Acta Sociologica #43. Retrieved November 4, 2011.</ref> here he lived until 1943, even obtaining Danish citizenship. In 1939, he wrote "Sociologi", which was for several decades an important textbook.<ref name="Trappe, Paul" />

In Denmark Geiger began by gaining a scholarship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] through the "Instituttet for Historie og Samfundskonomie" in [[Copenhagen]]; later he gave lectures at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. From 1938 - 1940 he was professor of sociology at the [[University of Århus]]—Denmark's first ever professor of sociology.<ref name="Trappe, Paul" /> When German troops entered the city in 1940 he was forced to leave, escaping to [[Odense]] where he lived with his parents-in-law for the next few years. In 1943 he fled once again to [[Sweden]] where he stayed for three years.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Here he gave lectures at the [[University of Stockholm|Universities of Stockholm]], [[University of Uppsala|Uppsala]] and [[University of Lund|Lund]]. When the war ended in 1945, Geiger immediately returned to Århus, taking up his position as professor of sociology once more. His first step was to found the university institute for research into societies, the first institute of its kind in Scandinavia.

From 1948 to 1952, Geiger published the series ''Nordiske Studier i Sociologie'' (Nordic Studies on Sociology) with [[Torgny Torgnysson Segerstedt]], Veli Verkko and [[Johan Vogt]]. In 1949 he was a co-founder of the [[International Sociological Association]].

On 16 June 1952, Geiger died on the return trip from Canada to Denmark on board the ship "Waterman".

==Work==
Geiger is considered the founder of the concept of [[social stratification]], using the concept of stratification (introduced by [[Edward A. Ross|Edward Ross]]) for the analysis of social structures.<ref name= "Trappe, Paul" />

According to this view, society is divided into an indefinite number of social levels or groups, defined according to attributes such as profession, education, upbringing, living standard, power, dress, religion, race, political opinion and organisation. This idea is closely connected to that of [[social mobility]] and the criteria for an [[industrial society]].

At least in Germany, he is also seen as an important contributor to the [[sociology of law]], by publishing, in 1947,  his "Vorstudien zu einer Soziologie des Rechts" (preliminary studies for a sociology of law).<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" />

Geiger also worked on the fundamental concepts of sociology, [[working class education]], industrial organisation, class structure, mobility, the origin and functions of the [[intelligentsia]], critics of ideology, and the nature of modern mass-society and democracy.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" />  He also spent time studying the nature of revolutionary crowds.<ref name="borch2006">[http://asj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/49/1/5 Crowds and Pathos: Theodor Geiger on Revolutionary Action - Borch 49 (1): 5 - Acta Sociologica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Geiger analysed the [[institutionalisation]] of the [[class struggle]], which he called [[democratisation]], and he considered it interconnected with [[corporativism]].<ref name="cambalikova1996">[http://www.humanaffairs.sk/full/hum196b.pdf hum196a<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Geiger published more than 160 works, but only a few have been translated to English thus far.<ref>Hughes, John. 2001. "Geiger's Sociology." Growth and Change Book Reviews. Retrieved November 4, 2011</ref> The [[Danish language|Danish]] body of Geiger's work has been translated (commented version) to [[German language|German]] by Gert J. Fode of the University of Aarhus, edited by Prof. Klaus Rodax ([[University of Erfurt]], Germany).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.proz.com/profile_resources/127110_r46a8615e5a976.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005137/http://static.proz.com/profile_resources/127110_r46a8615e5a976.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}</ref>

==Methodology==
Geiger made many significant contributions to [[methodology]] of the social sciences.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben"/>

Seeing no necessary difference between the laws and methods of the [[natural sciences]] and those of the social sciences, he advocated for unity of the methodologies of all the empirical sciences.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate"/> Geiger believed that sociology can only be a true scientific discipline if it establishes this consistent methodology and a rejection of the [[idiographic]] approach.<ref name= "Mayntz, Renate" /> Further, sociology should not study isolated instances, but rather patterns.<ref name= "Mayntz, Renate" /> This requires iterating between the general and the specific,<ref name= "Mayntz, Renate" /> by alternatively adopting [[wikiwikiweb:catascopic|catascopic]] and [[wikiwikiweb:anascopic|anascopic]] approaches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Banton|first=Michael|date=April 1979|title=Analytical and folk concepts of race and ethnicity|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=127–138|doi=10.1080/01419870.1979.9993258|issn=0141-9870}}</ref>

Geiger stressed the importance of supporting [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] research with [[empirical data]] but also the importance of theory in the analysis of empirical evidence.<ref name= "Mayntz, Renate" /> He believed that concepts are not to be derived from observation and experience alone but must be supported by them.<ref name= "Mayntz, Renate" />

The professor in [[Philosophy]] at the University of Aarhus, Svend Ranulf, at the time of Geiger's professorship there in Sociology, wrote a textbook about social science methodology, making arguments against some social scientists' methodologies.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> In particular, he argued against Geiger.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> Ranulf had been an applicant for the professorship position that Geiger was awarded in 1938.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> Ranulf alluded in his textbook that the methodologies of some sociologists, among them Theodor Geiger, could lead to a new Nazi movement.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> In 1946 Geiger wrote and published a short book, "Ranulf Contra Geiger, an Attack and an Offensive Defense".<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> In this book, Geiger outlined very carefully what his methodologies were, emphasizing that empirical sociology is built on concepts but is a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] study of social processes and phenomena.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> He validated one point made by Ranulf, that data should be collected in a non-biased way but he also defended that concepts come prior to data collection in research, and although such concepts may need revision after collection of data is through, any data collection without a conceptual foundation is illogical.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" /> In response to Ranulf's opposition to [[qualitative data]] and interpretation, Geiger argued that these were okay for analysis as long as the researcher maintained a value-free approach.<ref name= "Agersnap, Torben" />

Geiger published several articles in 1948 and 1949 about his theoretical considerations of methodology.<ref name="Trappe, Paul"/>

==Thought==

===Social Stratification and Mobility===
[[Social Stratification]] and [[Social mobility]] were included among Geiger's main interests and within these subfields, he made several contributions to [[sociology]].<ref name="Trappe, Paul" /> His interest in social stratification began in the 1920s when he initially accepted the [[Marxist]] definition of class.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate"/> However, Geiger quickly developed his own definition of class and several theories on the subject.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> In his 1930 publication (On the Theory of the Class Concept and the Proletarian Class), he distinguished his view from the Marxist concept that [[class structure]] is entirely determined by ownership of the [[means of production]].<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger argued that the Marxist ideology of class was a decent generalization but that it was also a "type concept" and described only a partial view of reality.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Further, he felt that the Marxist Two-class model was an accurate description of the earliest forms of [[capitalism]] but that modern developments did not fulfill Marx's predictions of the polarization of classes and intensified [[class conflict]].<ref name="Agersnap, Torben"/>  He believed society to be dynamic, so although he agreed with Marx, he believed that there are other causes and types of stratification other than those of the narrow Marxist definition and concept.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Instead, he looked at the classes of society in terms of stages, with estate society preceding the class conflict of Geiger's present, and a new stage to come in which society will form into distinct, specific social groups.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> He also acknowledged [[income]], level of education, and [[political power]] as new factors for stratification.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> Geiger developed a complex model and typology of social stratification, which was published in Wörterbuch der Soziologie (1955).<ref name="Trappe, Paul" /> In many ways, Geiger defended Marxism but he also agreed with arguments that many predictions made by Marxist class theory were not carried out.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" />

In 1932, Geiger wrote an analysis of the classes in Germany.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> The analysis was based on an [[empirical study]] of social stratification.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> In his analysis of the data, he classified the population into five groups, more complex than capitalists and [[proletariat]] as used by Marx, to determine the objective economic criteria of class.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Here, he made the distinction between objective and subjective forms of social class analysis including objective [[social status]] and subjective [[class consciousness]], respectively.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> He distinguishes the "old" middle class of farmers, artisans, and merchants from the "new" middle class of well trained professionals.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger saw the new salary-earning [[middle class]] as a sort of evolution of the proletarian class.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> He also believed that the middle class was more susceptible to new extremist [[ideologies]] like [[Nazism]] because it has a defensive and vulnerable position due to its lack of secure class identity.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> He elaborated on these ideas about the middle class in Klassesamfundeti Stobegryden (Class Society in the Melting Pot), after World War II.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> In London, Geiger and David Glass formed a subcommittee on social stratification and mobility and together they started a comparative study of international mobility and stratification.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" />

In 1949, Geiger did an empirical study of social stratification in Aarhus.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> The study was conducted through the general [[census]] of Aarhus, by adding a question about father's [[Job (role)|occupation]] and father-in-law's occupation, in addition to asking the subject's own occupation.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> The participants included over 40,000 men.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> The study was done carefully and objectively. He took all factors and variables into account to ensure [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Instead of looking at individual relationships for evidence in his analysis, he paid attention to group fluctuations that affected large scale changes in size and social rank of groups and instead of looking at vertical mobility, he looked at mobility between generations, throughout eighteen occupational categories.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> The main result of the data was a decrease in social mobility over time.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> In Geiger's analysis, he took these findings to reflect a period of increasing stability following a period of stratification type transition.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> He attributed this to the [[democratization]] of Denmark in the 1930s and 1940s that he claims led to a decrease in the need and desire for [[upward mobility]].<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" />

===Ideology and Value-free thought===
Ideology to Geiger is "a concept in the theory of knowledge," or "the atheoretical taken theoretically."<ref name="Trappe, Paul" /> His actual definition of ideology was: A statement that has or is presented to have an apparent meaning, claiming to be theoretical and factual while maintaining elements that are not theoretical, objective, or empirically supported and/or valid.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> His theory of ideology, resting on a [[methodological]] basis, was: "That to claim objective truth from a creation of the imagination is an ideology and is invalid".<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger was very concerned with Value Freedom, or the difference between value and fact, and the belief that Science cannot be valid when making Value-judgements.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> A Value-judgement is an ideological statement because it disguises a value as a statement of fact, claiming to be valid and objective.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger was led to these beliefs by the Uppsala school and Hägerstrom.<ref name="Trappe, Paul" />

Geiger's Value [[Nihilism]] refers to his advocacy for the illegitimacy of [[social norms]] made by moral claims.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" />  Here, he stands in opposition to [[structural-functionalism]].<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Value nihilism allows for value-judgements but does not allow them to become theories.<ref name="Trappe, Paul" />

In his last work, ""Demokratie ohne Dogma"" published after his death in 1960, Geiger calls for "intellectual humanism", "enlightenment of the masses," "democratization of reason," "asceticism of emotion," and "abstinence from value judgement."<ref name="Trappe, Paul" /> He considered this last work to be his greatest political contribution.<ref name="Trappe, Paul" />

===Intelligentsia===
Theodor Geiger's definition of [[intelligentsia]] is "Those who create the objects of representative culture." In this context, the word "objects" is not to be taken purely in a literal sense.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger saw intelligentsia as a functional term, distinct from [[intellectual]] which refers to a person that conceives of immaterial concepts and importance but who does not necessarily function to create.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> According to Geiger, the functions of the intelligentsia include: fueling progression, creating works of [[art]] and knowledge that serve to make life [[spirtuality|spiritual]], creating applicable science with the purpose of making life [[rational]], and criticizing power.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> This last function: criticism of power refers to being critical of any current or potential power structures within society, based on their possible oppression of the group's ability to create.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> However, they should not be confused as a revolutionary force.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> His theory was formulated in contrary response to Mannheim's concept of the intelligentsia as political leaders.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger saw the intelligentsia's function of criticism as the responsibility to destroy ideologies of the powerful, not to create ideologies of their own.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> But while this is not their function, according to Geiger, he acknowledges that they do it anyway.<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> He thought that the intelligentsia should create works of art or imagination, and that they should separately support Scientific theories with empirical evidence, but that they should not combine imagination with theory in the form of ideology.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" />  The intelligentsia, as a group,  do not belong to any one social class, neither objectively or subjectively speaking. In fact, Geiger categorizes them into four social classes: [[gentry]], [[bourgeois]], [[proletarian]], and [[democracy|democratic]].<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" />

After giving lectures in Sweden at Uppsala school on Intelligentsia in 1943,<ref name="Mayntz, Renate" /> Geiger wrote about their position in society, their functions and their origin in 1944.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> This work was published in 1949.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" /> Shortly after, he returned to Denmark, where he conducted an empirical study on the origins and structure of Danish Intelligentsia, based on the Danish Biographical Encyclopedia, enabling him to study the group over a four hundred year span.<ref name="Agersnap, Torben" />
