'''Walden Flores Bello''' (born November 11, 1945) is a Filipino [[academic]], [[environmentalist]], and [[social worker]] who served as a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. He is an international adjunct professor at [[Binghamton University]],<ref>https://www.binghamton.edu/sociology/faculty/profile.html?id=waldenbello</ref> professor of sociology and [[public administration]] at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], as well as executive director of Focus on the Global South.

==Early life==
Bello was born in [[Cardona, Rizal]] to Luz Flores and Jesse Bello from [[Ilocos Norte]] and [[Ilocos Sur]], respectively.<ref name=campaignbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2015/10/25/18779236.php|title=Walden Bello Runs for Senator of the Philippines, Pushes Reforms in Governance|date=2015-10-25|author=Walden Bello for Senator Movement}}</ref> His family paid for his [[Jesuit]] schooling at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and he attended [[graduate school]] at [[Princeton University]]. While attending Princeton in the United States, he was introduced to the [[anti-war movement]] and led an occupation of the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson Center]]. The confrontation with police during these protests radicalized Bello and inspired him to pursue a life of activism. For his graduate studies, he traveled to Chile and stayed in shanty towns following [[Salvador Allende]]'s [[socialist]] rise to the presidency.<ref name=Pstar>{{cite news|last1=Ramos Shahani|first1=Lila|title=The Kentex Fire: A Conversation with Walden Bello|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2015/05/26/1458669/kentex-fire-conversation-walden-bello|access-date=27 January 2016|work=philstar.com|agency=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=26 May 2015}}</ref>

When he returned to the United States to defend his dissertation, he lost his ability to return to the Philippines after his passport had been revoked when the declaration of [[Martial Law]] by then-President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on September 21, 1972.<ref>{{cite news |title=Professor, 2 others nabbed (2:29 p.m.) |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/02/24/professor.2.others.nabbed.(2.29.p.m.).html |newspaper=Sun.Star |date=February 24, 2006|access-date=2007-06-27 }}</ref>

==Activism==
Bello received his Ph.D. in sociology from Princeton in 1975 after completing his doctoral dissertation titled "The roots and dynamics of revolution and counterrevolution in Chile."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bello|first=Walden F.|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3266058|title=The roots and dynamics of revolution and counterrevolution in Chile|date=1975|language=en}}</ref> he then became part of the anti-Marcos movement, began teaching at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]].<ref name=Pstar/> In 1978 after being arrested multiple times during protests, he was arrested after leading the takeover of the Philippine consulate in San Francisco. Bello was later released following a [[hunger strike]] to bring attention to the situation the Philippines was facing.<ref name=WBwebsite>{{cite web|title=About Walden|url=http://www.waldenbello.org/about-walden/|website=Walden Bello|access-date=27 January 2016|language=en-US}}</ref> In the early-1980s, Bello also broke into the [[World Bank]] headquarters and stole 3,000 pages of confidential documents that he said would show the connection of the IMF and World Bank to Marcos.<ref name=WBwebsite/> He later wrote ''Development Debacle: the World Bank in the Philippines'' in 1982 surrounding the documents stating that this publication contributed toward the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the Philippines, with Bello returning to his native state two years later.<ref name=Pstar/>

In 1995, Bello co-founded Focus on the Global South, a policy research institute based in [[Bangkok]], Thailand.<ref name=WBwebsite/> Bello had also led teach-ins during the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests]] and protested internationally against globalization at the [[2001 G8 summit]], the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2003|WTO Ministerial Conference of 2003]], the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005|WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]] and was banned from the 2006 World Bank-IMF Conference in Singapore.<ref name=WBwebsite/>

Politically, Bello began to turn away from the Communist Party of the Philippines after he heard that they allegedly killed individuals in the 1980s and 1990s that were accused of being [[double agent]]s.<ref name=Pstar/> Bello later joined the [[Akbayan Citizens' Action Party]] and became a member of congress in 2010.<ref name=Pstar/> In March 2015, Bello resigned his position in congress due to conflicts with President [[Benigno Aquino III]] that surrounded the Disbursement Acceleration Program and the [[Mamasapano incident]]. He ran for senator in 2016 but lost.<ref name=RAPPLER>{{cite news|last1=Aceron|first1=Joy|last2=Isaac|first2=Francis|title=That thing called resignation|url=http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/86797-walden-bello-resignation|access-date=27 January 2016|work=[[Rappler]]|date=14 March 2015}}</ref>

== 2022 national elections ==
The [[Laban ng Masa]] coalition launched a campaign to collect 300,000 signatures to urge activist and former party-list lawmaker Walden Bello to run for president in the 2022 elections. In a statement, they stayed that it wants to "push for an ambitious platform that focuses on the poor, prioritizes the neglected, and fights for the rights of ordinary Filipinos."<ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=G. M. A.|title=Coalition launches signature drive for Walden Bello's bid for president in Eleksyon 2022|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/792374/coalition-launches-signature-drive-for-walden-bello-s-bid-for-president-in-eleksyon-2022/story/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=GMA News Online|language=en}}</ref> Bello's group sought talks with Vice President Robredo's backers for three months but were ignored. This caused them to support Leody de Guzman's presidential candidacy, instead.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Galvez|first=Daphne|date=2021-10-04|title=Progressive group says it sought meeting with Robredo on 2022 polls but ‘spurned’|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1496966/progressive-group-says-it-sought-meeting-with-vp-robredo-on-2022-polls-but-spurned|access-date=2021-10-22|website=INQUIRER.net|language=en}}</ref>

Later in October 20, Bello decided to run for the vice-presidency under the [[Partido Lakas ng Masa]], substituting Raquel Castillo who filed her candidacy as Guzman's running mate in the same party.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mendoza|first=John Eric|date=2021-10-20|title=Activist Walden Bello runs for VP as Ka Leody’s running mate|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1504411/activist-walden-bello-runs-for-vp-as-ka-leodys-running-mate|access-date=2021-10-22|website=INQUIRER.net|language=en}}</ref>

==Political positions==
The US ''[[Socialist Worker]]'' described Bello as "one of the most articulate and prolific voices on the international left" and that "he has devoted most of his life to fighting [[imperialism]] and corporate globalization".<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Walden Bello needs your support|url=http://socialistworker.org/2005-1/532/532_07_WaldenBello.shtml|website=socialistworker.org|publisher=[[Socialist Worker]]|access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref> Bello was also a supporter of [[Hugo Chávez]] and was impressed by his opposition to the United States, stating after Chávez's death that he was "a class act, one impossible to follow. Wherever you are right now, give ’em hell".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bello|first1=Walden|title=I'll miss Hugo|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/48265/ill-miss-hugo|access-date=27 January 2016|agency=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=7 March 2013}}</ref>
