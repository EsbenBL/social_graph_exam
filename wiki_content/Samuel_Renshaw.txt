He believed that most people used only one-fifth of their available [[mind-power]] to process information. By using methods of flashing pages he produced students who could read as fast as 1,200 to 1,400 words per minute.

Renshaw became involved in the establishment of the Midwestern Psychological Association and served as the organization's Secretary-Treasurer in 1929.<ref>{{citation|title= MPA History: List of Past MPA Presidents|url= http://midwesternpsych.org/about-mpa/mpa-history/|accessdate= April 18, 2019|publisher= Midwestern Psychological Association}}</ref> For his contributions to the war effort the [[United States Navy]] awarded him the [[Navy Distinguished Public Service Award]] in 1955.<ref name="AP-Obit" /> He wrote 23 volumes of a journal ''Visual Psychology''.{{citation needed|date= April 2019}}

[[Robert A. Heinlein]] depicted the technique in several of his works, including ''[[Citizen of the Galaxy]]'' (1957) and ''[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]'' (1949); and mentioned Renshaw in the context of the training of [[Fair Witness]]es in ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961).  He cited a ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' article on Renshaw's studies for responses to fan mail about the subject.<ref>{{cite web|title= Heinlein's Fan Mail Solution|author= Kevin Kelly|author-link= Kevin Kelly (editor)|url= http://kk.org/ct2/2008/09/heinleins-fan-mail-solution.php|accessdate= April 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.panshin.com/critics/Renshaw/notassmart/notassmart1.html|title= You're Not As Smart As You Could Be|publisher= [[Saturday Evening Post]]|date= April 17, 1948|accessdate= April 18, 2019|author= Wittels, David G.}}</ref>

This technique and equipment appeared at the Ravenswood School District (near [[Stanford University]]) for a short time in the 1960s. Several young students took part in the experiment, which involved film-strip readers and page-at-a-glance equipment.

The "Renshaw Training System for Aircraft and Ship Recognition" was considered{{by whom?|date=January 2021}} to have "saved untold lives during World War II".<ref>
