'''Rein Taagepera''' (born 28 February 1933)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071118012738/http://www.ut.ee/SOPL/cv/taageperae.htm Rein Taagepera's profile in the University of Tartu website]
</ref> is an [[Estonia]]n [[political science|political scientist]] and former politician.

== Education ==
Born in [[Tartu]], Estonia, Taagepera fled from occupied Estonia in 1944. Taagepera graduated from high school in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]] and then studied [[physics]] in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. He received a B.A. Sc (Nuclear Engineering) in 1959 and a M.A. (Physics) in 1961 from the University of Toronto, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1965. Working in industry until 1970, he received another M.A. in [[international relations]] in 1969 and switched to academe as a political scientist at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he stayed for his entire American career.  Taagepera is professor emeritus at  University of Tartu.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Awards - Karl Deutsch Award|url=https://www.ipsa.org/page/awards-karl-deutsch-award|access-date=2020-10-13|website=www.ipsa.org|language=en}}</ref>

== Political career ==
Taagepera served as President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies]] from 1986 until 1988. In 1991, he returned to Estonia as the founding dean of a new School of Social Sciences at the [[University of Tartu]], which merged into a full-fledged faculty in 1994, and where he also became Professor of Political Science (1994–1998).

In 1991, he was a member of the Estonian Constitutional Assembly, and in 1992, he ran as a presidential candidate<ref>{{Cite web|last=Simon|first=Stephanie|date=1992-09-19|title=Professor at UC Irvine Vying to Lead Estonia : Baltics: Rein Taagepera is one of four candidates in presidential race. The voting takes place Sunday.|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-09-19-mn-614-story.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> against [[Arnold Rüütel]] (3rd President of the Republic of Estonia, 2001–2006), and [[Lennart Meri]] (2nd President of the Republic of Estonia, 1992–2001), who won the election. Taagepera came in third with 23% of the popular vote. Later Taagepera admitted that one of the reasons why he ran, despite having little chance to win, was to take away votes from Rüütel and thus help Meri rise to the presidency.

In 2003, Taagepera agreed to serve for half a year as the founding chairman of a new political party, [[Union for the Republic - Res Publica|Res Publica]], which won the general elections that year and lead the governing coalition under Prime Minister [[Juhan Parts]] until April 2005. Taagepera tried to hold the party more or less in the middle of the spectrum (Taagepera even suggested he was centre-left politician). In 2005, Taagepera resigned his Res Publica membership, frustrated with the party's leadership style and move to the right (refer to his essay, ''Meteoric trajectory''). In April 2006, Res Publica decided to merge with the [[nationalism|national]]-[[conservatism|conservative]] [[Pro Patria Union (Estonia)|Pro Patria Union]] party.

==Scholarly works==
Taagepera's theoretical scholarly work, which mainly deals with [[electoral systems]], is heavily quantitative and modelling in character and strongly informed by the [[epistemology]] of his previous field, physics. The quantitative approach is also his general attitude towards political science as a scholarly discipline. He recently systematized numerous contributions in electoral systems theory into a general, quantitative theoretical framework, exposed in the volume ''Predicting Party Sizes: The Logic of Simple Electoral Systems'' (2007).

Taagepera's original epistemological and methodological approach, defined as ''logical quantitative modeling'', is systematically presented in the recent volume ''Making Social Sciences More Scientific. The Need for Predictive Models'' (2008). Of special interest is his research in the World System [[hyperbolic growth]].<ref>Taagepera, Rein (1976) Crisis around 2005 A.D.? A technology-population interaction model. General Systems 21, 137-138; Taagepera, Rein (1979) People, skills, and resources: An interaction model for world population growth. Technological Forecasting and Social Change 13, 13-30.</ref>

Apart from the quantitative study of electoral and party systems, Taagepera has also published several studies of Estonian and Baltic history, politics, and culture. These latter, on the other hand, are more personal and take strong normative positions. Taagepera has also written award-winning pieces of prose (most notably ''[[Livland]]-Leaveland'' in 1990. It was awarded the Tuglas Prize in the same year).
