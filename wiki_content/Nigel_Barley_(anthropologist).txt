'''Nigel Frederick Barley''' (born 1947) is a British [[anthropologist]] known for his books based on his anthropological field work, which have been treated as travel writing. His first book ''The Innocent Anthropologist'' (1983), was an account of field work in [[Cameroon]] and was positively reviewed. 

He later conducted field work in [[Indonesia]]. Since 2003 he has expanded his writing career. He divides his time between the United Kingdom and Indonesia. His book ''Not a Hazardous Sport'' (1989) was about his research in [[Tana Toraja Regency|Tana Toraja]]. He has since written numerous other works, including fiction. He wrote a historical novel ''Island of Demons'' (2009), loosely based on the German artist [[Walter Spies]], who lived for most of his career in [[Bali]].

Barley began writing books about his time in anthropological research. His first memoir, ''The Innocent Anthropologist'' (1983), gave a popular account of anthropological field work among the [[Dowayo language|Dowayo]] people of [[Cameroon]].<ref name=Waters/> 

Barley next worked as an anthropologist in [[Indonesia]]. His first book based on his time there was the humorous ''Not a Hazardous Sport'' (1989), describing his experiences in [[Tana Toraja Regency|Tana Toraja]] in the mountains of central [[Sulawesi]].<ref name="Hannigan 2019"/>

Barley has written on many other subjects including [[Sir Stamford Raffles]], the founder of Singapore,<ref name="Milne 2008">{{cite news |last1=Milne |first1=Rosie |title=Fact and Fiction |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/4205428/Fact-and-fiction.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 September 2008}}</ref> and [[Sir James Brooke]], the "white rajah" of [[Sarawak]].<ref name="LRB 2002">{{cite journal |last1=Kuper |first1=Adam |title=Man Who Burned |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |date=12 December 2002 |volume=24 |issue=24 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v24/n24/adam-kuper/man-who-burned}}</ref>

The journalist and author [[Ryszard Kapuscinski]] wrote that whereas "modern literature", as represented by works nominated in French literary awards, largely failed to talk about people from other cultures, Barley's ''Innocent Anthropologist'', like [[Colin Thubron]]'s ''Behind the Wall'' and [[Bruce Chatwin]]'s ''[[Songlines]]'' did "show us the modern cultures, ideas and behaviour of people who live in different geographical latitudes and who believe in different gods from us", even if these books were not considered to be "real literature" by some within the literary elite.<ref name="Cooke2013">{{cite book |last=Kapuscinski |first=Ryszard |authorlink=Ryszard Kapuscinski |title=The Other |year=2008 |page=59 |isbn=978-1844673285}} quoted in {{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Simon |title=Travellers' Tales of Wonder: Chatwin, Naipaul, Sebald: Chatwin, Naipaul, Sebald |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0erBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47 |year=2013 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-7547-0 |pages=46-47}}</ref>

Anthropologist Tony Waters described ''Innocent Anthropologist'' as a memorably written account. In a review in ''Ethnography'', he said that it is the book he recommends to students for an understanding of "field work, ethnography, and cultural anthropology."<ref name=Waters>{{cite web |last=Waters |first=Tony |title=Why Does Anthropology Worry about Jared Diamond when they have Nigel Barley? |url=http://www.ethnography.com/2013/01/why-does-anthropology-worry-about-jared-diamond-when-they-have-nigel-barley/| website=Ethnography.com |date=25 January 2013}}</ref> Waters says he truly admires the book as it gives a realistic idea of field experience, but "Oddly, I find few anthropologists who have read it, much less heard of it."<ref name=Waters/>

===''Not a Hazardous Sport''===

Tim Hannigan, reflecting on ''Not a Hazardous Sport'' in the ''Asian Review of Books'', wrote that British travel writing has had a "preeminent court jester"<ref name="Hannigan 2019"/> in each generation, from [[Robert Byron]] in the 1930s, [[Eric Newby]] in the 1950s, and [[Redmond O'Hanlon]] in the 1980s.<ref name="Hannigan 2019">{{cite journal |last1=Hannigan |first1=Tim |title=''Not a Hazardous Sport: Misadventures of an Anthropologist in Indonesia'' by Nigel Barley |journal=Asian Review of Books |date=21 June 2019 |url=https://asianreviewofbooks.com/content/not-a-hazardous-sport-misadventures-of-an-anthropologist-in-indonesia-by-nigel-barley/}}</ref> But in his view, Barley's writing has survived the test of time "in a postcolonial world"<ref name="Hannigan 2019"/> far better than O'Hanlon's, not least because, as an anthropologist, his observations on the people he wrote about were underpinned by "professional fieldwork ... proper language training and research".<ref name="Hannigan 2019"/> Hannigan found Barley's prose "effortlessly jaunty ..  with an air of permanent good-natured amusement. But there's also the faintly discernible trace of inexplicable melancholy common to the best of British comic travel writing".<ref name="Hannigan 2019"/> All in all, Hannigan considered it an excellent travel book, both a "vicarious journey", entertaining, and valuable for steering the reader "away from complacency".<ref name="Hannigan 2019"/>
