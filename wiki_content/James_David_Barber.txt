'''James David Barber''' (July 31, 1930 – September 12, 2004) was a [[political scientist]] whose book ''The Presidential Character'' made him famous for his classification of presidents through their worldviews. From 1977 to 1995, he taught political science at [[Duke University]].

==Background==
Barber was born on July 31, 1930, in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], to a physician and a nurse.<ref name="wp_bernstein">Bernstein, Adam. (2004). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21922-2004Sep14.html "James Barber Dies; Studied Presidents' Psyches"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', .</ref> In the 1950s he served in the [[United States Army]] as a [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|counter-intelligence agent]] before attending the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned a [[master's degree]] in political science. He earned a [[doctorate|Ph.D.]] in the same field from [[Yale University]].

He joined the faculty at [[Duke University]] in 1972, and became a full professor there in 1977.<ref name = "nyt_fox">Margalit Fox, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/politics/15barber.html "James D. Barber, Expert on Presidents, Dies at 74"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 September 2004.</ref>

He is credited in the field of political science for being the first to examine presidents beyond case studies. He devised a system of organizing a president's character  into either active-positive, passive-positive, active-negative, or passive-negative.
* Traits of an active-positive president include: a readiness to act, high optimism, and an overall fondness of the presidency. Some examples of presidents Barber cites as active-positive include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Gerald Ford]].
* Traits of a passive-positive president include: a low self-esteem compensated by an ingratiating personality, superficially optimistic, and a desire to please. Examples of passive-positive presidents include [[William Howard Taft]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Warren G. Harding]].
* Traits of an active-negative president include: lack of deriving joy after expending much effort on tasks, aggressive, highly rigid, and having a general view of power as a means to self-realization. Examples of active-negative presidents include [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Herbert Hoover]], and [[Richard Nixon]].
* Traits of a passive-negative president include: a strong sense of duty, desire to avoid power, low self-esteem compensated by service towards others, and an overall aversion to intense political negotiation. Presidential examples include [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].
