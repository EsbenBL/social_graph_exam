Eysenck's research purported to show that certain personality types had an elevated risk of [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Scholars have identified errors and suspected data manipulation in Eysenck's work, and large replications have failed to confirm the relationships that he purported to find. An enquiry on behalf of [[King's College London]] found the papers by Eysenck to be "incompatible with modern clinical science".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last1=O’GradyJul. 15|first1=Cathleen|last2=2020|last3=Am|first3=11:20|date=2020-07-15|title=Misconduct allegations push psychology hero off his pedestal|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/misconduct-allegations-push-psychology-hero-his-pedestal|access-date=2020-07-24|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en}}</ref>

==Life==
[[File:Hans and Sybil Eysenck.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With his wife Sybil]]

Eysenck was born in [[Berlin]], Germany. His mother was [[Silesia]]n-born film star [[Helga Molander]], and his father, Eduard Anton Eysenck, was an actor and nightclub entertainer who was once voted "handsomest man on the Baltic coast". His mother was Lutheran and his father was Catholic. Eysenck was brought up by his maternal grandmother of Jewish descent. Subjected to the [[Nuremberg laws]], she was deported and died in a concentration camp.<ref name=EysenckRebel>Eysenck, H. J., ''Rebel with a Cause (an Autobiography)'', London: W. H.

An initial move to England in the 1930s became permanent because of his opposition to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party and its persecutions.

Eysenck was Professor of Psychology at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], [[King's College London]], from 1955 to 1983. He was a major contributor to the modern scientific theory of personality and a brilliant teacher who helped find treatment for mental illnesses.<ref>''Behaviour Therapy and the Neurosis'', edited by Hans Eysenck, London: Pergamon Press, 1960.</ref><ref>Eysenck, Hans J., ''Experiments in Behaviour Therapy'', London: [[Pergamon Press]], 1964.</ref> Eysenck also created and developed a distinctive dimensional model of personality structure based on empirical factor-analytic research, attempting to anchor these factors in biogenetic variation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=24&editionID=199&ArticleID=1835 |title=Buchanan, R.

==Views and their reception ==

Examples of publications in which Eysenck's views roused controversy include (chronologically):
* A paper in the 1950s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Eysenck/psychotherapy.htm |title=Classics in the History of Psychology – Eysenck (1957) |publisher=Psychclassics.yorku.ca |date=23 January 1952 |access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> concluding that available data "fail to support the hypothesis that psychotherapy facilitates recovery from neurotic disorder".
* A chapter in ''Uses and Abuses of Psychology'' (1953) entitled "What is wrong with psychoanalysis".
* ''The Psychology of Politics'' (1954)
* ''Race, Intelligence and Education'' (1971) (in the US: ''The IQ Argument'').
* ''Sex, Violence and the Media'' (1978).
* ''Astrology — Science or Superstition?'' (1982).
* ''Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire'' (1985). 
* ''Smoking, Personality and Stress'' (1991).

Eysenck's attitude was summarised in his autobiography ''Rebel with a Cause'':<ref name="EysenckRebel" /> "I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, and that is the truth as he sees it. If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, that is too bad. Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, and that is the facts." He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | access-date=3 October 2012}}</ref>

===''The Psychology of Politics''===
In this book, Eysenck suggests that political behavior may be analysed in terms of two independent dimensions: the traditional left-right distinction, and how 'tenderminded' or 'toughminded' a person is. Eysenck suggests that the latter is a result of a person's introversion or extraversion respectively.

Colleagues critiqued the research that formed the basis of this book, on a number of grounds, including the following:
* Eysenck claims that his findings can be applied to the [[British middle class]] as a whole, but the people in his sample were far younger and better educated than the British middle class as a whole.
* Supporters of different parties were recruited in different ways: Communists were recruited through party branches, fascists in an unspecified manner, and supporters of other parties by giving copies of the questionnaire to his students and telling them to apply it to friends and acquaintances.
* Scores were obtained by applying the same weight to groups of different sizes. For example, the responses of 250 middle-class supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] were given the same weight as those of 27 working-class Liberals.
* Scores were rounded without explanation, in directions that supported Eysenck's theories.<ref>[[Altemeyer, Bob]]. ''Right Wing Authoritarianism'' (Manitoba: University of Manitoba Press, 1981) 80–91, {{isbn|0-88755-124-6}}.</ref>

===Genetics and intelligence===

Eysenck advocated a strong influence from [[genetics]] and [[Race and intelligence|race on IQ differences]]. Eysenck supported [[Arthur Jensen]]'s questioning of whether variation in [[IQ]] between [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] was entirely environmental.<ref>Eysenck, H. (1971). ''Race, Intelligence and Education''. London: Maurice Temple Smith.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boyle |first1=Gregory J. |last2=Stankov |first2=Lazar |last3=Martin |first3=Nicholas G. |last4=Petrides |first4=K.V. |last5=Eysenck |first5=Michael W. |last6=Ortet |first6=Generos |title=Hans J.

Eysenck claimed that the media had given people the misleading impression that his views were outside the mainstream scientific consensus. Eysenck cited ''[[The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy]]'' as showing that there was majority support for all of the main contentions he had put forward, and further claimed that there was no real debate about the matter among relevant scientists.<ref name="Eysenck, Hans J. 1990, p. 40">Eysenck, Hans J., ''Rebel with a Cause (an Autobiography)'', London: W. H. Allen & Co., 1990, pp. 289–291.</ref><ref>[[BBC television]] series ''Face To Face'' • Hans Eysenck – broadcast 16 October 1990.</ref>

Regarding this controversy, in 1988 S. A. Barnett described Eysenck as a "prolific popularizer" and he exemplified Eysenck's writings on this topic with two passages from his early 1970s books:<ref name="Barnett1989">{{cite book |first=S. A. |last=Barnett |title=Biology and Freedom: An Essay on the Implications of Human Ethology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfaJCLw8rCsC&pg=PA160|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35316-8|pages=160–161}}</ref>

Barnett quotes additional criticism of ''Race, Intelligence and Education'' from [[Sandra Scarr|Sandra Scarr-Salapatek]],<ref name="Barnett1989" /> who wrote in 1976 that Eysenck's book was "generally inflammatory"<ref>{{cite book|editor=Ned Joel Block and Gerald Dworkin |title=The I.Q.

"Although Eysenck is careful to say that these are not established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?"<ref name="Scarr1981" /> Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that "Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests," whereas a "quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ."<ref name="Scarr1981" /> Some of Eysenck's later work was funded by the [[Pioneer Fund]], an organization which promoted [[scientific racism]].<ref>William H. Tucker, ''The Funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund''.

===Cancer-prone personality===
Eysenck also received funding for consultation research via the New York legal firm Jacob & Medinger, which was acting on behalf of the tobacco industry. In a talk<ref>{{Citation|title=Hans Eysenck (1994) personality and cancer lecture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9pyS7EGCV8|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> given in 1994 he mentioned that he asked [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|Reynolds]] for funding to continue research. Asked what he felt about tobacco industry lawyers being involved in selecting scientists for research projects, he said that research should be judged on its quality, not on who paid for it, adding that he had not personally profited from the funds.<ref>Example document here [http://tobaccodocuments.org/bliley_lor/03747086-7087.html "Memorandum Regarding Professor Eysenck's Research Progress".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112113429/http://tobaccodocuments.org/bliley_lor/03747086-7087.html |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> According to the UK newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', Eysenck received more than £800k in this way.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/eysenck-took-pounds-800000-tobacco-funds-1361007.html Peter pringle, "Eysenck took pounds 800,000 tobacco funds", ''The Independent'', 31 October 1996.]</ref> Eysenck conducted many studies making claims about the role of personality in cigarette smoking and disease,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eysenck |first1=H.

The science behind this claim has now come under public scrutiny in the 2019 King's College London enquiry (see below).

===Genetics of personality===
{{Further|Biological basis of personality}}
In 1951, Eysenck's first empirical study into the [[genetics]] of personality was published. It was an investigation carried out with his student and associate [[Donald Prell]], from 1948 to 1951, in which [[twins|identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins]], ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism. It is described in detail in an article published in the ''[[Journal of Mental Science]]''. Eysenck and Prell concluded: "The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined]]."<ref>''The Journal of Mental Health'', July 1951, Vol. XCVII, "The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402.</ref>

=== Model of personality===
The two personality dimensions [[extraversion]] and [[neuroticism]] were described in his 1947 book ''Dimensions of Personality''. It is common practice in personality psychology to refer to the dimensions by the first letters, E and N.

E and N provided a two-dimensional space to describe individual differences in behaviour. Eysenck noted how these two dimensions were similar to the [[Four Temperaments|four personality types]] first proposed by the Greek physician [[Galen]]. 
* High N and high E = Choleric type
* High N and low E = Melancholic type
* Low N and high E = Sanguine type
* Low N and low E = Phlegmatic type

The third dimension, [[psychoticism]], was added to the model in the late 1970s, based upon collaborations between Eysenck and his wife, [[Sybil B. G. Eysenck]].<ref name=Eysenck1976>H. J. Eysenck and S. B. G. Eysenck (1976). ''Psychoticism as a Dimension of Personality''. London: Hodder & Stoughton.</ref>

Eysenck's model attempted to provide detailed theory of the causes of personality.<ref>Eysenck, H. J. (1967). ''The Biological Basis of Personality''. Springfield, IL: Thomas.</ref> For example, Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused by variability in cortical arousal: "introverts are characterized by higher levels of activity than extraverts and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts".<ref>(Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985)</ref> Similarly, Eysenck proposed that location within the neuroticism dimension was determined by individual differences in the [[limbic system]].<ref>Thomas, Kerry. (2007). The individual differences approach to personality. In ''Mapping Psychology'' (p. 315). The Open University.</ref> While it seems counterintuitive to suppose that introverts are ''more'' aroused than extraverts, the putative effect this has on behaviour is such that the introvert seeks lower levels of stimulation. Conversely, the extravert seeks to heighten his or her arousal to a more favourable level (as predicted by the [[Yerkes-Dodson Law]]) by increased activity, social engagement and other stimulation-seeking behaviours.

====Comparison with other theories====
[[Jeffrey Alan Gray]], a former student of Eysenck's, developed a comprehensive alternative theoretical interpretation (called [[Gray's biopsychological theory of personality]]) of the biological and psychological data studied by Eysenck&nbsp;– leaning more heavily on animal and learning models. Currently, the most widely used model of personality is the [[Big Five model]].<ref>Boyle, G. J. (2008). Critique of Five-Factor Model (FFM). In G. J. Boyle et al. (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 1 - Personality Theories and Models''. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-4651-3}} {{ISBN|1-4129-2365-4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=2019-05-30|title=The Big Five Personality Traits|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-big-five-personality-traits/|access-date=2020-08-22|website=psychcentral.com|language=en-US}}</ref> The purported traits in the Big Five model are as follows:
#Conscientiousness
#Agreeableness
#Neuroticism
#Openness to experience
#Extraversion

Extraversion and neuroticism in the Big Five are very similar to Eysenck's traits of the same name. However, what he calls the trait of psychoticism corresponds to two traits in the Big Five model: conscientiousness and agreeableness (Goldberg & Rosalack 1994). Eysenck's personality system did not address openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eysenck |first1=H.J. |title=Four ways five factors are not basic |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=June 1992 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=667–673 |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(92)90237-J }}</ref>

===Psychometric scales ===
Eysenck's theory of personality is closely linked with the psychometric scales that he and his co-workers constructed.<ref name="Furnham, A., Eysenck, S. B. G.">Furnham, A., Eysenck, S. B. G., & Saklofske, D. H. (2008). The Eysenck personality measures: Fifty years of scale development. In G.J. Boyle, G. Matthews, & D.H. Saklofske.

Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers.</ref> These included the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), the [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire]] (EPQ),<ref>Eysenck, H.

London: Hodder & Stoughton.</ref> as well as the revised version (EPQ-R) and its corresponding short-form (EPQ-R-S).

London: Corporate Assessment Network.</ref> There has been some debate about whether these facets should include impulsivity as a facet of [[extraversion]] as Eysenck declared in his early work, or of [[psychoticism]], as he declared in his later work.<ref name="Furnham, A., Eysenck, S. B. G." />

=== Publication in far right-wing press ===
Eysenck was accused of being a supporter of political causes on the extreme right. Connecting arguments were that Eysenck had articles published in the German newspaper ''[[National-Zeitung]]'',<ref>Christina Schori-Liang. ''Europe for the Europeans: The Foreign and Security Policy of the Populist Radical Right''. Ashgate 2007. p.160.</ref> which called him a contributor, and in ''[[Nation und Europa]]'', and that he wrote the preface to a book by a far-right French writer named [[Pierre Krebs]], ''Das unvergängliche Erbe'', that was published by Krebs' [[Thule Seminar]]. Linguist {{interlanguage link|Siegfried Jäger|de}} interpreted the preface to Krebs' book as having "railed against the equality of people, presenting it as an untenable ideological doctrine." In the ''National Zeitung'' Eysenck reproached [[Sigmund Freud]] for alleged trickiness and lack of frankness.<ref name="Jäger">Siegfried Jäger.

Remarking on Eysenck's alleged right-wing connections, Buchanan writes: "For those looking to thoroughly demonize Eysenck, his links with far right groups revealed his true political sympathies." According to Buchanan, these harsh critics interpreted Eysenck's writings as "overtly racist". Furthermore, Buchanan writes that Eysenck's fiercest critics were convinced that Eysenck was "willfully misrepresenting a dark political agenda". Buchanan argued that "There appeared to be no hidden agenda to Hans Eysenck. He was too self-absorbed, too preoccupied with his own aspirations as a great scientist to harbor specific political aims."<ref name="Buchanan2010d" />

As Buchanan commented:

{{blockquote|Harder to brush off was the impression that Eysenck was insensitive, even willfully blind to the way his work played out in a wider political context. He did not want to believe, almost to the point of utter refusal, that his work gave succor to right-wing racialist groups. But there is little doubt that Jensen and Eysenck helped revive the confidence of these groups. [...] It was unexpected vindication from a respectable scientific quarter. The cautionary language of Eysenck's interpretation of the evidence made little difference. To the racialist right, a genetic basis for group differences in intelligence bore out racialist claims of inherent, immutable hierarchy.<ref name="Buchanan2010d" />}}

According to Buchanan, Eysenck believed that the quality of his research would "help temper social wrongs and excesses".<ref name="Buchanan2010d" /> Eysenck's defence was that he did not shy away from publishing or being interviewed in controversial publications, and that he did not necessarily share their editorial viewpoint. As examples, Buchanan mentions contributions by Eysenck to pornographic magazines ''[[Mayfair (magazine)|Mayfair]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.<ref name="Buchanan2010d" />

Eysenck described his views in the introduction to ''Race, Education and Intelligence'':

{{blockquote|My recognition of the importance of the racial problem, and my own attitudes of opposition to any kind of racial segregation, and hatred for those who suppress any sector of the community on grounds of race (or sex or religion) were determined in part by the fact that I grew up in Germany, at a time when Hitlerism was becoming the very widely held doctrine which finally prevailed and led to the deaths of several million Jews whose only crime was that they belonged to an imaginary "race" which had been dreamed up by a group of men in whom insanity was mixed in equal parts with craftiness, paranoia with guile, and villainy with sadism.<ref name="Eysenck1973Intro">{{cite book|author=Hans Eysenck|title=Race, Education and Intelligence|year=1973|publisher=Maurice Temple Smith|isbn=978-0-8511-7009-1|pages=9–10}}</ref>}}

Pelosi cited 23 "serious criticisms" of Eysenck's work that had been published independently by multiple authors between 1991 and 1997, noting that these had never been investigated "by any appropriate authority" at that time.<ref name="Pelosi2019"/>
The reportedly fraudulent papers covered the links between personality and [[cancer]]. Critics claim that Grossarth and Eysenck claimed the existence of a "cancer prone personality" were supposed to have a risk of dying of cancer 121 times greater than controls, when exposed to the [[carcinogen]] physical factor tobacco smoking. Bosely (2019): The "heart disease-prone personality" exposed to physical risk factors is asserted to have 27 times the risk of dying of heart disease as controls.<ref name="Boseley 2019"/> Pelosi concluded "I honestly believe, having read it so carefully and tried to find alternative interpretations, that this is fraudulent work."<ref name="Boseley 2019"/>
  
The publications under discussion were criticized, among other things, for the reason that Eysenck's research work was partly financed by the tobacco industry and he therefore may have had an interest to show an association between personality and cancer (instead of an association of smoking and cancer).

Statement of Eysenck in 1990: “Note that I have never stated that cigarette smoking is not causally related to cancer and coronary heart disease; to deny such a relationship would be irresponsible and counter to the evidence. I have merely stated that the available evidence is insufficient to ''prove'' a causal relationship, and this I believe to be true.” In his statement at the time, Eysenck failed to take into account the highly addictive effect of [[nicotine]], which was only later clearly proven by [[Clinical neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] studies.<ref>Aho v.

Grossarth emphasized that the development of disease is often multicausal, whereby the factors reinforce each other in their effect, and he explicitly speaks of [[behavior]]al characteristics that may ''change'' due to [[psychological intervention]]. Grossarth emphasises their changeability through [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] in his intervention studies.
