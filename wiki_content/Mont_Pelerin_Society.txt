The '''Mont Pelerin Society''' ('''MPS''') is an international organization composed of economists, philosophers, historians, intellectuals and business leaders.<ref name="bush">[[Michael Novak]], 'The Moral Imperative of a Free Economy', in ''[[The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs]]'', [[George W. Bush Presidential Center|Bush Institute]], Crown Business, 2012, p. 294</ref> The members see the MPS as an effort to interpret in modern terms the fundamental principles of economic society as expressed by classical Western economists, political scientists and philosophers. Its founders included [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Frank Knight]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[George Stigler]] and [[Milton Friedman]].<ref name="bush"/> The society advocates [[freedom of expression]], [[free market]] economic policies and the political values of an [[open society]]. Further, the society seeks to discover ways in which free enterprise can replace many functions currently provided by government entities.

== Aims ==
In its "Statement of Aims" on 8 April 1947, the scholars were worried about the dangers faced by civilization, stating the following:
{{quote|Over large stretches of the Earth’s surface the essential conditions of human dignity and freedom have already disappeared. In others they are under constant menace from the development of current tendencies of policy.  The position of the individual and the voluntary group are progressively undermined by extensions of arbitrary power. Even that most precious possession of Western Man, freedom of thought and expression, is threatened by the spread of creeds which, claiming the privilege of tolerance when in the position of a minority, seek only to establish a position of power in which they can suppress and obliterate all views but their own.<ref name=aims>[https://www.montpelerin.org/montpelerin/mpsGoals.html "Statement of Aims"].</ref>}}

The group also stated that it is "difficult to imagine a society in which freedom may be effectively preserved" without the "diffused power and initiative" associated with "private property and the competitive market" and found it desirable ''[[inter alia]]'' to study the following matters:<ref name=aims/>
# "The analysis and exploration of the nature of the present crisis so as to bring home to others its essential moral and economic origins.
# The redefinition of the functions of the state so as to distinguish more clearly between the totalitarian and the liberal order.
# Methods of re-establishing the rule of law and of assuring its development in such manner that individuals and groups are not in a position to encroach upon the freedom of others and private rights are not allowed to become a basis of predatory power.
# The possibility of establishing minimum standards by means not inimical to initiative and functioning of the market.
# Methods of combating the misuse of history for the furtherance of creeds hostile to liberty.
# The problem of the creation of an international order conducive to the safeguarding of peace and liberty and permitting the establishment of harmonious international economic relations."<ref name=aims/>

The group "seeks to establish no meticulous and hampering orthodoxy", "conduct propaganda" or align with some party. It aims to facilitate "the exchange of views [...] to contribute to the preservation and improvement of the free society."<ref name=aims/>

== Name ==
The MPS was created in Fall 1947 at a conference organized by Friedrich Von Hayek during the [[International Trade Organization]] (ITO) drama of that year.<ref name=slobodian/> As ITO delegates met in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in to draft the world trade charter, another group of intellectuals convened at the opposite end of the lake at the base of [[Mont Pèlerin]].<ref name=slobodian/> Taking their name from the location, the Mont Pèlerin Society was formally established on April 10, 1947.<ref name=slobodian>{{cite book|author=[[Quinn Slobodian|Slobodian, Quinn]]|title=Globalists: The End of Empire and the Rise of Neoliberalism|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2018|quote=The postwar neoliberal movement was born in the midst of the [[International Trade Organization|ITO]] drama, and some of its members played a starring role in it. As delegates met in Geneva in the spring of 1947 to draft the world trade charter, a group of intellectuals gathered at the other end of the lake at the base of Mont Pèlerin. Taking their name from the location, the Mont Pèlerin Society (MPS) became the germ of what its organizer Hayek called 'the neoliberal movement.'|ref={{harvid|Slobodian|2018}}|isbn=978-0674979529}}</ref><ref name=Ebenstein>[[Alan Ebenstein|Ebenstein, Alan]] (2014).

Originally, it was to be named the [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]]-[[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] Society. Frank Knight protested against naming the group after two "Roman Catholic aristocrats," and Ludwig von Mises expressed concern that the mistakes made by Acton and Tocqueville would be connected with the society.<ref name=Ebenstein/>

== History ==
In 1947, thirty-nine scholars, mostly economists with some historians and philosophers, were invited by Friedrich Hayek to meet to discuss the state and possible fate of classical liberalism, his goal being an organization which would resist [[Economic interventionism|interventionism]] and promote his conception of classical liberalism.<ref name="Baird">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Baird|first=Charles|editor-first=Ronald|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC|year=2008|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]]|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-1412965804|oclc=750831024|lccn=2008009151|pages=342–343|doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n210|chapter=Mont Pelerin Society}}</ref> He wanted to discuss how to combat the "state ascendancy and [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] planning [that was] sweeping the globe".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The first meeting took place in the [[Pelerin Palace|Hotel du Parc]] in the Swiss village of Mont Pèlerin, near the city of [[Vevey]], [[Switzerland]]. Funding for the conference came from various sources including the [[William Volker Fund]] thanks to [[Harold Luhnow]]<ref name="Birch">{{cite book|last1=Birch|first1=Kean|title=A Research Agenda for Neoliberalism|date=2017|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1786433596|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrIzDwAAQBAJ&q=Anna+Schwartz+Mont+Pelerin+Society&pg=PT43|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> and the [[Bank of England]] owing to the help of [[Alfred Suenson-Taylor, 1st Baron Grantchester|Alfred Suenson-Taylor]].<ref name="Shaxson">{{cite book|last1=Shaxson|first1=Nicholas|title=Treasure islands : tax havens and the men who stole the world|date=2011|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-1847921109}}</ref>{{rp|84}} [[William Rappard]], a Swiss academic, diplomat and founder of the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]], addressed the society's inaugural meeting. In his "Opening Address to a Conference at Mont Pelerin",<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=THt6hFG1gcsC&pg=PA237&dq=Opening+Address+to+a+Conference+at+Mont+P%C3%A8lerin#PPA237,M1 F. A. Hayek, ''The Fortunes of Liberalism: Essays on Austrian Economics and the Ideal of Freedom'' (1992)]</ref> Hayek mentioned "two men with whom I had most fully discussed the plan for this meeting both have not lived to see its realisation", namely [[Henry Calvert Simons|Henry Simons]] (who trained Milton Friedman, a future president of the MPS, at the [[University of Chicago]]) and [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]], a British economic historian.

The MPS aimed to "facilitate an exchange of ideas between like-minded scholars in the hope of strengthening the principles and practice of a free society and to study the workings, virtues, and defects of market-oriented economic systems". The MPS has continued to meet regularly, the General Meeting every two years and the regional meetings annually. The MPS has close ties to the network of [[think tank]]s sponsored in part by the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Influence ==
Hayek stressed that the society was to be a scholarly community arguing against [[collectivism]] while not engaging in public relations or propaganda. The society has become part of an international think tank movement and Hayek used it as a forum to encourage members such as [[Antony Fisher]] to pursue the think tank route. Fisher has established the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] (IEA) in London during 1955, the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] in New York City in 1977 and the Atlas Economic Research Foundation in 1981. Now known as the [[Atlas Network]], they support a wide network of think tanks, including the [[Fraser Institute]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Prominent MPS members who advanced to policy positions included the late Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]] of West Germany, President [[Luigi Einaudi]] of Italy, Chairman [[Arthur F. Burns]] of the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Board and Secretary of State [[George Shultz]]. Among prominent contemporary political figures, former President [[Václav Klaus]] of the Czech Republic and acting{{clarify|date=August 2017}} politicians, such as Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremasinghe]] of Sri Lanka, former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] of the United Kingdom, former Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defence [[Antonio Martino]], Chilean Finance Minister Carlos Cáceres and former New Zealand Finance Minister [[Ruth Richardson]], are all  MPS members. Of 76 economic advisers on [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 campaign staff, 22 were MPS members.

Several leading journalists, including [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning columnist [[Walter Lippmann]], former radical [[Max Eastman]] (then roving editor at ''[[Reader's Digest]]''), [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]] (former editorial writer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine), [[Henry Hazlitt]] (former financial editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and columnist for ''[[Newsweek]]''), [[John Davenport (economic journalist)|John Davenport]] (holder of editorial posts at ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'') and [[Felix Morley]] (Pulitzer Prize-winning editor at ''[[The Washington Post]]''), have also been members. Members of the MPS have also been well represented on the [[Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Offer|first1=Avner|last2=Söderberg|first2=Gabriel|title=The Nobel Factor: The Prize in Economics, Social Democracy, and the Market Turn|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=104–05|edition=1st}}</ref>

Smith|Vernon Smith]] have won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. [[Graeme Maxton]] and [[Jørgen Randers]] note that it is no surprise that so many MPS members have won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences because the MPS helped to create that award, specifically to legitimize free-market economic thinking.<ref name="MaxtonRanders2016">[[Graeme Maxton]], [[Jorgen Randers]] (2016).

In the ''2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'' ([[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]], [[University of Pennsylvania]]), the MPS is noted as having the 9th (out of 55) "Best Think Tank Conference".<ref name="Global Go To">{{cite web|author=James G.

* {{cite book|author=[[Quinn Slobodian]]|title=Globalists: The End of Empire and the Rise of Neoliberalism|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2018|quote=The postwar neoliberal movement was born in the midst of the ITO drama, and some of its members played a starring role in it. As delegates met in Geneva in the spring of 1947 to draft the world trade charter, a group of intellectuals gathered at the other end of the lake at the base of Mont Pèlerin. Taking their name from the location, the Mont Pèlerin Society (MPS) became the germ of what its organizer Hayek called 'the neoliberal movement.'|ref={{harvid|Slobodian|2018}}|isbn=978-0674979529}}
