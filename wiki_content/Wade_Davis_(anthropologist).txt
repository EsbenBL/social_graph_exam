Davis came to prominence with his 1985 best-selling book ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'' about the [[Zombie (folklore)|zombie]]s of [[Haiti]]. He is professor of anthropology and the BC Leadership Chair in Cultures and Ecosystems at Risk at the [[University of British Columbia]].

Davis has published articles in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'', ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', and ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]''. He is an Explorer-in-Residence at the [[National Geographic Society]] and had produced 18 documentary films. His work has largely focused on worldwide indigenous cultures, and has taken him to East Africa, Borneo, Nepal, Peru, Polynesia, Tibet, Mali, Benin, Togo, New Guinea, Australia, Colombia, Vanuatu, Mongolia, and the high Arctic of Nunavut and Greenland.

==Early life, family, and education==
Davis was born in [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.<ref name=joins>{{cite press release| url= http://news.ubc.ca/2013/12/18/wade-davis-acclaimed-anthropologist-and-author-joins-the-university-of-british-columbia/ | title= Wade Davis, acclaimed anthropologist and author, joins the University of British Columbia| date= December 18, 2013| website= ubc.ca| publisher= University of British Columbia| access-date= July 24, 2017}}</ref>

He holds degrees in [[anthropology]] and [[biology]] and received his Ph.D. in [[ethnobotany]], all from [[Harvard University]].<ref name= joins /><ref name= NG-bio />

In 1974, at age 20, he crossed the [[Darién Gap]] on foot in the company of the English author and amateur explorer, [[Sebastian Snow]].<ref>{{citation| last= Snow| first= Sebastian | title= The Rucksack Man| location= London| publisher= [[Sphere Books]]| year= 1977| pages= 199–244}}</ref>

==Career==
Davis is an ethnographer, writer, photographer, and filmmaker, he also is a licensed river guide and has worked as park ranger and a forestry engineer.

===Anthropology and ethnobotany===
Mostly through the Harvard Botanical Museum, he spent more than three years in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Andes]] as a plant explorer, living among fifteen indigenous groups in eight [[Latin American]] nations while making some 6,000 botanical collections.<ref name= NG-bio /> He also conducted ethnographic fieldwork among several [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous societies]] of northern Canada. His work later took him to [[Haiti]] to investigate folk preparations implicated in the creation of [[zombies]], an assignment that led to his writing ''Passage of Darkness'' (1988) and ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'' (1986), an international bestseller. The book was used loosely as the basis of a [[Wes Craven]] [[horror film]], ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'' (1988).

Other books by Davis include ''Penan: Voice for the [[Borneo]] Rain Forest'' (1990), ''Shadows in the Sun'' (1998), ''Nomads of the Dawn'' (1995), ''The Clouded Leopard'' (1998), ''Rainforest'' (1998), ''Light at the Edge of the World'' (2001), ''The Lost Amazon'' (2004), ''Grand Canyon'' (2008), ''Book of Peoples of the World'' (ed. 2008), and ''One River'' (1996), which was nominated for the 1997 [[Governor General's Literary Award]] for nonfiction. His books have been translated into fourteen languages, including Basque, Serbian, Japanese, and Malay.

He has published 1800{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} popular articles on subjects ranging from [[Haitian vodoun]], Amazonian myth and religion, the traditional use of [[psychotropic drugs]], the ethnobotany of South American Indians, as well as, how [[COVID-19]] has signaled the end of the American era.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/covid-19-end-of-american-era-wade-davis-1038206/|title=The Unraveling of America|date=6 August 2020}}</ref> Davis has written for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[Men's Journal]]'', ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]'', ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', ''[[Scientific American]]'', ''[[National Geographic Traveler]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', [[Rolling Stone]], and numerous other international publications. 

Davis is a Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers (iLCP).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

A second collection was under contract for 2013 publication with Douglas & McIntyre as well.<ref name= NG-bio />

===Lectures and education===
Davis's research has inspired numerous documentary films as well as three episodes of the television series ''[[The X-Files]]''.<ref name=NG-bio /> He has been lecturing since the 1990s at various institutions.

In late 2013, it was announced that Davis would join the University of British Columbia as a professor of anthropology in the summer of 2014.<ref name=joins />

===Filmmaking and other media involvement===
Davis was the series creator, host, and co-writer of ''Light at the Edge of the World'', a four-hour ethnographic documentary series, shot in [[Rapa Nui]], [[Tahiti]], the [[Marquesas]], [[Nunavut]], Greenland, [[Nepal]], and [[Peru]], which aired in 165 countries on the National Geographic Channel and in the USA on [[Smithsonian Networks]].

==Criticisms of work in Haiti==
In 1983, Davis first advanced his hypothesis that [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX) poisoning could explain the existence of Haitian [[zombie]]s.<ref name= EHZ>{{cite journal| last= Davis| first= Wade |year= 1983|title= The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie| journal= [[Journal of Ethnopharmacology]]| volume= 9| issue= 1 | pages= 85–104 | pmid=6668953 | doi=10.1016/0378-8741(83)90029-6}}</ref> This idea has been controversial and his 1985 follow-up book (''The Serpent and the Rainbow'') elaborating upon this claim has been criticized as containing a number of scientific inaccuracies.<ref name= Hines08>{{cite journal| last= Hines| first= Terrence | title= Zombies and Tetrodotoxin| journal= [[Skeptical Inquirer]]| volume= 32| number= 3 | date= May–June 2008| pages= 60–62}}</ref> One of these is the suggestion that Haitian witchdoctors can keep "zombies" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years.<ref name= Booth88>{{cite journal| last= Booth| first= W.| date= April 15, 1988| title= Voodoo Science| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume= 240| number= 4850| pages= 274–277| doi= 10.1126/science.3353722 | pmid= 3353722| bibcode= 1988Sci...240..274B}}</ref> As part of his Haitian investigations, Davis commissioned the exhumation of a recently buried child.<ref>{{cite book| last= Davis| first= Wade | year= 1985| title= The Serpent and the Rainbow| place= New York| publisher= Simon & Schuster| pages= 92–95}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last= Davis| first= Wade| year= 1988| title= Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie| publisher= [[University of North Carolina Press]]| pages= 115–116}}</ref> (Dead human tissue is supposed to be a part of the "zombie powder" used by witchdoctors to produce zombies.) This has been criticized in the professional literature as a breach of ethics.<ref name= Booth88 /><ref>{{cite journal| last= Anderson| first= W.H. | year= 1988| title= Tetrodotoxin and the Zombie Phenomenon| journal= Journal of Ethnopharmacology| volume= 23| issue= 1 | pages= 121–126| doi=10.1016/0378-8741(88)90122-5| pmid= 3419200 }}</ref>

The strictly scientific criticism of Davis's zombie project has focused on the claims about the chemical composition of the "zombie powder". Several samples of the powder were analyzed for TTX levels by experts in 1986. They reported <ref>{{cite journal| last1= Kao| first1= C.Y. | first2= T. | last2= Yasumoto | year= 1986| title= Tetrodotoxin and the Haitian Zombie| journal= [[Toxicon]]| volume= 24| issue= 8 | pages= 747–749 | doi=10.1016/0041-0101(86)90098-x | pmid= 3775790}}</ref> that only "insignificant traces of tetrodotoxin [were found] in the samples of 'zombie powder' which were supplied for analysis by Davis" and that "it can be concluded that the widely circulated claim in the lay press to the effect that tetrodotoxin is the causal agent in the initial zombification process is without factual foundation". Davis's claims were subsequently defended by other scientists doing further analyses,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Benedek | first1 = C. | last2 = Rivier | first2 = L. | year = 1989 | title = Evidence for the presence of tetrodotoxin in a powder used in Haiti for zombification | journal = Toxicon | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 473–480 | doi=10.1016/0041-0101(89)90210-9| pmid = 2728032 }}</ref> and these findings were criticized in turn for poor methodology and technique by the original skeptics.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= Kao| first1= C.Y. | first2= T. | last2= Yasumoto | year= 1990| title= Tetrodotoxin in 'Zombie Powder'| journal= Toxicon| volume= 28| issue= 2 | pages= 129–132 | doi=10.1016/0041-0101(90)90330-a | pmid= 2339427}}</ref> Aside from the question of whether or not "zombie powder" contains significant amounts of TTX, the underlying concept of "tetrodotoxin zombification" has also been questioned more directly on a physiological basis.<ref name= Hines08 /> TTX, which blocks [[sodium channel]]s on the [[neuron|neural]] membrane, produces numbness, slurred speech, and possibly, paralysis or even respiratory failure and death in severe cases. As an isolated pharmacological agent, it is not known to produce the trance-like or "mental slave" state typical of the zombies of Haitian mythology, or of Davis's descriptions. This criticism can be countered by pointing to the [[Datura stramonium|datura]] mentioned in Davis's research. In and of itself, datura can produce these trance-like symptoms, and if a part of regular meals, could cause (or contribute to) the maintained stupor. ''Datura'' ingestions may present with prolonged toxic effects lasting hours to days.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Caffrey|first1=Charles R|last2=Lank|first2=Patrick M|date=2017-12-20|title=When good times go bad: managing 'legal high' complications in the emergency department|journal=Open Access Emergency Medicine|volume=10|pages=9–23|doi=10.2147/OAEM.S120120|issn=1179-1500|pmc=5741979|pmid=29302196}}</ref>

Biochemist Jessika Jake has noted that [[bromism]] also may be at play here. In his account of his release, [[Clairvius Narcisse]] reported that the master's wife fed salt to the enslaved and set them free. Administering NaCl helps the body excrete bromide, and thus is a known treatment for bromism. Symptoms of bromism include stupor, slurred speech, abnormal gait, and other symptoms described in zombie folklore (such as "behavior [that] can become violent, especially at night", skin rashes, and enlarged pupils).<ref>Rand.org Monograph Reports, [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1018z2/MR1018.2.chap10.pdf Chapter 10 Bromism].</ref> Further investigation into the bromide source, which may be as simple as the use of bromide salts when preparing food for the enslaved, should be addressed.

==Personal life==
Davis is married. He and his wife, Gail Percy, have lived in several places, sometimes with concurrent residences in [[Washington, D.C.]], Vancouver, the Stikine Valley of northern British Columbia, and [[Bowen Island]] near Vancouver.<ref name= joins /> They have two adult daughters,<ref name= joins /> Tara and Raina.<ref name= NG-bio>{{cite web|url= http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/wade-davis/ | title= Wade Davis, Anthropologist/Ethnobotanist: Explorers Council, Explorer-in-Residence, 2000-2013| publisher= National Geographic Society| website= NationalGeographic.com| access-date= July 24, 2017}}</ref> On April 13, 2018, Davis was granted Colombian nationality and citizenship by President [[Juan Manuel Santos]].<ref name= espectador>{{Cite web | url=https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/medio-ambiente/otorgan-la-nacionalidad-colombiana-wade-davis-el-antropologo-del-amazonas-articulo-749685/ |title = Otorgan la nacionalidad colombiana a Wade Davis, el antropólogo del Amazonas|date = 12 April 2018}}</ref>
