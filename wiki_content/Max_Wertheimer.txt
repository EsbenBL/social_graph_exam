'''Max Wertheimer''' (April 15, 1880 – October 12, 1943) was an [[Austro-Hungarian]] psychologist who was one of the three founders of [[Gestalt psychology]], along with [[Kurt Koffka]] and [[Wolfgang Köhler]]. He is known for his book, ''Productive Thinking'', and for conceiving the [[phi phenomenon]] as part of his work in Gestalt psychology.

Wertheimer became interested in psychology and studied under [[Carl Stumpf]] at the University of Berlin.<ref name="Hothersall, D. 2003">Hothersall, D. (2003)</ref> Wertheimer then went on to obtain his PhD in 1904 under [[Oswald Külpe]], at the University of Würzburg<ref name="Hothersall, D. 2003"/> and then began his intellectual career teaching at the [[Institute for Social Research|Frankfurt]] University.  For a short time he left Frankfurt to work at the Berlin Psychological Institute, but returned in 1929 as a full professor. Wertheimer eventually ended up on the faculty of [[The New School]] in New York, a position he held until his death.

==Early life==
Max Wertheimer was born on April 15, 1880, in [[Prague]], then part of the [[Bohemia]]n [[Austria-Hungary]]. Max was born to Wilhelm and Rosa Wertheimer, second to his brother Walter.<ref>King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005), pg 20</ref> Wilhelm Wertheimer was a successful educator, as well as financier. Rosa Wilhelm, born Rosa Zwicker, had a rich classical education.<ref>King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005), pg 17-18</ref> The Wertheimers were active in the Jewish community in which they lived.<ref>King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005), pg 21</ref> The Wertheimer household was extremely intellectual, therefore Max received education from both his parents; he engaged in political and educational discussions at home, as well as taking piano and violin lessons. After he received one of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s books as a gift, he developed an interest towards philosophy. He felt that he and Spinoza shared a culture and common traits.

Max began his formal education at age five, at a private elementary school maintained by the [[Piarists|Piarist order]] of the Roman Catholic Church. It was not uncommon at this time for Jewish children in central Europe to receive educations from the Catholic Church. At age ten, Max graduated from the Piarist Grammar School and enrolled in the Royal Imperial New City German State High School, where he could expect to obtain a degree that would qualify him for admittance to a university.<ref>King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005), pg 23</ref> Due to the diverse courses offered by the university, Max began to contemplate his future, and realized his deep fascination with philosophy. Max first started studying law at [[Charles University]], where he also explored other fields such as philosophy, music, physiology, and psychology. After a year, Max left and enrolled in [[University of Berlin]] where he shifted his study to philosophy.<ref>King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005), pg 24-25</ref> At Berlin, Max was able to work in the company of notable figures such as [[Carl Stumpf]], Friederich Schumann, [[Georg Elias Müller]], and [[Erich von Hornbostel]]. Later on in 1903 he got his PhD from the [[University of Würzburg]]. There he completed research on the lie detector.<ref name=sillis>{{cite journal|last=Sillis|first=D.L.|author2=Merton R.K.|title=Max Wertheimer|journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|year=1968|pages=522–527}}</ref>

==Later life==

Max Wertheimer began his academic career at an institute in Frankfurt, later to become the [[Goethe University of Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]. Max left Frankfurt from 1916 to 1929 to pursue a job at the [[Berlin Psychological Institute]] but returned to Frankfurt in 1929 as a full professor, where he stayed until 1933.<ref>King, B. D., Viney, W., Douglas Woody, W. (1993)pgs 351-352</ref> In 1923, while teaching in [[Berlin]], Wertheimer married Anna Caro (called Anni), a physician's daughter, with whom he had four children: Rudolf (who died in infancy, 1924), Valentin (1925–1978), [[Michael Wertheimer (psychologist)|Michael]] (born 1927) and Lise (born 1928, Lisbeth Rosa). Max and Anna Wertheimer divorced in 1942.

Wertheimer represented his country in World War I as a captain in the army. After coming back from the war he gave lectures and pursued his research on perception and gestalt in the [[University of Berlin]] until 1933. But in 1933, dramatic changes in Germany's regime encouraged or convinced Wertheimer to leave Germany; he heard Hitler's declarations on the media and he felt his Jewish roots were not going to be tolerated or accepted by the government directed by [[Adolf Hitler]]. So before Hitler rose to power, the Wertheimer family joined the other German emigres and moved to the United States.<ref name="King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. 2005">King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005)</ref> The Wertheimers' emigration was arranged through the U.S. consulate in Prague, and he and his wife and their children arrived in New York harbor on September 13, 1933. The family became citizens as well; that's why Max Wertheimer is referred to as a German-American psychologist.<ref name="ReferenceA">Michael Wertheimer, A Brief History of Psychology. 4th edition. Fort Worth TX: Harcourt Brace, 2000</ref>

Along with his move to America, Max accepted a professional position at age fifty-three in New York City at the [[New School for Social Research]].<ref name="King, B. D. 1993">King, B. D., Viney, W., Douglas Woody, W. (1993). A history of psychology (4): 356-358.</ref> The New School was only fourteen years-old when Max got the chance to teach various courses there. Max remained at the New School for the last decade of his life.<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> He remained in touch with his European colleagues, many of whom had also emigrated to America. [[Kurt Koffka|Koffka]] was teaching at [[Smith College]]; [[Wolfgang Köhler|Köhler]] at [[Swarthmore College]]; and [[Kurt Lewin|Lewin]] at [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Iowa]]. Although in declining health, he continued to work on his research of problem-solving, what he preferred to call "productive thinking." He completed his only book, "Productive Thinking" on the subject in late September 1943. Max died of a heart attack just three weeks after the completion of his book at his home in [[New Rochelle]], New York.<ref name="King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. 2005"/> Wertheimer is interred in [[Beechwoods Cemetery (New Rochelle, New York)|Beechwoods Cemetery]], also in New Rochelle. Max is father of [[Michael Wertheimer (psychologist)|Michael Wertheimer]], a successful psychologist.<ref name="King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. 2005"/>

==Phi phenomenon==
Max Wertheimer began the formal founding of Gestalt psychology in 1910 as he began experiments on the [[phi phenomenon]]. He published these experiments in a paper titled "Experimental Studies on the Perception of Movement".<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> The phi phenomenon is apparent movement caused by alternating light positions. Wertheimer illustrated this phenomenon on an apparatus he built that utilized two discrete lights on different locations. Although the lights are stationary, flashing the lights at succeeding time intervals causes the retina to perceive the light as moving. Wertheimer worked with partners Koffka and Köhler to collect data which ultimately led to their launch of the Gestalt movement. Their findings further demonstrated that the quality of the whole is different from the sum of the parts. The explanation of the phi phenomena was that movement is perceived because the eye itself moves in response to the successive flashes of light.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Psychology: Ideas and Context|last1=King|first1=D. Brett|last2=Woody|first2=William Douglas|last3=Viney|first3=Wayne|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780205963041|location=Oxon|pages=374}}</ref> The movement an observer experiences is based on feedback from the moving eye.<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> The researchers maintained that human perception is prone to such illusions and they speculated that it is more meaningful to connect close-together events than to keep them artificially separate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Psychology|last1=Weber|first1=Ann|last2=Johnson|first2=Joseph|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2011|isbn=9780060881528|location=New York|pages=6}}</ref>

==Productive thinking==
As a Gestalt theorist, Max Wertheimer was interested in perception, but additionally interested in thought. Max published his ideas in his book "Productive Thinking" (1945) before his death in 1943.<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> Wertheimer was interested in making a distinction between reproductive thinking and productive thinking. Reproductive thinking is associated with repetition, conditioning, habits or familiar intellectual territory. Productive thinking is the product of new ideas and breakthroughs.<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> Productive thinking is insight-based reasoning. Wertheimer argued that only insightful reasoning could bring true understanding of conceptual problems and relationships. Wertheimer encouraged training in traditional logic.  He believed traditional logic stimulated thinking. However, he believed that logic alone did not give rise to productive thinking. He believed creativity was also crucial to engage in positive thinking. In ''Productive Thinking,'' similar to his lectures, Wertheimer used concrete examples to illustrate his principles. Wertheimer used these illustrations to demonstrate the transition from S1, a state where nothing really seems to make sense, to S2, where everything seems clear and the concept grasped. He points out in "Productive Thinking" that solving a problem by blind obedience to rules prevents real understanding of the problems.<ref>Wertheimer, M. (1996). A Contemporary Perspective on the Psychology of Productive Thinking. University of Boulder Colorado</ref> He believes that this blind obedience forestalls a person from uncovering the solution.<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> Max Wertheimer's ideas of productive thinking are of continuing relevance in modern ideas of schemas, plans, and knowledge structures today.<ref>King, B. D., Wertheimer, M. (2005). Max Wertheimer and Gestalt Theory. Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ.</ref>

==Gestalt theory==

Wertheimer developed his Gestalt theory in 1910 while he was on board a train from Vienna for a vacation in Germany's Rhineland.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gx8eCgAAQBAJ&q=Max+Wertheimer+phi+phenomenon&pg=PT5|title=A Study Guide for Psychologists and Their Theories for Students: MAX WERTHEIMER|last=Learning|first=Gale, Cengage|date=2015-03-13|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|isbn=9781410333414|language=en}}</ref> Gestalt, in the closest English definition of the term, is translated potentially as configuration, form, holistic, structure, and pattern.<ref name="King, B. D. 1993"/> According to Gestalt psychology, perception is a whole. In this sense, perception can shape vision and the other senses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} In addition, the theory also maintained that the whole is not only greater than its components but also different from those components.<ref name=":0" /> By 1920, Wertheimer added the position that the properties of any parts are governed by the structural laws of the whole.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Max Wertheimer and Gestalt Theory|last1=King|first1=D. Brett|last2=Wertheimer|first2=Michael|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2005|isbn=9781412828260|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=378}}</ref> Later efforts to discover such laws had limited success.<ref name=":1" /> Wertheimer's work on gestalt psychology with his colleagues at The New School was seen as an opposition and alternative to the [[behaviorism|behavioral]] approach to psychology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Wertheimer started the [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] school of psychology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} His ideas also challenged [[structuralism]] and [[atomism]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} in that he and other gestalt psychologists were more concerned about the whole rather than small structures or fragments of an object.
