At the [[Federal Reserve]] annual [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City#Economic policy symposium|Jackson Hole conference]] in 2005, Rajan warned about the growing risks in the financial system and proposed policies that would reduce such risks.

==Early life and education==
Raghuram Rajan was born on 3 February 1963 in [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] into a [[Tamil Brahmin|Tamil]] family.

Assigned to the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], R Govindarajan, his father, was posted to [[Indonesia]] in 1966. In 1968 he joined the newly created external intelligence unit of the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW) where he served as staff officer under [[R. N. Kao]] and became part of the "Kaoboys". In 1970 he was posted to [[Sri Lanka]], where Raghuram Rajan missed school one year because of political turmoil. After Sri Lanka, R Govindarajan was posted to [[Belgium]] where the children attended a French school. In 1974 the family returned to India.<ref name="Caravan">{{cite news | title=Line of Credit: Raghuram Rajan takes charge at the RBI | url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/line-credit | author=Mark Bergen | publisher = Caravan Magazine | date=1 October 2013 | access-date = 19 Feb 2016}}</ref> Throughout his childhood, Rajan presumed his father to be a diplomat since the family traveled on diplomatic passports.<ref name="FinancialTimes">Crabtree, James (15 August 2014) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b049ce16-230e-11e4-a424-00144feabdc0.html Lunch with the FT: Raghuram Rajan] The Financial Times, Retrieved 11 November 2014</ref> He was a half-term student of [[Campion School, Bhopal]] until 1974.

From 1974 to 1981 Rajan attended [[Delhi Public School, R. K.

Arguably the most famous alumnus of Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram. he was one of the youngest professors at Chicago's Booth School of Business, and, at 40, the youngest chief economist of the International Monetary Fund."[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+roots+of+recession.-a0234020538]</ref> In 1981 he enrolled at [[Indian Institute of Technology Delhi]] for a bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]]. In the final year of his four-year degree, he headed the Student Affairs Council.<ref name="Caravan"/> He graduated in 1985 and was awarded the Director's Gold Medal as the best all-round student. In 1987, he earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], graduating with a gold medal for academic performance.<ref name="CV-booth"/> He joined the Tata Administrative Services as a management trainee, but left after a few months to join the doctoral program at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan School of Management]]<ref name="Caravan"/> at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

In 1991, he received a [[PhD]] for his thesis titled ''Essays on Banking'' under the supervision of [[Stewart Myers]], consisting of three essays on the nature of the relationship between a firm or a country, and its creditor banks. The nature of financial systems had witnessed widespread changes in the 1980s, with markets getting deregulated, information becoming more widely available and easier to process, and competition having increased. The established orthodoxy claimed that deregulation must necessarily increase competition, which would translate into greater efficiency.<ref name="PhD thesis">{{cite thesis|last1=Rajan|first1=Raghuram|title=Essays on banking|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/13883#files-area|website=DSpace@MIT|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|access-date=18 May 2018|date=1991|hdl=1721.1/13883#files-area|type=Thesis}}</ref> In his thesis, Rajan argued that this might not necessarily be the case. The first essay focused on the choice available to firms between arm's length credit and relationship-based credit. The second focused on the [[Glassâ€“Steagall legislation|Glass-Steagall Act]], and the conflict of interest involved when a commercial lending bank enters into investment banking. The final essay examined why indexation of a country's debt, despite offering potential advantages, seldom featured in debt reduction plans.<ref name="PhD thesis"/>

===Policymaking===

====International Monetary Fund====
In the aftermath of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] was facing criticism for its imposition of fiscal [[austerity]] and tighter monetary policies on developing nations. Critics, including Nobel laureate and former chief economist at the [[World Bank]], [[Joseph Stiglitz]], held the IMF's policies responsible for increased economic volatility and destabilisation.<ref name="Caravan"/><ref name="Mint">{{cite web|last1=Kishore|first1=Roshan|title=The economics of Raghuram Rajan|url=https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/YyhgAI4zNq4pvdoE4p7pXK/The-economics-of-Raghuram-Rajan.html|website=Mint|publisher=Mint on Sunday|access-date=18 May 2018|date=18 June 2016}}</ref> While the role of the [[List of IMF Economic Counsellors|chief economist]] had previously always been held by a leading macroeconomist, the IMF wanted to strengthen its financial expertise. American economist [[Anne Osborn Krueger|Anne Krueger]], then the IMF's first deputy managing director, had recently read Rajan's book ''[[Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists]]'', and reached out to him to understand if he would be interested. Although Rajan seemed to harbour reservations initially, reportedly telling her, "Well, Anne, I don't know any macroeconomics", he appeared for an interview, and was subsequently appointed.<ref name="Wallace"/> In announcing his appointment, IMF managing director [[Horst KÃ¶hler]] noted that Rajan's "particular experience in financial sector issues will help strengthen the IMF's role as a centre of excellence in macroeconomic and financial sector stability."<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: IMF Managing Director KÃ¶hler Proposes Raghuram Rajan as Economic Counsellor and Director of the IMF's Research Department|url=http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/14/01/49/pr03100|website=International Monetary Fund|access-date=18 May 2018|date=2 July 2003}}</ref> At 40, he was the youngest individual, and the first born in an emerging-market nation, to be appointed the chief economist at the IMF.<ref name="Caravan"/> He served in the position from October 2003 to December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raghuram G.

At the IMF, Rajan laid the groundwork for integrating financial sector analysis into the IMF's economic country models. He also led a team to assist some major economies in reducing balance of payments imbalances.<ref name="Wallace"/> During his tenure the Research Department, which Rajan led, contributed to a complete review of the IMF's medium-term strategy, worked on introducing modern modelling and exchange rate assessment techniques to the IMF's consultations with member countries, and analysed the growth and integration of China and India into the world economy.<ref name="IMF_PR">{{cite web|title=Press Release: Economic Counsellor Raghuram Rajan Notifies IMF Management of Intention to Return to the University of Chicago|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/14/01/49/pr06182|website=International Monetary Fund|access-date=18 May 2018|date=22 August 2006}}</ref> While he largely kept fiscal austerity policies intact, on occasions he also published research that went against the prevailing orthodoxy at the IMF.<ref name="Caravan"/><ref name="Mint"/> A 2005 paper, published with [[Arvind Subramanian]], questioned the efficacy of foreign aid, arguing that aid inflows have adverse effects on growth in developing economies.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2006/trade/pdf/rajan.pdf |title=What Undermines Aid's Impact on Growth? |last1=Rajan |first1=Raghuram G. |last2=Subramanian |first2=Arvind |date=9 January 2006 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |location=Washington, DC |conference=Conference on Trade and Growth, Research Department|access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> A 2006 paper, published with [[Eswar Prasad]] and Arvind Subramanian, concluded that while growth and the extent of foreign financing were positively correlated in industrial countries, non-industrial countries that had relied on foreign finance had grown slower than those that had not.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prasad|first1=Eswar|last2=Rajan|first2=Raghuram G.|last3=Subramanian|first3=Arvind|title=Foreign Capital and Economic Growth|date=30 August 2006|url=https://www.imf.org/External/NP/seminars/eng/2006/growth/as.pdf|access-date=19 May 2018|publisher=International Monetary Fund}}</ref>

While he was asked to stay on as the chief economist for a second term, Rajan left after one term as the University of Chicago indicated that his leave could not be extended.<ref name="IMF_PR"/>

====Economic Advisor to Government of India====

In 2007, then Deputy Chairman of the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]], [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], drafted Rajan to write a report proposing the next generation of financial sector reforms in India. A [[Raghuram Rajan Committee on Financial Sector Reforms|High Level Committee on Financial Sector Reforms]] was constituted consisting of twelve members, with Rajan as chairman. The committee, in its report titled ''A Hundred Small Steps'', recommended broad-based reforms across the financial sector, arguing that instead of focusing "on a few large, and usually politically controversial steps", India must "take a hundred small steps in the same direction".<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Hundred Small Steps |last=Planning Commission, Government of India |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2009 |isbn=978-81-7829-950-1}}</ref>

[[File:RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan meets Prime Minister Modi on 3 June 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Raghuram Rajan meeting Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in 2014.]]
In his first speech as RBI governor, Rajan promised banking reforms and eased curbs on foreign banking, following which the [[BSE SENSEX]] rose by 333 points or 1.83%. After his first day at office, the rupee rose 2.1% against the US dollar. As Governor of the RBI, Rajan made curbing [[inflation]] his primary focus, bringing down retail inflation from 9.8% in September 2013 to 3.78% in July 2015 â€“ the lowest since the 1990s. Wholesale inflation came down from 6.1% in September 2013 to a historic low of -4.05% in July 2015.

In a 2014 interview, Rajan said his major targets as governor of the Reserve Bank of India were to lower inflation, increase savings and deepen financial markets, of which he believed reducing inflation was the most important. A panel he appointed proposed an inflation target for India of 6% for January 2016 and 4%(+-2%) thereafter.<ref name="Euromoney"/> Under Rajan, the RBI adopted [[consumer price index]] (CPI) as the key indicator of inflation, which is the global norm, despite the government recommending otherwise. [[Foreign exchange reserves of India]] grew by about 30% to the tune of $380 billion in two years. Under Rajan, the RBI licensed two [[universal bank]]s and approved eleven [[payments bank]]s to extend banking services to the nearly two-thirds of the population who are still deprived of banking facilities.

During his tenure, he enforced two-factor authentication of domestic credit card transactions to ensure the safety of customers. However, in an apparent contradiction of his previous stance of encouraging customers to use banks, he also permitted banks to charge customers for conducting ATM transactions beyond a certain number of times per month, at a time when the Indian Government was actively attempting to promote financial inclusion through its [[Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana]] scheme, which effectively prevented people from easily accessing their own savings and discouraged them from using formal banking channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/making-atm-transactions-expensive-is-rbi-contradicting-its-own-stance-1984317.html|title=Making ATM transactions expensive: Is RBI contradicting its own stance? - Firstpost|website=www.firstpost.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Zt75NnStquASRmzIGgxjIL/Raghuram-Rajan-defends-stand-on-twofactor-authentication-A.html|title=Rajan defends RBI stand ATM fees, two-factor authentication|last=Rebello|first=Joel|date=2014-09-15|work=livemint.com/|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/vague-rbi-guidelines-see-banks-cap-pms-jan-dhan-yojana-accounts/articleshow/59434020.cms|title=Vague RBI guidelines see banks cap PM's Jan Dhan Yojana accounts|last=Shetty|first=Mayur|date=2017-07-04|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>

On 18 June 2016, Rajan announced that he would not be serving a second term as RBI Governor, and planned to return to academia.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/raghuram-rajan-pours-cold-water-on-speculations-says-wont-accept-second-term/articleshow/52809474.cms | title = ET: Raghuram pours cold water on speculations|date = 18 June 2016 | access-date = 18 June 2016 | newspaper = Economic Times}}</ref> In September 2017, Rajan revealed that though he was willing to take an extension and serve a second term as RBI Governor, the government had not extended any offer to him which left him with no choice but to return to the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/business/raghuram-rajan-says-chicago-university-leave-wasnt-issue-in-rbi-exit-1514293.html|title=Raghuram Rajan Says, Chicago University Leave Wasn't Issue in RBI Exit|work=News18|access-date=2017-09-10}}</ref> He also denied claims that the University of Chicago had, at that time, refused to accept his leave of absence to continue for a second term.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.livemint.com/Industry/6c0TJqYpVioNDLFR82YU6H/Raghuram-Rajan-says-Chicago-university-leave-wasnt-issue-i.html |title=Raghuram Rajan says Chicago university leave wasn't issue in RBI exit |date=10 September 2017 |work=Mint |access-date=16 July 2018 |agency=PTI}}</ref>

==Economic and political views==
Rajan's economic and political views were influenced by his experience of the Indian economy during [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]]. As an economist, he was therefore wary of the risks of both unnecessary government intervention as well as unregulated financial markets, while remaining a champion of capitalism.<ref name="Bergen"/>

===Financial markets===

Rajan advocates giving financial markets a greater role in the economy. In the book ''Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists: Unleashing the Power of Financial Markets to Create Wealth and Spread Opportunity''<ref>Rajan, R. G., & Zingales, L. (2003). Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists: Unleashing the Power of Financial Markets to Create Wealth and Spread Opportunity. New York: Crown Business.</ref> co-authored with Luigi Zingales, the two authors argue in favour of deregulated financial markets in order to facilitate access of the poor to finance: "Capitalism, or more precisely, the free market system, is the most effective way to organise production and distribution that human beings have found â€¦ healthy and competitive financial markets are an extraordinarily effective tool in spreading opportunity and fighting poverty. â€¦Without vibrant, innovative financial markets, economies would ossify and decline." (p &nbsp;1)

In 2005, at a celebration honouring [[Alan Greenspan]], who was about to retire as chairman of the [[US Federal Reserve]], Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector.<ref>Raghuram Rajan. "[http://www.nber.org/papers/w11728 Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?]". [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. 2005. Retrieved on 18 August 2012.</ref> In that paper, "Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?", Rajan "argued that disaster might loom."<ref name="WSJ">Justin Lahart. "[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123086154114948151.html Mr Rajan Was Unpopular (But Prescient) at Greenspan Party]". ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 2 January 2009. Retrieved on 18 August 2012.</ref> Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to "take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time. These risks are known as tail risks. But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised."

The response to Rajan's paper at the time was negative. For example, former [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] and former Harvard President [[Lawrence Summers]] called the warnings "misguided" and Rajan himself a "luddite".<ref>[[Paul Krugman]]. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 2 September 2009.</ref> However, following the [[financial crisis of 2007â€“2008]], Rajan's views came to be seen as prescient; by January 2009, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' proclaimed that now, "few are dismissing his ideas."<ref name="WSJ"/> In fact, Rajan was extensively interviewed on the global crisis for the Academy Award-winning documentary film ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]''. Rajan wrote in May 2012 that the causes of the ongoing economic crisis in the US and Europe in the 2008â€“2012 period were substantially due to workforce competitiveness issues in the globalisation era, which politicians attempted to "paper-over" with easy credit. He proposed [[Supply-side economics|supply-side]] solutions of a long-term structural or national competitiveness nature: "The industrial countries should treat the crisis as a wake-up call and move to fix all that has been papered over in the last few decades... Rather than attempting to return to their artificially inflated GDP numbers from before the crisis, governments need to address the underlying flaws in their economies. In the United States, that means educating or retraining the workers who are falling behind, encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, and harnessing the power of the financial sector to do good while preventing it from going off track. In southern Europe, by contrast, it means removing the regulations that protect firms and workers from competition and shrinking the government's presence in a number of areas, in the process eliminating unnecessary, unproductive jobs."<ref name="foreignaffairs1">Rajan, Raghuram G. (2012-05-01) [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/134863/raghuram-g-rajan/the-true-lessons-of-the-recession Foreign Affairs-Rhaguram Rajan-The True Lessons of the Financial Crisis-May/June 2012]. Foreignaffairs.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-16.</ref>

===Austerity vs stimulus===

During May 2012, Rajan and [[Paul Krugman]] expressed differing views on how to reinvigorate the economies in the US and Europe, with Krugman mentioning Rajan by name in an opinion editorial. This debate occurred against the backdrop of a significant "austerity vs stimulus" debate occurring at the time, with some economists arguing one side or the other or a combination of both strategies.<ref>Ummelas, Ott. (2012-05-12) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-12/rehn-rejects-false-choice-between-austerity-stimulus.html Bloomberg-Rehn Rejects â€˜Falseâ€™ Choice Between Austerity, Stimulus-May 2012].

Project-syndicate.org (2011-10-17). Retrieved on 2012-05-16.</ref> In an article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, Rajan advocated structural or supply-side reforms to improve competitiveness of the workforce to better adapt to globalisation, while also supporting fiscal austerity measures (E.g., raising taxes and cutting spending), although he conceded that austerity could slow economies in the short-run and cause significant "pain" for certain constituencies.<ref name="foreignaffairs1"/><ref>[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/central-bankers-under-siege Project Syndicate-Raghuram Rajan-Central Bankers Under Siege-May 2012]. Project-syndicate.org (2012-05-08). Retrieved on 2012-05-16.</ref> Krugman rejected this focus on structural reforms combined with fiscal austerity. Instead he advocated traditional Keynesian fiscal (government spending and investment) and monetary stimulus, arguing that the primary factor slowing the developed economies at that time was a general shortfall in demand across all sectors of the economy, not structural or supply-side factors that affected particular sectors.<ref>Paul Krugman [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/opinion/krugman-easy-useless-economics.html Easy Useless Economics]. NY Times. May 2012</ref>

As far as his position on India is concerned, Rajan stayed away from the [https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/bhagwati-versus-sen-what-s-going-on-113072400516_1.html Bhagwati vs. Sen debate], and has tended to sympathize with both sides of the so-called "growth vs. welfare" argument. While Rajan's views in general align with Bhagwati's (with respect to how growth is seen as the main source of development), he has also argued for government involvement in health and education like Sen, and has pointed to the resultant threat of oligarchy or alienation of the poor.<ref name="Bergen"/>

In 2019, Rajan said that, following the [[financial crisis of 2007â€“2008]] and the imposition of [[austerity]], contemporary [[capitalism]] "is under serious threat" because it has stopped providing opportunities for the many and is now facing a possible revolt from the masses.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 12, 2019 |title=Raghuram Rajan says capitalism is 'under serious threat'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47532522|work=[[BBC]] |access-date=March 12, 2019 }}</ref>

===Demonetization in India===

In interviews in September 2017, Rajan said the Government of India had consulted the Reserve Bank of India, during his Governorship, on the issue of [[2016 Indian banknote demonetisation|demonetization]] but never asked to take a decision.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/warned-government-about-cost-of-demonetisation-former-rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-says/articleshow/60343662.cms|title=Warned government about cost of demonetisation, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan says - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-09-10}}</ref> He said the RBI was against the move and warned the government of the potential negative effects. Rajan also termed the currency notes ban exercise as, "One cannot in any way say it has been an economic success". In addition to his work at the University of Chicago and RBI, Raghuram is also a member of the [[Berggruen Institute]]'s 21st Century Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://governance.berggruen.org/councils/21st-century-council/members|title=Berggruen Institute|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref>
