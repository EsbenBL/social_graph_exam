'''Mount Holyoke College''' is a [[Private college|private]] [[liberal arts college|liberal arts]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts]].  It is the oldest member of the historic [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, a group of elite women's colleges in the Northeastern United States.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mount Holyoke College|url=https://www.forbes.com/colleges/mount-holyoke-college/|access-date=2021-03-26|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

The college was founded in 1837 as the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary by Mary Lyon, a pioneer in education for women. A model upon which many other women's colleges were patterned, it is the oldest institution within the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] schools, an alliance of East Coast liberal arts colleges that was originally created to provide women with education equivalent to that provided in the then men-only [[Ivy League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/11/22/seven-sisters-then-and-now/tsPvrDXCkj6n0fzbBaHF2L/story.html|title=Seven Sisters: then and now – The Boston Globe|last=Schick|first=Martha|website=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref> Mount Holyoke is part of the region's [[Five College Consortium]], along with [[Amherst College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]: through this membership, students are allowed to take courses at any other member institution.

Undergraduate admissions are restricted to women, [[transgender]], and [[Non-binary gender|nonbinary]] students.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-04-18|title=Admission|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/admission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101083339/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/admission|archive-date=2020-11-01|access-date=2020-11-04|publisher=Mount Holyoke College|language=en}}</ref> In 2014, it became the first member of the Seven Sisters to introduce an admissions policy that was inclusive to transgender students.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-10-15|title=Students react to decision to admit transgender students at Mount Holyoke|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/transgender-applicants-welcome-mount-holyoke-womens-college|access-date=2021-09-08|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-us}}</ref> However, all graduate programs are open to applicants regardless of gender. Unlike the open curriculums of the other liberal arts schools in the Five College Consortium, Mount Holyoke undergraduates are required to take at least one class each in the humanities, science or mathematics, social sciences, and foreign language, as well as a physical education requirement.

The college's 800-acre (3.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) campus includes the [[Mount Holyoke College Art Museum]], the [[John Payson Williston Observatory]], and a [[Mount Holyoke College Botanic Garden|botanic garden]], and awards the [[Glascock Prize]] annually. Alumni and affiliates include notable poets, authors, feminists, academics, entertainers, scientists, politicians, and civil rights activists, as well as recipients of the [[Nobel Prize]], [[Pulitzer Prize]], [[Olympic Gold medal|Olympic Gold Medal]], [[Rhodes Scholarship]], [[Emmy Award]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]], and [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

[[File:Mount Holyoke Seminary and Ground 1887.jpg|thumb|Mount Holyoke in 1887]]

Mount Holyoke was founded in 1837 by [[Mary Lyon]] as Mount Holyoke Female Seminary.  Lyon is considered to have been an innovator in [[Women's education in the United States|women's education]].<ref name="google1">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3qWLyDZ8PsC&pg=PA13 |title=Alma Mater: Design and Experience in the Women's Colleges from Their ... – Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz – Google Boeken |access-date=2012-07-14|isbn=978-0870238697 |last1=Horowitz |first1=Helen Lefkowitz |year=1993 }}</ref> Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was one of several Christian institutions of higher education for young women established during the first half of the 19th century. Lyon's contemporaries include [[Sarah Pierce]] ([[Litchfield Female Academy]], 1792); [[Catharine Beecher]] ([[Hartford Female Seminary]], 1823); [[Zilpah P. Grant Banister]] ([[Ipswich Female Seminary]], 1828); and [[George Washington Doane]] (St. Mary's Hall, 1837 now called [[Doane Academy]]). Prior to founding Mount Holyoke, Lyon contributed to the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of ''Wheaton Female Seminary'' (now [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]]) in 1834.<ref name="google1" /> Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was chartered as a [[Female seminary|teaching seminary]] in 1836<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifemarylyon00gilcgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifemarylyon00gilcgoog/page/n474 436] |quote=mount holyoke chartered 1836. |title=First Charter of Mount Holyoke |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1910 |access-date=2011-02-20|last1=Gilchrist |first1=Beth Bradford }}</ref> and opened its doors to students on 8 November 1837. Both [[Vassar College]] and [[Wellesley College]] were patterned after Mount Holyoke.<ref name="Crispen">{{cite web|url=http://www.dean.sbc.edu/crispen.html|title=Seven Sisters and a Country Cousin|author=Jennifer L. Crispen|publisher=sbc.edu|access-date=2007-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818074928/http://www.dean.sbc.edu/crispen.html#|archive-date=2007-08-18|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to historian Amanda Porterfield, Lyon created Mount Holyoke to be "a religious institution that offered a model of Christian society for all to see."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Porterfiled |first1=Amanda |title=Mary Lyon and the Mount Holyoke Misionaries |date=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0195113013 |page=32}}</ref> Students "were required to attend church services, chapel talks, prayer meetings, and Bible study groups. Twice a day teachers and students spent time in private devotions. Every dorm room had two large lighted closets to give roommates privacy during their devotions".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/marylyon/life.html |title= Daily Life at Mount Holyoke |publisher=mtholyoke.edu |access-date=2006-09-01 |archive-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113220757/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/marylyon/life.html }}</ref> Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was the sister school to [[Andover Theological Seminary|Andover Seminary]]. Some Andover graduates looked to marry students from the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before becoming Christian missionaries because the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM) required its missionaries to be married before starting their missions. By 1859 there were more than 60 missionary alumnae; by 1887 the school's alumnae comprised one fifth of all female American missionaries for the ABCFM; and by the end of the century, 248 of its alumnae had entered the mission field.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Did You Know? | journal=Christian History & Biography | date=Spring 2006 | volume=90 | pages=3–4 }}</ref>

=== Collegiate charter ===
Mount Holyoke Female Seminary received its collegiate charter in 1888, becoming Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. The change in admission from Seminary to College included fundraising by the trustees, an overhaul of the entrance requirements, and course catalogue. Entrance exams were introduced at this time, scheduled in June or September at the college. In 1889, students traveling from the midwest could take these examinations in [[Freeport, Illinois]], and within a few years, this was expanded to other cities. Many additions were made to the course catalog, and starting in the 1889 academic year, students could choose to pursue degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Bachelor of Science]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A Hundred Years of Mount Holyoke College|last=Cole|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1940|location=New Haven, USA|pages=219}}</ref>  Within 4 years, the seminary enrollment dropped from 269 to 8. In 1893, the seminary course was discontinued, and the new title Mount Holyoke College was authorized.<ref name=":0" />

=== Cottage-style living ===
A movement towards what was referred to as cottage-style living started in 1889 by the New York Association<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://new.alumnae.mtholyoke.edu/nyc/|title=Mount Holyoke Club of NYC|website=Mount Holyoke Club of NYC}}</ref> after the change to Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. $15,000 was raised, and plans were put in place for Mary Brigham Cottage, with accommodations for the president and thirty students, with priority given to those in the collegiate course. At the time, two South Hadley families agreed to host boarders, and some students were permitted to live at the hotel. President [[Elizabeth Storrs Mead|Elizabeth Mead]] deemed both of these options unsatisfactory, and pushed the trustees to build yet another cottage. Mrs. Mead was ready to relieve the students of a large share of the drudgery of domestic work that had made up a good portion of their studies since Mary Lyon's conception of the seminary. From 1895 to 1996 the trustees allotted funds for the employment of four women to wash the dinner dishes that had formerly constituted the task of eight or ten students.<ref name=":0" />

On February 28, 1987, the [[United States Postal Service]]'s [[Great Americans series]] issued a [[postage stamp]] featuring [[Mary Lyon]], in honor of Mount Holyoke's ''Sesquicentennial'' (Mount Holyoke's 150th anniversary).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DB1239F932A15751C1A960948260|title=Stamp for Holyoke Founder|author=AP|date=1986-12-21|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/%7Edalbino/fdcs/mlyon.html|title=The Mary Lyon Stamp|access-date=2006-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219234157/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/%7Edalbino/fdcs/mlyon.html#|archive-date=2006-02-19|url-status=live|publisher=mtholyoke.edu}}</ref>

=== Phi Beta Beta chapter ===
The Mount Holyoke chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa#History|Phi Beta Kappa]] was established in 1905. It has been a sister school to [[Women's Christian College, Chennai|Women's Christian College]] in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India since 1920.

=== Debate on becoming co-educational ===
In the early 1970s Mount Holyoke had a long debate under the presidency of [[David Truman]] over the issue of coeducation. On 6 November 1971 the board of trustees voted to remain a women's college.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml|title=Mount Holyoke: A Detailed History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222407/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml#|archive-date=2007-09-26|url-status=live|publisher=mtholyoke.edu}}</ref>

=== Admission of transgender students===
At Convocation on September 2, 2014, President [[Lynn Pasquerella]] announced a new [[Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges|policy allowing the admission of transgender]] individuals of both sexes to the college,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/transgender-applicants-welcome-mount-holyoke-womens-college|title=Students react to decision to admit transgender students at Mount Holyoke|date=October 15, 2014|website=PBS NewsHour}}</ref> as well as the admission of students whose gender identities are [[Genderqueer|non-binary]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Admission of Transgender Students|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/policies/admission-transgender-students|website=Mount Holyoke College|access-date=2015-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116134430/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/policies/admission-transgender-students#|archive-date=2015-01-16|url-status=live|date=2014-09-02}}</ref> It was the first Seven Sister College to implement such policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/09/03/watch-first-seven-sisters-schools-admit-trans-women|title=Mt.

=== Undergraduate programs ===
Mount Holyoke offers 50 departmental and interdepartmental majors, including the option to design a special major. The primary degree conferred is the [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree, for which students complete 128 semester credits (one standard course equals 4 credits). At least 68 credits must be earned from course work outside the major department, across the three curricular divisions: humanities, science and mathematics, and social sciences. Study of a foreign language and completion of a multicultural perspectives course are also required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/degrees.shtml |title=Degrees and Requirements &#124; Mount Holyoke College |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= 2012-04-18|access-date=2012-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811071206/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/degrees.shtml# |archive-date=2010-08-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mount Holyoke's membership in the Five College Consortium allows students to enroll in courses at nearby Amherst College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They may also complete one of 12 Five College Certificates—among them African studies, Buddhist studies, coastal and marine sciences, cognitive neuroscience, international relations, and Middle Eastern studies—in lieu of a minor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu/|title=Five College Consortium|date=2012-06-22|publisher=www.fivecolleges.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230828/https://www.fivecolleges.edu/#|archive-date=2012-07-16|url-status=live|access-date=2012-07-14}}</ref>

The play was adapted into a [[Uncommon Women and Others (film)|television movie]] starring a then-unknown Meryl Streep.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rewatchclassictv.com/products/copy-of-chaplin-the-movie-mp-1992|title=UNCOMMON WOMEN AND OTHERS (PBS 1978) - (MERYL STREEP/ SWOOSIE KURTZ)y|last=|first=|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-us}}</ref>

=== Television ===
An urban legend says that the characters of the hit 1960's cartoon [[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!|''Scooby Doo Where Are You!'']] are said to be modeled after the Five College Consortium. Scooby Doo is meant to be [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], Shaggy is [[Hampshire College|Hampshire]], Fred is [[Amherst College|Amherst]], Daphne is Mount Holyoke and Velma is [[Smith College|Smith]]. These characterizations are made under the assumptions of stereotypes of the students from the Five Colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/smith-in-popular-culture/|title=Smith in Popular Culture « Smithipedia|website=sophia.smith.edu}}</ref>

=== Humor ===
* A 1968 article in the [[Columbia University]] student newspaper ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' repeated a line from the 1964 movie ''[[Sex and the College Girl]]'': "Smith to bed, Mount Holyoke to wed". This referred to the reputation of students from the two Seven Sisters Colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19681017-01.2.13&|title=Columbia Daily Spectator 17 October 1968 — Columbia Spectator|website=spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu}}</ref> In the 1980s, Mount Holyoke students launched a campaign against a dating book and article written by two [[Princeton University|Princeton]] graduates that tell men how to pick up female students at women's colleges.

* The Mount Holyoke song, "We're Saving Ourselves For Yale", alludes to the Ivy League-Seven Sisters relationship, which amusingly relates tales of women who hold onto their virginity long enough to catch a [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate to marry.
