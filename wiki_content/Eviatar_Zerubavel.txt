'''Eviatar Zerubavel''' (born 1948) is professor of [[sociology]] at [[Rutgers University]], a specialist in  the sociology of cognition and everyday life, including topics such as time, boundaries, and categorization.

== Biography ==
Zerubavel is a grandson of [[Ya'akov Zerubavel]]. Born in [[Israel]] in 1948 to parents in diplomatic service, he spent much of his childhood abroad. He studied first at the [[University of Tel Aviv]] and then received his Ph.D. in sociology from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1976, where he studied under [[Erving Goffman]]. After teaching at [[Columbia University]] and the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], he has spent the bulk of his career at [[Rutgers University]]. In 2003 he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and in 2007 he was recognized as a Board of Governors and Distinguished Professor of Sociology.

Zerubavel's first notable contributions were in the study of [[time]], particularly the sociology and [[standardization]] of time.  His books in this area were ''Patterns of Time in Hospital Life'' (1979); ''Hidden Rhythms'' (1981); ''The Seven Day Circle'' (1985); and ''Time Maps'' (2003).

Later he turned his attention to what he has termed [[cognitive sociology]], pointing out how much society rather than human nature shapes our mental lives, and how much the commonalities that mark out [[social groups]] involve shared patterns of thinking. His work in this vein includes ''The Fine Line'' (1991); ''Terra Cognita'' (1992); ''Social Mindscapes'' (1997); ''The Elephant in the Room'' (2006); and ''Ancestors and Relatives'' (2011). His newest book is (2018) ''Taken for Granted: The Remarkable Power of the Unremarkable''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|9780691177366}}.

Zerubavel served for many years as director of the graduate program in Sociology at Rutgers University and mentor to many [[graduate students]]. He became very interested in academic work habits and in [[time management]] in writing. His book ''The Clockwork Muse'' (1999) gives practical advice to writers across disciplines, and in particular advice on time management to those finishing books and [[dissertations]].

His own writing is notable for its use of multiple examples from everyday life, an approach which one of his students,  Wayne Brekhus, has called "Zerubavelian" sociology.<ref>(2007) Wayne Brekhus, "The Rutgers School: A Zerubavelian Culturalist Cognitive Sociology," ''European Journal of Social Theory,'' August 2007, vol. 10 no. 3, 448-464, doi: 10.1177/1368431007080705</ref><ref>(2019) "Times of Sociology: Eviatar Zerubavel in Conversation with Lorenzo Sabetta," ''Sociologica,'' August 2019, vol. 13 no. 2, 55-74, doi: 10.6092/issn.1971-8853/9747</ref>

He is married to Yael Zerubavel, a scholar of Israeli history who also teaches at Rutgers University.
