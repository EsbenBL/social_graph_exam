== Influences ==

=== Sigmund Freud ===
Chodorow's most profound influence stems from Freudian psychoanalysis. She critiques Freudian analysis with a feminist perspective to understand the mother-child relationship.<ref name=":1" />  Chodorow uses the Freudian model of female development to reveal that a girl's gender development is related to her closeness with her mother. Therefore, the girl is pursuing a privilege that a boy has already achieved. The boy has already received this attention, because he is more valued by the mother, as an object since he is a source of her own Oedipal gratification.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal |last1=Nadeau |first1=Frances A. |title=The Mother/Daughter Relationships in Young Adult Fiction |journal=The ALAN Review |date=1 December 1995 |volume=22 |issue=2 |doi=10.21061/alan.v22i2.a.5 }}</ref> However, the boy has both the need and the ability to detach himself from his mother. The female solves her inner conflict by converting her envy of male privilege into heterosexual desire.<ref name=":4" /> Using Freudian psychoanalytic theory, Chodorow explains that the Oedipus complex symbolically separates the male child from his mother, but young girls continue to identify with their mother.<ref name=":3" /> Chodorow notes that Freud's theory of the Oedipal conflict and the Oedipal revolution is due to chance;<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=https://www.apadivisions.org/division-39/publications/reviews/chodorow |title=The Reproduction of Mothering; Feminism and Psycohoanalytic Theory; Femininities, Masculinities and Sexualities; The Power of Feelings (Book Reviews) |last=Chodorow |first=Nancy |date=Winter 2003 |publisher=American Psychological Association |access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref> the father must be in the right place at the right time. Chodorow's analysis led to the hypothesis that a female's desire for men is a direct result of her strong desire for her mother.<ref name=":2" />

Additionally, Chodorow uses Sigmund Freud's theory to explain that the differences between men and women are largely due to capitalism and the absent father.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory: Seeing the Social World |last=Allan |first=Kenneth |publisher=Pine Forge Press |year=2005 |isbn=9781412905725 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=[https://archive.org/details/explorationsincl00alla/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/explorationsincl00alla/page/214 }}</ref>  Chodorow acknowledges the ways in which the economy changed in 2003, and the psychological impact this had on both sexes in regards to shared parenting.<ref name=femwriters>{{Cite journal|last=Chodorow|first=Nancy|date=1996|title=Nancy Chodorow|journal=Feminist Writers|volume=1996}}</ref> The development of shared parenting has challenged the traditional mothering role, resulting in a paradigm where mother and children have insufficient time for each other.<ref name=":2" />

Chodorow also argues that Freudian theory suppresses women. Nonetheless, the theory provides grounds for how people become gendered, how femininity and masculinity develop, and how sexism via sexual inequality is reproduced. Furthermore, Freud explains how nature becomes culture resulting in a second nature. Chodorow argues that this explains that the formation and organization of gender occur, not only through social institutions but also through transformations in the consciousness and the psyche.<ref name=":4" />

Chodorow draws on Freud's idea of intrapsychic structures to understand the developmental differences between girls and boys. Freud explains that there are three parts to an individual: the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id, the ego, and the super-ego]]. These parts produce rigid boundaries in the internal workings of our brains and impact our interactions in society. Chodorow uses this intrapsychic structure to explain that the internal workings of males and females are structurally different. Therefore, developmental differences are not inherent, rather these differences are produced through socialization.<ref name=":5" />

=== Karen Horney ===
Chodorow also draws influence from [[Karen Horney]], a 20th-century psychoanalyst who challenged Freudian ideas, ultimately leading to the foundation of feminist psychology.<ref name="Webster" /> Horney argued against Freud's idea that females are defective or limited, and rather argued that women possess positive feminine qualities and self valuation.<ref name="Webster" />

=== Philip Slater ===
Nancy Chodorow studied under the sociologist [[Philip Slater]] while she was earning her Ph.D. at [[Brandeis University]] in 1975. Slater encouraged her to study unconscious phenomena in order to deepen her understanding of personality.<ref name="Webster" /> Chodorow refers to Slater's book, ''Glory of Hera''(1968), as one of the most influential books in regards to a man's immense fear of women and its manifestation in culture.<ref name="Webster" />

==Concepts==

=== The Reproduction of Mothering (1978) ===
{{None}}
Chodorow views mothering as a dual structure, where motherhood is partly fixed by childhood experience and the social structure of kinship.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds |last=Allan |first=Kenneth |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2012 |isbn=978-1412978200 |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |pages=380}}</ref> She explains that the process of a woman becoming a mother goes beyond biology and instinct alone.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |title=Social Theory: The Multicultural, Global, and Classic Readings |last=Lemert |first=Charles |publisher=Routledge |year=2018 |isbn=9780429974267 |location=New York, NY }}</ref> Chodorow argues in her book, ''The Reproduction of Mothering'' (1978; 2nd ed., 1999), that gender differences are compromised from formations of the [[Oedipal complex]]. Chodorow's four main ideas throughout her book are what personality traits are specific to women, how does the pattern of male dominance might be understood and changed, how most women think of themselves as heterosexual, and why women have the urge to mother. In her book, she states, "Women have always cared for children, usually as mothers in families and occasionally as workers in child care centers as paid and slave domestics." Women's mothering is one of the most common elements of the sexual division of labor. Women have been subjected to having the sole responsibility of caring for a child and being the primary caretaker of the child. She begins with Freud's assertion that the individual is born bisexual and that the child's mother is its first sexual object. Chodorow, drawing on the work of [[Karen Horney]] and [[Melanie Klein]], notes that the child forms its ego in reaction to the dominating figure of the mother.<ref name="Webster" /> The male child forms this sense of independent agency easily, identifying with the agency and freedom of the father, and emulating his possessive interest in the mother/wife. This task is not as simple for the female child. The mother identifies with her more strongly, and the daughter attempts to make the father her new love object. The female child is then is stymied in her ego formation by the intense bond with the mother. Where male children typically experience love as a dyadic relationship, daughters are caught in a libidinal triangle where the ego is pulled between love for the father, the love of the mother, and concern and worry over the relationship of the father to the mother.<ref name="UCPress" />

The strong bond between the mother and the infant, not only shapes her identity but allows the child to acknowledge that the father is a separate being. Except, in circumstances where the father provides a similar form of primary care as the mother.<ref name=":8">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Nancy Chodorow |encyclopedia=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia |edition=6th |date=March 2017 }}</ref> This separation of the father and child can result in the child developing an ambivalence with the father.<ref name=":8" /> Therefore, the child is confused by the failure to recognize the mother's separateness. Consequently, children are more obedient to their father, but not because he is considered the authority figure or because of his strictness, but rather because of the child's initial relationship to the father.<ref name="UCPress" /><ref name=":4" /> 

=== Nancy Chodorow and The Reproduction of Mothering Forty Years (2021) ===
This work was so influential that in 2021, forty years after its initial release, Chodorow is revisiting it in ''Nancy Chodorow and The Reproduction of Mothering Forty Years''.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-55590-0 |title=Nancy Chodorow and the Reproduction of Mothering |year=2021 |isbn=978-3-030-55589-4 |editor1-last=Bueskens |editor1-first=Petra }}{{pn|date=May 2021}}</ref>

In the book, she says "The mother is the early caregiver and primary source of identification for all children... A daughter continues to identify with the mother."<ref name="UCPress" /> Chodorow explains that the strong bond between mother and daughter inhibits the daughter from forming her own identity. The first bonding beings in infancy with the mother. This initial bond is true for both sexes, except, boys breakaway at an early age to identify with their fathers. Thus, maintaining the mother-daughter relationship and identity.<ref name=":4"/>

=== Gender personality ===
For Chodorow, the contrast between the dyadic and triadic first love experiences explains the social construction of gender roles. This is through the universal degradation of women in culture, cross-cultural patterns in male behavior, and marital strain in Western society after Second Wave feminism. In marriage, the woman takes less of an interest in sex and more in the children. Her ambivalence towards sex eventually drives the male away. She devotes her energies to the children once she does reach sexual maturity.<ref name="UCPress" />

Chodorow examines the psychological development of adult females and males. Chodorow argues that the psyches of men and women are structured differently because of dissimilar childhood experiences.<ref name=":5" /> The justification for why women tend to be more empathic is because women's ego boundaries are less fixed. Chodorow hypothesizes that if women are perceived by society as primarily and exclusively as mothers, then any liberation of women will continue to be experienced as traumatic by society.<ref name=":2" />

Chodorow argues that masculinity is learned in the absence of an ongoing personal relationship with the father and without an available masculine role model, boys are taught more consciously how to be masculine. Boys' development of masculinity is used as a tool that would be used against them by the father. Therefore, masculine identity is due to gender role development. On the other hand, femininity is less consciously instilled in girls rather it is embedded in the ongoing relationship to the mother. Thus, female identification is predominantly parental. She says, “According to psychoanalytic theory, personality is a result of a boy’s or girl’s social- relational experiences from earliest infancy. Personality development is not the result of conscious parental intention. The nature and quality of the social relationships that a child experiences are appropriated, internalized, and organized by her or him and come to constitute her or his personality”.<ref name=":2" />

She says, “Masculinity is defined as much negatively as positively.”<ref name="UCPress" /><ref name=":2" /> Chodorow argues that the production of feminine identification is a rational process. In comparison, the production of male identification is defined by rejection rather than acceptance.<ref name=":2" />

=== Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory (1991) ===
In her book, ''Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory (1991)'', Chodorow expands on the finding that a man's suppression and denial of his need for love, often leads to an inability to tolerate others who can express their desire for love.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |last=Newman Metzl|first=Marilyn|date=Winter 2003|title=The Reproduction of Mothering; Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory; Femininities, Masculinities and Sexualities; The Power of Feelings (Book Reviews)|url=https://www.apadivisions.org/division-39/publications/reviews/chodorow|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=39|pages=55–60}}</ref> Women, on the other hand, have not suppressed these needs and thus may be willing to deal with their lover or husband being somewhat emotionally unresponsive, in exchange for some amount of caring and love.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/feminisnpsychoan0000unse|url-access=registration|quote=Nancy Chodorow.|title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory|last=Chodorow|first=Nancy J.|date=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300173376|language=en}}</ref> Since this desire for love cannot be silenced through [[Repression (psychology)|repression]], men will simultaneously protect themselves against the threat of invasion by women, while still being in a heterosexual relationship.<ref name=":10" /> Chodorow suggests that if the father figure could become more visible and participatory in family life, then the emotional ambiguities in both sexes would be rectified.<ref name=":10" />

Chodorow further synthesizes the female closeness with the mother quiets the sex drive toward men, because their inner emotional lives are far more satisfied.<ref name=":10" /> On the other hand, she suggests that the intense sex drive of men is a result of repression, and thus men fall in love much more romantically.<ref name=":10" /> She argues that this idea may be the basis for male aggression toward women.<ref name=":10" />

Additionally, Chodorow focuses on the ways in which society values women for "being," but men for "action."<ref name=":10" /> More specifically, women are often viewed as objects, but men are rather viewed as subjects. She suggests that this idea has deeper implications, as women tend to be very relationship-oriented.<ref name=":10" /> Chodorow ties this idea back to Freudian theory by arguing that men pay a price for the rushed detachment from their mother, and the resulting repression of their feminine selves.<ref name=":10" />

Chodorow continues expanding her ideas by explaining the separation and individuation a child faces with their mother. As an infant, a child depends and grows a stronger attachment upon whoever nurses and carries her or him. The child is developing a relationship with their mother emotionally and physically through the mother's body as she or he is being carried. Nancy explains in her book the concept of separation and individuation that children face with their mother as they grow into adults. As women mothers they take the character traits they developed as young adults and how they were raised by their mothers and incorporate them into their parenting skills. “A Woman identifies with her own mother and, through identification with her child, she (re)experiences herself as a cared- for the child. The particular nature of this double identification for the individual mother is closely bound up with her relationship to her own mother”. As mothers women tend to follow ways of how they were raised and use the same mother-child history she had with her own mother. 

=== The Psychoanalytic Ear and the Sociological Eye: Toward an American Independent Tradition (2019) ===
Dr. Nancy Chodorow explores her evolution from a sociologist and feminist scholar to a highly renowned psychoanalyst with her release of: “The Psychoanalytic Ear and the Sociological Eye: Toward an American Independent Tradition." Her publishers at Routledge CRC Press described one of her most recent works as: “A project which brings together her two professional identities, psychoanalyst and sociologist, as she also brings together and moves beyond two traditions within American psychoanalysis, naming for the first time an American independent tradition. The book's chapters move inward, toward fine-tuned discussions of the theory and epistemology of the American independent tradition, which Chodorow locates originally in the writings of Erik Erikson and Hans Loewald, and outward toward what Chodorow sees as a missing but necessary connection between psychoanalysis, the social sciences, and the social world.”<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|title=The Psychoanalytic Ear and the Sociological Eye: Toward an American Independent Tradition|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Psychoanalytic-Ear-and-the-Sociological-Eye-Toward-an-American-Independent/Chodorow/p/book/9780367134235|access-date=2021-03-01|website=Routledge & CRC Press|language=en}}</ref>

==== Key Concepts ====
In the "Psychoanalytic Ear and the Sociological Eye," Dr. Chodorow's primary focus is on the relationship between social relationships and individuality. Sociology and psychoanalysis, she says, have both been impoverished by not exploring the links and tensions between them. She finds parallels within psychoanalysis itself, where some analysts stress relationships as primary, while others emphasise the individual psyche. Chodorow’s twin peaks in this landscape are Erik Erikson and Hans Loewald. Setting these in dialogue with each other, Chodorow reflects her own cultural and psychoanalytic journeyings. Her discussion of Erikson’s and Loewald’s ideas, and of what others have done with them, amounts to a history of American psychoanalysis. It is an extraordinary survey. It also extends well beyond America, to include the British Independent Group and other aspects of European psychoanalysis. Chodorow’s call for a fresh relationship between psychoanalysis and sociology, anthropology and psychology, and between clinical practice and the university, opens new horizons in many directions. <ref name=":11" />

== Critical responses ==
Chodorow has received some criticism by sociologists for lacking empirical evidence and for her individualistic approach to social theory.<ref name="Webster" /> Other sociologists argue that she lacks emphasis on the impact of social reality in her theories, and does not understand the idea of [[social determinism]].<ref name="Webster" /> Conversely, Lacanian psychoanalytic feminists argue that she is too empirical and socially deterministic. They further argue against her view of the unconscious as a sociological phenomena rather than an indisputable level of analysis.<ref name="Webster" />
