Plomin has shown the importance of ''[[Heritability of IQ#Non-shared family environment and environment outside the family|non-shared environment]]'', a term that he coined to refer to the environmental factors that reduce the similarity of individuals raised in the same family environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Plomin|first1=Robert|last2=Daniels|first2=Denise|date=June 2011|title=Why are children in the same family so different from one another?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=563–582|doi=10.1093/ije/dyq148|issn=1464-3685|pmc=3147063|pmid=21807642}}</ref> In addition, he has shown that many environmental measures in psychology show genetic influence and that genetic factors can [[Mediation (statistics)|mediate]] associations between environmental measures and developmental outcomes.
