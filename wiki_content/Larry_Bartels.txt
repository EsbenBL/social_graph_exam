Prior to his appointment at Vanderbilt, Bartels served as the [[Donald E. Stokes]] Professor of Public Policy and International Relations and founding director of the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]]. He was elected a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2019.

==Biography==
Bartels received his B.A. in political science with distinction from [[Yale College]] in 1978, his M.A. in political science, also from Yale, in 1978, and his Ph.D. in political science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1983. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> He has published three books, ''Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of The New Gilded Age'' (Princeton, 2008), ''Campaign Reform: Insights and Evidence'', edited with Lynn Vavreck (University of Michigan Press, 2000), and ''Presidential Primaries and The Dynamics of Public Choice'' (Princeton, 1988). According to his official biography,

<blockquote>His first book, Presidential Primaries and the Dynamics of Public Choice (Princeton University Press, 1988), received the American Political Science Association's Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award for the year's best book on government, politics, or international affairs. He has also received the APSA's Franklin L. Burdette and E. E. Schattschneider Awards and the Best Paper Award from the Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behavior Section (three times), as well as major grants and fellowships from the Carnegie Corporation, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Russell Sage Foundation, and the Social Science Research Council. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995.</blockquote>

His rebuttal to [[Thomas Frank]]'s ''[[What's the Matter with Kansas? (book)|What's the Matter with Kansas?]]'', entitled ''What's the matter with What's the matter with Kansas'' was published in the ''Quarterly Journal of Political Science'' in 2006. While Frank asserts that the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] has been able to lure [[social class in the United States|working class]] voters away from the [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which better represents their economic interests, with value issues, such as [[abortion in the United States|abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], Bartels points out that the working class, despite being socially more conservative, is still overwhelmingly Democratic, more so than in the past.<ref name="Krugman">[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (2007). ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]''. New York: W. W. Norton.</ref>

In his empirical analysis, Bartels finds that both college graduates and working-class people are mostly Democratic, the former having become more Democratic over the past years. He attributes the gain made by Republicans to the loss of the [[Solid South]], with middle and high income whites from Southern states standing out as having become more Republican.<ref name="Bartels">Bartels, L.

[[Image:Senate Income Votes.SVG|thumb|200px|Bartels studied the voting patterns of the [[US Senate]] and correlated it with the responsiveness to the opinions of different amounts of [[Income in the United States]].<ref>Based on Larry Bartels's study ''[https://www.princeton.edu/~bartels/economic.pdf Economic Inequality and Political Representation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091537/http://www.princeton.edu/~bartels/economic.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}'', Table 1: Differential Responsiveness of Senators to Constituency Opinion.</ref>]]

In his 2008 book, ''Unequal Democracy: The political economy of the new gilded age'', Bartels demonstrates that income inequality expanded under Republican presidential administrations and narrowed under Democratic presidential administrations since the early 1970s, when [[Great Divergence (inequality)|income inequality first started to expand]]. Under Republican presidents, rich families saw substantial net gains in their income, while poorer families saw negligible gains, producing a significant net increase in income inequality. By contrast, under Democratic presidents, poor families did slightly better than rich families proportionally, lessening income inequality.

However, all income brackets, from the bottom 20% to the top 5% of the population, saw significantly greater increases in income under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents. In other words, had Democratic presidents been in office since the 1970s, income inequality may have lessened since the 1950s instead of growing into what Bartels calls "The New Gilded Age" of the early 21st century. Bartels's findings led him to conclude that "economic inequality is, in substantial part, a political phenomenon."<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aVtfu6ITpi4C Unequal democracy: The political economy of the new gilded age]''.
