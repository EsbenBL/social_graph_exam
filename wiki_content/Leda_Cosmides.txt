'''Leda Cosmides''' (born May 1957) is an American [[psychologist]], who, together with [[anthropologist]] husband [[John Tooby]], helped develop the field of [[evolutionary psychology]].

==Biography==
Cosmides originally studied [[biology]] at [[Radcliffe College]]/[[Harvard University]], receiving her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1979. While an undergraduate, she was influenced by the renowned [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Robert L. Trivers]], who was her advisor. In 1985, Cosmides received a PhD in [[cognitive psychology]] from Harvard. After completing postdoctoral work under [[Roger Shepard]] at [[Stanford University]], she joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1991, becoming a full professor in 2000.

In 1992, together with Tooby and [[Jerome Barkow]], Cosmides edited ''[[The Adapted Mind|The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture]]''. She and Tooby also co-founded and co-direct the [[Center for Evolutionary Psychology]].

Cosmides was awarded the 1988 [[AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research|American Association for the Advancement of Science Prize for Behavioral Science Research]],<ref>[http://archives.aaas.org/awards.php?a_id=24 History & Archives: AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research]</ref> the 1993 [[American Psychological Association]] [[APA Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology|Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology]], a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the 2005 [[National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award]], and the 2020 [[Jean Nicod Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jean-Nicod Lectures and Prize 2020|url=http://www.institutnicod.org/seminaires-colloques/prix-jean-nicod/conferences-et-prix-jean-nicod-2020/article/jean-nicod-lectures-and-prize-2020?lang=en|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-16|website=Institut Jean Nicod}}</ref>
