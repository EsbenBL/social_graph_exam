'''Mysticism''' is popularly known as becoming one with God or the Absolute,{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} but may refer to any kind of [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] or [[altered state of consciousness]] which is given a religious or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] meaning.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

The term "mysticism" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" />{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word μύω ''múō'', meaning "to close" or "to conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} mysticism referred to the biblical, liturgical, spiritual, and [[Christian contemplation|contemplative]] dimensions of early and medieval [[Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} During the [[early modern period]], the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to "extraordinary experiences and states of mind."{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}}

In modern times, "mysticism" has acquired a limited definition, with broad applications, as meaning the aim at the "union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God".<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> This limited definition has been applied to a wide range of religious traditions and practices,<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> valuing "mystical experience" as a key element of mysticism.

Broadly defined, mysticism can be found in all [[Religion#Types and demographics|religious traditions]], from [[indigenous religions]] and [[folk religions]] like shamanism, to organized religions like the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] faiths and [[Indian religions]], and modern spirituality, New Age and New Religious Movements.

Since the 1960s scholars have debated the merits of [[perennial philosophy|perennial]] and [[social constructionism|constructionist]] approaches in the scientific research of "mystical experiences".{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Forman|1997|p=197, note 3}} The perennial position is now "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} most scholars using a [[Contextualism|contextualist]] approach, which takes the cultural and historical context into consideration.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}}

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Christian contemplation|Henosis}}

"Mysticism" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|μύω}}, meaning "I conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and its derivative {{lang|grc|μυστικός}}, ''[[Wikt:μυστικός|mystikos]]'', meaning 'an initiate'. The verb {{lang|el|μύω}} has received a quite different meaning in the Greek language, where it is still in use. The primary meanings it has are "induct" and "initiate". Secondary meanings include "introduce", "make someone aware of something", "train", "familiarize", "give first experience of something".<ref group=web name="WordReference">{{cite web |url=http://www.wordreference.com/gren/μυώ |title=μυώ |website=WordReference English-Greek Dictionary |publisher=WordReference.com |access-date=April 24, 2016 }}</ref>

The related form of the verb {{lang|el|μυέω}} (mueó or myéō) appears in the [[New Testament]]. As explained in ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', it properly means shutting the eyes and mouth to experience mystery. Its figurative meaning is to be initiated into the "mystery revelation". The meaning derives from the initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries.<ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance">{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3453.htm |title=3453. mueó |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |archive-date=March 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319072955/https://biblehub.com/greek/3453.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Also appearing in the New Testament is the related noun {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} (mustérion or mystḗrion), the root word of the English term "mystery".  The term means "anything hidden", a mystery or secret, of which initiation is necessary. In the New Testament it reportedly takes the meaning of the counsels of God, once hidden but now revealed in the Gospel or some fact thereof, the Christian revelation generally, and/or particular truths or details of the Christian revelation.<ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2">{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |archive-date=March 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319073024/https://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to Thayer's Greek Lexicon, the  term {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} in classical Greek meant "a hidden thing", "secret". A particular meaning it took in [[Classical antiquity]] was a religious secret or religious secrets, confided only to the initiated and not to be communicated by them to ordinary mortals. In the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament the meaning it took was that of a hidden purpose or counsel, a secret will. It is sometimes used for the hidden wills of humans, but is more often used for the hidden will of God. Elsewhere in the Bible it takes the meaning of  the mystic or hidden sense of things. It is used for the secrets behind sayings, names, or behind images seen in visions and dreams. The [[Vulgate]] often translates the Greek term to the Latin {{lang|la|sacramentum}} ([[sacrament]]).<ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"/>

The related noun {{lang|el|μύστης}}  (mustis or mystis, singular) means the initiate, the person initiated to the mysteries.<ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"/> According to Ana Jiménez San Cristobal in her study of [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], the singular form {{lang|el|μύστης}} and the plural form {{lang|el|μύσται}} are used in ancient Greek texts to mean the person or persons initiated to religious mysteries. These followers of mystery religions belonged to a select group, where access was only gained through an initiation. She finds that the terms were associated with the term {{lang|el|βάκχος}} ([[Dionysus|Bacchus]]), which was used for a special class of initiates of the Orphic mysteries. The terms are first found connected in the writings of [[Heraclitus]]. Such initiates are identified in texts with the persons who have been purified and have performed certain rites. A passage of the ''[[Cretans (Euripides)|Cretans]]'' by [[Euripides]] seems to explain that the {{lang|el|μύστης}} (initiate) who devotes himself to an ascetic life, renounces sexual activities, and avoids contact with the dead becomes known as {{lang|el|βάκχος}}. Such initiates were believers in the god Dionysus Bacchus who took on the name of their god and sought an identification with their deity.<ref name="San Cristobal">San Cristobal (2009), p. 51-52</ref>

Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term ''[[contemplatio]]'', c.q. ''[[theoria]]''.{{sfn|Johnston|1997|p=24}} According to Johnston, "[b]oth contemplation and mysticism speak of the eye of love which is looking at, gazing at, aware of divine realities."{{sfn|Johnston|1997|p=24}}

== Definitions ==
According to Peter Moore, the term "mysticism" is "problematic but indispensable."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} It is a generic term which joins together into one concept separate practices and ideas which developed separately,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} According to Dupré, "mysticism" has been defined in many ways,{{sfn|Dupré|2005}} and Merkur notes that the definition, or meaning, of the term "mysticism" has changed through the ages.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> Moore further notes that the term "mysticism" has become a popular label for "anything nebulous, esoteric, occult, or supernatural."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

Parsons warns that "what might at times seem to be a straightforward phenomenon exhibiting an unambiguous commonality has become, at least within the academic study of religion, opaque and controversial on multiple levels".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Because of its Christian overtones, and the lack of similar terms in other cultures, some scholars regard the term "mysticism" to be inadequate as a useful descriptive term.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} Other scholars regard the term to be an inauthentic fabrication,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> the "product of post-Enlightenment universalism."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

=== Union with the Divine or Absolute and mystical experience ===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Unio mystica]] -->
{{See also|Hesychasm|Contemplative prayer|Apophatic theology}}

Deriving from [[Neo-Platonism]] and [[Henosis]], mysticism is popularly known as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} In the 13th century the term ''unio mystica'' came to be used to refer to the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> In the 19th century, under the influence of Romanticism, this "union" was interpreted as a "religious experience," which provides certainty about God or a transcendental reality.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" />{{refn|group=note|Note that Parmenides' "way of truth" may also be translated as "way of conviction." [[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. Cook's translation "way of conviction" is rendered by other translators as "way of truth."}}

An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} William James popularized this use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Religious experiences belonged to the "personal religion,"{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} He gave a Perennialist interpretation to religious experience, stating that this kind of experience is ultimately uniform in various traditions.{{refn|group=note|William James: "This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think, and which bring it about that the mystical classics have, as has been said, neither birthday nor native land."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}}}}

McGinn notes that the term ''unio mystica'', although it has Christian origins, is primarily a modern expression.{{sfn|McGinn|2005|p=6334}} McGinn argues that "presence" is more accurate than "union", since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union. He also argues that we should speak of "consciousness" of God's presence, rather than of "experience", since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about "new ways of knowing and loving based on states of awareness in which God becomes present in our inner acts."{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}

However, the idea of "union" does not work in all contexts. For example, in Advaita Vedanta, there is only one reality (Brahman) and therefore nothing other than reality to unite with it—Brahman in each person (''atman'') has always in fact been identical to Brahman all along. Dan Merkur also notes that union with God or the Absolute is a too limited definition, since there are also traditions which aim not at a sense of unity, but of [[Kenosis|nothingness]], such as [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Meister Eckhart]].<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> According to Merkur, [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and Buddhism also emphasize [[Sunyata|nothingness]].<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> Blakemore and Jennett note that "definitions of mysticism [...] are often imprecise." They further note that this kind of interpretation and definition is a recent development which has become the standard definition and understanding.<ref group=web name="Oxord-body" />{{refn|group=note|Blakemore and Jennett: "Mysticism is frequently defined as an experience of direct communion with God, or union with the Absolute, but definitions of mysticism (a relatively modern term) are often imprecise and usually rely on the presuppositions of the modern study of mysticism — namely, that mystical experiences involve a set of intense and usually individual and private psychological states [...] Furthermore, mysticism is a phenomenon said to be found in all major religious traditions.<ref group=web name="Oxord-body">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/religion-general/mysticism|title=Mysticism &#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-date=2021-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319073008/https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/religion-general/mysticism|url-status=live}}</ref> Blakemore and Jennett add: "[T]he common assumption that all mystical experiences, whatever their context, are the same cannot, of course, be demonstrated." They also state: "Some have placed a particular emphasis on certain altered states, such as visions, trances, levitations, locutions, raptures, and ecstasies, many of which are altered bodily states. Margery Kempe's tears and [[Teresa of Avila]]'s ecstasies are famous examples of such mystical phenomena. But many mystics have insisted that while these experiences may be a part of the mystical state, they are not the essence of mystical experience, and some, such as Origen, Meister Eckhart, and John of the Cross, have been hostile to such psycho-physical phenomena. Rather, the essence of the mystical experience is the encounter between God and the human being, the Creator and creature; this is a union which leads the human being to an ‘absorption’ or loss of individual personality. It is a movement of the heart, as the individual seeks to surrender itself to ultimate Reality; it is thus about being rather than knowing. For some mystics, such as Teresa of Avila, phenomena such as visions, locutions, raptures, and so forth are by-products of, or accessories to, the full mystical experience, which the soul may not yet be strong enough to receive. Hence these altered states are seen to occur in those at an early stage in their spiritual lives, although ultimately only those who are called to achieve full union with God will do so."<ref group=web name="Oxord-body" />}}

According to Gelman, "A unitive experience involves a phenomenological de-emphasis, blurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive significance of the experience is deemed to lie precisely in that phenomenological feature".{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gelman: "Examples are experiences of the oneness of all of nature, “union” with God, as in Christian mysticism, (see section 2.2.1), the Hindu experience that [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]] (that the self/soul is identical with the eternal, absolute being), the Buddhist unconstructed experience, and “monistic” experiences, devoid of all multiplicity."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}<br><br>Compare [[Plotinus]], who argued that ''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul," initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}}}}

=== Religious ecstasies and interpretative context ===
{{Main|Religious ecstasy|Altered state of consciousness|Cognitive science of religion|Neurotheology|Attribution (psychology)}}

Mysticism involves an explanatory context, which provides meaning for mystical and visionary experiences, and related experiences like trances. According to Dan Merkur, mysticism may relate to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness, and the ideas and explanations related to them.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" />{{refn|group=note|Merkur: "Mysticism is the practice of religious ecstasies (religious experiences during alternate states of consciousness), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them."<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" />}} Parsons stresses the importance of distinguishing between temporary experiences and mysticism as a process, which is embodied within a "religious matrix" of texts and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}{{refn|group=note|Parsons: "...episodic experience and mysticism as a ''process'' that, though surely punctuated by moments of visionary, unitive, and transformative encounters, is ultimately inseparable from its embodied relation to a total religious matrix: liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals, practice and the arts.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}}} Richard Jones does the same.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 1}} Peter Moore notes that mystical experience may also happen in a spontaneous and natural way, to people who are not committed to any religious tradition. These experiences are not necessarily interpreted in a religious framework.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356}} [[Ann Taves]] asks by which processes experiences are set apart and deemed religious or mystical.{{sfn|Taves|2009}}

=== Intuitive insight and enlightenment ===
{{Main|Enlightenment (spiritual)|Divine illumination|Subitism}}

Some authors emphasize that mystical experience involves intuitive understanding of the meaning of existence and of hidden truths, and the resolution of life problems. According to Larson, "mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}{{refn|group=note|Larson: "A mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence – an intuitive understanding and realization which is intense, integrating, self-authenticating, liberating – i.e., providing a sense of release from ordinary self-awareness – and subsequently determinative – i.e., a primary criterion – for interpreting all other experience whether cognitive, conative, or affective."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}}} According to McClenon, mysticism is "the doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths."<ref group=web name="Hartford" />{{refn|group=note|McClenon: "The doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths. Although it is difficult to differentiate which forms of experience allow such understandings, mental episodes supporting belief in "other kinds of reality" are often labeled mystical [...] Mysticism tends to refer to experiences supporting belief in a cosmic unity rather than the advocation of a particular religious ideology."<ref group=web name="Hartford">{{Cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Mysticism.htm|title=Content Pages of the Encyclopedia of Religion and Social Science|website=hirr.hartsem.edu|access-date=2006-07-12|archive-date=2015-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105021712/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Mysticism.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>}} According to James R. Horne, mystical illumination is "a central visionary experience [...] that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Horne: "[M]ystical illumination is interpreted as a central visionary experience in a psychological and behavioural process that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem. This factual, minimal interpretation depicts mysticism as an extreme and intense form of the insight seeking process that goes in activities such as solving theoretical problems or developing new inventions.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}}}

According to Evelyn Underhill, ''illumination''  is a generic English term for the phenomenon of mysticism. The term ''illumination'' is derived from the Latin ''[[Wikt:illuminatio|illuminatio]]'', applied to Christian [[prayer]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Underhill|2008}} Comparable Asian terms are [[bodhi]], [[kensho]] and [[satori]] in [[Buddhism]], commonly translated as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], and [[vipassana]], which all point to cognitive processes of intuition and comprehension. According to Wright, the use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world, and there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=181–183}}

=== Spiritual life and re-formation ===
{{Main|Spirituality|Spiritual development|Self-realization|Ego death}}

Other authors point out that mysticism involves more than "mystical experience." According to Gellmann, the ultimate goal of mysticism is human transformation, not just experiencing mystical or visionary states.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gellman: "Typically, mystics, theistic or not, see their mystical experience as part of a larger undertaking aimed at human transformation (See, for example, Teresa of Avila, Life, Chapter 19) and not as the terminus of their efforts. Thus, in general, ‘mysticism’ would best be thought of as a constellation of distinctive practices, discourses, texts, institutions, traditions, and experiences aimed at human transformation, variously defined in different traditions."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} According to [[Evelyn Underhill]], mysticism is "the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}{{refn|group=note|Original quote in "Evelyn Underhill (1930), ''Mysticism: A Study in the Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness''.{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}{{refn|group=note|Underhill: "One of the most abused words in the English language, it has been used in different and often mutually exclusive senses by religion, poetry, and philosophy: has been claimed as an excuse for every kind of [[occultism]], for dilute [[transcendentalism]], vapid [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], religious or aesthetic sentimentality, and bad [[metaphysics]]. on the other hand, it has been freely employed as a term of contempt by those who have criticized these things. It is much to be hoped that it may be restored sooner or later to its old meaning, as the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation which "aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in Judaism the [[Torah]], in Christianity [[Christ]], in Buddhism [[Buddha]], in the [[Islam]] [[Muhammad]]."{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}} Waaijman uses the word "omvorming",{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}} "to change the form". Different translations are possible: transformation, re-formation, [[Alchemy|trans-mutation]]. Waaijman points out that "spirituality" is only one term of a range of words which denote the praxis of spirituality.{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}} Some other terms are "Hasidism, contemplation, kabbala, asceticism, mysticism, perfection, devotion and piety".{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}}}} According to McGinn, personal transformation is the essential criterion to determine the authenticity of Christian mysticism.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}{{refn|group=note|McGinn: "This is why the only test that Christianity has known for determining the authenticity of a mystic and her or his message has been that of personal transformation, both on the mystic's part and—especially—on the part of those whom the mystic has affected.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}}}

== History of the term ==
=== Hellenistic world ===
In the Hellenistic world, 'mystical' referred to "secret" religious rituals like the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} The use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} A "mystikos" was an initiate of a mystery religion.

=== Early Christianity ===
{{Main|Greco-Roman mysteries|Early Christianity|Esoteric Christianity}}

In early Christianity the term "mystikos" referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The biblical dimension refers to "hidden" or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}}

Until the sixth century, the Greek term ''theoria,'' meaning "contemplation" in Latin, was used for the mystical interpretation of the Bible.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early [[Church Fathers]], who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]].

=== Medieval meaning ===
{{See also|Middle Ages}}

This threefold meaning of "mystical" continued in the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} According to Dan Merkur, the term ''unio mystica'' came into use in the 13th century as a synonym for the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, although it was mostly a male religiosity, since women were not allowed to study.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology". It is best known nowadays in the western world from [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[John of the Cross]].

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 166.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25| ''The Appearance of the Holy Spirit before Saint Teresa of Ávila,'' [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
In the sixteenth and seventeenth century ''mysticism'' came to be used as a substantive.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} This shift was linked to a new discourse,{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} in which science and religion were separated.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–18}}

[[Martin Luther|Luther]] dismissed the allegorical interpretation of the bible, and condemned Mystical theology, which he saw as more Platonic than Christian.{{sfn|King|2002|p=16}} "The mystical", as the search for the hidden meaning of texts, became secularised, and also associated with literature, as opposed to science and prose.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–17}}

Science was also distinguished from religion. By the middle of the 17th century, "the mystical" is increasingly applied exclusively to the religious realm, separating religion and "natural philosophy" as two distinct approaches to the discovery of the hidden meaning of the universe.{{sfn|King|2002|p=17}} The traditional hagiographies and writings of the saints became designated as "mystical", shifting from the virtues and miracles to extraordinary experiences and states of mind, thereby creating a newly coined "mystical tradition".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}} A new understanding developed of the Divine as residing within human, an essence beyond the varieties of religious expressions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}}

The 19th century saw a growing emphasis on individual experience, as a defense against the growing rationalism of western society.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> The meaning of mysticism was considerably narrowed:<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mysticism|title=Mysticism|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

The historical evidence, however, does not support such a narrow conception of mysticism.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" />}}

Under the influence of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], which was popularised in both the west and the east by [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalists]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], mysticism has been applied to a broad spectrum of religious traditions, in which all sorts of [[esotericism]] and religious traditions and practices are joined together.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term mysticism was extended to comparable phenomena in non-Christian religions,<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> where it influenced Hindu and Buddhist responses to colonialism, resulting in [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|McMahan|2010}}

== Variations of mysticism ==
Based on various definitions of mysticism, namely mysticism as an experience of union or nothingness, mysticism as any kind of an altered state of consciousness which is attributed in a religious way, mysticism as "enlightenment" or insight, and mysticism as a way of transformation, "mysticism" can be found in many cultures and religious traditions, both in [[folk religion]] and [[organized religion]]. These traditions include practices to induce religious or mystical experiences, but also ethical standards and practices to enhance self-control and integrate the mystical experience into daily life.

Dan Merkur notes, though, that mystical practices are often separated from daily religious practices, and restricted to "religious specialists like monastics, priests, and other [[renunciate]]s.<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" />

=== Shamanism ===
[[File:Khagdaev1.JPG|frameless|left|upright=0.9|Shaman]]
{{Main|Shamanism}}

According to Dan Merkur, shamanism may be regarded as a form of mysticism, in which the world of spirits is accessed through [[religious ecstasy]].<ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /> According to [[Mircea Eliade]] shamanism is a "technique of [[religious ecstasy]]."<ref name = Eli72>Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.</ref>

Shamanism  is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.<ref>[[#Hop87|Hoppál 1987]].  p. 76.</ref> A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance|trance state]] during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].</ref>

The term "shamanism" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]], as well as those of the neighboring [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]-speaking peoples. The term is also used to describe similar magico-religious practices found within the [[ethnic religion]]s of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. For instance, [[Louisiana Voodoo]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[West African Vodun]], [[Dominican Vudú]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] are related{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} folk-religions with ecstatic elements.

[[Neoshamanism]] refers to  "new"' forms of  [[shamanism]], or methods of seeking visions or  healing, typically practiced in Western countries. Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world, and is associated with [[New Age]] practices.<ref name="Harner1">Harner, Michael ''The Way of the Shaman.'' 1980, new edition, HarperSanFrancisco, 1990, {{ISBN|0-06-250373-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.equip.org/article/the-new-age-embraces-shamanism/|title=The New Age Embraces Shamanism|website=Christian Research Institute}}</ref>

==== Christian mysticism ====
{{Christian mysticism}}
{{Main|Christian contemplation|Christian mysticism|Mystical theology|Apophatic theology|German mysticism}}

=====Early Christianity =====
The [[apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (6th c.) exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, both in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]] and (by Latin translation) in the [[Western Christianity|West]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} Pseudo-Dionysius applied [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] thought, particularly that of [[Proclus]], to Christian theology.

===== Orthodox Christianity =====
The [[Orthodox Church]] has a long tradition of ''[[theoria]]'' (intimate experience) and ''[[hesychasm|hesychia]]'' (inner stillness), in which [[contemplative prayer]] silences the mind to progress along the path of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' (deification).

''Theosis'', practical unity with and conformity to God, is obtained by engaging in [[contemplative prayer]], the first stage of ''theoria'',<ref name="Vlachos_difference"/>{{refn|group=note|name=MHV|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "Noetic prayer is the first stage of theoria."<ref name="Vlachos_difference"/>}} which results from the cultivation of watchfulness (''[[nepsis]]''). In ''theoria'', one comes to behold the "divisibly indivisible" divine operations (''[[Essence–energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energeia]]'') of God as the "uncreated light" of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], a grace which is eternal and proceeds naturally from the blinding darkness of the incomprehensible divine essence.{{refn|group=note|[[Theophan the Recluse]]: "The contemplative mind sees God, in so far as this is possible for man."<ref>[[Theophan the Recluse]], ''What Is prayer?''. Cited in ''The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology'', p.73, compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, trans, E. Kadloubovsky and E.M. Palmer, ed. Timothy Ware, 1966, Faber & Faber, London.</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "This is what Saint Symeon the New Theologian teaches. In his poems, proclaims over and over that, while beholding the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. Being in "theoria" (vision of God), the saints do not confuse the hypostatic attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing these hypostatic attributes and teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this experience there can be no genuine "therapeutic tradition.""<ref name="Vlachos_difference">Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos, [http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/hierotheos_difference.aspx ''The Difference Between Orthodox Spirituality and Other Traditions'']</ref>}} It is the main aim of [[hesychasm]], which was developed in the thought St. [[Symeon the New Theologian]], embraced by the monastic communities on [[Mount Athos]], and most notably defended by St. [[Gregory Palamas]] against the Greek [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] philosopher [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam of Calabria]]. According to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] critics, hesychastic practice has its roots to the introduction of a systematic practical approach to [[quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]] by [[Symeon the New Theologian]].{{refn|group=note|Catholic Encyclopedia: "But it was Simeon, "the new theologian" (c. 1025-c. 1092; see Krumbacher, op. cit., 152–154), a monk of Studion, the "greatest mystic of the Greek Church" (loc. cit.), who evolved the [[quietist]] theory so elaborately that he may be called the father of Hesychasm. For the union with God in contemplation (which is the highest object of our life) he required a regular system of spiritual education beginning with baptism and passing through regulated exercises of penance and asceticism under the guidance of a director. But he had not conceived the grossly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] practices of the later Hesychasts; his ideal is still enormously more philosophical than theirs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hesychasm|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-06-18|archive-date=2016-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111054734/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience,<ref name="deCatanzaro9-10">[[#refdeCatanzaro1980|deCatanzaro 1980]], pp. 9–10.</ref> and met with strong resistance for his [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God's grace.<ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"/>

===== Western Europe =====
[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil43.jpg|thumb|right|''Life of [[Francis of Assisi]]'' by [[José Benlliure y Gil]]]]
The [[High Middle Ages]] saw a flourishing of mystical practice and theorization in western Roman Catholicism, corresponding to the flourishing of new monastic orders, with such figures as [[Guigo II]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the [[Victorines]], all coming from different orders, as well as the first real flowering of [[popular piety]] among the laypeople.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] saw the clash between the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] [[school of thought|schools of thought]], which was also a conflict between two different [[mystical theology|mystical theologies]]: on the one hand that of [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzmán]] and on the other that of [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Angela of Foligno]]. This period also saw such individuals as [[John of Ruysbroeck]], [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Catherine of Genoa]], the [[Devotio Moderna]], and such books as the ''[[Theologia Germanica]]'', ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]''.

Moreover, there was the growth of groups of mystics centered around geographic regions: the [[Beguines]], such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] and [[Hadewijch]] (among others); the [[German mysticism|Rhineland mystics]] [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]] and [[Henry Suso]]; and the English mystics [[Richard Rolle]], [[Walter Hilton]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The [[Spanish mystics]] included [[Teresa of Avila]], [[John of the Cross]] and [[Ignatius Loyola]].

The later post-[[reformation]] period also saw the writings of [[layperson|lay]] visionaries such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[William Blake]], and the foundation of mystical movements such as the [[Quaker]]s. Catholic mysticism continued into the modern period with such figures as [[Padre Pio]] and [[Thomas Merton]].

The [[philokalia]], an ancient method of [[Eastern Orthodox]] mysticism, was promoted by the twentieth century [[Traditionalist School]].

==== Western esotericism and modern spirituality ====
{{Main|Western esotericism|Spirituality|New Age}}

Many western esoteric traditions and elements of modern spirituality have been regarded as "mysticism," such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the [[Fourth Way]],{{sfn|Magee|2016}} [[Martinus Thomsen|Martinus´]] [[spiritual science]], and [[Neo-Paganism]]. Modern western spiritually and [[transpersonal psychology]] combine western psycho-therapeutic practices with religious practices like meditation to attain a lasting transformation. Nature mysticism is an intense experience of unification with nature or the cosmic totality, which was popular with Romantic writers.{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6342}}

=== Jewish mysticism ===
{{Jewish mysticism}}
{{Main|Jewish mysticism|Kabbalah}}

[[File:Abulafia.png|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Portrait of [[Abraham Abulafia]], Medieval Jewish mystic and founder of Prophetic Kabbalah.]]

In the common era, Judaism has had two main kinds of mysticism: [[Merkabah mysticism]] and [[Kabbalah]]. The former predated the latter, and was focused on visions, particularly those mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel.  It gets its name from the Hebrew word meaning "chariot", a reference to Ezekiel's vision of a fiery chariot composed of heavenly beings.

Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious [[Ein Sof]] (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation.

Kabbalah originally developed entirely within the realm of [[Jewish thought]]. Kabbalists often use classical Jewish sources to explain and demonstrate its esoteric teachings. These teachings are thus held by followers in [[Judaism]] to define the inner meaning of both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and traditional [[Rabbinic literature]], their formerly concealed [[Oral Torah|transmitted]] dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish [[Halakha|religious observances]].<ref>[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380313/jewish/Imbued-with-Holiness.htm "Imbued with Holiness"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012161542/http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380313/jewish/Imbued-with-Holiness.htm |date=2010-10-12 }} – The relationship of the esoteric to the [[exoteric]] in the fourfold [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]] interpretation of Torah and existence. From www.kabbalaonline.org</ref>

Kabbalah emerged, after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th to 13th century [[Hachmei Provence|Southern France]] and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]], becoming reinterpreted in the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century [[Safed|Ottoman Palestine]]. It was popularised in the form of [[Hasidic Judaism]] from the 18th century forward. 20th-century interest in Kabbalah has inspired cross-denominational [[Jewish renewal]] and contributed to wider non-Jewish [[New Age|contemporary spirituality]], as well as engaging its [[Gershom Scholem|flourishing emergence]] and historical re-emphasis through newly established [[Jewish studies|academic investigation]].

=== Islamic mysticism ===
{{stack begin}}{{Sufism}}{{stack end}}
{{Main|Sufism|Persian mysticism}}
The consensus is that Islam's inner and mystical dimension is encapsulated in Sufism.<ref name="Godlas">Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, ''Sufism's Many Paths'', 2000, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html University of Georgia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016144645/http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html |date=2011-10-16 }}</ref><ref>Nuh Ha Mim Keller, "How would you respond to the claim that Sufism is Bid'a?", 1995.

Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as
{{quote|[A] science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God.<ref>Ahmed Zarruq, Zaineb Istrabadi, Hamza Yusuf Hanson—"The Principles of Sufism". Amal Press. 2008.</ref>}}

A practitioner of this tradition is nowadays known as a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūfī}}'' ({{lang|fa|صُوفِيّ}}), or, in earlier usage, a [[dervish]]. The origin of the word "Sufi" is ambiguous. One understanding is that Sufi means wool-wearer; wool wearers during early Islam were pious ascetics who withdrew from urban life. Another explanation of the word "Sufi" is that it means 'purity'.<ref>{{cite web|author=Seyyedeh Dr. Nahid Angha |url=http://ias.org/sufism/origin-of-word-tasawouf/ |title=origin of the Wrod Tasawouf |date=22 November 2010 |publisher=Ias.org |access-date=2013-11-06}}</ref>

Sufis generally belong to a ''[[khalqa]]'', a circle or group, led by a Sheikh or ''[[Murshid]]''. Sufi circles usually belong to a ''[[Tariqa]]'' which is the Sufi order and each has a ''[[Silsila]]'', which is the spiritual lineage, which traces its succession back to notable Sufis of the past, and often ultimately to [[Muhammed]] or one of his close associates. The ''turuq'' (plural of ''tariqa'') are not enclosed like Christian monastic orders; rather the members retain an outside life. Membership of a Sufi group often passes down family lines. Meetings may or may not be segregated according to the prevailing custom of the wider society. An existing Muslim faith is not always a requirement for entry, particularly in Western countries.

[[File:Mevlana Konya.jpg|thumb|right|Mawlānā [[Rumi]]'s tomb, [[Konya]], Turkey]]

Sufi practice includes
* ''[[Dhikr]]'', or remembrance (of God), which often takes the form of rhythmic chanting and breathing exercises.
* ''[[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]'', which takes the form of music and dance — the whirling dance of the ''[[Mevlevi]]'' dervishes is a form well known in the West.
* ''[[Muraqaba]]'' or meditation.
* Visiting holy places, particularly the tombs of Sufi saints, in order to remember death and the greatness of those who have passed.

The aims of Sufism include: the experience of ecstatic states (''hal''), purification of the heart (''[[qalb]]''), overcoming the lower self (''[[nafs]]''), extinction of the individual personality (''[[fana (Sufism)|fana]]''), communion with God (''[[haqiqa]]''), and higher knowledge (''[[marifat]]''). Some sufic beliefs and practices have been found unorthodox by other Muslims; for instance [[Mansur al-Hallaj]] was put to death for blasphemy after uttering the phrase ''[[Ana'l Haqq]]'', "I am the Truth" (i.e. God) in a trance.

Notable classical Sufis include [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], [[Fariduddin Attar]], [[Sultan Bahoo]], [[Sayyed Sadique Ali Husaini]], [[Saadi Shirazi]] and [[Hafez]], all major poets in the [[Persian language]]. [[Omar Khayyam]], [[Al-Ghazzali]] and [[Ibn Arabi]] were renowned scholars. [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], [[Moinuddin Chishti]], and [[Bahauddin Naqshband]] founded major orders, as did Rumi. [[Rabia Basri]] was the most prominent female Sufi.

Sufism first came into contact with the Judeo-Christian world during the
[[Moorish]] occupation of [[Spain]]. An interest in Sufism revived in non-Muslim countries during the modern era, led by such figures as [[Inayat Khan]] and [[Idries Shah]] (both in the UK), [[Rene Guenon]] (France) and [[Ivan Aguéli]] (Sweden). Sufism has also long been present in Asian countries that do not have a Muslim majority, such as [[India]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2013/04/25/china-xinjiang-sufi-shrines/|title=China's Sufis: The Shrines Behind the Dunes|first=Ian|last=Johnson|date=25 April 2013}}</ref>

=== Indian religions ===
==== Hinduism ====
{{Main|Hinduism}}

In Hinduism, various [[sadhana]]s aim at overcoming ignorance (''avidhya'') and transcending the limited identification with body, mind and ego to attain ''[[moksha]]''. Hinduism has a number of interlinked [[Sādhanā|ascetic traditions]] and [[Darsanas|philosophical schools]] which aim at [[moksha]]{{sfn|Raju|1992}} and the acquisition of higher powers.{{sfn|White|2012}} With the onset of the British colonisation of India, those traditions came to be interpreted in western terms such as "mysticism", drawing equivalents with western terms and practices.{{sfn|King|2001}}

[[Yoga]] is the [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], and [[soul|spiritual]] practices or disciplines which aim to attain a state of permanent peace.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=10, 457}} Various traditions of yoga are found in [[Hinduism]], Buddhism and [[Jainism]].<ref>Denise Lardner Carmody, John Carmody, ''Serene Compassion.''

Classical [[Vedanta]] gives philosophical interpretations and commentaries of the [[Upanishads]], a vast collection of ancient hymns.  At least ten schools of Vedanta are known,{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} of which [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vishishtadvaita]], and [[Dvaita]] are the best known.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}} Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]], states that there is no difference between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. The best-known subschool is Kevala Vedanta or ''mayavada'' as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]]. Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.{{sfn|King|1999}} In contrast [[Bhedabheda]]-Vedanta emphasizes that Atman and Brahman are both the same and ''not'' the same,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} while [[Dvaita]] Vedanta states that Atman and God are fundamentally different.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} In modern times, the Upanishads have been interpreted by [[Neo-Vedanta]] as being "mystical".{{sfn|King|2001}}

Various [[Shaivism|Shaivist]] traditions are strongly nondualistic, such as [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].

==== Buddhism ====
{{See also|Presectarian Buddhism|Buddhist meditation|Subitism}}

According to Oliver, Buddhism is mystical in the sense that it aims at the identification of the true nature of our self, and live according to it.<ref>Oliver, P. ''Mysticism: A Guide for the Perplexed'', pp. 47–48</ref> Buddhism originated in India, sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries [[Common Era|BCE]], but is now mostly practiced in other countries, where it developed into a number of traditions, the main ones being [[Therevada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]].

Buddhism aims at [[Moksha|liberation]] from the cycle of rebirth by self-control through meditation and morally just behaviour. Some [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Buddhist paths]] aim at a gradual development and transformation of the personality toward [[Nirvana]], like the Theravada [[Four stages of enlightenment|stages of enlightenment]]. Others, like the Japanese Rinzai Zen tradition, emphasize [[Subitism|sudden insight]], but nevertheless also prescribe intensive training, including meditation and self-restraint.

Although [[Theravada]] does not acknowledge the existence of a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as a transcendent reality which may be attained.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}}{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=7}} It further stresses transformation of the personality through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}} According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened.{{sfn|Jones|2016| p=12 }} It is best known in the west from the [[Vipassana movement]], a number of branches of modern [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism from [[Buddhism in Burma|Burma]], Cambodia, [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]] and [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], and includes contemporary [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist teachers]] such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] and [[Jack Kornfield]].

Both denoye the potentiality of attaining Buddhahood.<ref>Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96–97.</ref> In the Lankavatara-interpretation, ''tathagata-garbha'' as a potentiality turned into a metaphysical Absolute reality which had to be realised.}} ''Vijñapti-mātra'', coupled with ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' or ''tathagatagarba'', has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

Chinese and Japanese Zen is grounded on the Chinese understanding of the [[Buddha-nature]] as one true's essence, and the [[Two truths doctrine]] as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or [[Buddha-nature]], thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=168}} In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and [[shikan-taza]], sitting meditation, is the expression of the already existing Buddhahood.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a [[Kensho|break-through insight]] in this Buddha-nature,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life,{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|p=54, 140}} as expressed in the [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]].{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} The Japanese Zen-scholar [[D.T.

Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28586-5}}</ref>

The Tibetan [[Vajrayana]] tradition is based on Madhyamaka philosophy and Tantra.{{sfn|Newman|2001|p=587}} In deity yoga, visualizations of deities are eventually dissolved, to realize the inherent [[sunyata|emptiness]] of every-'thing' that exists.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=16–20}} [[Dzogchen]], which is being taught in both the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan buddhist]] [[Nyingma]] school and the [[Bön]] tradition,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dzogchen|title=Dzogchen - Rigpa Wiki|website=www.rigpawiki.org}}</ref> focuses on direct insight into our real nature. It holds that "mind-nature" is manifested when one is enlightened,{{sfn|Klein|Tenzin Wangyal|2006|p=4}} being nonconceptually aware (''[[rigpa]]'', "open presence") of one's nature,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}} "a recognition of one's beginningless nature."{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=272}} [[Mahamudra]] has similarities with Dzogchen, emphasizing the meditational approach to insight and liberation.

=== Taoism ===
{{Main|Taoism}}

Taoist philosophy is centered on the ''Tao'', usually translated "Way", an ineffable cosmic principle. The contrasting yet interdependent concepts of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]'' and ''[[yin and yang|yang]]'' also symbolise harmony, with Taoist scriptures often emphasing the ''Yin'' virtues of femininity, passivity and yieldingness.<ref>''Mysticism: A guide for the Perplexed''. Oliver, P.</ref> Taoist practice includes exercises and rituals aimed at manipulating the life force ''[[Qi]]'', and obtaining health and longevity.{{refn|group=note|Extending to physical immortality: the Taoist pantheon includes ''[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]'', or immortals.}} These have been elaborated into practices such as ''[[Tai chi]]'', which are well known in the west.

===The Secularization of Mysticism===
{{see also|New Age}}

Today there is also occurring in the West what Richard Jones calls "the secularization of mysticism".<ref>Richard H. Jones, ''Philosophy of Mysticism'' (SUNY Press, 2016), epilogue.</ref> That is the separation of meditation and other mystical practices from their traditional use in religious ways of life to only secular ends of purported psychological and physiological benefits.

==Scholarly approaches of mysticism and mystical experience==
{{Main|Scholarly approaches of mysticism}}

=== Types of mysticism ===
[[R. C. Zaehner]] distinguishes three fundamental types of mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The monistic type, which according to Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul,{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the work of [[C.G. Jung]].}} includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as [[Samkhya]] and [[Advaita vedanta]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into one of these two categories.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}

[[Walter Terence Stace]], in his book ''Mysticism and Philosophy'' (1960), distinguished two types of mystical experience, namely extrovertive and introvertive mysticism.{{sfn|Stace|1960|p=chap. 1}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} Extrovertive mysticism is an experience of the unity of the external world, whereas introvertive mysticism is "an experience of unity devoid of perceptual objects; it is literally an experience of 'no-thing-ness'."{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} The unity in extrovertive mysticism is with the totality of objects of perception. While perception stays continuous, “unity shines through the same world”; the unity in introvertive mysticism is with a pure consciousness, devoid of objects of perception,{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=292}} “pure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated.”<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|url=https://archive.org/details/teachingsofmysti00stac|url-access=registration|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-451-60306-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/teachingsofmysti00stac/page/20 20–21]}}</ref> According to Stace such experiences are nonsensous and nonintellectual, under a total “suppression of the whole empirical content.”<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|url=https://archive.org/details/teachingsofmysti00stac|url-access=registration|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn= 0-451-60306-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/teachingsofmysti00stac/page/15 15–18]}}</ref>

Stace argues that doctrinal differences between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Stace argues that mysticism is part of the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver's background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.<ref name="Mysticism and Philosophy">{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=Mysticism and Philosophy|date=1960|publisher=MacMillan|pages=44–80}}</ref>

=== Mystical experiences ===
Since the 19th century, "mystical experience" has evolved as a distinctive concept. It is closely related to "mysticism" but lays sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior, whereas mysticism encompasses a broad range of practices aiming at a transformation of the person, not just inducing mystical experiences.

[[William James]]' ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is the classic study on religious or mystical experience, which influenced deeply both the academic and popular understanding of "religious experience".{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} He popularized the use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his "Varieties",{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental:{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}
{{quote|Under the influence of William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience, heavily centered on people's conversion experiences, most philosophers' interest in mysticism has been in distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting "mystical experiences.""{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}}}

Yet, Gelman notes that so-called mystical experience is not a transitional event, as William James claimed, but an "abiding consciousness, accompanying a person throughout the day, or parts of it. For that reason, it might be better to speak of mystical consciousness, which can be either fleeting or abiding."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

Most mystical traditions warn against an attachment to mystical experiences, and offer a "protective and hermeneutic framework" to accommodate these experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} These same traditions offer the means to induce mystical experiences,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} which may have several origins:
* Spontaneous; either apparently without any cause, or by persistent existential concerns, or by neurophysiological origins;
* Religious practices, such as [[contemplation]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]]-repetition;
* Entheogens (psychedelic drugs)
* Neurophysiological origins, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

The theoretical study of mystical experience has shifted from an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, takes into account the historical and cultural context.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.

=== Perennialism versus constructionism ===
The term "mystical experience" evolved as a distinctive concept since the 19th century, laying sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior. Perennialists regard those various experience traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof. In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the context in which they emerge.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Well-known representatives are William James, R.C. Zaehner, William Stace and Robert Forman.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity."{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}}

In contrast, for the past decades most scholars have favored a constructionist approach, which states that mystical experiences are fully constructed by the ideas, symbols and practices that mystics are familiar with.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} Critics of the term "religious experience" note that the notion of "religious experience" or "mystical experience" as marking insight into religious truth is a modern development,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} and contemporary researchers of mysticism note that mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts "which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience".{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic.{{sfn|Katz|2000|pp=3–4}}

Richard Jones draws a distinction between "anticonstructivism" and "perennialism": constructivism can be rejected with respect to a certain class of mystical experiences without ascribing to a perennialist philosophy on the relation of mystical doctrines.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 2; also see Jensine Andresen, "Introduction: Towards  a Cognitive Science of Religion," in Jensine Andresen, ed., ''Religion in Mind''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.}} One can reject constructivism without claiming that mystical experiences reveal a cross-cultural "perennial truth". For example, a Christian can reject both constructivism and perennialism in arguing that there is a union with God free of cultural construction. Constructivism versus anticonstructivism is a matter of the nature of ''mystical experiences'' while perennialism is a matter of ''mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse''.

=== Contextualism and attribution theory ===
{{Main|Attribution (psychology)|Neurotheology}}

The perennial position is now "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} and the contextual approach has become the common approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Contextualism takes into account the historical and cultural context of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The attribution approach views "mystical experience" as non-ordinary states of consciousness which are explained in a religious framework.{{sfn|Taves|2009}} According to Proudfoot, mystics unconsciously merely attribute a doctrinal content to ordinary experiences. That is, mystics project cognitive content onto otherwise ordinary experiences having a strong emotional impact.{{sfn|Proudfoot|1985}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}} This approach has been further elaborated by [[Ann Taves]], in her ''[[Religious Experience Reconsidered]]''. She incorporates both [[Neurotheology|neurological]] and cultural approaches in the study of mystical experience.

=== Neurological research ===
{{See also|Neurotheology}}

Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.{{sfn|Newberg|d'Aquili|2008}}{{sfn|Newberg|Waldman|2009}} This leads to a central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural correlates of mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences are no more than brain events or does it merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 4}}

Interest in mystical experiences and psychedelic drugs has also recently seen a resurgence.<ref>E.g., {{Harvnb|Richards|2015}}; {{Harvnb|Osto|2016}}</ref>

The [[anterior insula]] may be involved in [[ineffability]], a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words, which is a common quality in mystical experiences. According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the [[anterior insula]], a part of the brain which is involved in [[interoception]], self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk".{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2496–2498}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/can-epilepsy-unlock-the-secret-to-happiness-/epilepsy-happiness-brain-fabienne-picard/c4s13429/ Francesca Sacco (2013-09-19), ''Can Epilepsy Unlock The Secret To Happiness?'', Le Temps]}}

A philosophical issue in the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to [[morality]]. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible.<ref>Schweitzer 1936</ref> Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs.<ref>Danto 1987</ref> Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality.<ref>Stace 1960, pp. 323–343.</ref> Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is not as simple as that.{{sfn|Barnard|Kripal|2002}}{{sfn|Jones|2004}}

Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism – that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences – serves to exclude it from political issues as social justice. Mysticism thus becomes seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than seeking to transform the world, serve to accommodate the individual to the status quo through the alleviation of anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}
