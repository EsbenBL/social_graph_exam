'''Marcel Gauchet''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡoʃɛ|lang}}; born 1946) is a French [[historian]], [[philosopher]], and [[sociologist]]. He is professor emeritus of the [[Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron]] at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] and head of the periodical ''[[Le Débat]]''.

Gauchet is one of France's most prominent contemporary intellectuals. He has written widely on such issues as the political consequences of modern [[individualism]], the relation between [[religion]] and [[democracy]], and the dilemmas of [[globalisation]].

Two of Gauchet's books have been translated into English, including ''The Disenchantment of the World: A Political History of Religion''.

Gauchet was awarded the Prix européen de l'essai, fondation Charles Veillon in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fondation-veillon.ch/index.php?tag%2F2018-marcel-gauchet |title=fondation-veillon.ch |access-date=2020-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013943/https://fondation-veillon.ch/index.php?tag%2F2018-marcel-gauchet |archive-date=2018-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
