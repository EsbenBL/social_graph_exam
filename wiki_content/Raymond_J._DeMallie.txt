==Early life and education==
Raymond DeMallie was born in 1946 and raised in [[Rochester, New York]]. In 1964, in his last year of high school, he attended the [http://www.rochester.edu/college/ANT/morgan/past.html [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] Lecture]s at the University of Rochester, given by [[Fred Eggan]] of the University of Chicago.<ref name="bioDM"/>

This inspired DeMallie's decision to attend the [[University of Chicago]] for undergraduate and graduate work; Eggan would eventually serve as the chair of his dissertation committee.  Other influential teachers at Chicago included [[Sol Tax]] (with whom he worked as a member of the staff of [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CA/ ''Current Anthropology'']), [[George W. Stocking, Jr.|George Stocking]], [[Raymond D. Fogelson|Ray Fogelson]], and [[David M. Schneider|David Schneider]].<ref name="bioDM"/>

DeMallie's dissertation [[fieldwork]] on the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]] focused on kinship and [[social organization]].  DeMallie drew from both cultural and linguistic data, and he received his PhD in 1971. (He earned his B.A. with honors in 1968 and his M.A. in 1970, with the Department of Anthropology throughout his education at Chicago.)<ref name="bioDM">[https://aisri.indiana.edu/about/raymondjdemalliebiography.pdf "Raymond J. DeMallie"], Indiana University, accessed December 20, 2009.</ref>

==Career==
DeMallie was a member of the [[University of Wyoming|University of Wyoming's]] Department of Anthropology from 1972-73.

In 1973 he joined [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]'s Anthropology Department, which allowed him to work with the department's founder, [[Charles F. Voegelin|Carl Voegelin]]. In 1985 DeMallie founded and became the director of the [https://aisri.indiana.edu/about/index.html American Indian Studies Research Institute] at Indiana University.  The Institute collaborates with tribes to document endangered native languages and develop materials to teach the languages, many of which are being revived in tribal schools and colleges.<ref name="bioDM" />  On the Indiana faculty, Professor DeMallie was also the Class of 1967 Chancellor’s Professor of Anthropology and American Studies.<ref name="bioDM" />

During his career at Indiana, DeMallie has trained a significant number of scholars who have taken up research and teaching posts in several fields concerned with Native North American studies. These include [[Brenda Farnell]], Paula Wagoner, Mindy J. Morgan, [[Jason Baird Jackson]], and Carolyn Anderson.

DeMallie has been active in professional associations; in 1991-1992, he was elected as president of the American Society for Ethnohistory.<ref>[http://www.ethnohistory.org/sections/about_ase/governance.html "Governance of the Society"], American Society for Ethnohistory, accessed December 20, 2009</ref>
