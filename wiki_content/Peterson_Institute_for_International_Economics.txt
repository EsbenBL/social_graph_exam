The '''Peterson Institute for International Economics''' ('''PIIE'''), previously known as the '''Institute for International Economics''' ('''IIE'''), is an American [[think tank]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] It was founded by [[C. Fred Bergsten]] in 1981 and is currently led by [[Adam S. Posen]]. The institute conducts research, provides policy recommendations, and publishes books and articles on a wide range of topics related to the US economy and [[international economics]].

According to the ''2015 Global Go To [[Think Tank]] Index Report'' ([[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]], [[University of Pennsylvania]]), PIIE was number 20 (of 150) in the "Top Think Tanks Worldwide" and number 13 (of 60) in the "Top Think Tanks in the United States".<ref name="Global Go To">{{cite web |author=James G.

==History==
The institute was founded by [[C. Fred Bergsten]] in 1981, in response to a proposal from the [[German Marshall Fund]] (GMF).<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The President of the GMF, Frank Loy, as well as the President of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Leslie Gelb]], asked Bergsten to create a research institution focused on assessing the growing importance of the international economy in light of recent geopolitical events. During the 1970s, [[President (government title)|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] ended the link to the [[gold standard]], the [[first oil shock]] occurred in 1973, and the first [[Group of Five|G5]] summit convened. As a result, the new PIIE sought to conduct policy-oriented research on international economic issues by bringing together experts, academics, and policymakers.

The GMF committed an initial $4 million to the institute. The PIIE's founding chairman was Peter G. Peterson, who had served on Nixon's Council on International Economic Policy and as Secretary of Commerce. [[Anthony M. Solomon]] (the Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs and President of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]) and [[Richard N. Cooper]] (a consultant to the [[National Security Council]]) also joined the PIIE in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bergsten |first1=C. Fred |title=Peter G.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the PIIE expanded to become one of the most internationally recognized think tanks in Washington D.C. The [[Ford Foundation]] was also a major supporter of the PIIE, having provided a major grant in 1991. In the 1990s, the PIIE created a number of endowed chairs for its members: one in honor of [[Reginald H. Jones|Reginald Jones]], the former CEO of [[General Electric]], and another for [[Dennis Weatherstone]], the former CEO of [[JP Morgan & Co|JP Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bergsten |first1=C.

It moved from 11 [[Dupont Circle]] to its current building on [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in 2001.

In 2006, a capital campaign led to the creation of a sizable [[Financial endowment|endowment]] in order to celebrate the PIIE's 25th anniversary. Previously known as the Institute of International Economics, it changed its name that same year in recognition of [[Peter George Peterson|Peter G. Peterson]]'s role in the capital campaign and for his longstanding support of the Institute since the early 1980s. At its conference in [[New York, NY]], a number of major economic figures attended: [[Alan Greenspan]], former [[Federal Reserve Board Chairman]]; [[Robert Rubin]], former Secretary of the Treasury; [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], Governor of the [[European Central Bank]], among others.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Institute's 25th Anniversary Gala |url=https://www.piie.com/events/institutes-25th-anniversary-gala |website=Peterson Institute for International Economics |access-date=2019-12-29 |archive-date=2019-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229030544/https://www.piie.com/events/institutes-25th-anniversary-gala |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2017 tax reform debate===

The Peterson Institute has been at the forefront of research on the proposals by the [[Trump Administration]] of reforming the tax code. [https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/united-states-outlier-tax-trends-advanced-and-large-emerging-economies Comparative analyses in advanced economies] show the tax proposal will increase the budget deficit, unless coupled with a reduction of tax loopholes.{{primary source inline}}

==Building==
[[Image:Peterson Institute.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Peterson Institute for International Economics Building]]

In 2001 the Peterson Institute moved into a building it commissioned and built at 1750 [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] ("Embassy Row"), NW, Washington, D.C. It is located across from the main [[Brookings Institution]] building, diagonally across from [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and next to the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]].

The building was designed by [[James von Klemperer]] from the [[architectural firm]] [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]]. Its state-of-the-art conference center is named in honor of the institute's founder, [[C. Fred Bergsten]]. The sculpture garden is named in honor of Institute benefactor [[Anthony M. Solomon]]. The building houses several pieces of art donated by [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a former director of the institute, including a sculpture by [[Joan Miró]] and a painting by [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]]. It also houses collections of Chinese and African art donated by William M. Keck II, Ambassador [[John Melvin Yates|John M. Yates]], and Anthony M. Solomon.

The building was granted the Best Architecture for 2001 award by the ''[[American City Business Journals|Washington Business Journal]]'' and won a Best Design award from the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 2003.<ref name=Twenty-five>{{cite web|last=Bergsten|first=C.&nbsp;Fred|title=The Peter G.

== Criticism ==

In an opinion piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'' published in 2016, [[Steven Rattner]] called the new building of the Peterson Institute "the locker room of the Team Globalization and Free Trade cheering squad." We should not close our borders or retreat from the world, said Rattner, but free trade has winners and losers, and "we need to be more sensitive to the losers and try to help," for example by redistribution of income through the tax system, which, he said, we haven't been doing. He goes on to state that [[Ross Perot]] was right when he said that the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] would transfer American jobs to [[Mexico]], particularly in manufacturing. From 2009 to 2013, employment in the American auto manufacturing sector rose by 23%, from 560,000 to 690,000. But employment in the Mexican auto sector rose from 368,000 to 589,000, or 60%. "I’m happy that 221,000 more Mexicans got jobs," he writes, "but let’s be honest: Absent open borders, many of those jobs would have been in America." He concludes by pointing out that wages in American auto manufacturing are down by 12.7%. Furthermore, American auto manufacturing compensation was $35.67 an hour; in Mexico, it was $6.36 an hour. Adam Posen, then the Peterson Institute's director, responded that “fetishization” of any industry was “immoral.”<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/opinion/whats-our-duty-to-the-people-globalization-leaves-behind.html |title=What’s Our Duty to the People Globalization Leaves Behind? |author=Steven Rattner |author-link=Steven Rattner |date=January 26, 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 3, 2017 |archive-date=December 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209040129/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/opinion/whats-our-duty-to-the-people-globalization-leaves-behind.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
