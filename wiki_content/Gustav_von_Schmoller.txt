'''Gustav Friedrich''' (after 1908: '''von''') '''Schmoller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃmɔlɐ|lang|Gustav von Schmoller.ogg}}; 24 June 1838 – 27 June 1917) was the leader of the "younger" [[Germany|German]] [[historical school of economics]].

He was a leading ''[[Sozialpolitiker]]'' (more derisively, ''[[Kathedersozialist]]'', "Socialist of the Chair"), and a founder and long-time chairman of the ''[[Verein für Socialpolitik]]'', the German Economic Association, which continues to exist.<ref name=bonn>{{cite journal |last=Bonn |first=M.J. |doi=10.2307/2225060|title=Gustav Schmoller und die Volkswirtschaftslehre |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=48 |issue=192 |pages=713–714 |jstor=2225060 |year=1938 }}</ref> 
 
The appellation "Kathedersozialist" was given to Schmoller and other members of the Verein by their enemies. Schmoller disavowed the "socialist" label, instead tracing his thought to the heterodox liberalism represented by [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]], [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]], [[Bruno Hildebrand]], [[Thomas Edward Cliffe Leslie]], [[Lorenz von Stein]], and [[Émile de Laveleye]] and radicals such as [[Frederic Harrison]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]].<ref name="Grimmer" /> His goal was to reconcile the Prussian monarchy and bureaucracy "with the idea of the Liberal state and complemented by the best elements of parliamentarianism" to carry out social reform.<ref name="Grimmer">{{cite book |last1=Grimmer-Solem |first1=Erik |title=The Rise of Historical Economics and Social Reform in Germany, 1864-1894 |date=2003 |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=197–198}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nau |first1=Heino Heinrich |title=Gustav Schmoller's Historico-Ethical Political Economy : ethics, politics and economics in the younger German Historical School, 1860-1917 |journal=European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |date=2000 |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=523|doi=10.1080/09672560050210098 |s2cid=154920944 }}</ref>

==Life==
Schmoller was born in [[Heilbronn]]. His father was a [[Württemberg]] civil servant. Young Schmoller studied ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kameralwissenschaft|de}}'' (a combination of [[economics]], [[law]], [[history]], and civil administration) at the [[University of Tübingen]] (1857–61). In 1861, he obtained an appointment at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Württemberg Statistical Department|de|3=Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg}}.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Schmoller, Gustav}}</ref> During his academic career, he held appointments as a professor at the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] (1864–72), [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] (1872–82), and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] (1882–1913).<ref>''Encyclopedia of Law and Society: American and Global Perspectives'', 3rd ed., "Schmoller, Gustav von."</ref> After 1899, he represented the [[University of Berlin]] in the [[Prussian House of Lords]].

Schmoller's influence on academic policy, economic, social and fiscal reform, and economics as an academic discipline for the time between 1875 and 1910<ref name=powers>{{cite journal |last=Powers |first=Charles H. |title=Review|journal=[[American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]|volume=54|issue=3 |year=1995|pages=287–288 |jstor=3487093|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1995.tb03427.x }}</ref> can hardly be overstated. He was an outspoken proponent of the assertion of [[German naval power]] and the expansion of the [[German overseas empire]].

==Work==
[[File:Menger - Untersuchungen über das Methode der socialwissenschaften und der politischen Ökonomie insbesondere, 1933 - 5787924.tif|thumb|''Untersuchungen über das Methode der socialwissenschaften und der politischen Ökonomie insbesondere'', 1933]]
As an outspoken leader of the "younger" historical school, Schmoller opposed what he saw as the [[Hypothetico-deductive model|axiomatic-deductive]] approach of [[classical economics]] and, later, the [[Austrian school]]—indeed, Schmoller coined the term to suggest provincialism in an unfavorable review of the 1883 book ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere)'' by [[Carl Menger]], which attacked the methods of the historical school. This led to the controversy known as the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'', which today often appears as a waste of energies and one of the main reasons for the later demise of the whole historical school, although—as [[Joseph Schumpeter]] once pointed out—this was really a quarrel ''within'' that school. Schmoller's primarily [[inductive reasoning|inductive approach]], requesting careful study, comparative in time and space,<ref name=powers/> of economic performance and phenomena generally, his focus on the evolution of economic processes and institutions, and his insistence on the cultural specificity of economics and the centrality of values in shaping economic exchanges stand in stark contrast to some [[classical economics|classical]] and most [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]], so that he and his school fell out of the mainstream of economics by the 1930s, being replaced in Germany by the successor [[Freiburg school]].

However, it is often overlooked that Schmoller's primary preoccupation in his lifetime was not with economic ''method'' but with economic and social ''policy'' to address the challenges posed by rapid industrialization and urbanization. That is, Schmoller was first and foremost a social reformer.<ref>Grimmer-Solem, Erik (2003) ''The Rise of Historical Economics and Social Reform in Germany, 1864–1894'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> As such, Schmoller's influence extended throughout Europe, to the [[Progressive movement]] in the [[United States]], and to social reformers in [[Meiji Japan]]. His most prominent non-German students and followers included [[William J. Ashley]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[Richard T. Ely]], [[Noburu Kanai]], [[Albion W. Small]], and [[E.R.A. Seligman]].

Since the 1980s, Schmoller's work has been re-evaluated and found relevant to some branches of [[heterodox]] economics, especially [[development economics]], [[behavioral economics]], [[evolutionary economics]], and [[neo-institutional economics]]. He has long had an influence within the subfield of [[economic history]] and the discipline of [[sociology]].

;Works by Schmoller

His works, the majority of which deal with economic history and policy, include:
* ''Der französiche Handelsvertrag und seine Gegner'' (The French trade treaty and its opponents, 1862)
* ''Zur geschichte der deutschen Kleingewerbe im 19. Jahrhundert'' (History of German Small Businesses in the 19th Century, 1870)
* ''Strassburg zur Zeit der Zunftkämpfe'' (Strassburg During the Guild Fights, 1875)
* ''Zur Litteraturgeschichte der Staats- und Sozialwissenschaften'' (1888)
* ''Umrisse und Untersuchungen zur Verfassungs-, Verwaltungs-, und Wirtschaftsgeschichte'' (1898)
* ''Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirthschaftslehre'' (Layout of General Economics, 1900–1904)
* ''Ueber einige Grundfragen der Sozialpolitik'' (About a few Questions of Social Politics, 1904)

After 1881, Schmoller was editor of the ''Jahrbuch für Gesetzebung, Verwaltung, und Volkswirthschaft im deutschen Reich''.  From 1878 to 1903, he edited a series of monographs entitled ''Staats- und sozialwissenschaftliche Forschungen''. He was also an editor and major contributor to ''[[Acta Borussica]]'', an extensive collection of Prussian historical sources undertaken by the [[Berlin Academy of Science]] upon Schmoller's and [[Heinrich von Sybel|Sybel]]'s instigation.

One of the reasons why Schmoller is not more widely known today is that most of his books and articles were not translated,<ref name=bonn/> as during his time Anglo-American economists generally read German, which was the dominant scholarly language of the time. German having fallen out of favor, the untranslated texts are now inaccessible to readers without knowledge of German. Two exceptions are:
* ''The Mercantile System and Its Historical Significance'', New York: Macmillan, 2nd ed. 1910. This is a chapter from Schmoller's much larger work ''Studien über die wirtschaftliche Politik Friedrichs des Grossen'' which was published in 1884. The chapter was translated by William J. Ashley and published in 1897 under the English title above. [https://books.google.com/books?id=autMAAAAIAAJ online edition]
