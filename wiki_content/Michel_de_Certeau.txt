'''Michel de Certeau''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} ({{IPA-fr|sɛʁto|lang}}; 17 May 1925 – 9 January 1986) was a French [[Jesuit]] and scholar whose work combined [[history]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]], and the [[social sciences]]. He was known as a philosopher of everyday life and widely regarded as an historian who had interests ranging from travelogues of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to contemporary urban life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|pages=166–167}}</ref>

==Education==
Michel Jean Emmanuel de La Barge de Certeau was born in 1925 in [[Chambéry]], [[Savoie]].  De Certeau's education was eclectic, following the medieval tradition of ''peregrinatio academica''.<ref>Luce Giard, ''Michel de Certeau in the Americas. A conference in celebration of the 20th anniversary of Michel de Certeau’s death'', Dept. of History, UC San Diego, February 25, 2006.</ref> After obtaining degrees in [[classics]] and [[philosophy]] at the universities of [[Grenoble]], [[Lyon]], he studied the works of [[Pierre Favre]] (1506–1546) at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (Paris) with [[Jean Orcibal]]. He undertook religious training at a [[seminary]] in [[Lyon]], where he entered the [[Jesuit]] order (Society of Jesus) in 1950 and was ordained in 1956.  De Certeau entered the Society of Jesus hoping to do missionary work in [[China]]. In the year of his ordination, de Certeau became one of the founders of the journal ''Christus'', with which he would actively be involved for much of his life. In 1960 he earned his doctorate ("thèse de 3e Cycle") at the  [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] with a study of co-founder of the Society of Jesus Pierre Favre<ref>[http://www.jesuites.com/histoire/certeau.htm Jesuites.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910002903/http://www.jesuites.com/histoire/certeau.htm |date=2011-09-10 }}</ref> (the Sorbonne is a secular state university where theology may not be taught) before embarking on his celebrated study of [[Jean-Joseph Surin]].

== Professional life ==
De Certeau was greatly influenced by [[Sigmund Freud]] and was, along with [[Jacques Lacan]], one of the founding members of ''[[École Freudienne de Paris]]'', an informal group which served as a focal point for French scholars interested in psychoanalysis. He came to public attention after publishing an article dealing with the [[May 1968 events in France]]. He also took part in [[Robert Jaulin]]'s department of ethnology at the [[University of Paris-VII]] after May 68.

De Certeau went on to teach at several universities in locations as diverse as [[Geneva]], [[San Diego]], and [[Paris]]. Through the 1970s and 1980s he produced a string of works that demonstrated his interest in [[mysticism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[psychoanalysis]].  He died in Paris, aged 60, from pancreatic cancer.

===''The Practice of Everyday Life''===
De Certeau's most well-known and influential work in the United States has been ''[[The Practice of Everyday Life]]'', cited in fields such as rhetoric,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dickinson|first=Greg|date=2006|title=The Pleasantville Effect: Nostaliga and the Visual Framing of (White) Suburbia|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=70|pages=212–33|doi=10.1080/10570310600843504|s2cid=144339746}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Kendall R.|date=2006|title=Rhetorical Maneuvers: Subjectivity, Power, and Resistance|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|volume=39|issue=4|pages=310–32|doi=10.1353/par.2007.0005|s2cid=144090779}}</ref> performance studies,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theories of Performance|last=Bell|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Sage|year=2008|location=London}}</ref> and law.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Primack|first1=Alvin J.|last2=Johnson|first2=Kevin A.|date=2017|title=Student cyberbullying inside the digital schoolhouse gate: Toward a standard for determining where a "School" is|journal=First Amendment Studies|volume=51|pages=30–48|doi=10.1080/21689725.2016.1278177|s2cid=151924347}}</ref> In ''The Practice of Everyday Life'', de Certeau combined his disparate scholarly interests to develop a theory of the productive and consumptive activity inherent in [[everyday life]].  According to de Certeau, everyday life is distinctive from other practices of daily existence because it is repetitive and unconscious. De Certeau’s study of everyday life is neither the study of “popular culture”, nor is it necessarily the study of everyday resistances to regimes of power.  Instead, he attempts to outline the way individuals unconsciously navigate everything from city streets to literary texts.

''The Practice of Everyday Life'' distinguishes between the concepts of [[strategy]] and [[tactic (method)|tactics]].  De Certeau links "strategies" with institutions and structures of power who are the "producers", while individuals are "consumers" or "poachers," acting in accordance with, or against, environments defined by strategies by using "tactics".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practice of Everyday Life|last=Certeau|first=Michel de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|location=Berkeley|pages=xvi, xix}}</ref>  In the chapter "Walking in the City", de Certeau asserts that "the city" is generated by the strategies of governments, corporations, and other institutional bodies who produce things like maps that describe the city as a unified whole.  De Certeau uses the vantage from the World Trade Center in New York to illustrate the idea of a synoptic, unified view.  By contrast, the walker at street level moves in ways that are tactical and never fully determined by the plans of organizing bodies, taking shortcuts in spite of the strategic grid of the streets. De Certeau's argument is that everyday life works by a process of poaching on the territory of others, using the rules and products that already exist in culture in a way that is influenced, but never wholly determined, by those rules and products.

According to [[Andrew Blauvelt]], who relies on the work of de Certeau in his essay on design and everyday life:<ref>''Strangely Familiar: Design and Everyday Life'', edited by Andrew Blauvelt, Walker Art Center. 2003.</ref>

<blockquote>De Certeau's investigations into the realm of routine practices, or the "arts of doing" such as walking, talking, reading, dwelling, and cooking, were guided by his belief that despite repressive aspects of modern society, there exists an element of creative resistance to these structures enacted by ordinary people. In ''The Practice of Everyday Life'', de Certeau outlines an important critical distinction between strategies and tactics in this battle of repression and expression. According to him, strategies are used by those within organizational power structures, whether small or large, such as the state or municipality, the corporation or the proprietor, a scientific enterprise or the scientist. Strategies are deployed against some external entity to institute a set of relations for official or proper ends, whether adversaries, competitors, clients, customers, or simply subjects. Tactics, on the other hand, are employed by those who are subjugated. By their very nature tactics are defensive and opportunistic, used in more limited ways and seized momentarily within spaces, both physical and psychological, produced and governed by more powerful strategic relations.</blockquote>

===''The Writing of History''===
His work ''The Writing of History'', translated into English after his death, deals with the relationship between [[history]] and [[religion]].  De Certeau makes a point in linking the history of writing history to the legitimization of political power and that "Western" traditions of history involve using the act of writing as a tool of colonialism; writing their own histories while un-writing the embodied traditions of native peoples.
