She studied at King Edward’s School in Birmingham and won a scholarship to [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], to study English, but decided to go to Cambridge instead to study history at [[Newnham College]]. She was at Cambridge from 1964-7. She completed her Masters degree in Russian and Soviet Politics at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1968, staying on to complete a Ph.D. on decision-making in local government.

== Career ==
While researching her Ph.D. she taught at the Polytechnic of Central London (later to become the [[University of Westminster]]) and subsequently at the [[University of Essex]], where she became Professor of Politics.
Her special interests were political science and international relations, politics and gender. Over the course of her career, she published a large number of enduring works including ''Women and Politics'' (1982),''The Politics of Child Daycare in Britain'' (2000)
