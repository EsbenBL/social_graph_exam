'''Stuart Henry McPhail Hall''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (1932–2014) was a [[Jamaica]]n-born British [[Marxist]] [[sociologist]], [[culture theory|cultural theorist]], and [[political activist]]. Hall, along with [[Richard Hoggart]] and [[Raymond Williams]], was one of the founding figures of the school of thought that is now known as [[Cultural Studies#Approaches|British Cultural Studies]] or the [[Birmingham School of Cultural Studies]].{{sfn|Procter|2004}}

In the 1950s Hall was a founder of the influential ''[[New Left Review]]''. At Hoggart's invitation, he joined the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at [[Birmingham University]] in 1964. Hall took over from Hoggart as acting director of the centre in 1968, became its director in 1972, and remained there until 1979.<ref name=GuardianObit /> While at the centre, Hall is credited with playing a role in expanding the scope of cultural studies to deal with race and gender, and with helping to incorporate new ideas derived from the work of French theorists like [[Michel Foucault]].{{sfn|Schulman|1993}}

Hall left the centre in 1979 {{citation needed span |date=October 2021 |text=to become a professor of sociology}} at the [[Open University]].{{sfn|Hall|1996|p=501}} He was President of the [[British Sociological Association]] from 1995 to 1997.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} He retired from the Open University in 1997{{sfn|Hall|1997|p=24}} and was a [[professor emeritus]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' called him "one of the country's leading cultural theorists".<ref name=Observer>{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Tim |date=22 September 2007 |title=Cultural Hallmark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety |work=The Observer |location=London |access-date=17 February 2014}}</ref> Hall was also involved in the [[Black Arts Movement]]. Movie directors such as [[John Akomfrah]] and [[Isaac Julien]] also see him as one of their heroes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Julien |first=Isaac |author-link=Isaac Julien |date=12 February 2014 |title=In Memoriam: Stuart Hall |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/memoriam-stuart-hall |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>

Hall was married to [[Catherine Hall]], a feminist professor of modern British history at [[University College London]], with whom he had two children.<ref name=GuardianObit/> After his death, Stuart Hall was described as "one of the most influential intellectuals of the last sixty years".{{sfn|Epstein|2019|p=193}}

==Biography==
Stuart Hall was born on 3 February 1932 in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]], into a middle-class Jamaican family of African, English, Portuguese Jewish, and likely Indian descent.<ref name=Observer /><ref>{{cite news |last=Yardley |first=William |date=18 February 2014 |title=Stuart Hall, Trailblazing British Scholar of Multicultural Influences, Is Dead at 82 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A24}}</ref> He attended [[Jamaica College]], receiving an education modelled after the [[education in Britain|British school system]].{{sfn|Farred|1996|p=30}} In an interview Hall describes himself as a "bright, promising scholar" in these years and his formal education as "a very 'classical' education; very good but in very formal academic terms." With the help of sympathetic teachers, he expanded his education to include "[[T.&nbsp;S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and some of the surrounding literature and modern poetry", as well as "[[Caribbean literature]]".{{sfn|Hall|1996|pp=486–487}} Hall's later works reveal that growing up in the [[Discrimination based on skin color|pigmentocracy]] of the colonial West Indies, where he was of darker skin than much of his family, had a profound effect on his views.{{sfnm |1a1=Farred |1y=1996 |1pp=33–34 |2a1=Lewis |2y=2004}}

In 1951 Hall won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied English and obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree,{{sfn|Levens|1964|p=424}}<ref name=Bomb>{{cite magazine |last=Phillips |first=Caryl |author-link=Caryl Phillips |date=Winter 1997 |title=Stuart Hall |url=http://bombsite.com/issues/58/articles/2030 |magazine=Bomb |issue=58 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113160938/http://bombsite.com/issues/58/articles/2030 |archive-date=13 November 2013 |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> becoming part of the [[Windrush generation]], the first large-scale emigration of [[British West Indies|West Indians]], as that community was then known. He originally intended to do graduate work on the medieval poem ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', reading it through the lens of contemporary literary criticism, but was dissuaded by his language professor, [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Kim |first=Dorothy |date=25 September 2019 |title=The Question of Race in ''Beowulf'' |url=https://daily.jstor.org/the-question-of-race-in-beowulf/ |website=JSTOR Daily |access-date=20 June 2021}}</ref> who told him "in a pained tone that this was not the point of the exercise."{{sfn|Lavezzo|2019|p=1}} He began a PhD on [[Henry James]] at Oxford but, galvanised particularly by the 1956 [[Soviet invasion of Hungary]] (which saw many thousands of members leave the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and look for alternatives to previous orthodoxies) and the [[Suez Crisis]], abandoned this in 1957<ref name=Bomb /> or 1958{{sfn|Farred|1996|p=30}} to focus on his political work. In 1957, he joined the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and it was on a CND march that he met his future wife.<ref>{{cite news |last=Williamson |first=Marcus |author-link=Marcus Williamson |date=11 February 2014 |title=Professor Stuart Hall: Sociologist and Pioneer in the Field of Cultural Studies Whose Work Explored the Concept of Britishness |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-stuart-hall-sociologist-and-pioneer-in-the-field-of-cultural-studies-whose-work-explored-the-concept-of-britishness-9120126.html |work=The Independent |location=London |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> From 1958 to 1960, Hall worked as a teacher in a London [[secondary modern school]]{{sfn|Farred|1996|p=38}} and in adult education, and in 1964 married [[Catherine Hall]], concluding around this time that he was unlikely to return permanently to the Caribbean.<ref name=Bomb />

After working on the ''Universities and Left Review'' during his time at Oxford, Hall joined [[E.&nbsp;P. Thompson]], [[Raymond Williams]] and others to merge it with ''[[The New Reasoner]]'', launching the ''New Left Review'' in 1960 with Hall as the founding editor.{{sfn|Farred|1996|p=30}} In 1958, the same group, with [[Raphael Samuel]], launched the [[Partisan Coffee House]] in [[Soho]] as a meeting place for left-wingers.<ref>Berlin, Mike, [http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/audios.aspx?vid=7563 Bishopsgate Institute Podcast: The Partisan Coffee House: Cultural Politics and the New Left] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113165856/http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/audios.aspx?vid=7563 |date=13 November 2013 }}, 11 June 2009.</ref> Hall left the board of the ''New Left Review'' in 1961<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Derbyshire |first=Jonathan |date=23 August 2012 |title=Stuart Hall: 'We Need to Talk About Englishness' |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2012/08/stuart-hall-we-need-talk-about-englishness |work=New Statesman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515095803/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2012/08/stuart-hall-we-need-talk-about-englishness |archive-date=15 May 2021 |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> or 1962.{{sfn|Lewis|2004}}

Hall's academic career took off in 1964 after he co-wrote with [[Paddy Whannel]] of the [[British Film Institute]] "one of the first books to make the case for the serious study of film as entertainment", ''The Popular Arts''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paterson |first1=Richard |last2=Gerhardt |first2=Paul |date=11 February 2014 |title=Stuart Hall (1932–2014) |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/stuart-hall-1932-2014 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> As a direct result, [[Richard Hoggart]] invited Hall to join the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], initially as a research fellow at Hoggart's own expense.{{sfn|Lewis|2004}} In 1968 Hall became director of the centre. He wrote a number of influential articles in the years that followed, including ''Situating Marx: Evaluations and Departures'' (1972) and ''Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'' (1973). He also contributed to the book ''Policing the Crisis'' (1978) and coedited the influential ''Resistance Through Rituals'' (1975).

Shortly before [[1979 United Kingdom general election|Thatcher became Prime Minister]] in 1979, Hall and [[Maggie Steed]] presented ''It Ain't Half Racist Mum'', an [[Open Door (TV programme)|Open Door]] programme made by the Campaign Against Racism in the Media (CARM) which tackled racial stereotypes and contemporary British attitudes to immigration.{{sfn|Titley|2019|loc=ch.&nbsp;3}} After his appointment as a professor of sociology at the [[Open University]] (OU) that year, Hall published further influential books, including ''The Hard Road to Renewal'' (1988), ''Formations of Modernity'' (1992), ''Questions of Cultural Identity'' (1996) and ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices'' (1997). Through the 1970s and 1980s, Hall was closely associated with the journal ''[[Marxism Today]]'';<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Callinicos |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Callinicos |year=1985 |title=The Politics of ''Marxism Today'' |magazine=International Socialism |issue=29}}</ref> in 1995, he was a founding editor of ''[[Soundings (journal)|Soundings: A Journal of Politics and Culture]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/journals/soundings/issue/1.html |title=''Soundings'' |publisher=Lwbooks.co.uk |access-date=17 February 2014}}</ref>

He spoke internationally on Cultural Studies, including a series of lectures in 1983 at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] that were recorded and would decades later form the basis of the 2016 book ''Cultural Studies 1983: A Theoretical History'' (edited by Jennifer Slack and [[Lawrence Grossberg]]).<ref>{{cite web |last=Hsu |first=Hua |author-link=Hua Hsu |date=17 July 2017 |title=Stuart Hall and the Rise of Cultural Studies |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/stuart-hall-and-the-rise-of-cultural-studies |work=The New Yorker |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>

Hall was the founding chair of [[Iniva]] (Institute of International Visual Arts) and the photography organization [[Autograph ABP]] (the Association of Black Photographers).<ref>{{cite web |last=Loudis |first=Jessica |date=27 September 2017 |title=Why We Need Stuart Hall's Imaginative Left |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/145042/need-stuart-halls-imaginative-left |work=The New Republic |location=New York |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>

Hall retired from the Open University in 1997. He was elected [[fellow of the British Academy]] in 2005 and received the [[European Cultural Foundation]]'s Princess Margriet Award in 2008.<ref name=GuardianObit /> He died on 10 February 2014, from complications following kidney failure, a week after his 82nd birthday.

==Ideas==
Hall's work covers issues of [[Cultural hegemony|hegemony]] and [[cultural studies]], taking a post-[[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] stance. He regards language-use as operating within a framework of [[power (sociology)|power]], [[institution]]s and politics/economics. This view presents people as ''producers'' and ''consumers'' of culture at the same time. (Hegemony, in Gramscian theory, refers to the socio-cultural production of "consent" and "coercion".) For Hall, culture was not something to simply appreciate or study, but a "critical site of social action and intervention, where power relations are both established and potentially unsettled".{{sfn|Procter|2004|p=2}}

Hall became one of the main proponents of [[reception theory]], and developed [[Hall's Theory]] of encoding and decoding. This approach to [[textual analysis]] focuses on the scope for negotiation and opposition on the part of the audience. This means that the audience does not simply passively accept a text—social control. Crime statistics, in Hall's view, are often manipulated for political and economic purposes. Moral panics (e.g. over mugging) could thereby be ignited in order to create public support for the need to "police the crisis". The media play a central role in the "social production of news" in order to reap the rewards of lurid crime stories.{{sfn|Hall|Critcher|Jefferson|Clarke|1978}}

In his essay "Reconstruction Work: Images of Postwar Black Settlement", Hall also interrogates questions of historical memory and visuality in relation to photography as a colonial technology. According to Hall, understanding and writing about the history of black migration and settlement in Britain during the postwar era requires a careful and critical examination of the limited historical archive, and photographic evidence proves itself invaluable. However, photographic images are often perceived as more objective than other representations, which is dangerous. In his view, one must critically examine who produced these images, what purpose they serve, and how they further their agenda (e.g., what has been deliberately included and excluded in the frame). For example, in the context of postwar Britain, photographic images like those displayed in the ''[[Picture Post]]'' article "Thirty Thousand Colour Problems" construct black migration, blackness in Britain, as "the ''problem''".{{sfn|Hall|2006|p=92}} They construct miscegenation as "the centre of the problem", as "the problem of the problem", as "the core issue".{{sfn|Hall|2006|p=92}}

Hall's political influence extended to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], perhaps related to the influential articles he wrote for the CPGB's theoretical journal ''[[Marxism Today]]'' (''MT'') that challenged the left's views of markets and general organisational and political conservatism. This discourse had a profound impact on the Labour Party under both [[Neil Kinnock]] and [[Tony Blair]], although Hall later decried [[New Labour]] as operating on "terrain defined by Thatcherism".<ref name=Telegraphobit>{{cite news |date=11 February 2014 |title=Stuart Hall |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10629087/Stuart-Hall-obituary.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |page=25}}</ref>

===Encoding and decoding model===
{{Main|Reception theory}}
Hall presented his encoding and decoding philosophy in various publications and at several oral events across his career. The first was in "[[Encoding/Decoding model of communication|Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse]]" (1973), a paper he wrote for the [[Council of Europe]] Colloquy on "Training in the Critical Readings of Television Language" organised by the Council and the Centre for Mass Communication Research at the [[University of Leicester]]. It was produced for students at the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]], which Paddy Scannell explains: "largely accounts for the provisional feel of the text and its 'incompleteness'".{{sfn|Scannell|2007|p=211}} In 1974 the paper was presented at a symposium on Broadcasters and the Audience in [[Venice]]. Hall also presented his encoding and decoding model in "Encoding/Decoding" in ''Culture, Media, Language'' in 1980. The time difference between Hall's first publication on encoding and decoding in 1973 and his 1980 publication is highlighted by several critics. Of particular note is Hall's transition from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies to the [[Open University]].{{sfn|Scannell|2007|p=211}}

Hall had a major influence on cultural studies, and many of the terms his texts set forth continue to be used in the field. His 1973 text is viewed as a turning point in Hall's research toward structuralism and provides insight into some of the main theoretical developments he explored at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies.

Hall takes a [[semiotic]] approach and builds on the work of [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Umberto Eco]].{{sfn|Scannell|2007|p=209}} The essay takes up and challenges longheld assumptions about how media messages are produced, circulated and consumed, proposing a new theory of communication.{{sfn|Procter|2004|pp=59–61}} "The 'object' of production practices and structures in television is the production of a ''message'': that is, a sign-vehicle or rather sign-vehicles of a specific kind organized, like any other form of communication or language, through the operation of codes, within the syntagmatic chains of a discourse."{{sfn|Hall|1973|pp=1–2}}

According to Hall, a message "must be perceived as meaningful discourse and meaningfully de-coded" before it has an "effect", a "use", or satisfies a "need".{{sfn|Hall|1973|p=3}} There are four codes of the [[encoding/decoding model of communication]]. The first way of encoding is the dominant (i.e. hegemonic) code. This is the code the encoder expects the decoder to recognize and decode. "When the viewer takes the connoted meaning&nbsp;... full and straight&nbsp;... and decodes the message in terms of the reference-code in which it has been coded,&nbsp;... [it operates] inside the dominant code."{{sfn|Hall|1973|p=16}} The second way of encoding is the professional code. It operates in tandem with the dominant code. "It serves to reproduce the dominant definitions precisely by bracketing the hegemonic quality, and operating with professional codings which relate to such questions as visual quality, news and presentational values, televisual quality, 'professionalism' etc."{{sfn|Hall|1973|p=16}} The third way of encoding is the negotiated code. "It acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations, while, at a more restricted, situational level, it makes its own ground-rules, it operates with 'exceptions' to the rule."{{sfn|Hall|1973|p=17}} The fourth way of encoding is the oppositional code, also known as the globally contrary code. "It is possible for a viewer perfectly to understand both the literal and connotative inflection given to an event, but to determine to decode the message in a globally contrary way."{{sfn|Hall|1973|p=18}} "Before this message can have an 'effect' (however defined), or satisfy a 'need' or be put to a 'use', it must first be perceived as a meaningful discourse and meaningfully de-coded."{{sfn|Hall|1973|p=3}}

Hall challenged all four components of the mass communications model. He argues that (i) meaning is not simply fixed or determined by the sender; (ii) the message is never transparent; and (iii) the audience is not a passive recipient of meaning.{{sfn|Procter|2004|pp=59–61}} For example, a documentary film on asylum seekers that aims to provide a sympathetic account of their plight does not guarantee that audiences will feel sympathetic. Despite being realistic and recounting facts, the documentary must still communicate through a sign system (the aural-visual signs of TV) that simultaneously distorts the producers' intentions and evokes contradictory feelings in the audience.{{sfn|Procter|2004|pp=59–61}}

Distortion is built into the system, rather than being a "failure" of the producer or viewer. There is a "lack of fit", Hall argues, "between the two sides in the communicative exchange"—that is, between the moment of the production of the message ("encoding") and the moment of its reception ("decoding").{{sfn|Procter|2004|pp=59–61}}
In "Encoding/decoding", Hall suggests media messages accrue common-sense status in part through their performative nature. Through the repeated performance, staging or telling of the narrative of "[[9/11]]" (as an example; there are others like it), a culturally specific interpretation becomes not only plausible and universal but elevated to "common sense".{{sfn|Procter|2004|pp=59–61}}

===Views on cultural identity and the African diaspora===

In his influential 1996 essay "Cultural Identity and Diaspora", Hall presents two different definitions of cultural identity.

In the first definition, cultural identity is "a sort of collective 'one true self'&nbsp;... which many people with a shared history and ancestry hold in common."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=223}} In this view, cultural identity provides a "stable, unchanging and continuous frame of reference and meaning" through the ebb and flow of historical change.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=223}} This allows the tracing back the origins of descendants and reflecting on the historical experiences of ancestors as a shared truth.{{sfn|Hall|1990}} Therefore, blacks living in the diaspora need only "unearth" their African past to discover their true cultural identity.{{sfn|Hall|1990}} While Hall appreciates the good effects this first view of cultural identity has had in the postcolonial world, he proposes a second definition of cultural identity that he views as superior.

Hall's second definition of cultural identity "recognises that, as well as the many points of similarity, there are also critical points of deep and significant ''difference'' which constitute 'what we really are'; or rather&nbsp;– since history has intervened&nbsp;– 'what we have become'."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=225}} In this view, cultural identity is not a fixed essence rooted in the past. Instead, cultural identities "undergo constant transformation" throughout history as they are "subject to the continuous 'play' of history, culture, and power".{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=225}} Thus Hall defines cultural identities as "the names we give to the different ways we are positioned by, and position ourselves within, the narratives of the past."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=225}} This view of cultural identity was more challenging than the previous due to its dive into deep differences, but nonetheless it showed the mixture of the African diaspora. In other words, for Hall cultural identity is "not an essence but a ''positioning''".{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=226}}

====Presences====

Hall describes Caribbean identity in terms of three distinct "presences": the African, the European, and the American.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=230}} Taking the terms from [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Léopold Senghor]], he describes the three presences: "Présence Africaine", "Présence
Européenne", and "Présence Americaine".{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=230}} "Présence Africaine" is the "unspeakable 'presence' in Caribbean culture".{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=230}} According to Hall, the African presence, though repressed by slavery and colonialism, is in fact hiding in plain sight in every aspect of Caribbean society and culture, including language, religion, the arts, and music. For many black people living in the diaspora, Africa becomes an "[[imagined community]]" to which they feel a sense of belonging.{{sfn|Hall|1990}} But, Hall points out, there is no going back to the Africa that existed before slavery, because Africa too has changed. Secondly, Hall describes the European presence in Caribbean cultural identity as the legacy of colonialism, racism, power and exclusion. Unlike the "Présence Africaine", the European presence is not unspoken even though many would like to be separated from the history of the oppressor. But Hall argues that Caribbeans and diasporic peoples must acknowledge how the European presence has also become an inextricable part of their own identities.{{sfn|Hall|1990}} Lastly, Hall describes the American presence as the "ground, place, territory" where people and cultures from around the world collided.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=234}} It is, as Hall puts it, "where the fateful/fatal encounter was staged between Africa and the West", and also where the displacement of the natives occurred.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=234}}

====Diasporic identity====

Because diasporic cultural identity in the Caribbean and throughout the world is a mixture of all these different presences, Hall advocated a "conception of 'identity' which lives with and through, not despite, difference; by ''hybridity''".{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=235}} According to Hall, black people living in diaspora are constantly reinventing themselves and their identities by mixing, hybridizing, and "creolizing" influences from Africa, Europe, and the rest of the world in their everyday lives and cultural practices.{{sfn|Hall|1990|pp=233–236}}{{page range too broad|date=October 2021}} Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all cultural identity for diasporic people, but rather a multiplicity of different cultural identities that share both important similarities and important differences, all of which should be respected.{{sfn|Hall|1990}}

====Difference and differance====

In "Cultural Identity and Diaspora", Hall sheds light on the topic of difference within black identity. He first acknowledges the oneness in the black diaspora and how this unity is at the core of blackness and the black experience. He expresses how this has a unifying effect on the diaspora, giving way to movements such as negritude and the pan-African political project. Hall also acknowledges the deep rooted "difference" within the diaspora as well. This difference was created by destructive nature of the transatlantic slave trade and the resulting generations of slavery. He describes this difference as what constitutes "what we really are", or the true nature of the diaspora.{{sfn|Hall|1990}} The duality of such an identity, that expresses deep unity but clear uniqueness and internal distinctness provokes a question out of Hall: "How, then, to describe this play of 'difference' within identity?"{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=228}} Hall's answer is 'differance'. The use of the 'a' in the word unsettles us from our initial and common interpretation of it, and was originally introduced by [[Jacques Derrida]]. This modification of the word difference conveys the separation between spatial and temporal difference, and more adequately encapsulates the nuances of the diaspora.

* The [[Stuart Hall Library]], [[Iniva]]'s reference library at [[Rivington Place]] in [[Shoreditch]], London, founded in 2007, is named after Stuart Hall, who was the chair of the board of Iniva for many years.
* In November 2014 a week-long celebration of Stuart Hall's achievements was held at the [[University of London]]'s [[Goldsmiths College]], where on 28 November the new Academic Building was renamed in his honour, as the Professor Stuart Hall building (PSH).<ref>{{cite web |date=11 December 2014 |title=Goldsmiths Renames Academic Building After Professor Stuart Hall |url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/news/professor-stuart-hall-roundup/ |location=London |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 December 2014 |title=Goldsmiths Honour Stuart Hall by Naming Building After Him |url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/goldsmiths-honour-stuart-hall-naming-building-after-him |work=The Voice |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184405/http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/goldsmiths-honour-stuart-hall-naming-building-after-him |archive-date=8 November 2018 |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>

===Film===
Hall was a presenter of a seven-part television series entitled ''Redemption Song'' — made by Barraclough Carey Productions, and transmitted on [[BBC2]], between 30 June and 12 August 1991 — in which he examined the elements that make up the Caribbean, looking at the turbulent history of the islands and interviewing people who live there today.<ref>[http://bufvc.ac.uk/dvdfind/index.php/title/18006 "Redemption Song (7 Parts)"], BUFVC.</ref> The series episodes were as follows:
* "Shades of Freedom"  (11/08/1991)
* "Following Fidel"  (04/08/1991)
* "Worlds Apart"  (28 July 1991)
* "La Grande Illusion"  (21 July 1991)
* "Paradise Lost"  (14 July 1991)
* "Out of Africa"  (7 July 1991)
* "Iron in the Soul"  (30 June 1991)

Hall's lectures have been turned into several videos distributed by the Media Education Foundation:
* [http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=407 ''Race, the Floating Signifier''] (1997).
* [http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=409 ''Representation & the Media''] (1997).
* [http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=414 ''The Origins of Cultural Studies''] (2006).

[[Mike Dibb]] produced a film based on a long interview between journalist [[Maya Jaggi]] and Stuart Hall called ''Personally Speaking'' (2009).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3664512/ "Personally Speaking: A Long Conversation with Stuart Hall (2009)"], IMDb.</ref><ref>[http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=416%20 ''Personally Speaking'']. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404064706/http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=416%20 |date=4 April 2015 }} (2009).</ref>

Hall is the subject of two films directed by [[John Akomfrah]], entitled ''[[The Unfinished Conversation]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Stuart Hall Project]]'' (2013). The first film was shown (26 October 2013 – 23 March 2014) at [[Tate Britain]], [[Millbank]], London,<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/display/bp-spotlight-john-akomfrah-unfinished-conversation "BP Spotlight: John Akomfrah, The Unfinished Conversation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024142414/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/display/bp-spotlight-john-akomfrah-unfinished-conversation |date=24 October 2014 }}, Tate Britain.</ref> while the second is now available on DVD.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hudson |first=Mark |date=15 October 2012 |title=A Beautiful Paean to Identity |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9609361/The-Unfinished-Conversation-by-John-Akomfrah-a-beautiful-paean-to-identity.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |page=30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018014717/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9609361/The-Unfinished-Conversation-by-John-Akomfrah-a-beautiful-paean-to-identity.html |archive-date=18 October 2012 |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>

''The Stuart Hall Project'' was composed of clips drawn from more than 100 hours of archival footage of Hall, woven together over the music of jazz artist [[Miles Davis]], who was an inspiration to both Hall and Akomfrah.<ref>Clark, Ashley, [https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/film-week-stuart-hall-project "Film of the Week: The Stuart Hall Project"], ''Sight & Sound'', British Film Institute, 29 September 2014; updated 31 March 2015.</ref>

The film's structure is composed of multiple strands. There is a chronological grounding in historical events, such as the [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]], along with reflections by Hall on his experiences as an immigrant from the Caribbean to Britain. Another historical event vital to the film was the [[1958 Notting Hill race riots]] occasioned by the murder of a Black British man; these protests showed the presence of a black community within England. When discussing the Caribbean, Hall discusses the idea of hybridity and he states that the Caribbean is the home of hybridity. There are also voiceovers and interviews offered without a specific temporal grounding in the film that nonetheless give the viewer greater insights into Hall and his philosophy. Along with the voiceovers and interviews, embedded in the film are also Hall's personal achievements; this is extremely rare, as there are no traditional archives of those Caribbean peoples moulded by the [[Middle Passage]] experience.

The film can be viewed as a more pointedly focused take on the [[Windrush generation]], those who migrated from the Caribbean to Britain in the years immediately following the [[World War II]]. Hall, himself a member of this generation, focused on the [[racial discrimination]] faced by the Windrush generation, contrasting the idealized perceptions among West Indian immigrants of Britain versus the harsher reality they encountered when arriving in the "mother country".<ref>{{cite news |last=Jeffries |first=Stuart |date=10 February 2014 |title=Stuart Hall's Cultural Legacy: Britain Under the Microscope |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/10/stuart-hall-cultural-legacy-britain-godfather-multiculturalism |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref>

A central theme in the film is diasporic belonging. Hall confronted his own identity within both British and Caribbean communities, and at one point in the film he remarks: "Britain is my home, but I am not English."

IMDb summarises the film as "a roller coaster ride through the upheavals, struggles and turning points that made the 20th century the century of campaigning, and of global political and cultural change."<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2578290/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl "The Stuart Hall Project (2013)"], IMDb. Retrieved 24 November 2014.</ref>

In August 2012, Professor [[Sut Jhally]] conducted an interview with Hall that touched on a number of themes and issues in cultural studies.<ref>{{cite web|first=Sut |last=Jhally |url=https://vimeo.com/53879491 |title=Stuart Hall Interviewed By Sut Jhally |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=30 August 2012 |access-date=17 February 2014}}</ref>
