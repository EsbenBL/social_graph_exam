'''Moisey Yakovlevich Ostrogorsky''' (also '''Moisei Ostrogorsky'''; {{lang-ru|Моисей Яковлевич Острогорский|Moisey Yakovlevich Ostrogorskiy}}; {{lang-be|Майсей Якаўлевiч Aстрaгорскi|Majsiej Jakaŭlievič Astrahorski}}; 1854 – 10 February 1921) was a politician, political scientist, historian, jurist and [[sociologist]]. Along with [[Max Weber]] and [[Robert Michels]], he is considered one of the founders of [[political sociology]], especially in the field of theories about [[party system]]s and political parties.<ref>Lipset (1982)</ref>  Ostrogorski noted that loyalty to parties is often comparable to loyalty to one's religion. He was a member of the First [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]] representing the [[Hrodna]] province in 1906-1907.

==Biography==
Moisey Ostrogorsky was born in 1854 in the [[Grodno Governorate|Grodno province]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now in the [[Belarus]]), where he grew up. He studied law at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and worked for the Russian justice ministry.

He represented [[Grodno Governorate|Grodno province]] in the First State Duma (Parliament of the Russian Empire).

In the 1880s, he went to Paris and studied at the [[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]], where he wrote his dissertation ''Les origines du suffrage universel'' (The origins of universal suffrage) (1885). Whilst in France, Ostrogorski imbibed French political thought, which was distrustful of an all-powerful state, from thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Tocqueville, Saint Simon and Proudhon.<ref>(Lipset, S.M. (1960). Political Man. Garden City, New York. p22)</ref>

He traveled to the United States and Great Britain. In 1902, he published ''Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties''<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/12/27/118489979.pdf ''"The Party System: Ostrogorski's Work on Democracy and Political Organization,"''] The New York Times, December 27, 1902.</ref> (originally in French), which compared the political system of the two nations. After returning to Russia in 1906, he became the [[Duma]] representative for the Hrodna province as a member of the liberal [[Constitutional Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Moisey Ostrogorsky |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moisey-Yakovlevich-Ostrogorsky |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref> He left politics after the Duma was dissolved during the Russian Revolution.

As a political thinker, he was recognized in the West before he was in Russia. Ostrogorski has been influential on the political thought of the 20th century.

After leaving politics, he taught at the Psychoneurological Institute in [[St. Petersburg]].

He died on 10 February 1921 in St. Petersburg, now renamed [[Petrograd]]. 

===Work on political science===
Ostrogorski's main work is ''La democratie et l'organisation des partis politiques''.<ref>(Paris, 1903; the English edition, London, 1903; vol, 2 appeared as ''Democracy and the Party System in the United States'', New York, 1910; the new advanced edition of all works under the title ''La democratie et les partis politiques'', "Democracy and Political Parties", Paris, 1912)</ref>  He noted behavioural determinism in organisational structure: "As soon as a party, even if created for the noblest object perpetuates itself, it tends to degeneration", which influenced "the later researches of Max Weber, Robert Michels, and Andre Siegfried".<ref>(Scheider, Theodor. (1962). The State and Society in Modern Times. London, England: Thomas Nelson and Sons, p84.) Ostrogorski is one of the few scholars referenced by Max Weber in his classic lecture "Politics as Vocation."</ref>

Ostrogorski is also the author of a book that is about the equality of the sexes: ''La Femme au point de vue du droit public''.<ref>(Paris, 1892, 2 English edition, London, 1908; German translation, Leipzig, 1897, the Polish translation, Warsaw, 1898)</ref>

==Legacy==
Ostrogorsky unwittingly donated his surname to the [[Ostrogorski Centre]], which is a "Western-style" political lobby group.<ref name="oc">{{cite news |title=What is the Ostrogorski Centre? |url=http://ostrogorski.org/en/about |accessdate=20 March 2020 |publisher=Ostrogorski Centre}}</ref> Notable amongst its sponsors are  [[The Guardian]], a leftist charity which publishes a UK newspaper, and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], as well as various opaque organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Partners |url=http://ostrogorski.org/be/node/8 |publisher=Ostrogorski Centre |accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>
