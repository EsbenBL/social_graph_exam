The [[U.S. Constitution]] provides for a [[federal district]] under the [[District of Columbia home rule|exclusive jurisdiction]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]]; the district is therefore not a part of any [[U.S. state]] (nor is it one itself). The signing of the [[Residence Act]] on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a [[capital district]] located along the Potomac River near the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the national capital, and Congress held its first session there in 1800. In 1801, the territory, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia (including the settlements of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]), officially became recognized as the federal district. In 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned the land originally ceded by Virginia]], including the city of Alexandria; in 1871, it created a [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|single municipal government]] for the remaining portion of the district. There have been [[Statehood movement in the District of Columbia|efforts]] to make the city into a state since the 1880s, a movement that has gained momentum in recent years, and a [[DC Admission Act|statehood bill]] passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Emily|date=2021-04-22|title=House Approves D.C.

The city is divided into [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrants]] centered on the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], and there are as many as 131 [[Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.|neighborhoods]]. According to the [[2020 United States census|2020 Census]], it has a population of 689,545,<ref name="QuickFacts" /> which makes it the [[List of United States cities by population|20th-most populous city in the U.S.]] and gives it a population larger than that of two U.S. states: Wyoming and Vermont.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Journal|first=Matt Vasilogambros, National|date=2013-12-30|title=D.C.

The three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the district: Congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (judicial). Washington is home to many national [[List of museums in Washington, D.C.|monuments and museums]], primarily situated on or around the [[National Mall]]. The city hosts [[List of diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C.|177 foreign embassies]] as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profits, lobbying groups, and professional associations, including the [[World Bank Group]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[AARP]], the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Human Rights Campaign]], the [[International Finance Corporation]], and the [[American Red Cross]].

[[Mayor of the District of Columbia|A locally elected mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|a 13-member council]] have governed the district since 1973. Congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws. D.C. residents elect a [[District of Columbia voting rights|non-voting]], at-large [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|congressional delegate]] to the House of Representatives, but the district has no representation in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. District voters choose three [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] in accordance with the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1961.

Various [[tribe]]s of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataway people]] (also known as the Conoy) inhabited the lands around the [[Potomac River]] when Europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century. One group known as the [[Nacotchtank]] (also called the Nacostines by [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionaries]]) maintained settlements around the [[Anacostia River]] within the present-day District of Columbia. Conflicts with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near [[Point of Rocks, Maryland]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaJrnQEACAAJ |title=Ancient Washington: American Indian Cultures of the Potomac Valley |last1=Humphrey |first1=Robert Lee |last2=Chambers |first2=Mary Elizabeth |date=1977 |publisher=George Washington University |isbn=9781888028041 |access-date=March 6, 2018}}</ref>

In his [[Federalist No. 43]], published January 23, 1788, [[James Madison]] argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/fedpapers/fed_43.html |title=The Federalist No. 43 |access-date=September 5, 2011 |last=Madison |first=James |work=The Independent Journal |publisher=Library of Congress |archive-date=August 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/619ldujGz?url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/fedpapers/fed_43.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers had besieged Congress while its members were meeting in [[Philadelphia]].

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article One, Section Eight]], of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] permits the establishment of a "District (not exceeding ten&nbsp;miles&nbsp;square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html |title=Constitution of the United States |access-date=July 22, 2008 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}</ref> However, the Constitution does not specify a location for the capital.

===Foundation===
On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]], which approved the creation of a national capital on the [[Potomac River]]. The exact location was to be selected by President [[George Washington]], who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring {{convert|10|mi|km}} on each side, totaling {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|0}}.<ref name=Crew89>{{cite book |last1=Crew |first1=Harvey W. |last2=Webb |first2=William Bensing |last3=Wooldridge |first3=John |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C. |publisher=United Brethren Publishing House |year=1892 |location=Dayton, OH |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5Q81AAAAIAAJ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5Q81AAAAIAAJ/page/n96 89]–92 }}</ref>{{efn|The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River.

In the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.<ref name=richards>{{cite journal|last=Richards |first=Mark David |date=Spring–Summer 2004 |title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004 |journal=Washington History |pages=54–82 |url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf |access-date=January 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf |archive-date=January 18, 2009 }}</ref> The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American [[History of slavery|slave trade]], and pro-slavery residents feared that [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] in Congress would [[Slavery in the United States|end slavery]] in the district, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district, through a process known as [[District of Columbia retrocession|retrocession]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Greeley |first=Horace |title=The American Conflict: A History of the Great Rebellion in the United States |publisher=G. & C.W.

The [[Virginia General Assembly]] voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that Virginia had ceded. Therefore, the district's area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.<ref name=richards /> Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Compromise1850.html |title=Compromise of 1850 |access-date=July 24, 2008 |date=September 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref>

Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|Organic Act of 1871]], which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, abolished the [[Washington County, D.C.|Washington County]], and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite web| title=An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=0454 |work=Statutes at Large, 41st Congress, 3rd Session |access-date=July 10, 2011 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref> From this point, the name "Washington", initially only refers to "the City of Washington, DC", became synonymous with "District of Columbia".

After the reorganization, President Grant appointed [[Alexander Robey Shepherd]] to the position of Governor of the District of Columbia in 1873.

By the early 20th century, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.<ref name=ramroth /> What became known as the [[McMillan Plan]] was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system.

{{See also|District of Columbia home rule|List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|List of District of Columbia symbols|United States presidential elections in Washington, D.C.}}

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution]] grants the [[United States Congress]] "exclusive jurisdiction" over the city. The district did not have an elected local government until the passage of the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|1973 Home Rule Act]]. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|elected mayor]] and the thirteen-member [[Council of the District of Columbia]]. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/pages/dc-home-rule |title=DC Home Rule |publisher=Council of the District of Columbia |access-date=December 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117031522/http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/pages/dc-home-rule |archive-date=November 17, 2011 }}</ref>

Each of the city's eight [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] elects a single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the district as a whole. The council chair is also elected at-large.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcboee.org/candidate_info/elected_officials/elected.asp |title=Current Elected Officials in DC |access-date=January 11, 2012 |publisher=D.C.

Washington, D.C., observes all [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holidays]] and also celebrates [[Emancipation Day]] on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the district.<ref name=emancipation /> The [[flag of Washington, D.C.]], was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family [[coat of arms]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jason|title=Washington, D.C.|year=2003|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7368-2204-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/washingtondc0000glas/page/55 55]|url=https://archive.org/details/washingtondc0000glas|url-access=registration}}</ref>

Washington, D.C., is overwhelmingly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], having voted for the Democratic candidate solidly since it was granted electoral votes in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Each [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate was voted down in favor of the Democratic candidate by a margin of at least 56 percentage points each time; the closest, albeit very large, margin between the two parties in a presidential election was in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], when [[Richard Nixon]] secured 21.56% of the vote to [[George McGovern]]'s 78.10%. Since then, the Republican candidate has never received more than 20 percent of the vote. Every Democrat since [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] has received over 90% of the vote.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Additionally, since 2016, the city's residential voting population has become almost unanimously Democratic, more so than it has ever been. Since [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], no Democrat has received less than 93% of the major-party vote in the federal district, a level of support that has not been crossed districtwide before that election.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

[[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|Same-sex marriage]] has been legal in the district since 2010, and [[conversion therapy]] has been prohibited since 2015. [[Assisted suicide in the United States#District of Columbia|Assisted suicide]] is also permitted in the district, with a bill legalizing the practice being introduced in 2015, signed by mayor [[Muriel Bowser]] in 2016, and going into effect in 2017, making Washington, D.C., the seventh jurisdiction in the United States to have legalized assisted suicide, along with [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Montana]] and [[Vermont]].{{cn|date=November 2021}}

The idiom [[Inside the Beltway]] is an occasional reference used by media to describe political issues inside of Washington, D.C., by way of geographical demarcation regarding the region inner to the Capital's Beltway, [[Capital Beltway|Interstate 495]], the city's highway loop (beltway) constructed in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

===Budgetary issues===
[[File:John_A._Wilson_Building_west_side.jpg|thumb|The [[John A. Wilson Building]] houses the offices of the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|mayor of Washington]] and the [[Council of the District of Columbia]].]]
The mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The [[Government Accountability Office]] and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470&nbsp;million and over $1&nbsp;billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as [[Medicaid]] and the operation of the [[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997|local justice system]]; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.<ref name=DCAppleseed>{{cite web|title=Building the Best Capital City in the World |url=http://www.dcappleseed.org/library/DC%20Appleseed%20Report.FINAL.pdf |publisher=DC Appleseed |access-date=February 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511193725/http://www.dcappleseed.org/library/DC%20Appleseed%20Report.FINAL.pdf |archive-date=May 11, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=GAO>{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Structural Imbalance and Management Issues|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03666.pdf|publisher=Government Accountability Office|date=May 2003|access-date=February 5, 2011}}</ref>

The district has a federally funded "Emergency Planning and Security Fund" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. During the Trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. Trump's January 2017 inauguration cost the city $27&nbsp;million; of that, $7&nbsp;million was never repaid to the fund.

The district is not a state and therefore has no voting representation in Congress. D.C. residents elect a [[Non-voting members of the United States House of representatives|non-voting delegate]] to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] ([[District of Columbia's At-large congressional district|D.C. At-Large]]), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the [[Floor (legislative)|House floor]]. The district has no official representation in the [[United States Senate]]. Neither chamber seats the district's elected [[Shadow congressperson|"shadow" representative or senators]]. Unlike residents of [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] such as [[Puerto Rico]] or [[Guam]], which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all federal taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Individuals-Living-or-Working-in-U.S.-Possessions |title=Individuals Living or Working in U.S. Possessions |access-date=December 2, 2012 |publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202114846/http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Individuals-Living-or-Working-in-U.S.-Possessions |archive-date=December 2, 2012  }}</ref> In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7&nbsp;billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest [[Federal tax revenue by state|federal taxes per capita]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/12db05co.xls |title=Internal Revenue Gross Collections, by Type of Tax and State, Fiscal Year 2012 |access-date=September 5, 2013 |format=XLS |publisher=Internal Revenue Service }}</ref>

Several approaches to resolving these concerns have been suggested over the years:
* [[D.C. statehood movement|District of Columbia Statehood]]: Almost all the District of Columbia would become the [[51st state|51st State]] as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. The much-reduced District of Columbia would run from Capitol Hill west to the Potomac, including the White House and many federal buildings; no one resides permanently in this federal enclave.{{cn|date=November 2021}}
* [[District of Columbia retrocession#Proposed Maryland retrocession|District of Columbia Retrocession to Maryland]]: As [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] in 1846 was retroceded to [[State of Virginia|Virginia]], proponents believe the rest of the District of Columbia except for a small strip of land around the Capitol and the White House (the federal enclave) would be given back to [[State of Maryland|Maryland]], allowing for DC residents to become Maryland residents as they were before the [[Residence Act]] of 1790.{{cn|date=November 2021}}
* [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]: this option would allow DC residents to vote in Maryland or Virginia for their congressional representatives, with the District of Columbia remaining an independent entity. This was in effect from 1790 to 1801, before the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801|Organic Act of 1801]].{{cn|date=November 2021}}

Opponents of D.C. voting rights propose that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.<ref>{{cite news|first=John |last=Fortier |title=The D.C. colony |date=May 17, 2006 |url=http://thehill.com/component/content/article/275-john-fortier/4948-the-dc-colony |work=The Hill |access-date=October 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112065946/http://thehill.com/component/content/article/275-john-fortier/4948-the-dc-colony |archive-date=November 12, 2010 }}</ref>
