'''Montagu Collet Norman, 1st Baron Norman''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (6 September 1871 – 4 February 1950) was an English [[banker]], best known for his role as the [[Governor of the Bank of England]] from 1920 to 1944.

Norman led the bank during the toughest period in modern British economic history and was noted for his somewhat raffish character and arty appearance. A very influential figure, Norman, according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', was referred to as "the currency dictator of Europe", a fact which he himself admitted to, before the Court of the Bank on 21 March 1930.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tragedy & Hope|last=Quigley|first=Carroll|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1966|isbn=0-945001-10-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyhopehisto00quig/page/62 62]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyhopehisto00quig/page/62}}</ref> The economist and Court member, [[John Maynard Keynes]], said of him: "Montagu Norman, always absolutely charming, always absolutely wrong"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kynaston|first=David|title=City of London, volume 3: Illusions of Gold 1914-1945|publisher=Chatto and Windus|year=1999|pages=483}}</ref>.

==Early life and military service==
Norman was the elder son of [[Frederick Norman]] and Lina Susan Penelope Collet, a daughter of [[Mark Wilks Collet|Sir Mark Wilks Collet, 1st Baronet]], himself a [[Bank of England]] Governor. The [[Norman family]] was well known in banking. Montagu's brother [[Ronald Collet Norman]] and his nephew [[Mark Norman (banker)|Mark Norman]] became leading bankers. Montagu's great-nephew David Norman has also led a successful [[City of London|City]] career and is a noted benefactor of the arts. Montagu Norman was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and spent one year at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=NRMN889MC|name=Norman, Montagu Collet}}</ref> He also joined the 4th Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire militia in 1894 and served in the [[Second Boer War]]. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1901.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27359 |page=6326 |date=27 September 1901 }}</ref>

==Merchant banking==
After spending time in Europe, he joined [[Martins Bank]], where his father was a partner, in 1892, [[Brown, Shipley & Co.]], where his maternal grandfather was a partner, in 1894, and [[Brown Bros. & Co.]] of New York, in 1895. He became a partner in Brown Shipley in 1900 before leaving for [[South Africa]], and retired from them in 1915.

==Bank of England==
He became a director of the [[Bank of England]] in 1907 and during [[World War I]] he was a financial advisor to government departments. He was appointed [[Deputy Governor of the Bank of England|Deputy Governor]] in 1917 and he became [[Governor of the Bank of England|Governor]] in 1920. Under Norman, the bank underwent significant change. He was a supporter of the return to the [[gold standard]], which he called "knaveproof",<ref>Nicholas Crafts, “[https://voxeu.org/article/walking-wounded-british-economy-aftermath-world-war-i Walking wounded: The British economy in the aftermath of World War I]” dated 27 August 2014 at voxeu.org</ref> in 1925, despite the opposition of economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|title=John Maynard Keynes : the economist as saviour 1920-1937 : a biography.|publisher=Macmillan|year=1992|isbn=0-333-37138-0}}</ref>. In 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, Norman commented, "Unless dramatic measures are taken to save it, the capitalist system throughout the civilized world will be wrecked within a year"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Howe|first=Quincy|title=World Diary: 1929-34|year=1934|location=New York|pages=111}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Verfasser.|first=Ahamed, Liaquat|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1179294023|title=Lords of finance : 1929, the Great Depression, and the bankers who broke the world|date=19 March 2020|isbn=978-1-84794-300-2|pages=5|oclc=1179294023}}</ref>; he borrowed $250 million in an attempt to stave off speculative attacks upon the pound<ref>{{Cite book|last=Verfasser.|first=Ahamed, Liaquat|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1179294023|title=Lords of finance : 1929, the Great Depression, and the bankers who broke the world|date=19 March 2020|isbn=978-1-84794-300-2|pages=424|oclc=1179294023}}</ref>. Later that year, however, the United Kingdom was forced to permanently abandon the gold standard after the publication of the May Report on the UK's budget deficit provoked a further financial crisis<ref>{{Cite book|last=Verfasser.|first=Ahamed, Liaquat|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1179294023|title=Lords of finance : 1929, the Great Depression, and the bankers who broke the world|date=19 March 2020|isbn=978-1-84794-300-2|pages=425–430|oclc=1179294023}}</ref>.

Norman was a close friend of the German Central Bank President [[Hjalmar Schacht]], who served in Hitler's government as President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics between 1934 and 1937. Norman was also so close to the Schacht family that he was godfather to one of Schacht's grandchildren.<ref>Forbes, Neil (2000), "Doing Business with the Nazis"</ref> Both were members of the [[Anglo-German Fellowship]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]].

While in the past Norman's role in the transferring of Czech gold to the Nazi regime in March 1939 was uncertain, careful investigation by historian David Blaazer into the Bank of England's internal memos has established that Norman knowingly authorized the transfer of Czech gold from [[Czechoslovakia]]'s No. 2 account with the [[Bank for International Settlements]] to the No. 17 account, which Norman was aware was managed by the German [[Reichsbank]]. Within ten days the money had been transferred to other accounts. In the fall of 1939, two months after the outbreak of World War II, Norman again supported transfers of Czech gold to Hitler's Germany. On this occasion His Majesty's Government intervened to block Norman's initiative.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blaazer |first=David |year=2005 |title=Finance and the End of Appeasement: The Bank of England, the National Government and the Czech Gold |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=25–39 |doi=10.1177/0022009405049264|s2cid=197807556 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ab87009811f3fefe0e8e4f3d6248e59ee210aaf5 }}</ref> He retired from the bank in 1944.

==Honours==
Following his retirement, he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Norman''', of St Clere in the County of Kent, on 13 October 1944.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36746 |page=4698 |date=13 October 1944 }}</ref> In addition to receiving the Distinguished Service Order, Norman was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1923<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32840 |page=4605 |date=29 June 1923 }}</ref> and was created a Grand Officer of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33260 |page=1960 |date=25 March 1927 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:St Clere, Kent-geograph-5070081-by-Oast-House-Archive.jpg|thumb|St Clere, near Sevenoaks, Kent]]
On 2 November 1933, Norman married [[Priscilla Reyntiens|Priscilla Cecilia Maria Reyntiens]], London councillor and granddaughter of [[Montagu Bertie, 7th Earl of Abingdon]]. He gained two stepsons from this marriage; [[Simon Towneley|Sir Simon Towneley]] and [[Peregrine Worsthorne|Sir Peregrine Worsthorne]].  Lord Norman & Cecilia had no children and on his death he passed the bulk of his estate to his nephew, Brigadier Hugh Norman.

In 1944, while visiting his brother on his country estate in Hertfordshire, Norman went for a walk and tripped over, causing an injury from which he never recovered.  There is an amusing anecdote contained in Bill Bryson's book, that he tripped over a cow, but it is unclear where this anecdote came from as it is not known within his family.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |year=2013 |title=One Summer |pages=495 |location=London |publisher=Transworld Publishers |isbn=9780385608282 }}</ref>

From 1904, Norman's London home was Thorpe Lodge, Airlie Gardens off [[Campden Hill]] in Kensington, which had been built c1816. Norman worked with [[Walter Shirley, 11th Earl Ferrers|Walter Knight Shirley]] and [[Ernest Gimson]] to modernise the house and redecorate it in the [[Arts and Crafts]] style. Lord Norman died at Thorpe Lodge in 1950 following a [[stroke]]. The house later became part of [[Holland Park School]].<ref name="british-history.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol37/pp58-76|title=The Phillimore estate - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>

During his married life, he lived at the Manor of [[St Clere, Kent|St Clere]] in [[Kemsing]], Kent, which he acquired from his uncle in 1935.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cameron |first=Roderick |year=1981 |title=Great Comp and its garden |pages=131–144 |location=London |publisher=Bachman and Turner Publications |isbn=0859741001 }}</ref>
