'''Experimental political science''' is the use of [[experiment]]s, which may be [[natural experiment|natural]] or [[scientific control|controlled]], to implement the [[scientific method]] in [[political science]].

== History and usage ==
The first experiment in political science is regarded to be Harold Gosnell's 1924 study on voter turnout in Chicago.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Rebecca B.|last2=Williams|first2=Kenneth C.|title=Experimentation in Political Science|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/morton/ExpChapHandbook5April06.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> In this experiment, he randomly assigned districts to receive information on voter registration and encouragements to vote.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gosnell|first1=Harold F.|title=An Experiment in the Stimulation of Voting|journal=American Political Science Review|date=1926|volume=20|issue=4|pages=869–874|url=http://www.ib.ethz.ch/teaching/pwgrundlagen/Gosnell-Experiment-Voting-1926.pdf|doi=10.2307/1945435|jstor=1945435|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729161524/http://www.ib.ethz.ch/teaching/pwgrundlagen/Gosnell-Experiment-Voting-1926.pdf|archive-date=29 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Current experts in experimental methodology in political science include [[Rebecca Morton]] and [[Donald Green]]. 

Since then, experimental research has become a growing area of political science. The publication of experimental research articles in flagship political science journals has risen, especially since the 1980s. Moreover, [[citation analysis]] indicates that articles using experimental methods have higher rates of citation.

Among the areas that it is used in are:
* [[Political psychology]], including [[survey methodology]], [[loss aversion]], influences on [[voter turnout]], and [[media influence]];
* The effects on outcomes of different [[voting systems]] (''e.g.'', [[Storable Votes#Experimental Results|storable votes]]), including the study of [[tactical voting]]; 
* The political economy of development;<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=Macartan |last2=Weinstein | first2 = Jeremy  |title=Field experiments and the Political Economy of Development|journal = Annual Review of Political Science |date=2009|volume=12|pages=367–378|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.060107.155922|doi-access=free}}</ref>
