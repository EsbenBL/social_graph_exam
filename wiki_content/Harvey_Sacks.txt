'''Harvey Sacks''' (July 19, 1935 &ndash; November 14, 1975) was an American [[sociologist]] influenced by the [[ethnomethodology]] tradition. He pioneered extremely detailed studies of the way people use language in everyday life. Despite his early death in a car crash and the fact that he did not publish widely, he founded the discipline of [[conversation analysis]]. His work has had significant influence on fields such as [[linguistics]], [[discourse analysis]], and  [[discursive psychology]].

==Life and academic career==
Sacks received his doctoral degree in [[sociology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1966),<ref>{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=David|title=Harvey Sacks: social science and conversation analysis|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1998|page=28|isbn=978-0-19-521472-7}}</ref> an LL.B. at Yale Law School (1959),<ref name=sche>{{cite journal|last=Schegloff|first=Emanuel A.|year=1989|title=Harvey Sacks — Lectures 1964–1965 an introduction/memoir |journal=Human Studies|volume=12|issue=3–4|pages=185–209|issn=1572-851X|doi=10.1007/BF00142761}}</ref> and a B.A. at Columbia College (1955).<ref name=sche/>  He lectured at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]] from 1964-1975. 

In 1975 Sacks died in a car accident. He was survived by his wife, two siblings, and his parents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/19/archives/prof-harvey-sacks.html|title=Prof. Harvey Sacks|date=19 November 1975|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

==Work==

Sacks became interested in the structure of conversation while working at a suicide counseling hotline in Los Angeles in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pomerantz|first=Anita|author2=Fehr, B. J.|title=Discourse Studies: A Multidisciplinary Approach|editor=Teun Adrianus van Dijk|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|chapter=Conversation analysis: An approach to the Analysis of Social Interaction|pages=165–190|isbn=978-1-84860-649-4|chapter-url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233751|accessdate=2013-12-29}}[</ref>  The calls to the hotline were recorded, and Sacks was able to gain access to the tapes and study them.  In the 1960s, prominent linguists like [[Noam Chomsky]] believed that conversation was too disorganized to be worthy of any kind of in-depth structural analysis {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} . Sacks strongly disagreed, since he saw structure in every conversation, and developed conversation analysis as a result.

Sacks's recorded lectures were transcribed (by [[Gail Jefferson]] who also edited them posthumously) but the tapes were not saved.  The duplicated copies of the transcribed lectures were made freely available by Sacks and achieved international circulation and recognition during his lifetime and subsequently{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} .

He treated such topics as: the organization of person-reference; topic organization and stories in conversation; speaker selection preferences; pre-sequences; the organization of [[turn-taking]]; conversational openings and closings; and  puns, jokes, stories and repairs in conversation among many others.<ref>Sacks, H., & Jefferson, G. (1995). Lectures on conversation.</ref>

==Legacy==

[[Emanuel Schegloff]], one of Sacks's close collaborators, colleagues and co-authors, became his [[literary executor]]. The subsequent handling of the literary estate (''[[Nachlass]]'', to use the academic term) has attracted some controversy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Sacks's major work, ''Lectures on Conversation,'' is composed of edited revisions of transcribed lectures held from Spring 1964 through to 1972, and comprises about 1200 pages in a two-volume work published by Basil Blackwel in 1992. This publication project was instigated largely by David Sudnow and [[Gail Jefferson]], colleagues and students of Sacks at Berkeley, UCLA and Irvine, and includes an introduction by [[Emanuel Schegloff]]. In her acknowledgements in these volumes, Jefferson mentioned the help of Sudnow in dealing with Sacks's literary estate. The Harvey Sacks Memorial Association, registered as a not-for-profit Association, was formed by Sudnow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

These ''Lectures'' have been important for Sacks's later influence and for the field of [[Conversation Analysis]].

Sudnow was a follower of [[Alfred Schutz]] in phenomenology, and [[Harold Garfinkel]] in ethnomethodology. Sudnow regards the work of Sacks as outside the ethnomethodological mainstream.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} By contrast Garfinkel lists Sacks as one of 'Ethnomethodology's Authors' <ref>Garfinkel, Harold. Lebenswelt origins of the sciences: Working out Durkheim's aphorism. ''Human Studies'' 30 (2007): 9-56.</ref>
