== Books ==
Fine's first book, ''A Mind of Its Own'', synthesizes a large amount of cognitive research to show that the mind often gives a distorted picture of reality.

Her second book, ''[[Delusions of Gender]]'', argues that conclusions that science has shown that [[men's and women's brains]] are intrinsically different in ways that explain the gender status quo are premature and often based on flawed methods and unexamined assumptions. She also challenges the common assumption that a gender-egalitarian society means that differences in social outcomes and interests must be due to biology. "With still such different contexts and circumstances for men and women, it's simply not possible to compare the choices they make and draw confident conclusions about the sexes' different inner natures."<ref>{{cite news|last=Irvine|first=Jessica|title=An equal footing still step too far|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/an-equal-footing-still-step-too-far-20110826-1jegl.html|work=[[The Age]] (Melbourne)|access-date=27 September 2011|date=27 August 2011}}</ref> Fine's approach to gender has been criticised by those who think it [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/thepsychologist/docs/psy1110/15 |title=The Psychologist, November 2010 by The British Psychological Society |publisher=ISSUU |access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Farrelly |first=Elizabeth |author-link=Elizabeth Farrelly |title=Gender and feminism, a guilt trip |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/gender-and-feminism-a-guilt-trip-20101013-16jyv.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=28 September 2011 |date=14 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118204411/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/gender-and-feminism-a-guilt-trip-20101013-16jyv.html |archive-date=18 November 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> and for not accounting for what psychiatry terms [[gender identity disorder]]s. However, as Fine pointed out in ''The Psychologist'', the book is concerned with scientific evidence presented as support for the idea that males and females are, on average, 'hardwired' to 'systemise' versus 'empathise', rather than the question of the extent to which core gender identity is 'hardwired'; and that she does not subscribe to a behaviourist or [[social determinist]] view of development, but rather "one in which the developmental path is constructed, step by step, out of the continuous and dynamic interaction between brain, genes and environment."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cordeliafine.com/Psychologist_Interview.pdf |title=The battle of the sex differences: Interview |publisher=Cordeliafine.com |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210502/http://www.cordeliafine.com/Psychologist_Interview.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Ben Barres]], a Professor of Neurobiology at [[Stanford University]], wrote in a review of the book for ''[[PLOS Biology]]'' that Fine's "analysis of this data should be required reading for every neurobiology student, if not every human being." The neuroscientists [[Margaret McCarthy (academic)|Margaret McCarthy]] and Gregory Ball have said that Fine presents a one-sided picture of the study of sex differences, and that ''Delusions of Gender'' threatened to "severely hamper" progress in this field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = Margaret M. | last2 = Ball | first2 = Gregory F. | title = Tempests and tales: challenges to the study of sex differences in the brain |journal=Biology of Sex Differences | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 | doi = 10.1186/2042-6410-2-4 | pmc = 3108906 | date = 28 April 2011 }}</ref> However, neuroscientists Geert de Vries and Nancy Forger of the Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State University cite the work of Fine and colleagues in noting that "unsubstantiated claims about the nature and function of neural sex differences continue to be made and such claims may do serious harm".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Vries|first1=Geert J.|last2=Forger|first2=Nancy G.|date=1 January 2015|title=Sex differences in the brain: a whole body perspective|journal=Biology of Sex Differences|volume=6|pages=15|doi=10.1186/s13293-015-0032-z|issn=2042-6410|pmc=4536872|pmid=26279833}}</ref> Together with Barnard College sociomedical scientist [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], Fine has rejected the claim,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-xx-factor/|title=The XX Factor - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=18 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> based on quotations of her criticisms of popular misrepresentations of science, that she is "anti-sex differences".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/06/anti-sex-difference-scientific-rigour-gender-research-feminism|title=We've been labelled 'anti-sex difference' for demanding greater scientific rigour|last1=Fine|first1=Cordelia|date=6 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 April 2017|last2=Jordan-Young|first2=Rebecca|author-link2 =Rebecca Young (journalist)|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Fine and Jordan-Young, with other co-authors, have published recommendations and guidelines for improving the quality of scientific investigations of sex/gender differences in research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rippon | first1 = Gina | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | last3 = Jordan-Young | first3 = Rebecca | last4 = Kaiser | first4 = Anelis | author-link1 = Gina Rippon | author-link3 = Rebecca Jordan-Young | author-link4 = Anelis Kaiser | title = Recommendations for sex/gender neuroimaging research: key principles and implications for research design, analysis and interpretation | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 650 | pages = 650 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00650 | pmid = 25221493 | pmc = 4147717 | date = 28 August 2014 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = Cordelia | last2 = Rippon | first2 = Gina | last3 = Jordan-Young | first3 = Rebecca | last4 = Kaiser | first4 = Anelis | last5 = Joel | first5 = Daphna | author-link2 = Gina Rippon | author-link3 = Rebecca Jordan-Young | author-link4 = Anelis Kaiser | author-link5 = Daphna Joel | title = Letter to the Editor &#124; ''Journal of Neuroscience'' research policy on addressing sex as a biological variable: Comments, clarifications, and elaborations | journal = [[Journal of Neuroscience Research]] | volume = 95 | issue = 7 | pages = 1357&ndash;1359 | doi = 10.1002/jnr.24045 | pmid = 28225166 | date = July 2017 | s2cid = 45664076 }}</ref>

Fine's third book, ''Testosterone Rex'', critiques an account of sex differences and their evolutionary, neural and hormonal basis that is the prominent view in the scientific literature and research. In 2017, ''Testosterone Rex'' won the prestigious [[Royal Society Science Books Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/news/2017/09/cordelia-fine-wins-30th-anniversary-royal-society-insight-investment-science-book-prize/|title=Cordelia Fine's explosive study of gender politics wins 30th anniversary Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> [[Harriet Hall]], who often critiques alternative medicine and quackery for their lack of a scientific basis, argued in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'': "Cordelia Fine's book provides compelling evidence that men and women aren't really very different other than in their anatomy. There is no such thing as a 'male brain' or a 'female brain'. There are no essential male or female natures but rather an individualized mosaic of features. Testosterone isn't very important. Biology can't be used to explain or excuse societal inequalities."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/testosterone-rex/|title=SkepDoc's Corner Testosterone Rex - The Bottom Line|publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref>
