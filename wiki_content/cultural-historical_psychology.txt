All this theoretical (mostly, speculative) and experimental empirical work was attempted by the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]] (also referred to as "Vygotsky-[[Alexander Luria|Luria]] Circle").

== Theoretical premises ==
Cultural-historical psychology never existed as such during Vygotsky's lifetime. He never accomplished a developmental theory of his own and, by his own admission, died at the threshold of a new psychological theory of [[consciousness]].

Vygotsky believed in the "[[New Soviet man|new man]]" that he referred to as a "superman" of the future [[Communist society]] and advocated for a psychological theory that would account for the development from the actual level of human development to the potential one of a "superman". To that end, he claimed that the development of "higher psychological functions" are a result of the impact of the society (including, according to [[Marxism|Marxist principles]], its economic basis and the relations of production) and the culture at large. This idea was well known at least fifty years before Vygotsky, was advocated for by a number of other psychologists, and is frequently discussed under the label of "[[sociogenesis]]". In contradistinction to [[Freud]]'s and Freudian "[[depth psychology]]" and the [[behaviorists]] (and many others) "surface psychologies" of the average people in their everyday environment, Vygotsky postulated "peak psychology" of his own, which would focus on the highest, "peak" performance of people in their actual life and potential, future "superman" capacity. This "peak psychology" was never accomplished and largely remained an interesting and promising, yet [[utopian]] scientific project of considerable interest in the contemporary context of 21st century psychological research.<ref name="vygScienceSuperman">Yasnitsky, A.

== The benefits and failings of the theory ==
The larger project of the new psychology of Vygotsky and Luria failed,<ref name="joravsky">Cf.: "He laid out a most ambitious program of unification with an 'historico-cultural' approach as the central feature. Though tuberculosis cut him off at a very early age, Vygotsky left prolific disciples, most notably Luria and A.N. Leont'ev, who founded the Vygotsky school of cognitive psychology, focused on brain damage and on child development. There is a great irony in that history: preaching a comprehensive science, Vygotsky started one more school" (p. 254). Joravsky, D. (1989) ''Russian Psychology: a Critical History'', Cambridge: Blackwell.</ref> and no universal integrative theory of human mind and development was built by the time of Vygotsky's death in 1934 or afterwards. However, the earlier intellectual effort and the legacy of the Soviet scholars of the 1920s-1930s produced a range of specialized, loosely-related fields of psychological theory and practice including [[cultural psychology|cultural]]<ref name="handbook-cultMediation">Arievich, I.M. & Stetsenko, A.

A few of these earlier influences were subsequently downplayed, misunderstood or even totally ignored and forgotten. Thus, cultural-historical psychology understood as the Vygotsky-Luria project, originally intended by its creators as an integrative and, later, holistic "new psychology" of socio-biological and cultural development should not be confused with later self-proclaimed "Vygotskian" theories and fields of studies, ignorant of the historical roots and the intended breadth and depth of the original proposal and its consistent emphasis on the need in a new theory of consciousness.<ref name="handbook-consciousness"/> These include such as ''sociocultural psychology'', ''socio-historical psychology'', ''[[activity theory]]'', ''[[cultural psychology]]'', or ''[[cultural-historical activity theory]] (CHAT)''.<ref name="activityTheoryDead">Toomela, A.

== [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky-Luria Circle]] ==
Vygotsky and Luria informally collaborated with other psychologists, educationalists, medical specialists, physiologists, and neuroscientists. The foundation of the integrative science of the mind, brain, and behavior in their bio-social development, was the main work of the Circle. They incorporated ideas of social and interpersonal relations, the practices of empirical scientific research, and "Stalinist science" founded on the discursive practices of Soviet science in the 1930s.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Yasnitsky|first=Anton|date=2011|title=Vygotsky Circle as a Personal Network of Scholars: Restoring Connections Between People and Ideas|journal=Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science|doi=10.1007/s12124-011-9168-5|pmid=21667127|volume=45|issue=4|pages=422–57|s2cid=207392569}}</ref> There were around three dozen people involved in the research for Vygotsky's theory, at different periods of time.

In 1924, the Circle was formed in Moscow after Vygotsky moved there from Gomel, Belarus. At the Institute of Psychology he met Zankov, Solv'ev, Sakharov, and Varshava, as well as Alexander Luria, with whom he would go on to collaborate with.<ref name=":1" />

The group grew at a gradual rate and all research was conducted in Moscow, Kharkov, and Leningrad, located in the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] (1941), the group disbanded and any further post-Vygotskian research after the beginning of [[World War II]], was conducted by Luria, Leontiev, Zankov, and Elkonin.<ref name=":1" />
