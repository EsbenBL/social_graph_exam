Stokes began to work at the University of Michigan in 1958. There he collaborated with fellow University of Michigan social scientists [[Angus Campbell (psychologist)|Angus Campbell]], [[Philip Converse]], and [[Warren Miller (political scientist)|Warren Miller]] to write ''The American Voter'', which was one of the first major empirical studies of voting behavior.<ref name="DeGroat97">{{cite web |url=http://ns.umich.edu/Releases/1997/May97/chr051497b.html |date=1997-05-14 | website=University of Michigan News |title=Former graduate school Dean Donald E. Stokes has died | publisher=University of Michigan |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> Through thousands of interviews with American citizens during the election periods in 1948, 1952, 1954, 1956 and 1958, the authors first identified several of the core results in voting behavior that would form the [[Michigan model]].<ref name="pace97">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/29/nyregion/donald-e-stokes-69-leading-political-scientist.html |date=1997-01-29 |title=Donald E. Stokes, 69, Leading Political Scientist (Obituary) | work=The New York Times |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> These include the importance of party identification, the low information level of many voters, and the large number of voters who remain undecided until immediately before an election.<ref name="pace97" />

In 1966, Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes followed ''The American Voter'' with another book, ''Elections and the Political Order''. Stokes studied the politics of the [[United Kingdom]] as well as American politics; he and [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] conducted the first [[British Election Study]], and coauthored the 1969 book ''Political Change in Britain''.
