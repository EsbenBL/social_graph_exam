===''Inside Job'' interview and aftermath===
Hubbard was interviewed in [[Charles H. Ferguson|Charles Ferguson's]] Oscar-winning documentary film, ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'' (2010), discussing his advocacy, as chief economic advisor to the Bush Administration, of deregulation. Ferguson argues that deregulation led to the 2008 [[List of banks acquired or bankrupted during the 2007–2012 global financial crisis|international banking crisis]] sparked by the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] and the sale of [[Merrill Lynch]]. In the interview, Ferguson asks Hubbard to enumerate the firms from whom he receives outside income as an advisory board member in the context of possible [[conflict of interest]]. Hubbard, hitherto cooperative, declines to answer and threatens to end the interview with the remark, "You have three more minutes; give it your best shot."<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130272396 Transcript excerpt on "A Searing Look At Wall Street In 'Inside Job', Charles Ferguson interviewed by Melissa Block"], which aired October 1, 2010 on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''. During the program, Ferguson explained to [[Melissa Block]], "Well, the entire interview was fairly contentious, as you can imagine. It surprised me somewhat to realize that these people were not used to being challenged, that they'd never been questioned about this issue before. They clearly expected to be deferred to by me and I think by everybody."</ref> After the release of the film, Columbia ramped up ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify their conflict of interest disclosure requirements.<ref name="spectator">[http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/04/13/inside-job-prompts-new-look-conflict-interest-policy "‘Inside Job’ prompts new look at conﬂict of interest policy,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213072648/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/04/13/inside-job-prompts-new-look-conflict-interest-policy |date=2011-12-13 }} published April 13, 2011, in the Columbia Spectator.</ref> (Columbia Business School professor Michael Feiner, a member of the faculty committee of Columbia's Sanford C.
