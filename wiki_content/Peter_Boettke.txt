Boettke – Biographical Information]</ref> In 1998, he returned to George Mason University as a faculty member. In 2004, he was named a Hayek Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]].

Boettke worked as a tennis instructor before pursuing his graduate degree in economics.

== Analytical anarchism ==
Analytical anarchism is the name given by Boettke to the positive [[political economy]] of [[anarchism]], or anarchism from the economic point of view, in the [[anarcho-capitalism|libertarian tradition]] of [[Murray Rothbard]]'s ''[[For a New Liberty]]'' (1973) and [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]]'s ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' (1973). Boettke claims that analytical anarchism has developed out of this tradition and is currently being pursued by economists such as [[Peter Leeson]], [[Edward Stringham]] and [[Christopher Coyne (professor)|Christopher Coyne]].<ref>[http://analyticalanarchism.net/about/ Analytical Anarchism research program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115503/http://analyticalanarchism.net/about/ |date=July 29, 2013 }}</ref> These professors are related to Mercatus Center and to the faculty of economics at George Mason University.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}
