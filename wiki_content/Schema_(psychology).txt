In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], a '''schema''' (plural ''schemata'' or ''schemas'') describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = DiMaggio | first1 = P | year = 1997 | title = Culture and cognition | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 23 | pages = 263–287 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.263 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boutyline|first=Andrei|last2=Soter|first2=Laura K.|date=2021|title=Cultural Schemas: What They Are, How to Find Them, and What to Do Once You’ve Caught One|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224211024525|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|doi=10.1177/00031224211024525|issn=0003-1224}}</ref> It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.psyctherapy.com/Enrolled/glossaryBody1.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213104606/http://www.psyctherapy.com/Enrolled/glossaryBody1.htm|archive-date=December 13, 2013|access-date=7 March 2013}}</ref> Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit.

==History==
"Schema" comes from the Greek word ''schēmat'' or ''schēma'', meaning "figure".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Samawi |first1=Idris |title=Schema |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schema/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=27 May 2020}}</ref>

Prior to its use in psychology, the term "schema" had primarily seen use in [[philosophy]]. For instance, "schemata" (especially "[[Schema (Kant)|transcendental schemata]]") are crucial to the architectonic system devised by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nevid | first1 = J. S. | year = 2007 | title = Kant, cognitive psychotherapy, and the hardening of the categories | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 605–615 | doi = 10.1348/147608307X204189 | pmid = 17535545 }}</ref>

Early developments of the idea in psychology emerged with the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] and [[Jean Piaget]]: the term ''schéma'' was introduced by Piaget in 1923.<ref>Piaget, J. (1923). {{cite web|title=Langage et pensée chez l'enfant|trans-title=Language and thought in children|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP23_Langag_pensee_chap1_fonctionslang.pdf|language=fr}} (3e éd. 1948 revue et avec un nouvel avant-propos et un nouveau chapitre II inséré  utgave  bind). Neuchâtel: Delachaux et Niestlé, p. 43f.</ref> In Piaget's later publications, action (operative or procedural) ''schémes'' were distinguished from figurative (representational) ''schémas'', although together they may be considered a schematic duality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Siraj-Blatchford |first1=John |last2=Siraj-Blatchford |first2=Iram |date=October 2002 |title=Discriminating between schemes and schema in young children's emergent learning of science and technology |journal=International Journal of Early Years Education |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1080/0966976022000044744 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248981221}}</ref> In subsequent discussions of Piaget in English, ''schema'' was often a mistranslation of Piaget's original French ''schéme''.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Driscoll | first1 = Marcy Perkins | year = 2000 | title = Psychology of Learning for Instruction | edition = 2nd | publisher= Allyn and Bacon |isbn=9780205263219 |page=189}}</ref> The distinction has been of particular importance in theories of [[embodied cognition]] and [[ecological psychology]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garbarini |first1=Francesca |last2=Adenzato |first2=Mauro |date=October 2004 |title=At the root of embodied cognition: cognitive science meets neurophysiology |journal=[[Brain and Cognition]] |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=100–106 |pmid=15380880 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.06.003|s2cid=13613791 }}</ref>

The concept was popularized in psychology and education through the work of the British psychologist [[Frederic Bartlett]],<ref name="bartlett">{{cite book |last= Bartlett |first=F.C. |year=1932 |title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1086/399084 |s2cid=7992164 |url= https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180214073354/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2018-02-14 }}</ref> who drew on the term [[body schema]] used by neurologist [[Henry Head]].

==Schematic processing==
Through the use of schemata, a [[heuristic]] technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act without effort.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kleider | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Pezdek | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldinger | first3 = S. D. | last4 = Kirk | first4 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Schema-driven source misattribution errors: Remembering the expected from a witnessed event | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1002/acp.1361 }}</ref> The process however, is not always accurate, and people may develop [[Illusory correlation|illusory correlations]], which is the tendency to form inaccurate or overestimated associations between categories, especially when the information is distinctive. <ref name=":0" />

However, schemata can influence and hamper the uptake of new information ([[proactive interference]]), such as when existing [[stereotype]]s, giving rise to limited or [[bias]]ed discourses and expectations ([[prejudice]]s), lead an individual to "see" or "remember" something that has not happened because it is more believable in terms of his/her schema.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = M. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = N. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of schemas, stimulus ambiguity, and interview schedule on eyewitness memory over time | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 101–118 | doi = 10.1037/1076-898X.9.2.101 | pmid = 12877270 }}</ref> For example, if a well-dressed businessman draws a knife on a vagrant, the schemata of onlookers may (and often do) lead them to "remember" the vagrant pulling the knife. Such distortion of memory has been demonstrated. (See {{section link||Background research}} below.) 

Schemata are interrelated and multiple conflicting schemata can be applied to the same information. Schemata are generally thought to have a level of activation, which can spread among related schemata. Which schema is selected can depend on factors such as current activation, accessibility, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and emotion.

''Accessibility'' is how easily a schema comes to mind, and is determined by personal experience and expertise. This can be used as a cognitive shortcut; it allows the [[availability heuristic|most common explanation to be chosen for new information]].

With priming, a brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation to a schema so that it is used for subsequent ambiguous information. Although this may suggest the possibility of [[subliminal message]]s, the effect of priming is so fleeting that it is difficult to detect outside laboratory conditions.

==Background research==

=== Frederic Bartlett ===
The original concept of schemata is linked with that of reconstructive memory as proposed and demonstrated in a series of experiments by [[Frederic Bartlett]].<ref name="Bartlett">Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://web.archive.org/web/20180214073354/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press</ref> By presenting participants with information that was unfamiliar to their cultural backgrounds and expectations and then monitoring how they recalled these different items of information (stories, etc.), Bartlett was able to establish that individuals' existing schemata and stereotypes influence not only how they interpret "schema-foreign" new information but also how they recall the information over time. One of his most famous investigations involved asking participants to read a Native American folk tale, "The War of the Ghosts",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://condor.depaul.edu/dallbrit/extra/360/war-of-t.htm |title=War of the Ghosts, from Bartlett, Remembering, 1932/1995, p. 65 |website=condor.depaul.edu |access-date=2020-06-11}}</ref> and recall it several times up to a year later. All the participants transformed the details of the story in such a way that it reflected their cultural norms and expectations, i.e. in line with their schemata. The factors that influenced their recall were:

* Omission of information that was considered irrelevant to a participant;
* Transformation of some of the details, or of the order in which events, etc., were recalled; a shift of focus and emphasis in terms of what was considered the most important aspects of the tale;
* Rationalization: details and aspects of the tale that would not make sense would be "padded out" and explained in an attempt to render them comprehensible to the individual in question;
* Cultural shifts: the content and the style of the story were altered in order to appear more coherent and appropriate in terms of the cultural background of the participant.

Bartlett's work was crucially important in demonstrating that long-term memories are neither fixed nor immutable but are constantly being adjusted as schemata evolve with experience. His work contributed to a framework of memory retrieval in which people construct the past and present in a constant process of narrative/discursive adjustment. Much of what people "remember" is  [[confabulated]] narrative (adjusted and rationalized) which allows them to think of the past as a continuous and coherent string of events, even though it is probable that large sections of memory (both episodic and semantic) are irretrievable or inaccurate at any given time.<ref name="Bartlett" />

An important step in the development of schema theory was taken by the work of D.E. Rumelhart describing the understanding of narrative and stories.<ref>Rumelhart, D.E. (1980) [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4 Schemata: the building blocks of cognition]. In: R.J. Spiro et al. (Eds) Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. See also: Mandler, J. M. (1984). Stories, scripts, and scenes: Aspects of schema theory. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> Further work on the concept of schemata was conducted by W.F. Brewer and J.C. Treyens, who demonstrated that the schema-driven expectation of the presence of an object was sometimes sufficient to trigger its erroneous recollection.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Treyens | first2 = J. C. | title = Role of schemata in memory for places | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages= 207–230 | year = 1981 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90008-6| s2cid = 54259841 }}</ref> An experiment was conducted where participants were requested to wait in a room identified as an academic's study and were later asked about the room's contents. A number of the participants recalled having seen books in the study whereas none were present. Brewer and Treyens concluded that the participants' expectations that books are present in academics' studies were enough to prevent their accurate recollection of the scenes.

In the 1970s, computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]] was trying to develop machines that would have human-like abilities. When he was trying to create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett's work and decided that if he was ever going to get machines to act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. To compensate for that he created what was known as the frame construct, which was a way to represent knowledge in machines. His frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world didn't have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value.<ref>{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=The Psychology of Computer Vision|editor=Patrick H. Winston}}</ref> Because of Minsky's work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, [[David Rumelhart]] extended Minsky's ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the [[mental representation]] of complex knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|chapter=Schemata: The Building Blocks of Cognition|year=1980|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|edition=Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension|doi=10.4324/9781315107493-4|title=Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension|pages=33–58|isbn=9781315107493}}</ref>

Roger Schank and Robert Abelson developed the idea of a script, which was known as a generic knowledge of sequences of actions. This led to many new empirical studies, which found that providing relevant schema can help improve comprehension and recall on passages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Rodger C.|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Abelson|first2=Robert P.|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&isbn=9781134919666&format=googlePreviewPdf}}</ref>

Schemata have also been viewed from a [[sociocultural perspective]] with contributions from [[Lev Vygotsky]], in which there is a transactional relationship between the development of a schema and the environment that influences it, such that the schema doesn't develop independently as a construct in the mind, but carries all the aspects of the history, social, and cultural meaning which influences its development. Schemata are not just scripts or frameworks to be called upon, but are active processes for solving problems and interacting with the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McVee|first=Mary B.|last2=Dunsmore|first2=Kailonnie|last3=Gavelek|first3=James R.|date=December 2005|title=Schema Theory Revisited|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00346543075004531|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=75|issue=4|pages=531–566|doi=10.3102/00346543075004531|issn=0034-6543}}</ref>

==Modification==
New information that falls within an individual's schema is easily remembered and incorporated into their [[worldview]]. However, when new information is perceived that does not fit a schema, many things can happen. The most common reaction is to simply ignore or quickly forget the new information.<ref>Taylor, S. E., & Crocker, J. (1981). Schematic bases of social information processing. In E. T. Higgins, C. A. Herman, & M. P. Zanna (Eds.), Social cognition: The Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology (pp. 89-134). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> This can happen on an unconscious level— frequently an individual may not even perceive the new information. People may also interpret the new information in a way that minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens don't lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says "chickens don't lay eggs", he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of [[disconfirmation bias]], the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one's expectations.<ref name="taberandlodge">{{cite journal | last1 = Taber | first1 = Charles S. | last2 = Lodge | first2 = Milton | title = Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 50 | number = 3 | pages= 755–769 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x | issn = 0092-5853| citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.7064 }}</ref> This is also known as [[cognitive dissonance]]. However, when the new information cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Chris S. | last2 = Durso | first2 = Francis T. | year = 1984 | title = Effect of schema-incongruent information on memory for stereotypical attributes | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 55–70 | pmid = 6747816 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.55}}</ref>

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was known best for his work with development of human knowledge. He believed knowledge was constructed on cognitive structures, and he believed people develop cognitive structures by accommodating and assimilating information. Accommodation is creating new schema that will fit better with the new environment or adjusting old schema. Accommodation could also be interpreted as putting restrictions on a current schema. Accommodation usually comes about when assimilation has failed. Assimilation is when people use a current schema to understand the world around them. Piaget thought that schemata are applied to everyday life and therefore people accommodate and assimilate information naturally.<ref>{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=Jean|title=Studies in Reflection Abstraction|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Sussex|isbn=978-1-84169-157-2|editor=Robert L. Campbell}}</ref> For example, if this chicken has red feathers, Bob can form a new schemata that says "chickens with red feathers can lay eggs". This schemata will then be either changed or removed, in the future.

[[Assimilation (psychology)|Assimilation]] is the reuse of schemata to fit the new information. For example, when a person sees an unfamiliar dog, they will probably just integrate it into their dog schema. However, if the dog behaves strangely, and in ways that doesn't seem dog-like, there will be [[Accommodation (psychology)|accommodation]] as a new schema is formed for that particular dog. With Accommodation and Assimilation comes the idea of equilibrium. Piaget describes equilibrium as a state of cognition that is balanced when schema are capable of explaining what it sees and perceives. When information is new and cannot fit into existing schema this is called disequilibrium and this is an unpleasant state for the child's development. When disequilibrium happens, it means the person is frustrated and will try to restore the coherence of his or her cognitive structures through accommodation. If the new information is taken then assimilation of the new information will proceed until they find that they must make a new adjustment to it later down the road, but for now the child remains at equilibrium again. The process of equilibration is when people move from the equilibrium phase to the disequilibrium phase and back into equilibrium.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S. A|year=2009|title=Jean Piaget {{!}} Cognitive Theory|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|access-date=25 February 2013|website=SimplyPsychology}}</ref>

In view of this, a person's new schemata may be an expansion of the schemata into a subtype. This allows for the information to be incorporated into existing beliefs without contradicting them. An example in [[social psychology]] would be the combination of a person's beliefs about women and their beliefs about business. If women are not generally perceived to be in business, but the person meets one who is, a new subtype of businesswoman may be created, and the information perceived will be incorporated into this subtype. Activation of either woman or business schema may then make further available the schema of "businesswoman". This also allows for previous beliefs about women or those in business to persist. Rather than modifying the schemata related to women or to business persons, the subtype is its own category. <ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Kite|first1=Mary E.|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781317227236|title=Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination: 3rd Edition|last2=Whitley, Jr.|first2=Bernard E.|date=2016-06-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-62384-9|edition=0|location=3rd edition. {{!}} New York, NY : Routledge, 2016.|language=en|doi=10.4324/9781315623849}}</ref>

==Self-schema==
{{Main|Self-schema}}
Schemata about oneself are considered to be grounded in the present and based on past experiences. Memories are framed in the light of one's self-conception. For example, people who have positive self-schemata (i.e. most people) selectively attend to flattering information and selectively ignore unflattering information, with the consequence that flattering information is subject to deeper encoding, and therefore superior recall.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = J. D. | year = 2000 | title = On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 6| pages = 906–92 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 | pmid=11138760}}</ref> Even when encoding is equally strong for positive and negative feedback, positive feedback is more likely to be recalled.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sanitioso | first1 = R. | last2 = Kunda | first2 = Z. | last3 = Fong | first3 = G.

L. | year = 1998 | title = Self-esteem and memory for favorable and unfavorable personality feedback | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 24 | pages = 51–64 | doi=10.1177/0146167298241004| s2cid = 144945319 }}</ref> Thus, memory tends to be biased in a way that validates the agent's pre-existing self-schema.

There are three major implications of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed faster and more efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one's self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one's self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more likely to try to find a new roommate, even if this view is positive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Swann | first1 = W. B. | last2 = Jr | last3 = Pelham | first3 = B. W. | year = 2002 | title = Who wants out when the going gets good?

As researched by [[Aaron T. Beck|Aaron Beck]], automatically activated negative self-schemata are a large contributor to depression. According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), these self-schemata are essentially the same type of cognitive structure as stereotypes studied by prejudice researchers (e.g., they are both well-rehearsed, automatically activated, difficult to change, influential toward behavior, emotions, and judgments, and bias information processing).<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)">{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T.

The self-schema can also be self-perpetuating. It can represent a particular role in society that is based on stereotype, for example: "If a mother tells her daughter she looks like a tom boy, her daughter may react by choosing activities that she imagines a tom boy would do. Conversely, if the mother tells her she looks like a princess, her daughter might choose activities thought to be more feminine." This is an example of the self-schema becoming self-perpetuating when the person at hand chooses an activity that was based on an expectation rather than their desires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Psychology Glossary|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Self-Schema|access-date=7 March 2013}}</ref>

==Schema therapy==
{{Main article|Schema therapy|List of maladaptive schemas}}
Schema therapy was founded by [[Jeffrey Young]] and represents a development of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) specifically for treating [[personality disorders]].<ref>Young, J. E. (1999) Cognitive therapy for personality disorders: A schema-focused approach. (rev ed.) Sarasota, FL: Professional Resources Press</ref><ref name="young">Young, Klosko & Weishaar (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vScjGGgJEZgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Schema Therapy: A Practitioner's Guide]. New York: The Guilford Press.</ref> ''Early maladaptive schemata'' are described by Young as broad and pervasive themes or patterns made up of memories, feelings, sensations, and thoughts regarding oneself and one's relationships with others; they can be a contributing factor to treatment outcomes of mental disorders and the maintenance of ideas, beliefs, and behaviors towards oneself and others. They are considered to develop during childhood or adolescence, and to be dysfunctional in that they lead to self-defeating behavior. Examples include schemata of abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, and defectiveness/shame.<ref name="young" />

Schema therapy blends CBT with elements of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[object relations]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] and [[psychoanalytic]] therapies in order to treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient's experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. Cognitive behavioral methods work to increase the availability and strength of adaptive schemata while reducing the maladaptive ones. This may involve identifying the existing schema and then identifying an alternative to replace it. Difficulties arise as these types of schema often exist in absolutes; modification then requires replacement to be in absolutes, otherwise the initial belief may persist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Padesky|first=Christine A.|date=December 1994|title=Schema change processes in cognitive therapy|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpp.5640010502|journal=Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=267–278|doi=10.1002/cpp.5640010502}}</ref> The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy according to Young is the latter "emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on [[Schema therapy#Limited reparenting|limited reparenting]]".<ref name="APA">{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffery|title=Schema Therapy|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/videos/4310804.aspx|access-date=28 February 2013}}</ref> He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be [[eating disorder]]s and personality disorders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.<ref name="APA"/>
