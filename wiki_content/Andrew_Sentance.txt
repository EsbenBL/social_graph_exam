In early 2019 Sentance criticized the [[Bank of England]]'s 'doomsday scenario report on Brexit'.

==Criticism==
The economist [[Paul Krugman]] criticized an article Sentance wrote in London's ''[[Financial Times]]'' on 21 September 2015, which opposed the US [[Federal Open Market Committee]]'s decision not to raise interest rates.<ref>Andrew Sentance, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a0e69d9e-5e29-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2.html#axzz3mFElaEMo "The US Federal Reserve has got it wrong"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 21 September 2015 (subscription required).</ref> Krugman writes:
<blockquote>
What makes the piece so remarkable is that there isn’t so much as a nod to what you might have thought was the standard approach to monetary policy; not only has Sentance made up his own version of macroeconomics, he’s evidently completely unaware that he has done so.<ref name=Krugman>Paul Krugman, [http://nyti.ms/1V6Pi4o "Nutcases and Knut Cases"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 September 2015 (subscription required).</ref>
</blockquote>

According to Krugman, Sentance criticizes the Fed for its shifting arguments against raising rates ("sluggish growth in all the major western economies in 2011-12; the euro crisis in 2013-14; and now the Fed is citing weak economic growth in China and the impact this has on financial markets") and says: "If you look around hard enough, there can always be a reason for not raising interest rates."<ref name=Krugman/> Krugman points out that Sentance never once mentions that, according to Krugman, US "inflation is still below the Fed’s target, and shows no sign of rising".<ref name=Krugman/>

==Personal life==
Andrew Sentance is married with two adult children. His main interest outside work is music. He plays the piano, organ, guitar and bass guitar and he is a former member of a band called 'Revelation'.<ref>BBC Radio 4 Moneybox, 18 July 2010.</ref> He is also involved in local church music in the area around [[Broxbourne]], Hertfordshire, where he now lives. Since 2019, he has played the organ regularly and acted as Director of Music in the Parish of [[Bengeo]] near [[Hertford]]. Sentance takes a keen interest in environmental affairs and also in charity work: he is a former trustee of Build It International,<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Trustees|url=http://www.builditinternational.org/about-us/our-people/|publisher=Build It International|accessdate=13 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217024219/http://www.builditinternational.org/about-us/our-people/|archive-date=17 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> a development charity, and a former trustee of the charity Harvest Help (now known as [[Self Help Africa]]) as well as a former trustee of the Anglo-German Foundation.
