===Research===
Banerjee and his co-workers try to measure the effectiveness of actions (such as government programmes) in improving people's lives. For this, they use [[randomized controlled trials]], similar to clinical trials in medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cho | first = Adrian | title = Economics Nobel honors trio taking an experimental approach to fighting poverty | journal = Science | date = 14 October 2019 | url = https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/10/economics-nobel-honors-trio-taking-experimental-approach-fighting-poverty | access-date = 16 October 2019 | quote = To bring some science to the fight against poverty, the three researchers borrowed a key tool from clinical medicine: the randomized controlled trial.

Banerjee and Prof. Esther Duflo, also from MIT, tried an experiment in [[Rajasthan]], where they gave a bag of pulses to mothers who vaccinated their children. Soon, the immunization rate went up in the region. In another experiment, they found that learning outcomes improved in schools that were provided with teaching assistants to help students with special needs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/economics-of-poverty/article29683404.ece?homepage=true/|title=Economics of poverty: On Economic Sciences' Nobel |newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=21 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>

== Awards ==

Abhijit Banerjee was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2019 along with his two co-researchers [[Esther Duflo]] and [[Michael Kremer]] "for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty".<ref>{{Cite news | last = Johnson | first = Simon | last2 = Pollard | first2 = Niklas | title = Trio wins economics Nobel for science-based poverty fight | publisher = Reuters | date = 14 October 2019 | url = https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1WT17L-OCATP}}</ref>

The press release from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] noted: "Their experimental research methods now entirely dominate [[development economics]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2019/10/press-economicsciences2019.pdf|title=The Prize in Economic Sciences 2019|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: Nobel prize|date=14 October 2019|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name=guardianlive>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/14/nobel-prize-in-economic-sciences-2019-sveriges-riksbank-live-updates|title=Nobel Prize in Economics won by Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer for fighting poverty|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2019}}</ref>

The Nobel committee commented:
::"Banerjee, Duflo and their co-authors concluded that students appeared to learn nothing from additional days at school. Neither did spending on textbooks seem to boost learning, even though the schools in Kenya lacked many essential inputs. Moreover, in the Indian context Banerjee and Duflo intended to study, many children appeared to learn little: in results from field tests in the city of [[Vadodara]] fewer than one in five third-grade students could correctly answer first-grade curriculum math test questions.<ref name=guardianlive />

::"In response to such findings, Banerjee, Duflo and co-authors argued that efforts to get more children into school must be complemented by reforms to improve school quality."<ref name=guardianlive />

* He has been awarded the [[Doctor of Letters]] ([[Honoris causa|Honoris Causa]]) by the [[University of Calcutta]] in January 2020.<ref name=DLitt_CU>[https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/calcutta-university-confers-doctor-of-letters-degree-to-abhijit-banerjee-2171173 Calcutta University Awards Doctor Of Letters Degree To Abhijit Banerjee]</ref>

The Nobel Prize was a major recognition for their chosen field - Development Economics, and for the use of Randomised Controlled Trials.
