==Background==
Kathleen Carley was born in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] in 1956.<ref name="ODHPUS">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1109/21.364841 | last1 = Carley | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Zhiang Lin | title = Organizational designs suited to high performance under stress | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–230 | year = 1995 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8b2e841b41b47086812bb5ed1e38648695fa06a}}</ref> At High School her interest in social modeling was inspired by [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]]. [[Artificial intelligence]] was not a career path at that time and she was dissuaded from studying Mathematics because of [[Sexism|gender stereotyping]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Christofer |last=Edling |title=We Always Know More Than We Can Say: Mathematical Sociologists on Mathematical Sociology |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Hedström |editor2-first=Björn |editor2-last=Wittrock |work=Frontiers of Sociology (Annals of the International Institute of Sociology) |publisher=[[Institut international de sociologie]].

Instead she studied for an [[Bachelor of Science|S.B.]] in [[Economics]] and an S.B. in [[Political Science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1978. She received her Ph.D. in [[Sociology]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1984.  Her Ph.D. advisor was [[Harrison White]] and her thesis was entitled ''Consensus Construction''.<ref name="Vita"/>

==Career==
On leaving Harvard in 1984, Carley secured a position as Associate Professor of Sociology and Information Systems at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] where she remains based. In 1990 she became Associate Professor of Sociology and Organizations, in 1998 Professor of Sociology, Organizations and IT, and in 2002 attained her current role as Professor of Computation, Organization and Society. Since 1998 she has also held appointments in other CMU schools and departments; the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Heinz College, Tepper School of Business and Department of Engineering and Public Policy.<ref name="Vita"/>

==Research==
Carley's research combines [[cognitive science]], [[sociology]] and [[computer science]] to address complex social and organizational problems. Her most notable research contribution was the establishment of [[dynamic network analysis]] (DNA). She has also contributed to research on computational social and organization theory,<ref>Geoffrey P. Morgan and Kathleen M.

Her research on dynamic network analysis has resulted in tools for analyzing large-scale dynamic networks and various multi-agent simulation systems. Her CASOS group has developed tools for text-mining semantic networks (AutoMap), [[agent based model|simulating]] [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] models (BioWar), and simulating [[Clandestine cell system|covert networks]] (DyNet).

Carley is the founding co-editor and co-[[editor-in-chief]] of the journal ''[[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/business+for+professionals/journal/10588?detailsPage=editorialBoard |title=Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (Editorial Board) |access-date=9 April 2011}}</ref> She has co-edited several books in the computational organizations and dynamic network area.
