== Early life and career ==
Reich was born to a Jewish family in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the son of Mildred Freshman (née Dorf) and Edwin Saul Reich (1914–2016), who owned a women's clothing store.<ref name="NNDB">{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/486/000055321/|title=Robert Reich|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=May 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHRmAAAAMAAJ&q=Robert+Reich+scranton |title=Newsmakers: the people behind today's headlines : 1995 cumulation, includes ... – Louise Mooney Collins, Gale Research Inc – Google Books |access-date=November 9, 2012|isbn=9780810357457 |year=1995 |author1=Lins }}</ref> As a child, he was diagnosed with [[multiple epiphyseal dysplasia]], also known as Fairbank's disease, a bone disorder that results in short stature among other symptoms. This condition made him a target for bullies and he sought out the protection of older boys; one of them was [[Michael Schwerner]], who was one of the three civil rights workers [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|murdered in Mississippi]] by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1964 for the registration of African-American voters. Reich cites this event as an inspiration to "fight the bullies, to protect the powerless, to make sure that the people without a voice have a voice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2011/11/18/transcript-robert-reichs-speech-at/|title=Transcript: Robert Reich's speech at Occupy Cal|first=Robert | last=Reich|publisher=[[The Daily Californian]]|date=November 18, 2011|access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>

At Yale, he was classmates with Bill and Hillary Clinton, [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Michael Medved]], and [[Richard Blumenthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/interviews/reich.html |title=Interviews – Robert Reich &#124; The Clinton Years &#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=January 16, 2001 |access-date=May 26, 2012}}</ref>

From 1973 to 1974, he served as law clerk to Judge [[Frank M. Coffin]], chief judge of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]; and from 1974 to 1976 was assistant to the [[U.S. Solicitor General]], [[Robert Bork]] (at Yale, Reich had studied [[antitrust law]] under Bork<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLfO-2t1qPQ&t=7m54s The Monopolization of America], published on Robert Reich's YouTube channel (May 6, 2018)</ref>).  In 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed him director of the Policy Planning Staff at the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

From 1980 until 1992, Reich taught at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard University, where he wrote a series of influential books and articles, including ''The Next American Frontier'' and ''The Work of Nations''.

== Tenure as Secretary of Labor ==
[[File:rbreich.jpg|thumb|Official Department of Labor portrait of Robert Reich]]
Bill Clinton incorporated Reich's thinking into his 1992 campaign platform, "Putting People First", and after being elected invited Reich to head his economic transition team. Reich later joined the administration as [[Secretary of Labor]]. During his tenure, he implemented the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] (FMLA) and successfully lobbied to increase the [[minimum wage]].<ref name=cnn>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/1996/08/20/economy/pension_pkg/ | work=CNN Money | title=U.S. minimum wage hike | date=August 20, 1996}}</ref>

In addition, Reich used the office as a platform for focusing national attention on the need to help American workers to adapt to the new economy. He popularized the term "[[corporate welfare]]"—arguing that the nation could get the money it needed to retrain people and move them from welfare to work by cutting "aid for dependent corporations". He advocated that the country provide more opportunities for workers to learn technological skills.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== After the Clinton administration ==
In 1996, between Clinton's re-election and second inauguration, Reich decided to leave the department to spend more time with his sons, then in their teen years. He published his experiences working for the Clinton administration in ''Locked in the Cabinet''. After publication of the book, Reich received criticism for embellishing events with invented dialogue. The paperback release of the memoir revised or omitted the inventions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE2DA173EF937A15751C0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Now!

[[File:Robert Reich University of Iowa Sep 7 2011.jpg|thumb|Robert Reich in 2011]]
In early 2005, there was speculation that Reich would once again seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts. He instead endorsed the then-little-known candidacy of [[Deval Patrick]], who had previously served as [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for Civil Rights in the Clinton Administration. Patrick won the party's endorsement, a three-way primary with nearly 50% of the vote, and the general election in November 2006.

In September 2005 Reich testified against [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] at his confirmation hearings for [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court]].

On January 1, 2006, Reich joined the faculty of UC Berkeley's [[Goldman School of Public Policy]]. Since then, he has taught a popular undergraduate course called Wealth and Poverty, in addition to his graduate courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/7345 |title=University of California – UC Newsroom &#124; Robert Reich to join School of Public Policy |publisher=Universityofcalifornia.edu |date=July 22, 2005 |access-date=May 26, 2012}}</ref> Reich is also a member of the board of trustees for the Blum Center for Developing Economies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Maclay |first=Kathleen |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/04/19_blum.shtml |title=4.19.2006 – Blum Center to develop sustainable solutions to issues facing world's poor |publisher=Berkeley.edu |date=April 19, 2006 |access-date=May 26, 2012}}</ref> The center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blumcenter.berkeley.edu |title=Blum Center for Developing Economies &#124; Real-World Solutions to Combat Poverty |publisher=Blumcenter.berkeley.edu |access-date=May 26, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, he teamed up with filmmaker [[Jacob Kornbluth]] to produce the documentary ''[[Inequality for All]]'', based on his book ''Aftershock'' which won a Special Jury Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

On February 26, 2016, he endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]] for President of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/robert-reich-bernie-sanders-endorsement-bill-clinton-hillary-secretary-of-labor|title=Former secretary of labor endorses Sanders|work=TheHill|date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> After Sanders ended his campaign, Reich urged Sanders's supporters to back eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.<ref name="DEMOCRACYNOW">{{ cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/4/as_green_party_convention_opens_watch | title=Chris Hedges vs. Robert Reich on Clinton, Third Parties, Capitalism & Next Steps for Sanders Backers | work=[[Democracy Now!]] | date=August 4, 2016 | access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> Since at least summer 2016, Reich has contributed an opinion column to ''[[Newsweek]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-corrupt-state-so-much-worse-his-imaginary-deep-state-opinion-1445302|title=Trump's Corrupt State is so much worse than his imaginary Deep State {{!}} Opinion|date=June 21, 2019|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trump-establishment-guy-478513|title=Robert Reich: Trump's the establishment guy|date=July 7, 2016|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref> In 2020, he again endorsed Bernie Sanders for President.<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Reich |first=Robert |user=RBReich |number=1232771608739074048 |title=The best way for Democrats to defeat Trump’s fake anti-establishment populism is with the real thing, coupled with an agenda of systemic reform.

In 2017, he again teamed up with Jacob Kornbluth to produce the documentary ''Saving Capitalism'', based on his book of that name. [[Netflix]] chose the film to be a Netflix Original Documentary. In the documentary, Reich posits that large corporations began in the late 1960s to use financial power to purchase influence among the political class and consolidate political power, highlighting in particular the influence of the 2010 [[Citizens United v. FEC|Citizens United]] ruling that allowed corporations to contribute to election campaigns. In the documentary, he advocates for grassroots political mobilization among working class Americans to countervail the political power of corporate America.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Kornbluth, Jacob; Gilman, Sari (Directors) | date=November 21, 2017 | title=Saving Capitalism | medium=Motion picture | location=USA}}</ref>

[[File:Robert Reich, Policy Network, April 6 2009, detail.jpg|thumb|right|Reich speaking in 2009]]
In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Reich explained that "I don't believe in redistribution of wealth for the sake of redistributing wealth. But I am concerned about how we can afford to pay for what we as a nation need to do [...] [Taxes should pay] for what we need in order to be safe and productive. As [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] once wrote, 'taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.{{'"}}<ref name=freakonomics>{{cite news|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/robert-reich-answers-your-labor-questions/ | work=The New York Times | title=Robert Reich Answers Your Labor Questions | first=Stephen J. | last=Dubner | date=May 1, 2008 | access-date=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

In response to a question as to what to recommend to the incoming president regarding a fair and sustainable income and wealth distribution, Reich said: "Expand the [[Earned income tax credit|Earned Income Tax Credit]]—a wage supplement for lower-income people, and finance it with a higher marginal income tax on the top five percent. For the longer term, invest in education for lower income communities, starting with early-childhood education and extending all the way up to better access to post-secondary education."<ref name=freakonomics />

Reich is pro-[[trade union|union]], saying: "Unionization is not just good for workers in unions, unionization is very, very important for the economy overall, and would create broad benefits for the United States."<ref>{{ cite web | first=Robert | last=Reich |url=http://robertreich.org/post/257310148 | title=Why We Need Stronger Unions and How to Get Them | work=Robert Reich's blog | date=January 27, 2009 | access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> He also favors raising the federal minimum wage to $15/hr across three years, believing that it will not adversely impact big business, and will increase higher value worker availability.<ref>{{ cite web | first=Robert | last=Reich | title=Why The Minimum Wage Should Really Be Raised To $15 An Hour |url=http://robertreich.org/post/82134788482 | date=April 8, 2014 | access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref>

Reich also supports an unconditional and [[universal basic income]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/3/26/1287365/-Robert-Reich-Universal-Basic-Income-In-The-US-Almost-Inevitable|title=Robert Reich: Universal Basic Income In The US 'Almost Inevitable'|publisher=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=May 18, 2017}}</ref> On the eve of a June 2016 popular vote in Switzerland on basic income, he declared that countries will have to introduce this instrument sooner or later.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/der-mittelstand-wird-verschwinden/story/25271560|title=Ohne Grundeinkommen wird es nicht gehen|first=Mit Robert Reich sprach Michael|last=Soukup|date=February 5, 2016|access-date=May 18, 2017|via=www.tagesanzeiger.ch|newspaper=Tages-Anzeiger}}</ref>

While affordable housing has been a central issue in Reich's activism, in July 2020 Reich opposed a high-density development project in his own neighborhood in Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yelimeli|first=Supriya|date=2020-08-07|title=Landmarking fails for 130-year-old Berkeley house in passionate debate over housing, history|url=https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/08/07/landmarking-fails-for-130-year-old-berkeley-house-in-passionate-debate-over-housing-and-history|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Berkeleyside|language=en-US}}</ref> He supported making a 120-year-old triplex a landmark to prevent the construction of a 10-apartment building, one of which would be [[Covenant (law)|deed restricted]] to be rented to a low income tenant, citing "the character of the neighborhood".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Planning_and_Development/Level_3_-_LPC/2020-08-06_LPC_ATT%204_1915%20Berryman_Correspondence%20Received.pdf |title=Preservation of the Payson House |author=Robert B.

Although a supporter of Israel, Reich has criticized Israel's [[Israeli settlement|settlement building]] in the occupied [[Palestinian territories]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Former US secretary: Netanyahu speech 'poisoning' ties |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/former-us-secretary-netanyahu-speech-poisoning-ties/ |work=The Times of Israel |date=1 March 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, with Jacob Kornbluth, Reich founded Inequality Media, which produces videos, live interviews on Facebook, portions of his undergraduate class at Berkeley, and long-form videos. The purpose is to educate the public about the implications of the widening inequalities of income, wealth, and political power. Reich and Kornbluth have produced more than 90 videos of two minutes each about the economy and current events, that have been watched by more than 50 million people.

Since shortly after the 2017 inauguration Reich has produced a "Resistance Report" program, offering contextual analysis of latest White House and Cabinet activities, typically a 15- to 30-minute presentation, available on social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5HsClUUEJ4zuCSNtd1ssQ|title=Inequality Media Civic Action|publisher=YouTube|access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref>
