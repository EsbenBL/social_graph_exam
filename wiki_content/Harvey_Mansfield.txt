'''Harvey Claflin Mansfield Jr.''' (born March 21, 1932) is an American [[political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He is the [[William R. Kenan, Jr.]] [[Professor]] of Government at [[Harvard University]], where he has taught since 1962. He has held [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] and [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] Fellowships and has been a Fellow at the [[National Humanities Center]]; he also received the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2004 and delivered the [[Jefferson Lecture]] in 2007. He is a Carol G. Simon Senior Fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]]. He is notable for his generally [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance on political issues in his writings.

Mansfield is the author and co-translator of studies of and/or by major political philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]], of [[Constitution|Constitutional government]], and of ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'' (2006). In interviews Mansfield has acknowledged the work of [[Leo Strauss]] as the key modern influence on his own political philosophy.<ref name=HarlanKagay>See, e.g.,&nbsp;Josh Harlan and Christopher Kagay, [http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hrp/issues/1993/Mansfield.pdf "Harvey C.

==Early life and education==
Mansfield's father, [[Harvey Mansfield Sr.]], had been editor of the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', and was the Ruggles Professor Emeritus of Public Law and Government at [[Columbia University]] at the time of his death in 1988 at the age of 83.<ref name=dies>{{cite news|title=Harvey Mansfield, 83; Taught at Columbia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/10/obituaries/harvey-mansfield-83-taught-at-columbia.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 May 1988}}</ref> Mansfield has been at Harvard since his own student days in 1949, having joined the faculty in 1962. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] at Harvard in 1953, served in the United States Army in Virginia and France, and then received his [[Ph.D.]] from Harvard 1961.

==Personal life==
Mansfield was married to Delba Winthrop, with whom he co-translated and co-authored work on [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]].

==Career==
===''A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy''===
In his 2001 book ''A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy'', Mansfield traces the history of political philosophy in "the great books" written by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Rousseau]], and others of the "highest rank" (1).<ref name=MansfieldSGTPP>Harvey C. Mansfield, ''A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy'' (Wilmington, Delaware: ISI Books, 2001). {{ISBN|1-882926-43-9}}. (Subsequent parenthetical references to this work follow in the text.)</ref> He also finds [[political philosophy]] in practical [[politics]], which Mansfield considers necessarily partisan, because it involves citizens "arguing passionately pro and con with advocacy and denigration, accusation and defense" (2). He argues that politics does not merely consist of liberal and conservative options, but rather, they are fundamentally opposed to each other, with each side defending its own interest as it attempts to appeal to the [[common good]] (2). Since such adversarial sides in a political dispute appeal to the common good, an observer of the dispute can use his capacity to reason to judge which side supplies the most compelling arguments. If such an observer is competent to be a judge, he or she may be thought of as a political philosopher, or as at least on the way to engaging in political philosophy (2–3).

Mansfield stresses the connection between politics and political philosophy, but he does not find [[political philosophy]] in [[political science]], which for Mansfield is a rival to political philosophy and "apes" the natural sciences (3–5). From Mansfield's point of view, [[political science]] replaces words like "good", "just", and "noble" with other words like "utility" or "preferences." The terms are meant to be neutral, but as a result of the political scientist's purported change of role and perspective from judge to so‑called "disinterested observer", such a "scientist" is not able to determine whose arguments are the best, because he or she falls victim to [[relativism]], which, according to Mansfield, is "a sort of lazy [[dogmatism]]" (4–5).

In his guide, Mansfield reminds students that political science rebelled from political philosophy in the seventeenth century and declared itself distinct and separate in the [[Positivism|positivist]] movement of the late nineteenth century: thus, he argues in it that whereas "Today political science is often said to be 'descriptive' or 'empirical,' concerned with facts; political philosophy is called 'normative' because it expresses values. But these terms merely repeat in more abstract form the difference between political science, which seeks agreement, and political philosophy, which seeks the best" (6).

Furthermore, according to Mansfield, when people talk about the difference between political philosophy and political science, they are actually talking about two distinct kinds of political philosophy, one modern and the other ancient. The only way to understand modern political science and its ancient alternative fully, he stresses, is to enter the history of political philosophy, and to study the tradition handed down over the centuries: "No one can count himself educated who does not have some acquaintance with this tradition. It informs you of the leading possibilities of human life, and by giving you a sense of what has been tried and what is now dominant, it tells you ''where we are now'' in a depth not available from any other source" (7–8). Although modern political science feels no obligation to look at its roots, and might even denigrate the subject as if it could not be of any real significance, he says, "our reasoning shows that the history of political philosophy is required for understanding its substance" (7–8).

===Scholarship===
====Western civilization====
In response to [[multiculturalism]] on college campuses, Mansfield has defended the importance of preserving and teaching courses on [[Western civilization]], even proposing a survey course that selects a dozen or so books that capture the principal themes.  Mansfield believes that understanding Western civilization is important because the books that explain it deal with problems associated with the human condition.<ref name="The Hoover Institution"/>
====Defense of the "strong executive"====
Mansfield has argued that the President of the United States has "extra-legal powers such as commanding the military, making treaties (and carrying on foreign policy), and pardoning the convicted, not to mention a veto of legislation", observing that the [[U.S. Constitution]] does not ask the President to take an oath to execute the laws, but rather, to execute "the ''office'' of the president, which is larger."<ref name=Mansfieldlawpres>Harvey Mansfield, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/563mevpm.asp "The Law and the President:] In a National Emergency, Who You Gonna Call?" ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', January 16, 2006, accessed February 5, 2007.</ref> Referring to domestic surveillance, Mansfield notes, "those arguing that the executive should be subject to checks and balances are wrong to say or imply that the president may be checked in the sense of stopped. The president can be held accountable and made responsible, but if he could be stopped, the Constitution would lack any sure means of emergency action.<ref name=Mansfieldlawpres/> He defends the [[separation of powers]], arguing that "the executive subordinated to the rule of law is in danger of being subordinate to the legislature."<ref>Harvey C. Mansfield, [http://opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110010014 "The Case for the Strong Executive:] Under Some Circumstances, the Rule of Law Must Yield to the Need for Energy", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 2, 2007, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref>

====''Taming the Prince''====
In his book ''Taming the Prince'', Mansfield traces the modern doctrine of executive power to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].  He argues that executive power had to be tamed to become compatible with liberal constitutionalism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mansfield|first=Harvey|title=Taming the Prince|year=1989|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York}}</ref>
====Gender roles and equality====
In his 2006 book ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'', Mansfield defended a moderately conservative understanding of [[gender role]]s, and bemoaned the loss of the virtue of [[Masculinity|manliness]] in a "[[Gender neutrality|gender neutral]]" society. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview, he defined the concept briefly as "confidence in a situation of risk. A manly man has to know what he is doing."<ref name="Of Manliness and Men">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/magazine/of-manliness-and-men.html|title=Of Manliness and Men|first=Deborah|last=Solomon|date=12 March 2006|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> He defines the idea in more concrete terms in the book. There, a manly man does not have to know what he is doing, but only has to act as though he does. Also in the book, Mansfield subjects the concept of manliness to a test in which he refers for support of his argument to such diverse authorities as [[Homer]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and Naomi Wood. In his argument, manliness is ultimately related to [[assertiveness]]—"decisiveness without complete knowledge"—and its place in society is debated. In an interview with Bill Kristol, Mansfield said, "What I wrote was a modest defense of manliness. And the emphasis [is] on modest because manliness can be bad as well as good. Not everyone who takes risks deserves to have them turn out right and so manliness is, I think, responsible for a lot of evil. You can say that terrorists are manly, they’re willing to risk their lives and give their lives for a principle they believe in or a point they believe in."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mansfield|first1=Harvey|title=Conversations with Bill Kristol|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/harvey-mansfield/|website=Conversations with Bill Kristol|access-date=8 October 2014}}</ref>

''Manliness'' was criticized by [[Martha Nussbaum]] in the June 22, 2006, issue of ''[[The New Republic]].''<ref name="Nausbaum Criticism">[http://www.powells.com/review/2006_06_22] from ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> Nussbaum accuses Mansfield of misreading, or refusing to read, many feminist and nonfeminist texts. She argues that his book is based on overt misogynistic assumptions that take a position of indifference towards [[violence against women]]. Mansfield asserts, she contends, that a woman can resist rape only with the aid of "a certain ladylike modesty enabling her to take offense at unwanted encroachment".<ref name="Nausbaum Criticism"/>

Concerning controversial comments by former President of Harvard, [[Lawrence Summers]], about mental differences between men and women, Mansfield said that it is "probably true" that women "innately have less capacity than men at the highest level of science...It's common sense if you just look at who the top scientists are".<ref name="Of Manliness and Men"/>

In 1993, Mansfield testified on behalf of Colorado's Amendment 2, which amended the state constitution to prevent gays, lesbians and bisexuals from pursuing legal claims of discrimination. In his testimony, he argued that being gay "is not a life that makes for happiness," that homosexuality is "shameful," and that by not being able to have children gay people were not "socially responsible."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1993/10/19/mansfield-speaks-in-gay-rights-trial/|title=Mansfield Speaks In Gay Rights Trial|date=19 October 1993|author=Anna D.

====Views on grades and affirmative action====
Mansfield has voiced criticism of [[grade inflation]] at [[Harvard University]], which he claims is due in part to [[affirmative action]].<ref name=grades>Harvey C. Mansfield, [http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i30/30b02401.htm "Point of View: Grade Inflation: It's Time to Face the Facts"], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', April 6, 2001, accessed June 18, 2007.</ref> Mansfield also participated in a debate on [[affirmative action]] between [[Cornel West]] and [[Michael Sandel]] (arguing for affirmative action) with [[Ruth Wisse]] and himself (arguing against affirmative action). The debate attracted a "massive audience" of a thousand Harvard students, requiring its campus venue to be changed twice before it could take place on November 3, 1997, in Harvard's [[Sanders Theater]], prompting Professor Sandel to comment, "'This puts to rest the myth that this generation has a political apathy, and apathy to political debates.'"<ref>As qtd. in Luke McLoughlin, [http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/1997/dec/walking.html "Walking the Walk: Dialogue Is Only a Prelude to Involvement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901213551/http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/1997/dec/walking.html |date=2006-09-01 }}, archived issue of ''[[Digitas]]'' (Dec. 1997), accessed February 6, 2007. [Digitas is "a student organization dedicated to new technology" at [[Harvard University]].]</ref> In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that "the most frequent grade is an A", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, "I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade".<ref>{{cite web| last =Slavov| first =Sita| title =How to Fix College Grade Inflation: Inflated grades are a serious problem, but there are ways to fix them.| website =US News & World Report| date =26 December 2013| url =https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/12/26/why-college-grade-inflation-is-a-real-problem-and-how-to-fix-it| access-date = 11 September 2015 }}</ref>

In response to [[grade inflation]], according to ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'' reporters Lulu Zhou and Rebecca D. O'Brien, Mansfield revived the "ironic" (or the "inflated") grade in 2006, in order to let his students know what they really deserved in his class without causing them harm by grading them lower than the other professors at Harvard: "In Mansfield’s 'true and serious' grading system, 5 percent of students will receive A’s, and 15 percent will receive A-minuses. But Mansfield won’t share those marks with anyone other than his teaching fellows and students. ... By contrast, Mansfield’s 'ironic' grade—the only one that will appear on official transcripts—will follow average grade distribution in the College, with about a quarter of students receiving A’s and another quarter receiving A-minu[s]es"; in contrast, their privately received deserved "real" (lower) grades usually centered around a C or C-minus, earning him the nickname "Harvey C-minus Mansfield."<ref>Lulu Zhou, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511242 "'C-minus' Prof to Give More As"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', February 13, 2006, accessed February 9, 2007.</ref> "This [grading] policy—meant to demonstrate the causes and effects of grade inflation—drew heat from students and faculty, and attracted national media attention."<ref name=OBrien>Rebecca D. O'Brien, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=348199 "Professor Fights Grade Inflation, Affirmative Action"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', June 2, 2003, accessed February 6, 2007.</ref> Mansfield himself has joked that his middle initial "C." stands for compassion: "That's what I lack when it comes to grading."<ref name=OBrien/> In an interview with the Hoover Institution, Mansfield claimed that college professors are too quick to label students as exceptional.<ref name="The Hoover Institution">{{cite web|title=Harvey Mansfield – The Left on Campus|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT-rixDQM9A|work=The Hoover Institution|publisher=The Hoover Institution|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref>
====Jefferson Lecture====
On May 8, 2007, Mansfield delivered the 36th [[Jefferson Lecture]] ("the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities", according to the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], which sponsored the lecture).<ref name=NEH>[http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20070322.html "Harvey Mansfield, Noted American Author and Political Theorist, to Deliver the 2007 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities"], press release, ''[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]'', March 22, 2007.</ref><ref name=NEHAboutJL>[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/Mansfield/HMabout.html "About the Jefferson Lecture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519000428/http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/Mansfield/HMabout.html |date=2007-05-19 }}, ''[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]'', accessed June 16, 2007.</ref><ref name=Mansfield>Harvey C. Mansfield, [https://archive.today/20070516081754/http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/Mansfield/HMlecture.html "How to Understand Politics: What the Humanities Can Say to Science"], 36th Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, presented on May 8, 2007, at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]], ''neh.gov'' ([[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]]), accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> In his lecture, Mansfield suggests "two improvements for today’s understanding of politics arising from the humanities ... first ... to recapture the notion of [[thumos]] in [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]... [and] ...second ... the use of names—proper to literature and foreign to science".<ref name=Mansfield/>

This is a reference to his own philosophy, which forbids discounting the wisdom of the past simply because those who spoke it lived a long time ago.
