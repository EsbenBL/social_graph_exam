[[File:NolanwithNolanChart1996.jpg|thumb|[[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]], founder of the Libertarian Party, with the [[Nolan Chart]]]]
The first [[Libertarian National Convention]] was held in June 1972. In 1978, [[Dick Randolph]] of [[Alaska]] became the first elected Libertarian [[State legislature (United States)|state legislator]]. Following the 1980 federal elections, the Libertarian Party assumed the title of being the third-largest party for the first time after the [[American Independent Party]] and the [[Conservative Party of New York]] (the other largest minor parties at the time) continued to decline. In 1994, over 40 Libertarians were elected or appointed which was a record for the party at that time. 1995 saw a soaring membership and voter registration for the party. In 1996, the Libertarian Party became the first [[Third party (United States)|third party]] to earn ballot status in all 50 states two [[United States presidential election|presidential]] [[Elections in the United States|elections]] in a row. By the end of 2009, 146 Libertarians were holding elected offices.<ref>"History." Libertarian Party of Kansas, lpks.org/history.</ref>

National convention delegates vote on changes to the party's national platform and bylaws and elect officers and "At-Large" representatives to the party's National Committee. The National Committee also has "Regional Representatives", some of whom are appointed by delegate caucuses at the national convention whereas others are appointed by the chairpersons of LP state affiliate chapters within a region.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovKfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA498|title=Political Groups, Parties, and Organizations that Shaped America: An Encyclopedia and Document Collection|last1=Ainsworth|first1=Scott H.|last2=Harward|first2=Brian M.|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=July 19, 2019|access-date=September 23, 2019|volume=2|page=498|isbn=978-1-4408-5196-4}}</ref>

=== State chapters ===
The Libertarian Party is organized in all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.

=== Membership ===
Since the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an "instant" membership, but these are referred to as "signature members". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party's national newspaper, ''LP News''.<ref>{{ISSN|8755-1373}}</ref> Since 2006, membership in the party's state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lpar.org/help/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221021341/http://lpar.org/help/|url-status=dead|title=Help the LPAR « Libertarian Party of Arkansas|archive-date=February 21, 2012}}</ref> with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.

Most rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to "bylaws-sustaining members" who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state's election laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016_LP_Bylaws_and_Convention_Rules_w_2016_JC_Rules.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=2016|website=lp.org}}</ref>

== Platform ==
{{Duplication|dupe=#Political positions|date=September 2019}}
The preamble outlines the party's goals: "As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others. [...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands". Its Statement of Principles begins: "We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D. Frank Robinson, The Libertarian Party Statement of Principles |work= Independent Political Report |date = December 28, 2015 |access-date = June 25, 2016 }}</ref>

The platform emphasizes individual liberty in personal and economic affairs, avoidance of "foreign entanglements" and military and economic [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] in other nations' affairs, and free trade and migration. The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a "Self-determination" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: "Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty". It also includes an "Omissions" section which reads: "Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval".<ref name=platform/>

The party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> In 2018, the Libertarian Party became the first in the United States to call for the decriminalization of sex work.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://reason.com/2018/07/02/libertarians-call-for-sex-work-decrim/ |title = Libertarian Party Adopts New Sex Work Plank |access-date = May 5, 2020}}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some "good-faith" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name="abortion1.4">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

The Statement of Principles was written by [[John Hospers]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies|volume=13|number=2|date=September 1998|pages=153–165|title=A Libertarian Argument Against Open Borders}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's bylaws specify that a 7/8ths supermajority of delegates is required to change the Statement of Principles.<ref>Article 3, section 1</ref> Any proposed platform plank found by the Judicial Committee to conflict with the Statement requires approval by a three-fourths supermajority of delegates.<ref>Rule 5</ref> Early platform debates included at the second convention whether to support [[tax resistance]] and at the 1974 convention whether to support [[anarchism]].

The first Libertarian presidential candidate, [[John Hospers]], received one electoral vote in 1972 when [[Roger MacBride]], a [[Virginia]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[faithless elector]] pledged to [[Richard Nixon]], cast his ballot for the Libertarian ticket. His vote for [[Tonie Nathan|Theodora ("Tonie") Nathan]] as vice president was the first electoral college vote ever to be cast for a woman in a United States presidential election.<ref>"{{cite web |url=http://www.fairvote.org/e_college/faithless.htm#4 |title=Faithless Electors |publisher=[[Center for Voting and Democracy]] |access-date=July 25, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906231513/http://www.fairvote.org/e_college/faithless.htm#4 |archive-date=September 6, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> MacBride became the Libertarian presidential nominee himself in 1976. This was the last time that the Libertarian Party won an electoral vote until 44 years later, in the 2016 presidential election, when [[Texas]] Republican faithless elector Bill Greene, who was pledged to cast his vote for [[Donald Trump]], instead cast his vote for Libertarian Party member, 1988 presidential nominee, and former Republican representative [[Ron Paul]] for president.<ref>[https://www.texastribune.org/2016/12/19/watch-texas-electoral-college-vote-begins-texas-ca/ Texas electors cast 36 votes for Trump, 1 for Kasich, 1 for Ron Paul].

During the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], [[Gary Johnson]] and vice presidential candidate [[Bill Weld]] received a record percentage of 3.29% of the popular vote (4,489,233 votes),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip |website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> getting 9.34% in [[2016 United States presidential election in New Mexico|New Mexico]], where Johnson had previously been elected governor.

=== Earning ballot status ===
Historically, Libertarians have achieved 50-state [[ballot access]] for their presidential candidate five times: in 1980, 1992, 1996, (in 2000, [[L.

=== Party supporters ===
In the Libertarian Party, some donors are not necessarily "members" because the party since its founding in 1972 has defined a "member" as being someone who agrees with the party's membership statement. The precise language of this statement is found in the party Bylaws.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/bylaws.shtml Official Bylaws] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605025750/http://www.lp.org/organization/bylaws.shtml |date=June 5, 2008 }} of the Libertarian Party. Retrieved May 14, 2007</ref> As of the end of 2017, there were 138,815 Americans who were on record as having signed the membership statement.<ref name="hq.lp.org">{{Cite web|url=http://hq.lp.org/pipermail/lnc-business/attachments/20180103/93c34956/attachment-0001.pdf|title=Libertarian National Committee Membership Report, December, 2017}}</ref> A survey by David Kirby and [[David Boaz]] found a minimum of 14 percent of American voters to have libertarian-leaning views.<ref>{{cite web |first = David |last = Boaz |url = http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2010/01/22/how-many-libertarian-voters-are-there/ |title = How Many Libertarian Voters Are There? |work = Cato@Liberty |publisher = Cato Institute |date = January 22, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1 = David |last1 = Kirby |first2 = David |last2 = Boaz |url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa658.pdf |title = The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama |work = Policy Analysis |page = 1 |publisher = Cato Institute |date = January 21, 2010 }}</ref>

There is another measure the party uses internally as well. Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party's presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.<ref name="hq.lp.org"/>

Historically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s and in 1991 they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0.<ref>"[http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml LNC Approves Zero Dues]", ''LP News'', September 1, 2005. Retrieved on July 25, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416112128/http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml |date=April 16, 2007 }}</ref> However, the change to $0 dues was controversial and was ''de facto'' reversed by the 2006 [[Libertarian National Convention]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], at which the members re-established a basic $25 dues category (now called Sustaining membership) and further added a requirement that all National Committee officers must henceforth be at least sustaining members (which was not required prior to the convention).

=== Registered voters ===
Ballot access expert and editor of ''[[Ballot Access News]]'' [[Richard Winger]] periodically compiles and analyzes voter registration statistics as reported by state voter agencies and he reports that as of early 2020 the party ranked third in voter registration nationally with 693,634 .<ref>{{cite web |url = http://ballot-access.org/2020/03/27/march-2020-ballot-access-news-print-edition/ |title = March 2020 Ballot Access News Print Edition |website = ballot-access.org }}</ref>

=== Libertarians in office ===
[[File:Marshall Burt (51031273467) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Wyoming State Representative]] [[Marshall Burt]] (L–[[Green River, Wyoming|Green River]])|upright=0.8]]

Libertarians have had limited success in electing candidates at the state and local level. Since the party's creation, 10 Libertarians have been elected to [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] and some other state legislators have switched parties after being originally elected as Republicans or Democrats. The most recent Libertarian candidate elected to a state legislature was [[Marshall Burt]] to the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]] in 2020. The party elected multiple legislators in New Hampshire during the 1990s as well as in Alaska during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://100years.akleg.gov/bio.php?id=1077|title=100 Years of Alaska's Legislature|website=100years.akleg.gov|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> One of the party's Alaska state legislators, [[Andre Marrou]] was nominated for vice president in 1988 and for president in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqMhWHxF_ko|title=Andre Marrou, Libertarian Candidate for President, 1992. Interview part 1 of 2.|last=Samuel Wilson|date=November 4, 2008|access-date=June 21, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

As of 2017, there were 168 Libertarians holding elected office: 58 of them partisan offices and 110 of them non-partisan offices.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/candidates/elected-officials |title = Elected-Officials; Libertarian Party |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 3, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, some party members, who were elected to public office on other party lines, explicitly retained their Libertarian Party membership and these include former Representative Ron Paul, who has repeatedly stated that he remains a life member of the Libertarian Party.

Previously, the party has had four sitting members of state legislatures. [[Laura Ebke]] served in the nonpartisan [[Nebraska Legislature]] and announced her switch from being a Republican to a Libertarian in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/frustrated-state-sen-laura-ebke-switches-from-republican-to-libertarian/article_4bce0112-4914-58fb-abd1-efb9f3acd6e7.html|title='Frustrated' State Sen.

A [[Monmouth University]] opinion poll conducted on March 24, 2016 found Libertarian candidate [[Gary Johnson]] in double digits with 11% against [[Donald Trump]] (34%) and [[Hillary Clinton]] (42%) in a three-way race<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/24/libertarian-gary-johnson-double-digits-race-agains/ |title = Poll shows Gary Johnson in double digits in 3-way race against Clinton, Trump |date = March 24, 2016 |last = Sherfinski |first = David |work = The Washington Times |access-date = May 14, 2016 }}</ref> while a [[CNN]] poll from July 16, 2016, found Johnson with a personal best 13% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/17/rel8a.-.2016.pdf |title=Images |website=i2.cdn.turner.com }}</ref> To be included in any of the three main presidential debates, a candidate must be polling at least 15% in national polls.

Following Trump's win in the Indiana Republican primary, making him the presumptive Republican nominee, the Libertarian Party received a rise in attention. Between 7 pm on May 3 and 12 pm on May 4, the Libertarian Party received 99 new memberships and an increase in donors as well as a rise in [[Google]] searches of "Libertarian Party" and "Gary Johnson".<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/libertarian-party-membership-applications-double-after-trump-becomes-gop-nominee/article/2590367 |title = Libertarian Party membership applications double after Trump becomes GOP nominee |last = Schow |first = Ashe |work = Washington Examiner |date = May 4, 2016 |access-date = May 10, 2016 }}</ref> On May 5, [[Mary Matalin]], a longtime Republican political strategist, made news when she switched parties to become a registered Libertarian, expressing her dislike of Trump.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mary-matalin-registered-independent-222882 |title = Mary Matalin registers as Libertarian, says 'I'm a provisional Trumpster' |last = Gass |first = Nick |date = May 6, 2016 |work = Politico |access-date = May 10, 2016 }}</ref>

In response, Libertarian 2016 nominee Gary Johnson noted that analysis of national polls shows more votes drawn from [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRxe-3tb1v0 |title = Will The Libertarian Ticket Benefit From The Colbert Bump? |date = June 10, 2016 |access-date = June 10, 2016 }}</ref>

Johnson would go on to receive [[2016 United States presidential election#Results by state|3.3%]] of the nationwide popular vote, with his best performance (9.3%) coming in New Mexico, where he previously served as a two-term governor.

After the conclusion of the Electoral College in 2016, the Libertarian Party received one electoral college vote from a faithless elector in Texas. However, the party's 2016 nominee Gary Johnson did not receive the vote. The single faithless vote went instead to former Republican Congressman [[Ron Paul]], who had rejoined the Libertarian Party in 2015. He is the first Libertarian to receive an electoral vote since 1972.

=== Politicians leaving their parties for the Libertarians ===
[[File:Justin Amash official photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Representative [[Justin Amash]], the first Libertarian member of Congress]]
After presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] won Indiana's 2016 Republican primary, several Republican officeholders left the Party and changed their affiliation to the Libertarian Party. The first to do so was [[John Moore (Nevada politician)|John Moore]], a then-sitting Assemblyman in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/nevada-state-assemblyman-john-moore-joins-libertarian-party|title=Nevada State Assemblyman John Moore Joins Libertarian Party|website=Libertarian Party|access-date=May 12, 2016|date=January 8, 2016}}</ref> Following the 2016 Nebraska State Legislative Session, state Senator [[Laura Ebke]] announced her displeasure with the Republican Party and announced she was registering as a Libertarian. After that, [[Mark B. Madsen]], a Utah State Senator, switched from the Republican Party to the Libertarian Party. From February to June 2017, three New Hampshire State Representatives ([[Caleb Q. Dyer]], [[Joseph Stallcop]] and [[Brandon Phinney]]) left the Republican and Democratic Parties and joined the Libertarian Party. In January 2018, [[New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands]] [[Aubrey Dunn Jr.]] switched his party registration from Republican to Libertarian and subsequently announced he would run as the Libertarian nominee for the [[2018 United States Senate election in New Mexico|Senate election in New Mexico]]. Dunn was the first Libertarian in a partisan statewide office and was the highest ever official from the Libertarian Party until US Representative [[Justin Amash]] switched his party registration from independent to Libertarian on April 29, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Justin Amash Becomes the First Libertarian Member of Congress|url=https://reason.com/2020/04/29/justin-amash-becomes-the-first-libertarian-member-of-congress/|date=2020-04-29|website=Reason.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> In December 2020 Maine House of Representatives member John Andrews changed his party registration to Libertarian after winning re-election as a Republican.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballot-access.org/2020/12/14/maine-legislator-john-andrews-joins-libertarian-party/|title=Maine Legislator John Andrews Joins Libertarian Party &#124; Ballot Access News}}</ref>

There have also been a number of politicians who joined the Libertarian Party, sometimes only briefly, after having left office, including former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], former Massachusetts Governor [[William Weld]], former Rhode Island Governor [[Lincoln Chafee]], former Alaska United States Senator [[Mike Gravel]], former Georgia Congressman [[Bob Barr]], and former Texas Congressman [[Ron Paul]].

== Presidential ballot access ==
The Libertarian Party has placed a presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, as well as D. C., six times: 1980, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2016, and 2020. That level of ballot access has only been achieved by a third-party candidate four other times ([[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in 1980, [[Lenora Fulani]] in 1988, and [[Ross Perot]] in 1992 and 1996.) Although the territory of [[Guam]] has no electoral votes, it began holding presidential preference elections in 1980. The Libertarian Party presidential candidate has appeared on the ballot in Guam in every election from 1980 through 2020, except for 2016. Anderson and Fulani were also on the ballot in Guam.<ref>{{cite web|author=Guam Election Commission|url=https://gec.guam.gov/index.php/about-the-gec/reports-studies-publications|title=Reports, Studies & Publications|publisher=Gec.guam.gov|access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref>

The following is a table comparison of ballot status for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee from 1972 to 2020. In some instances the candidate appeared on the ballot as an independent.

== Political positions ==
[[File:Libertarian Party Porcupine (USA).svg|thumb|Libertarian Party Porcupine]]
The Libertarian Party supports ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] and the abolition of the modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems "social" and "economic" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>

=== Economic issues ===
The "poverty and welfare" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |title = Poverty and Welfare |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 17, 2016 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160504174949/http://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |archive-date = May 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>According to the party platform: "The only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected" (adopted May 2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/current-issues|title=Current Issues|publisher=Libertarian Party|access-date=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507012119/http://www.lp.org/issues/current-issues|archive-date=May 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The Libertarian Party believes [[Economic regulation#Criticism of economic regulation|government regulations]] in the form of [[minimum wage law]]s drive up the [[Minimum wage#Debate over consequences|cost of employing additional workers]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |title = Poverty and Welfare |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150511125038/http://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |archive-date = May 11, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> That is why Libertarians favor loosening minimum wage laws so that overall [[Economy of the United States#Employment|unemployment rate]] can be reduced and low-wage workers, unskilled workers, [[Immigration to the United States|visa immigrants]] and those with limited education or job experience can find employment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ca.lp.org/lp20090420.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113063659/http://www.ca.lp.org/lp20090420.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Time to Tax Sacramento with Tough Love|archive-date=January 13, 2010}}</ref>

==== Education ====
The party supports ending the [[Education in the United States|public school system]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform#2.9 |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = July 29, 2016 }}</ref> The party's official platform states that education is best provided by the free market, achieving greater quality, accountability and efficiency with more diversity of [[school choice]]. Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>

==== Environment ====
{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}
The Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that "governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection".<ref name="Platform">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name="Platform"/>

==== Fiscal policies ====
[[File:Libertarian at the Tea Party tax day protest 2010 (4526050598).jpg|thumb|Libertarian protester at the 2010 Tea Party tax day, St. Paul, Minnesota]]
The Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name="Platform" />

==== Healthcare ====
The Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it "recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of health insurance they want, the level of health care they want, the care providers they want, the medicines and treatments they will use and all other aspects of their medical care, including end-of-life decisions". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor "consumer-driven health care".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines and medicine across international borders.

==== Immigration and trade agreements ====
The Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that "political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries".<ref name="lp.org">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders. However, the party encourages blocking immigration of those with violent backgrounds or violent intent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Immigration|url=https://www.lp.org/issues/immigration/|website=Libertarian Party|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref>

==== Labor ====
The Libertarian Party supports the repeal of all laws which impede the ability of any person to find employment while opposing government-fostered/forced retirement and heavy interference in the [[collective bargaining|bargaining process]]. The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name="Platform"/>

==== Retirement and Social Security ====
The party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name="Platform" />

=== Social issues ===
The Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|access-date=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name="Eagles Johnston">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name="Libertarian struggle">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12–13, 1996}}</ref><ref name="Co-founder">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="GALLOWAY Libertarian">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography and prostitution|pornography]],<ref name="Eagles Johnston"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name="Eagles Johnston"/><ref name="Libertarian struggle"/><ref name="Co-founder"/><ref name="GALLOWAY Libertarian"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|access-date=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archive-date=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> has always supported the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name="Co-founder"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name="Freedom of Speech">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archive-date=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name="Libertarian struggle"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name="ontheissues.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|access-date=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: "Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

[[File:LP-Prochoice-Rally-DC-11-12-1989.jpg|thumb|A Libertarian banner at an abortion rights rally]]

==== Abortion ====
{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on abortion}}
The official Libertarian party platform states: "Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration".<ref name="abortion1.4"/> Libertarians have very different opinions on the issue, just like in the general public. Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression against a baby, therefore necessitating government intervention to prevent it. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> The party has nominated both Pro-Life and Pro-Choice candidates and does not take a strong stance on the issue in general.

==== Crime and capital punishment ====
{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}
Shortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a "Libertarian Party Program on Crime" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name="ontheissues.org"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name="lp.org"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 "2016 platform"].</ref>

==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====
The Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: "We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States "with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform".<ref name="Freedom of Speech"/>

==== Government reform ====
The Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name="auto"/>

==== LGBT issues ====
The Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archive-date=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: "Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws".<ref name=Platform/>

Gay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012). Many LGBT political candidates have run for office on the Libertarian Party ticket<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Gallagher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT46|title=It's my party|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=October 29, 1996}}</ref> and there have been numerous LGBT caucuses in the party, with the most active in recent years being the Outright Libertarians. With regard to [[non-discrimination law]]s protecting LGBT people, the party is more divided, with some Libertarians supporting such laws, and others opposing them on the grounds that they violate [[freedom of association]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fee.org/articles/freedom-of-association-is-no-excuse-to-target-gays/ | title=Freedom of Association is No Excuse to Target Gays &#124; Casey Given| date=March 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cato.org/blog/against-enda |title = Against ENDA|date = November 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Libertarian Party of Washington]] encouraged voters to approve [[Washington Referendum 71 (2009)|Washington Referendum 71]] that extended [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT relationship rights]]. According to the party, withholding [[Domestic partnership in the United States|domestic partnership]] rights from [[same-sex couple]]s is a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>Christopher Mangum, [http://www.advocate.com/printArticle.aspx?id=100523 Libertarians Endorse R-71] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919032631/http://www.advocate.com/printArticle.aspx?id=100523|date=September 19, 2011}}, ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', October 21, 2009.</ref> In September 2010, in the light of the failure to repeal the "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" policy (which banned openly gay people from serving in the military) during the [[Obama administration]], the Libertarian Party urged gay voters to stop supporting the Democratic Party and vote Libertarian instead.<ref>{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Bolcer|url=http://advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/24/Libertarians_to_Gays_We_Want_You/|title=Libertarians to Gays: We Want You|work=The Advocate|date=September 24, 2010}}</ref> The policy was repealed at the end of 2010.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg|title=With Obama's Signature, 'Don't Ask' Is Repealed|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23military.html|access-date=December 22, 2010}}</ref>

==== Pornography and prostitution ====
The Libertarian Party views attempts by government to control [[obscenity]] or [[pornography]] as "an abridgment of liberty of expression"<ref name="Freedom of Speech"/> and opposes any government intervention to regulate it. According to former Libertarian National Committee chairman [[Mark Hinkle]], "Federal anti-[[obscenity]] laws are unconstitutional in two ways. First, because the Constitution does not grant Congress any power to regulate or criminalize obscenity, and second, because the First Amendment guarantees the right of [[free speech]]".<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/ridiculous-pornography-trial-violates-constitution|title=Ridiculous pornography trial violates Constitution|publisher=Libertarian Party|access-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref> This also means that the party supports the legalization of prostitution.<ref name="Eagles Johnston"/><ref name="Libertarian struggle"/><ref name="Co-founder"/><ref name="GALLOWAY Libertarian"/> Many men and women<ref name="Ex call-girl">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2JFdAAAAIBAJ&pg=6766,3289732&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Ex-call girl seeks 'legal prostitution' job|work=The Telegraph-Herald|date=July 20, 1986}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref name="Minor Party">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1084251322.html?dids=1084251322:1084251322&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+13%2C+1986&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Bully+for+Minor+Party+Candidates&pqatl=google|title=Bully for Minor Party Candidates|last= Stall|first= Bill|page= B5|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 13, 1986|quote=There is Norma Jean Almodovar, the former Los Angeles prostitute running on the Libertarian Party ticket.}}</ref><ref name=Salon>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/feature/2008/10/31/prop_k|title=Prostitutes before pimps|work=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|quote=After the meeting, Liu got into a friendly debate with Starchild—this is the Bay Area, folks!—a well-known sex worker and outreach director for the local Libertarian Party.}}</ref><ref name="Candidate fights">{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=1120|title=Candidate fights solicitation charge|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|quote=A member of the Libertarian Party and an activist for sex worker rights, Starchild has lashed out at the Fremont Police Department…}}</ref> with backgrounds in prostitution and activists for [[sex workers' rights]], such as [[Norma Jean Almodovar]]<ref name="Ex call-girl"/><ref name="Minor Party"/> and Starchild,<ref name=Salon/><ref name="Candidate fights"/> have run for office on the Libertarian Party ticket or are active members of the party.

==== Second and Fourth Amendment rights ====
The Libertarian Party affirms an individual's right recognized by the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] to keep and bear arms and opposes the prosecution of individuals for exercising their rights of [[self-defense]]. The party opposes laws at any level of government requiring registration of or restricting the ownership, manufacture, or transfer or sale of [[firearms]] or [[ammunition]].<ref name="Platform"/> The Libertarian Party has also shown support in the past for the abolition of the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] and support for [[Constitutional carry]].<ref>[https://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2000_Libertarian_Gun_Control.htm "National Platform of the Libertarian Party" (2000)].Libertarian Party.

=== Foreign policy issues ===
Libertarians generally prefer an attitude of mutual respect between all nations.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Libertarians believe that free trade engenders positive international relationships. Libertarian candidates have promised to cut [[foreign aid]] and withdraw American troops from the Middle East and other areas throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/issues/foreign-policy |title = Foreign Policy |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref>

The Libertarian Party opposed the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] and LP Chair [[Mark Hinkle]] in a statement described the position of the Libertarian Party: "President Obama's decision to order military attacks on Libya is only surprising to those who actually think he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. He has now ordered bombing strikes in six different countries, adding Libya to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen."<ref>[[Press release]] (March 20, 2011).

==== Political status of Puerto Rico ====
While the Libertarian Party has not taken an official stance on the political status of [[Puerto Rico]], it did publish an article in which Bruce Majors – the party's [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|2012 candidate]] for the [[District of Columbia's at-large congressional district]] [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] election – expressed support to "put a [[referendum]] on the [[ballot]]" and "let residents decide whether they would like to be a state" and thereby give residents of Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico greater control over their level of [[Taxation in the United States|taxation]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/blogs/staff/uphill-battle-for-libertarian-in-dc-but-reward-is-possible |title = Uphill Battle for Libertarian in DC, But Reward Is Possible |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 |date = October 21, 2012 }}</ref>

== Internal debates ==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}
{{main|Factions in the Libertarian Party (United States)}}

=== "Radicalism" vs. "pragmatism" debate ===
A longstanding debate within the party is one referred to by libertarians as the [[Anarcho-capitalism and minarchism|anarchist–minarchist debate]]. In 1974, [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] and [[Minarchism|minarchists]] within the party agreed to officially take no position on whether or not government should exist at all and to not advocate either particular view. This agreement has become known as the [[Dallas Accord]], having taken place at the party's convention that year in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOrT8tMMS5AC|title=Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement|author=Doherty, Brian|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|date=April 28, 2009|chapter=Libertarian Zionism, the Koch Bubble, and America's Third Largest Political Party|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOrT8tMMS5AC&q=%22libertarian+party%22+%22dallas+accord%22+%22national+convention%22&pg=PT375|author-link=Brian Doherty (journalist)|isbn=9780786731886}}</ref>

Libertarian members often cite the departure of [[Ed Crane (political activist)|Ed Crane]] (of the [[Cato Institute]], a libertarian [[think tank]]) as a key turning point in the early party history.<ref>{{cite news |last = Rothbard |first = Murray |author-link = Murray Rothbard |title = It Usually Ends With Ed Crane |url = https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/it-usually-ends-with-ed-crane/ |access-date = October 11, 2013 |work = LewRockwell.com |date = January–April 1981 }}</ref> Crane (who in the 1970s had been the party's first Executive Director) and some of his allies resigned from the party in 1983 when their preferred candidates for national committee seats lost in the elections at the national convention.

In the mid-2000s, groups such as the Libertarian Party Reform Caucus generally advocated revising the party's platform, eliminating or altering the membership statement and focusing on a politics-oriented approach aimed at presenting libertarianism to voters in what they deemed a "less threatening" manner.<ref>{{cite news |last = Samuels |first = L.

=== Platform revision ===
In 1999, a working group of leading Libertarian Party activists proposed to reformat and retire the platform to serve as a guide for legislative projects (its main purpose to that point) and create a series of custom platforms on issues for different purposes, including the needs of the growing number of Libertarians in office. The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>"[http://www.reformthelp.org/ Victory in Portland! Libertarian Reform Caucus]"</ref> Their agenda was partially successful in that the platform was much shortened (going from 61 to 15 planks&nbsp;– 11 new planks and 4 retained from the old platform) over the previous one.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/issues/platform_all.shtml National Platform of the Libertarian Party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182629/http://www.lp.org/issues/platform_all.shtml |date=May 28, 2008 }}, Official website of the Libertarian National Committee. Retrieved on July 25, 2006</ref>

Members differ as to the reasons why the changes were relatively more drastic than any platform actions at previous conventions. Some delegates voted for changes so the party could appeal to a wider audience, while others simply thought the entire document needed an overhaul. It was also pointed out that the text of the existing platform was not provided to the delegates, making many reluctant to vote to retain the planks when the existing language was not provided for review.<ref>"[http://www.libertyforall.net/?p=6 Portland and the LP Platform: The Perfect Storm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312201243/http://www.libertyforall.net/?p=6 |date=March 12, 2007 }}", a review by George Squyres, Platform Committee chairman. Retrieved on November 2, 2006.</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}

Not all party members approved of the changes, some believing them to be a setback to libertarianism<ref>"[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/lp-turkish-delight.html The LP's Turkish Delight] by [[Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.]]".</ref> and an abandonment of what they see as the most important purpose of the Libertarian Party.<ref>L. K. Samuels, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig7/samuels1.html Evicting Libertarian Party Principles: The Portland Purge], [[LewRockwell.com]], July 7, 2006.</ref>

At the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, the changes went even further with the approval of an entirely revamped platform.<ref name="lp-platform2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=National Platform of the Libertarian Party (2008)|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=May 2008|access-date=October 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003074345/http://www.lp.org/platform|archive-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref> Much of the new platform recycles language from pre-millennial platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform/|title=1996 National Platform of the Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=July 1996|access-date=October 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003074345/http://www.lp.org/platform|archive-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref> While the planks were renamed, most address ideas found in earlier platforms and run no longer than three to four sentences.<ref name="lp-platform2008"/>
