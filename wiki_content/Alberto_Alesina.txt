'''Alberto Francesco Alesina''' (29 April 1957 – 23 May 2020) was an Italian [[political economics|political economist]]. Described as one of the leading political economists of his generation,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Summers|first=Lawrence|date=24 May 2020|title=It is hard to imagine the field of political economy without Alberto Alesina|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/24/it-is-hard-imagine-field-political-economy-without-alberto-alesina/|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> he published many influential works in both the economics and political science research literature.

==Background and professional life==
Alesina was born in [[Broni]], [[Lombardy]], Italy.{{cn|date=December 2019}} He obtained his undergraduate degree in economics from [[Bocconi University]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Helgadóttir|first=Oddný|date=15 March 2016|title=The Bocconi boys go to Brussels: Italian economic ideas, professional networks and European austerity|journal=Journal of European Public Policy|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=392–409|doi=10.1080/13501763.2015.1106573|s2cid=155917559|issn=1350-1763}}</ref>

From 2003–2006, Alesina served as Chairman of the Department of Economics at Harvard.  He was the Nathaniel Ropes Professor of Political Economy at Harvard. He visited several institutions including [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Tel Aviv University]], [[University of Stockholm]], [[The World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).  In 2006, Alesina participated in the [[Stock Exchange of Visions]] project.

He published five books and edited many more. His two most recent books were ''The Future of Europe: Reform or Decline'' (2006, MIT Press), and ''Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference'' (2004, Oxford). He was a co-editor of the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' for eight years and associate editor of many academic journals. He published columns in many leading newspapers around the world.  He was a founding contributor of the online economic policy and research journal [[Voxeu.org]] and of [[Lavoce.info]].

Alesina's work covered a variety of topics, including:
* Political [[business cycles]]
* The political economy of [[fiscal policy]] and [[budget deficits]]
* The process of [[European integration]]
* Stabilization policies in high [[inflation]] countries
*[[Currency union|Currency unions]]
* The political economic determinants of re-distributive policies
* Differences in the [[welfare state]] in the US and Europe
* Differences in the [[economic system]] in the US and Europe
* The effect of alternative [[electoral systems]] on economic policies
* The determination of the choice of different electoral systems

Alesina was a member of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (Cambridge, Massachusetts), the  [[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] in London, and the [[Econometric Society]].<ref>*[http://scholar.harvard.edu/alesina Harvard Faculty page.]</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2006.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=14 April 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archive-date= 10 May 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==Death==
Alesina died from a suspected heart attack on 23 May 2020, while hiking with his wife, Susan.<ref>[https://www.repubblica.it/economia/2020/05/24/news/morto_alberto_alesina-257495821/ È morto Alberto Alesina, economista italiano che ha conquistato Harward] {{in lang|it}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/05/alberto-alesina-a-pioneer-of-modern-political-economy-dies-at-63/|title = Recalling a pioneer of modern political economy|work = [[The Harvard Gazette]]|date =  27 May 2020|access-date = 24 October 2020|last = Mineo|first = Liz}}</ref> In 2021, Harvard University renamed its political economy workshop in Alesina's honor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Seminar Series: Alberto Alesina Seminar on Political Economy|url=https://www.iq.harvard.edu/program-political-economy|access-date=2021-11-09|website=www.iq.harvard.edu|language=en}}</ref>

==Austerity==
Alesina was an influential proponent of [[austerity]] during the [[Great Recession in Europe|Great Recession]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=Henry|last2=Quiggin|first2=John|date=2017|title=Consensus, Dissensus, and Economic Ideas: Economic Crisis and the Rise and Fall of Keynesianism|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=269–283|doi=10.1093/isq/sqx010|issn=0020-8833|doi-access=free}}</ref> He argued that austerity can be expansionary in situations where government reduction in spending is offset by greater increases in aggregate demand (private consumption, private investment and exports).<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Alesina|first1=Alberto|title=Austerity: When It Works and When It Doesn't|last2=Favero|first2=Carlo|last3=Giavazzi|first3=Francesco|date=2019|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17221-7|pages=5|jstor=j.ctvc77f4b}}</ref> A credible fiscal consolidation would reduce private actors' uncertainty and lower the risk premium. Assuming that [[Ricardian equivalence]] and the [[Permanent income hypothesis]] hold, actors' expected future wealth would increase and induce them to consume more.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlin |first1=Wendy |last2=Soskice |first2=David |title=Macroeconomics:Institutions, instability, and the financial system |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |pages=528–530}}</ref>

In October 2009 Alesina and [[Silvia Ardagna]] published "Large Changes in Fiscal Policy: Taxes Versus Spending",<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Large Changes in Fiscal Policy: Taxes Versus Spending|doi=10.3386/w15438 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 15438 |date = October 2009 |first1 = Alberto F.|last1 = Alesina|first2 = Silvia|last2 = Ardagna|citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.7482}}</ref> a much-cited academic paper aimed at showing that fiscal austerity measures did not hurt economies, and actually helped their recovery. On 6 June 2013 U.S. economist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics#Laureates|2008 Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Krugman]] published "How the Case for Austerity Has Crumbled"<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jun/06/how-case-austerity-has-crumbled/?pagination=false How the Case for Austerity Has Crumbled, Paul Krugman, The New York Review of Books, June 6, 2013]</ref> in ''The New York Review of Books'', noting how influential these articles have been with policymakers, describing the paper by the 'Bocconi Boys' Alesina and Ardagna (from the name of their Italian alma mater) as "a full frontal assault on the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] proposition that cutting spending in a weak economy produces further weakness", arguing the reverse.

More recently, studies by the [[IMF]] and others have cast doubt on the methodological underpinning of Alesina's work and conclude that the evidence is more likely to suggest a contractionary effect of fiscal consolidation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Devries |first1=Pete |last2=Guajardo |first2=Jaime |last3=Leigh |first3=Daniel |last4=Pescatori |first4=Andrea |title=A New Action-Based Dataset of Fiscal Consolidation |journal=IMF Working Paper |date=2011 |volume=128 |issue=11 |ssrn=1861798 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1861798}}</ref><ref>https://www.imf.org/~/media/Websites/IMF/imported-flagship-issues/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/02/pdf/_c3pdf.ashx</ref>
