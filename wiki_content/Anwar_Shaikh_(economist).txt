'''Anwar M. Shaikh''' (born 1945) is a [[Pakistani Americans|Pakistani American]] [[heterodox economist]] in the tradition of [[Classical economics|classical political economy]].

He is Professor of Economics in the Graduate Faculty of Social and Political Science at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]], where he has taught since 1972.<ref>[http://homepage.newschool.edu/~AShaikh/ Anwar Shaikh.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421170313/http://homepage.newschool.edu/~AShaikh/ |date=2010-04-21 }} The New School for Social Research 2011. Retrieved 7 July 2011.</ref>

Carrying on [[teaching]] and [[research]] that originated in the context of [[New Left]] [[social movements]], Shaikh's [[political economy]] has focused on the laws of motion and empirical patterns of [[industrialized]] [[capitalism]], based on a theory of [[competition]] independent of [[neoclassical economics]].

In specific fields, he has written on the [[labor theory of value]], [[production functions]], [[international trade]], [[neoliberalism]], the [[welfare state]], [[economic growth]], [[inflation]], the [[falling rate of profit]], [[long waves]], [[International inequality|inequality on the world scale]], and past and current [[global recession|global economic crises]].

In 2016, Shaikh published ''Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crisis''.

== Early life and education==
{{American socialism|expanded=Theorists}}
Shaikh was born in [[Karachi]], in 1945. He traveled extensively at an early age 
and attended schools and lived for various lengths of time in [[Ankara]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New York City]], [[Lagos]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], and [[Kuwait]].

He graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in New York City in 1961, received a B.S.E from Princeton University in 1965, worked for two years in Kuwait, and then returned to the United States to study at [[Columbia University]], from which he received his [[Ph.D.]] in Economics in 1973. In 1972 he joined the Economics Department at the Graduate Faculty of the [[New School for Social Research]].

He taught [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[social sciences]] at the [[American School of Kuwait|Kuwait-American School]] in [[Kuwait City]] in 1966–67 and worked as a teacher of social science and mathematics at Harlem Prep in [[Harlem, NY]], while in graduate school.

His major political influences stem from the New Left, including the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Second-wave feminism|feminist movement]] in the US, and national liberation movements abroad. He always found [[neoclassical economics]] unpersuasive, and the quest for more solid foundations led him to the works of [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Roy Harrod]], [[Wassily Leontief]], [[Michał Kalecki]], [[Joan Robinson]], [[Piero Sraffa]] and [[Luigi Pasinetti]], and subsequently to [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Karl Marx]]. The quest for a modern [[political economy]] of developed capitalism became a central theme of his subsequent work.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://anwarshaikhecon.org/index.php/about-anwar-shaikh-economist-new-school/anwar-shaikh-biography |title=Anwar Shaikh Biography |last=Shaikh |first=Anwar |date=August 15, 2016 |website=Anwar Shaikh Econ |access-date=October 4, 2017 }}</ref>

== Contributions==
=== Critique of perfect competition ===
Shaikh has argued in various publications that neither neoclassical economics nor the great bulk of [[heterodox economics]] provides an adequate foundation for the analysis of developed [[capitalism]]. The former is based on a vision of a perfect capitalism which is claimed to optimally and efficiently serve the interests of all of its participants.

At the heart of this vision is the theory of [[perfect competition]]. Much of heterodox economics is in turn based on the theory of [[imperfect competition]], i.e., on departures from perfect competition. But the theory of imperfect competition is intrinsically dependent on the theory of perfect competition. Shaikh argues that even [[Neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian economics]], whose revival was sparked by [[Sraffa]]'s classic work, relies heavily on the neoclassical concepts of perfect competition and of equilibrium as an attained-and-held state.

In place of these notions, Shaikh proposes the theory of real competition and the theory of turbulent regulation. Real competition is competition-as-war, with individual firms seeking to undermine each other by lowering costs and cutting prices. Turbulent regulation is the resulting process of perpetual overshooting and undershooting of actual economic variables (such as prices, wages and profit rates) around their ever-moving centers of gravity.

Shaikh has utilized this framework to develop alternate theories of industrial, financial and international competition (the latter rejecting the standard theory of comparative costs). The key element in all cases is the turbulent equalization of profit rates in various spheres of investment. He uses his theoretical structures to explain the actual patterns of industrial prices, [[Rate of profit|profit rates]], [[stock market]] prices, and [[exchange rates]] in the [[developed world]].

=== Theory of the profit rate ===
The second strand of Shaikh's work concerns macrodynamics. Once again, the profit rate is the key variable. He argues that capitalist growth is driven by profitability, not by the requirements of [[full employment]] as in neoclassical theory, by [[Exogeny|exogenous]] demand as in [[Keynesian theory]], or by the savings rate as in [[Harrod–Domar model|Harrodian theory]].

In his earlier work, he used this notion to develop a theory of [[Kondratiev wave|long waves]] and crises based on the [[Marxian economics|Marxian concept]] of [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rate of profit]]. Subsequently, he showed that the link between growth and the profit rate can also provide an alternate theory of inflation, which he showed to work very well for the US in the postwar period.

In more recent work, he has developed a formal classical profit-driven model of growth and contrasted its structure and its policy implications to those of the standard models in the other traditions.

=== Empirical measures of profit ===
A third strand of his work is the relation between theoretical categories and empirical measures. His 1994 book ''Measuring the Wealth of Nations: The Political Economy of National Accounts'', co-authored with Ahmet Tonak, developed a mapping between the [[national accounts]] corresponding to neoclassical and Keynesian concepts and those corresponding to classical and Marxian ones. It is now a classic reference on the subject.

More recently, he has argued that it is crucially important to distinguish between the average rate of profit on all capital invested, which includes old and new investments, and the rate of return on new investment alone. It is only the latter, he argues, which is turbulently equalized among alternative uses of capital. He showed that one can approximate the rate of return on new investment via the incremental rate of profit.

Using this, he demonstrated that, contrary to the "[[irrational exuberance]]" claim of [[Robert Shiller]], the rate of return in the stock market does indeed oscillate around the incremental rate of return in the corporate sector. In more recent work, he demonstrates that the same turbulent equalization holds for manufacturing sectors within the US and even across [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD countries]].

=== Production function critique ===
The final strand of his work is a critique of the neoclassical [[Production function|aggregate production function]] and its associated marginal-productivity theory of income distribution, dating back to his earliest work ''Laws of Production and Laws of Algebra: The Humbug Production Function'' (1974). This was a stinging critique of [[Robert Solow]]'s famous article on the measurement of technical change, following up on a similar criticism of cross-section production functions by [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] and [[Ferdinand K. Levy|Levy]] (1963).

To combat the notion that production functions, if not theoretically sound, are at least empirically well-supported, Shaikh fitted a function to a set of data points that spell out "HUMBUG" when plotted, then showed that the result was a proper production function.

The Simon-Shaikh critique of production functions was taken up by Jesus Felipe, J. S. L. McCombie and others in a series of articles over the years. Further articles by Shaikh in this vein appeared in 1980, 1986, and 2005, the last being in a special journal issue devoted to the subject that included contributions by Felipe, McCombie, and [[Franklin M. Fisher]]. Expressing the importance of Shaikh's result, J. E. King remarked that "[i]f there was any justice in the world of economics," Shaikh should have gotten the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize]] for the humbug production function.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=John E.|date=2016|title=Book review: Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises|journal=The Economic and Labour Relations Review|volume=27|issue=4|pages=548–553|doi=10.1177/1035304616677488|s2cid=157967068}}</ref>

It synthesizes much of his earlier work into a comprehensive theory of micro- and macroeconomics, while critiquing both mainstream neoclassical economics and post-Keynesian alternatives.
