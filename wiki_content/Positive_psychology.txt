'''Positive psychology''' is the scientific study of what makes life most worth living, focusing on both individual and societal well-being.{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} It studies "positive subjective experience, positive individual traits, and positive institutions...it aims to improve [[quality of life]]."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition, Measures, Applications, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/quality-of-life|access-date=2021-03-06|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> It is a field of study that has been growing steadily throughout the years as individuals and researchers look for common ground on better well-being.<ref>Gable, S. L., & Haidt, J. (2005). What (and why) is positive psychology?. ''Review of general psychology'', ''9''(2), 103-110.</ref>

Positive psychology began as a new domain of [[psychology]] in 1998 when [[Martin Seligman]] chose it as the theme for his term as president of the [[American Psychological Association]].<ref name="Time"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Happier : learn the secrets to daily joy and lasting fulfillment|last=Tal.|first=Ben-Shahar|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0071510967|location=New York|oclc=176182574}}</ref><ref name=":9" /> It is a reaction against past practices, which have tended to focus on mental illness and emphasized [[maladaptive behavior]] and negative thinking. It builds on the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] movement by [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Rollo May]], [[James Bugental]] and [[Carl Rogers]], which encourages an emphasis on [[happiness]], [[well-being]], and positivity, thus creating the foundation for what is now known as positive psychology.<ref name=":9">Srinivasan, T. S. (2015, February 12). The 5 Founding Fathers and A History of Positive Psychology. Retrieved February 4, 2017, from https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/founding-fathers/</ref>

Positive psychology focuses on [[eudaimonia]], an Ancient Greek term for "the good life" and the concept for reflection on the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. Positive psychologists often use the terms [[subjective well-being]] and happiness interchangeably.<ref>Nyabul, P. O., & Situma, J. W. (2014). The Meaning of Eudemonia in Aristotle’s Ethics. ''International Journal'', ''2''(3), 65-74.</ref>

Positive psychologists have suggested a number of factors may contribute to happiness and subjective well-being. For example, social ties with a spouse, family, friends, colleagues, and wider [[Social network|networks]]; membership in clubs or social organizations; physical exercise, and the practice of [[meditation]]. Spirituality can also be considered a factor that leads to increased individual happiness and well-being. Spiritual practice and religious commitment is a topic researchers have been studying as another possible source for increased well-being and an added part of positive psychology.<ref>Day, J. M. (2010). Religion, spirituality, and positive psychology in adulthood: A developmental view.

==Definition and basic assumptions==

===Definition===
[[Martin Seligman]] and [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] define positive psychology as "the scientific study of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels that include the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}}

===Basic concepts===
Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], meaning "the good life" or [[flourishing]]. It is focused on living according to what holds the greatest value in life and other such factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life.” [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant [[gratification]].{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=13}}

Positive psychology complements, without intending to replace or ignore, the traditional areas of [[psychology]]. By emphasizing the study of positive human development, this field helps to balance other approaches that focus on disorder, which may produce only limited understanding.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} Positive psychology has also placed a significant emphasis on fostering positive [[self-esteem]] and [[self-image]], though positive psychologists with a less humanist direction are less likely to focus as intently on such topics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mruk|first1=Christopher|title=The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Potential Common Ground for Humanistic Positive Psychology and Positivistic Positive Psychology|journal=The Humanistic Psychologist|date=April 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=143–158|doi=10.1080/08873260802111176|id={{ProQuest|212086932}}}}</ref>

The basic premise of positive psychology is that human beings are often intrigued by the future more than they are driven by the past. It also suggests that a combination of positive experiences and emotions concerning the past, the present, and the future leads to a pleasant, happy life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lee Duckworth|first1=Angela|last2=Steen|first2=Tracy A.|last3=Seligman|first3=Martin E.P.|date=April 2005|title=Positive Psychology in Clinical Practice|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=629–651|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144154|pmid=17716102}}</ref> Another aspect of this may come from our views outside of our own lives. Author of ''Grit'', Angela Duckworth, might view this as having an other-centered purpose, of which could have a positive psychological affect on our lives.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Duckworth|first=Angela|title=Grit The Power of Passion and Perseverance|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5011-1110-5|location=New York, NY|pages=143}}</ref> Seligman identified other possible goals: families and schools that allow children to grow, workplaces that aim for satisfaction and high productivity, and teaching others about positive psychology.<ref name="SeligmanMartin">Seligman, Martin E.P. "Positive Psychology Center." Positive Psychology Center. University of Pennsylvania, 2007. Web. 12 Mar. 2013.</ref> Psychologist Daniel Gilbert has also written extensively on the affects of time perception and happiness.<ref name=":10" />

Those who practice positive psychology attempt [[psychological intervention]]s that foster positive attitudes toward one's subjective experiences, individual traits, and life events.{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} The goal is to minimize [[Pathology|pathological]] thoughts that may arise in a hopeless mindset and to develop a sense of optimism toward life.{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} Positive psychologists seek to encourage acceptance of one's past, excitement and optimism about one's future experiences, and a sense of contentment and well-being in the present.<ref name="14 March 2016">{{cite journal|last1=Shesthra|first1=Arjun|title=Positive psychology: Evolution, philosophical foundations, and present growth|journal=Indian Journal of Positive Psychology|date=December 2016|volume=7|issue=4|pages=460–465|id={{ProQuest|1862867466}}}}</ref>

Related concepts are [[happiness]], [[well-being]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}</ref> and [[meaningful life]].

- Happiness: Has been sought after and discussed throughout time. Research has concluded that happiness can be thought of in the way we act or what we do and how we think in relative terms to it.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_156_20|title = Understanding the determinants of happiness through Gallup World Poll|year = 2020|last1 = Kishore|first1 = Kamal|last2 = Jaswal|first2 = Vidushi|last3 = Muniraju|first3 = M.|last4 = Jaswal|first4 = Nidhi|last5 = Kapoor|first5 = Rakesh|journal = Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care|volume = 9|issue = 9|pages = 4826–4832|pmid = 33209808|pmc = 7652195}}</ref>

- Well-Being: Has often been referred to what is inherently good for an individual both physically and mentally, though other aspects could be added in to define well-being.<ref>Crisp, R. (2001). Well-being.

Chicago</ref>

- Quality of life: Quality of life encompasses more than just physical and mental well-being, it involves socioeconomic factors. It is also perceived differently in different cultures and regions around the world, but can come down to how well you are living and functioning in life.<ref>Wen, J., Yk, S., Yp, L., Yuan, P., Wang, F., & Garcıa, O. (2012). Quality of life. ''Physical Diseases, and Psychological Impairment among Survivors'', ''3''.</ref>

===Research topics===
According to Seligman and Peterson, positive psychology addresses three issues: [[positive emotions]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-03-12|title=Positive Emotions: A List of 26 Examples + Definition in Psychology|url=https://positivepsychology.com/positive-emotions-list-examples-definition-psychology/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=PositivePsychology.com|language=en-US}}</ref> positive individual traits,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-09-08|title=Happiness and Positive Psychology|url=https://www.aipc.net.au/articles/happiness-and-positive-psychology/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=AIPC Article Library|language=en-US}}</ref> and positive institutions. Positive emotions are concerned with being content with one's past, being happy in the present and having hope for the future. Positive individual traits focus on one's strengths and virtues. Finally, positive institutions are based on strengths to better a community of people.<ref name="SeligmanMartin" />

According to Peterson, positive psychologists are concerned with four topics: positive experiences, enduring psychological traits, positive relationships, and positive institutions.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} He also states that topics of interest to topics of interest to [[List of positive psychologists|researchers in the field]] are states of [[pleasure]] or [[flow (psychology)|flow]], [[Value (ethics)|values]], strengths, [[virtue]]s, talents, as well as the ways that these can be promoted by [[social system]]s and institutions.{{sfn|Peterson|2006}}

==History==
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Comprehensive Soldiers Fitness (1)cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|To [[Martin Seligman]], psychology (particularly its positive branch) can investigate and promote realistic ways of fostering more well-being in individuals and communities.]]

===Origin===
While the formal discipline of positive psychology has only existed since 2000,{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} the concepts that form the basis of it have been present in religious and philosophical discourse for thousands of years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Christopher|first1=John Chambers|last2=Hickinbottom|first2=Sarah|date=October 2008|title=Positive Psychology, Ethnocentrism, and the Disguised Ideology of Individualism|journal=Theory & Psychology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=563–589|doi=10.1177/0959354308093396|s2cid=55331439}}</ref> It has been influenced by humanistic as well as psychodynamic approaches to treatment. Predating the use of the term “positive psychology”, researchers within the field of psychology had been focusing on topics that would now be included under this new denomination.<ref name=":12"/>

The term positive psychology dates back at least to 1954, when Maslow's first edition of ''[[Motivation and Personality (book)|Motivation and Personality]]''&nbsp;was published with a final chapter titled "Toward a Positive Psychology."<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=Motivation and Personality|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1970|edition=2nd|location=New York}}</ref> In the second edition published in 1970, he removed that chapter, saying in the preface that "a&nbsp;positive psychology is at least available today though not very widely."<ref name=":02" /> There have been indications that psychologists since the 1950s have been increasingly focused on the promotion of mental health rather than merely treating mental illness.<ref name="twsMay18g45r">{{cite news|url=http://www.her.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/1/57.pdf|title=Current conceptualizations of mental health and mental health promotion|author=Secker J|access-date=2010-05-18|publisher=Health Education Research|year=1998|issue=1|volume=13|page=58|quote=...

Positive psychology grew as an important field of study within psychology in 1998 when [[Martin Seligman]] chose it as the theme for his term as president of the [[American Psychological Association]].<ref name="Time">{{cite web |url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/TimeMagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf |title=Time Magazine's cover story in the special issue on "The Science of Happiness", 2005 |access-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711093607/http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/timemagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf |archive-date=2006-07-11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/positive-psychology-the-benefits-of-living-positively/|title=Positive Psychology: The Benefits of Living Positively|date=2013-03-11|work=World of Psychology|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> In the first sentence of his book ''Authentic Happiness'', Seligman claimed: "for the last half century psychology has been consumed with a single topic only – mental illness,"{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=xi}} expanding on Maslow's comments.{{efn|Maslow wrote:
{{Quote|The science of psychology has been far more successful on the negative than on the positive side. It has revealed to us much about man’s shortcomings, his illness, his sins, but little about his potentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations, or his full psychological height. It is as if psychology has voluntarily restricted itself to only half its rightful jurisdiction, the darker, meaner half.<ref>Maslow, Motivation and Psychology, p. 354</ref>}}}} He urged psychologists to continue the earlier missions of psychology of nurturing talent and improving normal life.{{sfn|Compton|2005|pp=1–22}}

===Development===
The first positive psychology summit took place in 1999. The First International Conference on Positive Psychology took place in 2002.{{sfn|Compton|2005|pp=1–22}} More attention was given by the general public in 2006 when, using the same framework, a course at [[Harvard University]] became particularly popular.<ref name="Happier">Ben-Shahar, Ben (2007) "Happier -Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment", First Edition, McGraw-Hill Co.</ref> In June 2009, the First World Congress on Positive Psychology took place at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Reuters, Jun 18, 2009: [https://archive.today/20120908022121/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS130343+18-Jun-2009+PRN20090618 First World Congress on Positive Psychology Kicks Off Today With Talks by Two of the World's Most Renowned Psychologists]</ref>

The field of positive psychology today is most advanced in the United States and Western Europe. Even though positive psychology offers a new approach to the study of positive emotions and behavior, the ideas, theories, research, and motivation to study the positive side of human behavior is as old as humanity.<ref>Compton, William C., and Edward Hoffman. ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness and Flourishing.'' 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2013. Print.</ref>

===Influences===

Several [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic psychologists]], most notably [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Carl Rogers]], and [[Erich Fromm]], developed theories and practices pertaining to human [[happiness]] and flourishing. More recently, positive psychologists have found [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for the humanistic theories of flourishing. In addition, positive psychology has moved ahead in a variety of new directions.

In 1984, Diener published his [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], positing "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]."<ref>Tov & Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soss_research/1395</ref> In this model, [[Cognition|cognitive]], [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and contextual factors contribute to subjective well-being.<ref name="Galinha_Pais-Ribeiro_2011">{{cite journal | last1 = Costa Galinha | first1 = Iolanda | last2 = Pais-Ribeiro | first2 = José Luís | year = 2011 | title = Cognitive, affective and contextual predictors of subjective wellbeing | journal = International Journal of Wellbeing | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 34–53 | doi = 10.5502/ijw.v2i1.3 | doi-access = free }}</ref> According to Diener and Suh, subjective well-being is "based on the idea that how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important."<ref>{{cite book|last=Diener, Suh|first=Ed, Eunkook|title=Culture and Subjective Well-being|year=2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|page=4}}</ref>

Carol Ryff's [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]] was initially published in 1989, and additional testing of its factors was published in 1995. It postulates six factors which are key for well-being, namely [[self-acceptance]], [[personal growth]], [[purpose in life]], environmental mastery, [[autonomy]], and positive relations with others.<ref>[http://livingmeanings.com/six-criteria-well-ryffs-multidimensional-model/ ''Carol Ryff’s Model of Psychological Well-being. The Six Criteria of Well-Being'']</ref>

According to [[Corey Keyes]], who collaborated with Carol Ryff and uses the term [[flourishing]] as a central concept, mental well-being has three components, namely [[Hedonism|hedonic]] (c.q. subjective or emotional<ref name="Robitschek"/>), psychological, and social well-being.{{sfn|Keyes|2002}} [[Hedonic treadmill|Hedonic well-being]] concerns emotional aspects of well-being, whereas psychological and social well-being, c.q. eudaimonic well-being, concerns skills, abilities, and optimal functioning.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2015-10-23|title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=17|issue=5|language=en|pages=2023–2036|doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z|s2cid=16022037|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ddb08f90efd8ecc652072bf8efafbd5b3e930b36}}</ref> This tripartite model of mental well-being has received extensive empirical support across cultures.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Robitschek">{{Cite journal|last1=Robitschek|first1=Christine|last2=Keyes|first2=Corey L.

==== Influences in Ancient History ====
While the formal title "positive psychology" has only been around for the past two decades,{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} the concepts that form the basis of this field have been present in religious and philosophical discourse for thousands of years.

==Core theory and methods==
{{Main|Well-being}}
There is no accepted "gold standard" theory in positive psychology. However, the work of [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] is regularly quoted.<ref name="Sze"/> So too the work of [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]] and older models of well-being, such as [[Carol Ryff's Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]] and [[Ed Diener|Diener's]] [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]].

===Initial theory: three paths to happiness===
In ''Authentic Happiness'' (2002) Seligman proposed three kinds of a happy life that can be investigated:{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=275}}<ref name="Sze">David Sze (2015), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html ''The Father of Positive Psychology and His Two Theories of Happiness'']</ref>
# ''Pleasant life'': research into the [[pleasure|Pleasant]] Life, or the "life of enjoyment," examines how people optimally experience, [[Affective forecasting|forecast]] , and [[Savoring|savor]] the positive feelings and emotions that are part of normal and healthy living (e.g., relationships, hobbies, interests, entertainment, etc.). Despite the attention given, Martin Seligman says this most transient element of happiness may be the least important.<ref name=NYSciHap>{{cite magazine |last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |magazine=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |access-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archive-date=2010-11-15 }}</ref>
# ''Good Life'': investigation of the beneficial effects of immersion, absorption, and [[flow (psychology)|flow]] felt by individuals when optimally engaged with their primary activities, is the study of the Good Life, or the "life of engagement." Flow is experienced when there is a positive match between a person's strength and their current task, i.e., when one feels confident of accomplishing a chosen or assigned task.{{efn|See related concepts: [[Self-efficacy]] and [[play (activity)|play]].}}
# ''Meaningful Life'': inquiry into the [[Meaningful Life]] , or "life of affiliation," questions how individuals derive a positive sense of well-being, belonging, meaning, and purpose from being part of and contributing back to something larger and more permanent than themselves (e.g., nature, social groups, organizations, movements, traditions, belief systems).

===PERMA===
In ''Flourish'' (2011) Seligman argued that the last category of his proposed three kinds of a happy life, "[[meaningful life]]," can be considered as 3 different categories. The resulting summary for this theory is Seligman's [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|PERMA acronym]]: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and purpose, and Accomplishments.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html|title=The Father of Positive Psychology and His Two Theories of Happiness|last=Sze|first=David|date=2015-06-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> It is a [[mnemonic]] for the five elements of Martin Seligman's well-being theory:<ref name="Sze"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |title=The World Question Center 2011— Page 2 |publisher=Edge.org |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210015906/http://edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |archive-date=2011-02-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* ''Positive emotions'' include a wide range of feelings, not just happiness and joy.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&nbsp;1}} Included are emotions like excitement, satisfaction, pride and awe, amongst others.

[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] explains true engagement as [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], a state of deep effortless involvement,<ref name=":1" /> feeling of intensity that leads to a sense of ecstasy and clarity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi TED talk}}</ref> The task being done needs to call upon higher skill and be a bit difficult and challenging yet still possible. Engagement involves [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] for and concentration on the task at hand and is assessed subjectively as to whether the person engaged was completely absorbed, losing self-consciousness.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&nbsp;1}}
* ''Relationships'' are essential in fueling positive emotions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brain-sharp.com/blogs/news/healthy-lifestyle-tips|title=Healthy Lifestyle Tips}}</ref> whether they are work-related, familial, romantic, or platonic. As [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] puts it simply, "other people matter."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-beauty-in-the-beast/201210/other-people-matter|title=Other People Matter}}</ref> Humans receive, share, and spread positivity to others through relationships. They are important not only in bad times, but good times as well. In fact, relationships can be strengthened by reacting to one another positively. It is typical that most positive things take place in the presence of other people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|title=Using Positive Psychology in Your Relationships}}</ref>
* ''Meaning'' is also known as [[Intention|purpose]], and prompts the question of "why." Discovering and figuring out a clear "why" puts everything into context from work to relationships to other parts of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|title=Why do You do What You Do?|date=2013-09-06}}</ref> Finding meaning is learning that there is something greater than one's self. Despite potential challenges, working with meaning drives people to continue striving for a desirable goal.
* ''Accomplishments'' are the pursuit of success and mastery.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&nbsp;1}} Unlike the other parts of PERMA, they are sometimes pursued even when accomplishments do not result in positive emotions, meaning, or relationships. That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup}}</ref> Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.

Each of the five PERMA elements was selected according to three criteria:
# It contributes to well-being.
# It is pursued for its own sake.
# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.

===''Character Strengths and Virtues''===
{{main|Character Strengths and Virtues|Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|VIA Institute on Character}}
{{See also|Character education|Values education}}

The development of the ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' (CSV) handbook (2004) represented the first attempt by Seligman and Peterson to identify and classify positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identified 6 classes of [[virtues]] (i.e., "core virtues"), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004}}

The CSV suggested these 6 virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures; in addition, these virtues and strengths can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints threefold: 1) The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, 2) the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]], suggesting people are "evolutionarily predisposed" toward certain [[virtue]]s, and 3) virtue has a biological basis.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004|p=51}}

The organization of the 6 virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:
# '''[[Wisdom]] and knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]
# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]
# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]
# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]] 
# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]
# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]

Recent research challenged the need for 6 virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just 3 or 4 categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shryack | first1 = J. | last2 = Steger | first2 = M.

===Flow===
{{Main|Flow (psychology)}}
{{See also|Peak experience}}

In the 1970s, Csikszentmihalyi (a Hungarian- American psychologist) began studying ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense [[Attention|concentration]], loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that "time is flying." Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of [[goal]]s (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990>{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-06-016253-5 }}</ref> Anyone can experience flow and it can be felt in different domains, such as play, [[creativity]], and work. Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety and feeling overwhelmed; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled, results in [[boredom]].<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/>

Flow can be extremely beneficial when it comes to parenting children. When flow is enhanced between parents and their children, the parents are more capable of thriving in their role as a parent. A parenting style that is positively oriented will also result in children that experience lower levels of stress and overall improve the child's well-being.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pentti|first1=Selja|last2=Fagerlund|first2=Åse|last3=Nyström|first3=Pär|date=2019-09-25|title=Flourishing families: Effects of a positive psychology intervention on parental flow, engagement, meaning and hope|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/view/1003|journal=International Journal of Wellbeing|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=79–96|doi=10.5502/ijw.v9i4.1003|issn=1179-8602|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Research advances and applications ==
{{Main|Well-being contributing factors}}

Topical and [[Methodology|methodological]] development has expanded the field of positive psychology. These advances have enabled the field of positive psychology to grow beyond its core theories and methods. Positive psychology is now a global area of study, with various national indices tracking citizens' happiness ratings.

=== Research findings ===
Research in positive psychology, well-being, [[eudaimonia]] and [[happiness]], and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligman cover a broad range of topics including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life." A [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies in 2009<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sin |first1=Nancy L. |last2=Lyubomirsky |first2=Sonja |title=Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |date=May 2009 |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=467–487 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20593|pmid=19301241 |doi-access=free }}</ref> showed that Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) produced improvements in well-being and lower [[Depression (mood)|depression]] levels, the PPIs studied included writing gratitude letters, learning optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences and socializing with others. In a later meta-analysis of 39 studies with 6,139 participants in 2012,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bolier |first1=Linda |last2=Haverman |first2=Merel |last3=Westerhof |first3=Gerben J |last4=Riper |first4=Heleen |last5=Smit |first5=Filip |last6=Bohlmeijer |first6=Ernst |title=Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies |journal=BMC Public Health |date=December 2013 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=119 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-119|pmid=23390882 |pmc=3599475 |doi-access=free }}</ref> the outcomes were positive. Three to six months after a PPI the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant. However the positive effect was weaker than in the 2009 meta analysis, the authors concluded that this was because they only used higher quality studies. The PPIs they considered included counting blessings, [[kindness]] practices, making personal goals, showing gratitude and focusing on personal strengths. Another review of PPIs published in 2018 found that over 78% of intervention studies were conducted in Western countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hendriks |first1=Tom |last2=Warren |first2=Meg A |last3=Schotanus-Dijkstra |first3=Marijke |last4=Hassankhan |first4=Aabidien |last5=Graafsma |first5=Tobi |last6=Bohlmeijer |first6=Ernst |last7=de Jong |first7=Joop |title=How WEIRD are positive psychology interventions?

In the textbook ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness'', authors Compton and Hoffman give the "Top Down Predictors" of well-being as high [[self esteem]], [[optimism]], [[self efficacy]], a sense of meaning in life and positive relationships with others. The personality traits most associated with well being are [[extraversion]], [[agreeability]] and low levels of [[neuroticism]].

In a study published in 2020, students were enrolled in a positive psychology course that focused on improving happiness and well-being through teaching about positive psychology.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Bruce W.|last2=Ford|first2=C. Graham|last3=Erickson|first3=Kelly|last4=Guzman|first4=Anne|date=February 1, 2020|title=The Effects of a Character Strength Focused Positive Psychology Course on Undergraduate Happiness and Well-Being|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10902-020-00233-9|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=343–362|doi=10.1007/s10902-020-00233-9|s2cid=214172035}}</ref> The participants answer questions pertaining to the 5 categories known as PERMA. At the end of the semester those same students reported significantly higher scores in all categories (p <.001) minus engagement which was significant at p < .05. One of the aims of this study was to make it rewarding for positive psychology interventions to stay in the participants lives. The authors stated, “Not only do students learn and get credit, there is also a good chance that many will reap the benefits in what is most important to them—their health, happiness, and well-being.”<ref name=":11" />

=== Academic methods ===

==== Quantitative ====
Quantitative methods in positive psychology include p-technique factor analysis, dynamic factor analysis, interindividual differences and [[structural equation modeling]], spectral analysis and item response models, dynamic systems analysis, latent growth analysis, [[Latent class model|latent-class models]], [[hierarchical linear modeling]], [[measurement invariance]], [[experimental method]]s, [[Behavioural genetics|behavior genetics]], and integration of quantitative and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61178188|title=Oxford handbook of methods in positive psychology|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Ong, Anthony D., Van Dulmen, Manfred H. M.|isbn=978-0-19-517218-8|location=Oxford|oclc=61178188}}</ref>

==== Qualitative ====
In a 2012 ''[[The Journal of Positive Psychology|Journal of Positive Psychology]]'' article published by Grant J. Rich, the usage of [[Qualitative research|qualitative methodology]] to study positive psychology is explored and considered.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=Grant J.|date=2017|title=The promise of qualitative inquiry for positive psychology: Diversifying methods|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2016.1225119|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=12|issue=3|pages=220–231|doi=10.1080/17439760.2016.1225119|s2cid=151352247}}</ref> Author Rich addresses the popularity of quantitative methods in studying the [[Empirical research|empirical]] questions that positive psychology presents. He argues that there is an "overemphasis" on quantitative methods and suggests implementing qualitative methods, such as [[semi-structured interview]]s, observations, [[Field research|fieldwork]], [[Creative work|creative artwork]], and [[focus group]]s. Rich states that qualitative approaches are valuable approaches to studying positive psychology. He writes that usage of qualitative methods will further promote the "flourishing of positive psychology" and encourages such practice.<ref name=":5" />

==== Behavioral interventions ====
Changing happiness levels through [[Psychological intervention|interventions]] is a further methodological advancement in the study of positive psychology. Enhancing happiness through behavioral interventions has been the focus of various [[Academic journal|academic and scientific psychological publications]]. Happiness-enhancing interventions include expressing [[kindness]], [[gratitude]], [[optimism]], [[humility]], [[awe]], and [[mindfulness]].

In 2005, Sonja Lyubomirsky, Kennon M. Sheldon, and David Schkade co-authored an academic paper published in the journal ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lyubomirsky|first1=Sonja|last2=Sheldon|first2=Kennon M.|last3=Schkade|first3=David|date=2005|title=Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111|journal=Review of General Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=111–131|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111|s2cid=6705969|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.9655}}</ref> In their research, they created a [[Experimental psychology#Experiments|behavioral experiment]] using two 6-week interventions. One intervention studied was the performance of acts of kindness. The other was focused on gratitude and emphasized the counting of one's blessings. The study participants who went through the behavioral interventions reported higher levels of happiness and well-being than those who did not participate in either intervention. The paper provides experimental support for the effect of gratitude and kindness on enhancing subjective well-being and happiness.

Further research conducted by Sonja Lyubomirsky, Rene Dickerhoof, Julia K. Boehm, and Kennon M. Sheldon, published in 2011 in the academic journal ''[[Emotion (journal)|Emotion]]'', found that the interventions of expressing optimism and expressing gratitude enhanced subjective well-being in participants who took part in the intervention for 8 months.<ref name=":62">{{Cite journal|last1=Lyubomirsky|first1=Sonja|last2=Dickerhoof|first2=Rene|last3=Boehm|first3=Julia K.|last4=Sheldon|first4=Kennon M.|date=2011|title=Becoming happier takes both a will and a proper way: An experimental longitudinal intervention to boost well-being.|url= |journal=Emotion|volume=11|issue=2|pages=391–402|doi=10.1037/a0022575|pmid=21500907|pmc=4380267}}</ref> The researchers concluded that interventions are "most successful when participants know about, endorse, and commit to the intervention."<ref name=":62" /> The article provides support that when individuals enthusiastically take part in behavioral interventions, such as expression of optimism and gratitude, they may be engaging in an approach to increase happiness and subjective well-being.

In 2014, Elliott Kruse, Joseph Chancellor, Peter M. Ruberton, and Sonja Lyubomirsky published an academic article in the journal ''[[Social Psychological and Personality Science|Social Psychology and Personality Science]].''<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Kruse|first1=Elliott|last2=Chancellor|first2=Joseph|last3=Ruberton|first3=Peter M.|last4=Lyubomirsky|first4=Sonja|date=2014|title=An Upward Spiral Between Gratitude and Humility|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550614534700|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|language=en|volume=5|issue=7|pages=805–814|doi=10.1177/1948550614534700|s2cid=7390929}}</ref> In their research, they study the interaction effects between gratitude and humility through behavior interventions. The interventions they studied were writing a gratitude letter and writing a 14-day diary. In both interventions, Kruse et al. found that gratitude and humility are connected and are "mutually reinforcing."<ref name=":7" /> The article also discusses how gratitude, and its associated humility, may lead to more positive emotional states and subjective well-being.

Researchers Melanie Rudd, Kathleen D. Vohs, and Jennifer Aaker conducted a series of experiments that showed a positive effect of awe on subjective well-being, publishing their results in 2012 in the academic journal ''[[Psychological Science]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rudd|first1=Melanie|last2=Vohs|first2=Kathleen D.|last3=Aaker|first3=Jennifer|date=2012|title=Awe Expands People's Perception of Time, Alters Decision Making, and Enhances Well-Being|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612438731|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1130–1136|doi=10.1177/0956797612438731|pmid=22886132|s2cid=9159218|citeseerx=10.1.1.650.9416}}</ref> Their research found that individuals who felt awe also reported feeling higher availability of time, more preference for experiential expenditures than material expenditures, and greater life satisfaction. Experiences that heighten awe may lead to higher levels of life satisfaction and, in turn, higher levels of happiness and subjective well-being.

Mindfulness interventions may also increase happiness. In a ''[[Mindfulness (journal)|Mindfulness]]'' article published in 2011 by Torbjörn Josefsson, Pernilla Larsman, Anders G. Broberg, and Lars-Gunnar Lundh, it was found that meditation improves subjective well-being for individuals who mindfully meditate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Josefsson|first1=Torbjörn|last2=Larsman|first2=Pernilla|last3=Broberg|first3=Anders G.|last4=Lundh|first4=Lars-Gunnar|date=2011|title=Self-Reported Mindfulness Mediates the Relation Between Meditation Experience and Psychological Well-Being|journal=Mindfulness|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–58|doi=10.1007/s12671-011-0042-9|s2cid=145232909}}</ref> The researchers note that being mindful in meditation includes awareness and observation of one's meditation practice, with non-reaction and non-judgmental sentiments during meditation.

=== National indices of happiness ===
The creation of various national [[Index (statistics)|indices]] of happiness have broadened and expanded the field of positive psychology to a global scale.

In a January 2000 academic article published in ''American Psychologist'', psychologist [[Ed Diener]] proposed and argued for the creation of a national happiness index in the United States.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Diener|first=Ed|date=2000|title=Subjective well-being: The science of happiness and a proposal for a national index.|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.34|journal=American Psychologist|volume=55|issue=1|pages=34–43|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.34|pmid=11392863}}</ref> Such an index would provide measurements of happiness, or subjective well-being, within the United States and across many other countries in the world. Diener argued that national indices would be helpful markers or indicators of population happiness, providing a sense of current ratings and a tracker of happiness across time. Diener proposed that the national index include various sub-measurements of subjective well-being, including "pleasant affect, unpleasant affect, life satisfaction, fulfillment, and more specific states such as stress, affection, trust, and joy."<ref name=":13" />

In 2012, the first [[World Happiness Report]] was published. The World Happiness Report was initiated by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in June 2011, which passed the Bhutanese Resolution.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=World Happiness Report 2020|url=http://worldhappiness.report/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=worldhappiness.report|language=en}}</ref> The Bhutanese Resolution called for nations across the world to "give more importance to happiness and well-being in determining how to achieve and measure social and economic development."<ref name=":4" /> The data for the World Happiness Reports is collected in partnership with the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] World Poll's life evaluations and annual happiness rankings. The World Happiness Report bases its national rankings on how happy constituents self-report and believe themselves to be.

The first World Happiness Report, published in 2012, is a 170-page report that details the state of world happiness, the causes of happiness and misery, policy implications from happiness reports, and three case studies of subjective well-being for 1) Bhutan and its [[Gross National Happiness]] index, 2) the U.K. [[Office for National Statistics]] Experience, and 3) happiness in the member countries within the [[OECD]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=edited by John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffrey Sachs|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946558240|title=World happiness report ; 2012, World happiness report|date=2012|publisher=Earth Institute, Columbia University|isbn=978-0-9968513-0-5|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=946558240}}</ref> The World Happiness Report published in 2020 is the 8th publication in the series of reports.

== Influences on other academic fields ==
Positive psychology has influenced a variety of other academic fields of study and scholarship. It has been applied to various other areas of scholarship, most notably [[Organizational behavior|Organizational Behavior]] and [[Psychiatry]].

=== Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) ===
Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS), also referred to as Positive Organizational Behavior (POB), began as a direct application of positive psychology to the field of [[organizational behavior]]. One of the first times the term was officially defined and published was in 2003, in the text ''Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline'' edited by [[Ross School of Business|University of Michigan Ross School of Business]] professors [[Kim S. Cameron]], Jane E. Dutton, and Robert E. Quinn.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Kim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cumQYLiKCCcC&q=positive+organizational+scholarship&pg=PR9|title=Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline|last2=Dutton|first2=Jane|last3=Quinn|first3=Robert E.|date=2003|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|isbn=978-1-57675-966-0|language=en}}</ref> In the first chapter of the text, Cameron, Dutton, and Quinn promote "the best of the human condition," such as goodness, compassion, resilience, and positive human potential, as an organizational goal as important as financial organizational success.<ref name=":8" /> The goal of POS is to study the factors that create positive work experiences and successful, people-oriented organizational outcomes.

A large collection of POS research is contained in the 2011 volume ''The Oxford Handbook of Positive Organizational Scholarship,'' edited by University of Michigan Ross School of Business Professors [[Kim S. Cameron]] and Gretchen M. Spreitzer.<ref name=":92">{{Cite document|date=2011-08-22|editor-last=Spreitzer|editor-first=Gretchen M.|editor2-last=Cameron|editor2-first=Kim S.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Positive Organizational Scholarship|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199734610.001.0001|isbn=9780199734610}}</ref> This 1076-page volume encompasses nine sections and 79 chapters spanning various topics. Major topics include positive human resource practices, positive organizational practices, and positive leadership and change. Much of the volume expands upon and applies core concepts of positive psychology to the workplace context, covering areas such as positive individual attributes, positive emotions, strengths and virtues, and positive relationships. A further definition of POS, as written by editors Cameron and Spreitzer:<blockquote class="templatequote">Positive organizational scholarship rigorously seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition based on scholarly research and theory. Just as positive psychology focuses on exploring optimal individual psychological states rather than pathological ones, organizational scholarship focuses attention on the generative dynamics in organizations that lead to the development of human strength, foster resiliency in employees, enable healing and restoration, and cultivate extraordinary individual and organizational performance. POS emphasizes what elevates individuals and organizations (in addition to what challenges them), what goes right in organizations (in addition to what goes wrong), what is life-giving (in addition to what is problematic or life-depleting), what is experienced as good (in addition to what is objectionable), and what is inspiring (in addition to what is difficult or arduous).<div class="templatequotecite">— Kim S.

=== Psychiatry ===
Positive psychology has influenced psychiatry by providing additional therapeutic and [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavior]] shifts, including well-being therapy, positive [[psychotherapy]], and practicing an integration of positive psychology in [[Therapy|therapeutic practice]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|title=Positive psychology in practice|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/positive_psychology_in_practice|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Harvard Health}}</ref>

In an 2015 academic article published in ''Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation'', Mills and Kreutzer argue for the principles of positive psychology to be implemented to assist those recovering from [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Ana L.|last2=Kreutzer|first2=Jeffrey S.|date=2015|title=Theoretical Applications of Positive Psychology to Vocational Rehabilitation After Traumatic Brain Injury|journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation|volume=26|issue=1|pages=20–31|doi=10.1007/s10926-015-9608-z|pmid=26373862|s2cid=19549504}}</ref> They make the case that TBI rehabilitation practices rely on the betterment of the individual through engaging in everyday practices, a practice significantly related to tenets of positive psychology. Their proposal to connect positive psychology with TBI [[vocational rehabilitation]] (VR) also looks at happiness and its [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] with improvements in [[mental health]], including increased confidence and productivity, as well as others. While the authors point out that empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, they clarify that positive psychology's focus on small successes, optimism and prosocial behavior is promising for improvements in the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.

==Popular culture==
The study of positive psychology has been translated into various popular media outlets, including books and films, and has been an influencing factor in the wellness industry.

=== Books ===
There have been several [[popular psychology]] books written by positive psychologists for a general audience.

Ilona Boniwell, in her book ''Positive Psychology in a Nutshell'', provided a summary of the current research. According to Boniwell, well-being is related to optimism, [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], social connections (i.e., close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods) and subjective health (what you think about your health).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Boniwell|first=Ilona|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10608571|title=Positive psychology in a nutshell: the science of happiness|date=2012|isbn=978-0-335-24721-9|language=en|oclc=816029887}}</ref> Boniwell further writes that well-being is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children (although they add meaning to life), moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing and objective health (what doctors say).

[[Sonja Lyubomirsky#The How of Happiness|Sonja Lyubomirsky]], in her book ''The How of Happiness'', provides advice and guidance on how to improve happiness. According to ''The How of Happiness,'' individuals should create new habits, seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent [[Hedonic treadmill|hedonic adaptation]], and enlist others to motivate and support during the creation of those new habits.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lyubomirsky|first=Sonja|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-of-happiness-a-scientific-approach-to-getting-the-life-you-want/oclc/173683624|title=The how of happiness: a scientific approach to getting the life you want|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-1-59420-148-6|location=New York|language=en|oclc=173683624}}</ref> Lyubomirsky gives 12 happiness activities, including savoring life, learning to forgive, and living in the present.

''[[Stumbling on Happiness]]'' by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] is another popular book that shares positive psychology research findings for a general readership audience. Gilbert presents research suggesting that individuals are often poor at predicting what will make them happy in the future and that individuals are prone to misevaluating the causes of their happiness.<ref name=":10">{{Cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Daniel Todd|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/stumbling-on-happiness/oclc/61362165|title=Stumbling on happiness|date=2006|publisher=A.A. Knopf|isbn=978-1-4000-7742-7|location=New York|language=en|oclc=61362165}}</ref> He also notes that the subjectivity of subjective well-being and happiness often is the most difficult challenge to overcome in predicting future happiness, noting that our future selves may have different subjective perspectives on life than our current selves.

=== Films ===
Coverage of positive psychology has entered the [[film industry]]. Similarly, films have provided the basis of new research within positive psychology.

[[Happy (2011 film)]] is a full-length documentary film covering overviewing the fields of positive psychology and [[neuroscience]]. It also highlights various case studies on happiness across diverse cultures and geographies. The film features interviews with notable positive psychologists and scholars, including Daniel Gilbert, Ed Diener, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.<ref>{{Citation|last=Belic|first=Roko|title=Happy|date=2011|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1613092/|type=Documentary, Drama, Family|others=Marci Shimoff, Ed Diener, Richard Davidson, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|publisher=Emotional Content, Iris Films, Wadi Rum Films|access-date=2020-11-29}}</ref>

The Positive Psychology News website includes a section on annual Positive Psychology Movie Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Positive Psychology Movie Awards for 2018|url=https://positivepsychologynews.com/news/ryan-niemiec/2019042539708|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Positive Psychology News|language=en-US}}</ref> The Positive Psychology Movie Awards ranks a short list of feature films of 2009, 2014, and annually between 2016 and 2018 that feature powerful messages of positive psychology. The rankings are according to the website's author, Ryan Niemiec, Psy.D, who is a psychologist, coach, and education director of the VIA Institute on Character. The Positive Psychology Movie Awards presents separate awards for categories including: Best Positive Psychology Film, Award for Positive Relationships, Award for Meaning, Award for Achievement, Award for Mindfulness, Award for Happiness, Signature Strengths Use, among others.

Further research done on positive psychology as represented in feature films has been done in association with the VIA Institute. Contemporary and popular films that promote or represent character strengths are the basis for various academic articles.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Character Strengths, Character Building Experts {{!}} VIA Institute|url=https://www.viacharacter.org/research/findings/positive-psychology-movies|access-date=2020-11-29|website=www.viacharacter.org}}</ref>

=== Wellness industry ===
The growing popularity and attention given to positive psychology research has influenced industry growth, development, and consumption of products and services meant to cater to wellness and well-being.

According to the Global Wellness Institute, as of 2018, the global wellness economy is valued at $4.5 trillion and the wellness industry represents 5.3% of global economic output.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Statistics & Facts|url=https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Global Wellness Institute|language=en-US}}</ref> Key sectors of the wellness industry include workplace wellness, fitness and mind-body, personal care, and wellness lifestyle.

Highlighting happiness and well-being has been a strategy harnessed by various companies in their marketing strategies. Food and beverage companies such as Coca-Cola<ref>{{Cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Jeremy|date=2013-05-07|title=Coca-Cola Really Does Sell Happiness|url=http://psychologyofwellbeing.com/201305/coca-cola-really-does-sell-happiness.html|access-date=2020-11-30|website=The Psychology of Wellbeing|language=en-US}}</ref> and Pocky, whose motto is "Share happiness!",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pocky {{!}} About|url=https://pocky.com/about}}</ref> emphasize happiness in their commercials, branding, and descriptions. CEOs at retail companies such as Zappos have profited by publishing books detailing their deliverance of happiness,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hsieh, Tony.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/320191190|title=Delivering happiness : a path to profits, passion, and purpose|date=2010|publisher=Business Plus|isbn=978-0-446-56304-8|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=320191190}}</ref> while Amazon's logo features a dimpled smile.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rogoza|first=Posted byRoman|date=2012-08-22|title=Arrow or Smile: What Message Is Hidden in Amazon Logo?|url=https://www.logaster.com/blog/amazon-logo/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Logaster Blog|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Positive psychology has been criticized in many different aspects from its conception continuing into the present day.

=== Reality distortion ===
In 1988, psychologists [[Shelley E. Taylor]] and Jonathan D. Brown co-authored a ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' article that coined the phrase [[positive illusions]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Shelley E.|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathon D.|date=1988|title=Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health |journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=103|issue=2|pages=193–210|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193|pmid=3283814|citeseerx=10.1.1.337.407}}</ref> Positive illusions are the [[cognitive processes]] individuals engage in when [[Self aggrandizing|self-aggrandizing]] or self-enhancing. They are the unrealistically positive or self-affirming attitudes that individuals hold of themselves, their position, or their environment. In essence, positive illusions are attitudes of extreme optimism that endure even in the face of facts and real conditions. Taylor and Brown suggested that positive illusions protect individuals from negative feedback that they might receive, and this, in turn, preserves their [[psychological adaptation]] and subjective well-being. However, later research has found that engaging in positive illusions and related attitudes has led to psychological [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] conditions. These conditions include poorer social relationships, expressions of [[narcissism]], and negative workplace outcomes,<ref>{{Cite news|date=2010-02-27|title=Positive Illusions and Positive Psychology: Do Positive Illusions Foster Mental Health?|url=http://positivepsychology.org.uk/positive-illusions/|access-date=2020-11-29|website=PositivePsychology.org.uk|language=en-US}}</ref> thus reducing the positive effects that positive illusions have on subjective well-being, overall happiness, and life satisfaction.

[[Kirk J. Schneider|Kirk Schneider]], editor of the [[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]], has said that positive psychology fails to explain past heinous behaviors such as those perpetrated by the Nazi party, Stalinist marches and Klan gatherings, to identify but a few. He also pointed to a body of research showing high positivity correlates with positive illusion, which effectively distorts reality. The extent of the downfall of high positivity or [[flourishing]] is one could become incapable of psychological growth, unable to self-reflect, and tend to hold racial biases. By contrast, negativity, sometimes evidenced in mild to moderate depression, is correlated with less distortion of reality. Therefore, Schneider argues, negativity might play an important role within the dynamics of human flourishing. To illustrate, conflict engagement and acknowledgement of appropriate negativity, including certain negative emotions like guilt, might better promote flourishing. Overall, Schneider provided perspective: "perhaps genuine happiness is not something you aim at, but is...a by-product of a life well lived – and a life well lived does not settle on the programmed or neatly calibrated."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Toward a Humanistic Positive Psychology: Why Can't We Just Get Along?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/awakening-awe/201011/toward-humanistic-positive-psychology-why-cant-we-just-get-along|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Narrow focus ===
In 2003, Ian Sample, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', noted that, "Positive psychologists also stand accused of burying their heads in the sand and ignoring that depressed, even merely unhappy people, have real problems that need dealing with."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2003-11-19|title=Why do some people enjoy life and others don't?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/19/1|access-date=2021-06-21|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> He also quoted Steven Wolin, a [[clinical psychiatrist]] at [[George Washington University]], as saying that the study of positive psychology is just a reiteration of older ways of thinking, and that there is not much scientific research to support the efficacy of this method. Gable responds to criticism on their Pollyanna view on the world by saying that they are just bringing a balance to a side of psychology that is glaringly understudied. To defend his point, Gable points to the imbalances favoring research into negative psychological well-being in [[cognitive psychology]], [[health psychology]], and [[social psychology]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2003-11-19|title=Why do some people enjoy life and others don't?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/19/1|access-date=2021-07-08|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

Martin Jack has also maintained that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to looking at optimal emotional well-being, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counseling and [[educational psychology]], are also interested in positive human fulfillment. He goes on to mention that, while positive psychology has pushed for schools to be more student-centered and able to foster positive self-images in children, he worries that a lack of focus on self-control may prevent children from making full contributions to society. If positive psychology is not implemented correctly, it can cause more harm than good. This is the case, for example, when interventions in school are coercive (in the sense of being imposed on everyone without regard for the individual child's reason for negativity) and fail to take each student's context into account.<ref name="Ciarrochi 2016">{{Cite journal|last1=Ciarrochi|first1=Joseph|last2=Atkins|first2=Paul W.

=== Role of negativity ===
[[Barbara S. Held]], a professor at [[Bowdoin College]], argued that while positive psychology makes contributions to the field of psychology, it has its faults. She offered insight into topics including the negative side effects of positive psychology, negativity within the positive psychology movement, and the current division in the field of psychology caused by differing opinions of psychologists on positive psychology. In addition, she noted the movement's lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raised issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A "one size fits all" approach is arguably not beneficial to the advancement of the field of positive psychology; she suggested a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Barbara S.|date=2004-01-01|title=The Negative Side of Positive Psychology|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022167803259645|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–46|doi=10.1177/0022167803259645|s2cid=146703182|issn=0022-1678}}</ref> By teaching young people that being confident and optimistic leads to success, when they are unsuccessful they will begin to believe it is because they are insecure or pessimistic. This could lead them to believe that any negative internal thought or feeling they may experience is damaging to their happiness and should be steered clear of completely.<ref name="Ciarrochi 2016"/>

=== Toxic positivity ===
A recent critical response to the field of positive psychology is that around toxic positivity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Halberstam |first=Jack |date=2011 |title=The Queer Art of Failure |isbn=978-0-8223-5045-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Colin |date=2014 |title=Happiness Studies and Wellbeing: A Lacanian Critique of Contemporary Conceptualisations of the Cure |url=https://cultureunbound.ep.liu.se/article/view/2113 |journal=Culture Unbound  |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=795 |doi=10.3384/cu.2000.1525.146791}}</ref> Toxic positivity is the concept or phenomenon in which individuals do not fully acknowledge, process, or manage the full spectrum of emotions, including anger or sadness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Toxic Positivity: Don't Always Look on the Bright Side|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-man-cave/201908/toxic-positivity-dont-always-look-the-bright-side|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}</ref> This genre of criticism against positive psychology argues that the field of positive psychology places too much importance on "upbeat thinking, while shunting challenging and difficult experiences to the side."<ref>{{Cite web|author=Jen Rose Smith|title=When does a good attitude become toxic positivity?|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/health/toxic-positivity-mental-health-wellness/index.html|access-date=2020-11-29|website=CNN}}</ref> Individuals who engage in a constant chase for positive experiences or states of high subjective well-being may be inadvertently [[stigmatizing]] negative emotional conditions, such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], or may be suppressing natural emotional responses, such as [[sadness]], [[regret]], or [[Psychological stress|stress]]. Furthermore, by not allowing negative emotional states to be experienced, or by suppressing and hiding negative emotional responses, individuals may experience harmful physical, [[cardiovascular]], and [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] consequences.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Zawn Villines  |editor-last=Johnson|editor-first=Jacquelyn|title=What to know about toxic positivity|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/toxic-positivity|website=Medical News Today|date=31 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=J.

=== Methodological and philosophical critiques ===
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2021}}
[[Richard Lazarus]], who was well known in psychology for his [[Cognitive-Motivational-Relational]] theory of emotions, has thoroughly critiqued some methodological and philosophical components of positive psychology. He holds that giving more detail and insight into the positive is not a bad thing, but not at the expense of the negative aspect, because the two (positive and negative) are inseparable. The first methodological issue noted is positive psychology's use of correlational and cross-sectional research designs to indicate a causality between the movement's ideas and healthy lives, there could be other factors not researched and time differences that account for healthier lives that the researchers do not account for. Secondly, he considers that emotions cannot be categorized dichotomously into positive and negative; by nature, emotions are subjective and rich in social/relational meaning. Additionally, he claims that emotions are fluid, meaning that the context they appear in changes over time. He states that “all emotions have the potential of being either one or the other, or both, on different occasions, and even on the same occasion when an emotion is experienced by different persons”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazarus|first=Richard S.|date=2003|title=Does the Positive Psychology Movement Have Legs?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1449813|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=14|issue=2|pages=93–109|doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1402_02|jstor=1449813|s2cid=52037670|issn=1047-840X}}</ref> The third issue is the neglect of individual differences in most social science research. Many research designs focus on statistical significance of the groups, while overlooking differences among individuals. Lazarus's final methodological complain is the tendency for social science researchers to not adequately define and measure emotions. Most assessments are quick checklists and do not provide adequate debriefing. Many researchers do not differentiate between fluid emotional states and relatively stable personality traits.

Lazarus further holds that positive psychology claims to be new and innovative although the majority of research on stress and coping theory make much of the same claims as positive psychology. The movement attempts to uplift and reinforce the positive aspects of one's life, but everyone in life experiences stress and hardship. Coping through these events should not be looked at as adapting to failures, but should be regarded as successfully navigating stress, but the movement doesn't hold that perspective.

== The US Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program ==

The [[Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness|Comprehensive Soldier Fitness]] (CSF) program was established in 2008 by then-Chief of Staff of the [[United States Army]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[George W. Casey, Jr.]], in an effort to address the increasing rates of drug abuse, family violence, [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], and suicide among soldiers. The Army contracted with Martin Seligman's Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania to supply a program closely based on the center's Penn Resiliency Program, which was designed for 10- to 14-year-old children.<ref name="Singal">{{cite web|last=Singal|first=Jesse|title=Positive Psychology Goes to War|date=June 7, 2021|accessdate=July 25, 2021|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/positive-psychology-goes-to-war}}</ref> Although Seligman proposed starting with a small-scale pilot-test, General Casey insisted on immediately rolling out the CSF to the entire Army.<ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Martin E. P.|title=Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-Being|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|page=163|isbn=9781439190753}}</ref> Interviewed for the journal ''Monitor on Psychology'' of the [[American Psychological Association]], Seligman said that "This is the largest study—1.1 million soldiers—psychology has ever been involved in."<ref>{{cite web|last=Novotney|first=Amy|title=Strong in mind and body|date=December 2009|accessdate=July 25, 2021|url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/12/army-program}}</ref> According to journalist Jesse Singal, "It would become one of the largest mental-health interventions geared at a single population in the history of humanity, and possibly the most expensive."<ref name="Singal"/>

Some psychologists have criticized the CSF for various reasons. Nicholas J. L. Brown wrote that "The idea that techniques that have demonstrated, at best, marginal effects in reducing depressive symptoms in school-age children could also prevent the onset of a condition that is associated with some of the most extreme situations with which humans can be confronted is a remarkable one that does not seem to be backed up by empirical evidence."<ref name="Brown">{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Nicholas J. L.|title=A critical examination of the US Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program|journal=The Winnower|volume=2|year=2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264224551}}</ref>
[[Stephen Soldz]] of the [[Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis]] cited Seligman's acknowledgment that the CSF is a gigantic study rather than a program based on proven techniques, and questioned the ethics of requiring soldiers to participate in research without informed consent.<ref name="Soldz">{{cite journal|last=Soldz|first=Stephen|title=The Dark Side of "Comprehensive Soldier Fitness"|journal=The American Psychologist|date=March 24, 2011|volume=66|issue=7|pages=643-4; discussion 646-7|doi=10.1037/a0025272|pmid=21967209|accessdate=July 25, 2021|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2011/03/24/the-dark-side-of-comprehensive-soldier-fitness/}}</ref> Soldz also criticized the CSF training for trying to build up-beat attitudes toward combat: "Might soldiers who have been trained to resiliently view combat as a growth opportunity be more likely to ignore or under-estimate real dangers, thereby placing themselves, their comrades, or civilians at heightened risk of harm?"<ref name="Soldz"/>

In 2021 the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] carried a debate between Singal and Seligman about whether, with the CSF well into its second decade, there was any solid evidence of its effectiveness. Singal cited studies that, he said, failed to find any measurable benefits in such positive psychology techniques, and he criticized the Army's own reports as methodologically unsound and lacking peer review.<ref name="Singal"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Singal|first=Jesse|title=Magical Thinking on Positive Psychology: The field's founder can't see past his own hype|date=July 22, 2021|accessdate=July 25, 2021|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/magical-thinking-on-positive-psychology}}</ref> Seligman said that Singal had misinterpreted the studies and ignored the Army's positive feedback from soldiers, one of whom told Seligman that "if I had had this training years ago, it would have saved my marriage."<ref>{{cite web|last=Seligman|first=Martin E.
