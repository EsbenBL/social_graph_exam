==Contributions to political sociology==

Spillman's dissertation and first book published in 1997, ''Nation and commemoration'', "examines meaning-making in politics. It traces the emergence of national identities in two similar “new nations” by comparing ritual and symbol in centennial and bicentennial commemorations."<ref name="nd"/> Prominent Berkeley cultural sociologist [[Ann Swidler]] describes the work as "pathbreaking" with how it convincingly describes how "two similar nations [Australia and the USA] end up with divergent images of national identity."<ref name="nd3">{{cite web|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~lspillma/nation.html|title=Nation and Commemoration - Lyn Spillman|publisher=www3.nd.edu|accessdate=2014-10-18}}</ref> The work was reviewed in several scholarly journals, including the [[American Journal of Sociology]], [[Social Forces]], International Affairs and the Journal of Intercultural Studies.<ref name="barnesandnoble">{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nation-and-commemoration-lynette-p-spillman/1116931102?ean=9780521574044|title=Nation and Commemoration: Creating National Identities in the United States and Australia by Lynette P.
