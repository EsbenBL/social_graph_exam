'''José Ortega y Gasset''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse oɾˈteɣa i ɣaˈset|lang}}; 9 May 1883&nbsp;– 18 October 1955) was a Spanish [[philosophy|philosopher]] and essayist. He worked during the first half of the 20th century, while Spain oscillated between [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|monarchy]], [[Second Spanish Republic|republicanism]], and [[Spanish Civil War|dictatorship]]. His [[philosophy]] has been characterized as a "[[philosophy of life]]" that "comprised a long-hidden beginning in a [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[metaphysics]] inspired by [[William James]], and with a general [[Methodology|method]] from a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] imitating [[Edmund Husserl]], which served both his proto-[[existentialism]] (prior to [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]])<ref name="SEP"/> and his realist [[historicism]], which has been compared to both [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Benedetto Croce]]."<ref>John T. Graham. ''A Pragmatist Philosophy of Life in Ortega y Gasset''. (University of Missouri Press, 1994), p. vii.</ref>

==Biography==
José Ortega y Gasset was born 9 May 1883 in [[Madrid]]. His father was director of the newspaper ''[[El Imparcial (1867–1933)|El Imparcial]]'', which belonged to the family of his mother, Dolores Gasset. The family was definitively of Spain's end-of-the-century liberal and educated bourgeoisie. The liberal tradition and journalistic engagement of his family had a profound influence in Ortega y Gasset's activism in politics.

Ortega was first schooled by the [[Jesuit]] priests of [[St. Stanislaus Kostka College, Málaga]], [[Málaga]] (1891–1897). He attended the [[University of Deusto]], [[Bilbao]] (1897–98) and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the Central University of Madrid (now [[Complutense University of Madrid]]) (1898–1904), receiving a doctorate in Philosophy. From 1905 to 1907, he continued his studies in [[Germany]] at [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Cologne]], [[Berlin]] and, above all [[Marburg]]. At Marburg, he was influenced by the [[neo-Kantianism]] of [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Paul Natorp]], among others.

On his return to Spain in 1908, he was appointed professor of [[Psychology]], [[Logic]] and [[Ethics]] at the Escuela Superior del Magisterio de Madrid.<ref name="ortegaygasset.edu">[http://www.ortegaygasset.edu/contenidos.asp?id_i=27 ''Datos biográficos'']</ref> In 1910, he married [[:es:Rosa_Spottorno_Topete|Rosa Spottorno Topete]], a Spanish translator and feminist, and was named full professor of [[Metaphysics]] at Complutense University of Madrid, a vacant seat previously held by [[Nicolás Salmerón]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Holmes|first=Oliver|title=José Ortega y Gasset|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/gasset/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref>

In 1917 he became a contributor to the newspaper ''[[El Sol (Madrid)|El Sol]]'', where he published, as a series of essays, his two principal works: ''España invertebrada'' (''Invertebrate Spain'') and ''La rebelión de las masas'' (''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]''). The latter made him internationally famous. He founded the ''[[Revista de Occidente]]'' in 1923, remaining its director until 1936. This publication promoted translation of (and commentary upon) the most important figures and tendencies in philosophy, including [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Johan Huizinga]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Jakob von Uexküll]], [[Heinz Heimsoeth]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Hans Driesch]], Ernst Müller, [[Alexander Pfänder]], and [[Bertrand Russell]].

Elected deputy for the [[Province of León]] in the constituent assembly of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], he was the leader of a parliamentary group of intellectuals known as ''Agrupación al Servicio de la República''<ref>Encarta Encyclopedia Spanish Version: Agrupación_al_Servicio_de_la_República Microsoft Corporation Spanish Version [http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1121500589/Agrupaci%C3%B3n_al_Servicio_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica.html].

Leaving Spain at the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], he spent years of exile in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] until moving back to [[Europe]] in 1942.<ref name="ortegaygasset.edu"/> He settled in [[Portugal]] by mid-1945 and slowly began to make short visits to Spain. In 1948 he returned to Madrid, where he founded the Institute of Humanities, at which he lectured.<ref>[http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/jose-ortega-y-gasset.php Philosophy Professor: Jose Ortega Y Gasset] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916073527/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/jose-ortega-y-gasset.php |date=16 September 2007 }}</ref> Upon his return to Spain, he often privately expressed his hostility to the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime, stating that the government did not deserve anyone's confidence and that his beliefs were "incompatible with Franco."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=19 November 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=38}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
===Liberalism===
''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' is Ortega's best known work. In this book he defends the values of meritocratic liberalism reminiscent of [[John Stuart Mill]] against attacks from both communists and right-wing populists.<ref name="Dobson">{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=19 November 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=60–72}}</ref> Ortega likewise shares Mill's fears of the "tyranny of the majority" and the "collective mediocrity" of the masses, which he believes threaten individuality, free thought, and protections for minorities.<ref name="Dobson" /> Ortega characterized liberalism as a politics of "magnanimity."<ref name="Dobson" />

Ortega's rejection of the Spanish [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservative Party]] under [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]] and his successors was unequivocal, as was his distrust of the Spanish monarchy and Catholic Church.<ref name="Dobson" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Enkvist |first1=Inger |title=José Ortega y Gasset – The Spanish philosopher who saw life as an intellectual adventure |journal=CFE Working Paper Series |date=2002 |volume=18 |page=16}}</ref> However, again in a manner similar to Mill, Ortega was open-minded toward certain socialists and non-Marxist forms of socialism, and even complimented [[Pablo Iglesias Posse]] as a "lay saint."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=19 November 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=46–47}}</ref> Under the influence of German social democrats such as [[Paul Natorp]] and [[Hermann Cohen]], he adopted a [[communitarian]] ontology and could be critical of capitalism, particularly the [[laissez-faire]] variant, declaring that "nineteenth-century capitalism has demoralized humanity" and that it had "impoverished the ethical consciousness of man."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=19 November 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=52–55}}</ref>

==="Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia"===
For Ortega y Gasset, philosophy has a critical duty to lay siege to beliefs in order to promote new ideas and to explain reality. To accomplish such tasks, the philosopher must—as Husserl proposed—leave behind prejudices and previously existing beliefs, and investigate the essential reality of the universe. Ortega y Gasset proposes that philosophy must overcome the limitations of both [[idealism]] (in which reality centers around the ego) and ancient-medieval [[Philosophical realism|realism]] (in which reality is outside the subject) to focus on the only truthful reality: "my life"—the life of each individual. He suggests that there is no "me" without things, and things are nothing without me: "I" (human being) cannot be detached from "my circumstance" (world). This led Ortega y Gasset to pronounce his famous maxim "Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia" ("I am I and my circumstance") (''Meditaciones del Quijote'', 1914)<ref>Ortega y Gasset, José. Obras Completas, Vol. I. Ed. Taurus/Fundación José Ortega y Gasset, Madrid, 2004, p. 757.</ref><ref name="SEP"/> which he always put at the core of his philosophy.

For Ortega y Gasset, as for Husserl, the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] '[[cogito ergo sum]]' is insufficient to explain reality. Therefore, the Spanish philosopher proposes a system wherein the basic or "radical" reality is "my life" (the first ''yo''), which consists of "I" (the second ''yo'') and "my circumstance" (''mi circunstancia''). This ''circunstancia'' is oppressive; therefore, there is a continual dialectical interaction between the person and his or her circumstances and, as a result, life is a drama that exists between necessity and freedom.

In this sense Ortega y Gasset wrote that life is at the same time fate and freedom, and that freedom "is being free inside of a given fate. Fate gives us an inexorable repertory of determinate possibilities, that is, it gives us different destinies. We accept fate and within it we choose one destiny." In this tied down fate we must therefore be active, decide and create a "project of life"—thus not be like those who live a conventional life of customs and given structures who prefer an unconcerned and imperturbable life because they are afraid of the duty of choosing a project.

===Ratiovitalism<!--'Ratiovitalism' redirects here-->===
With a philosophical system that centered around life, Ortega y Gasset also stepped out of [[Descartes]]' ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' and asserted "I live therefore I think". This stood at the root of his [[Kantian]]-inspired [[perspectivism]],<ref name="SEP"/> which he developed by adding a non-relativistic character in which absolute truth does exist and would be obtained by the sum of all perspectives of all lives, since for each human being life takes a concrete form and life itself is a true radical reality from which any philosophical system must derive. In this sense, Ortega coined the terms "vital reason"<ref name="SEP"/> ({{lang-es|razón vital}}, "reason with life as its foundation") to refer to a new type of reason that constantly defends the life from which it has surged and "ratiovitalism<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->" ({{lang-es|raciovitalismo}}), a theory that based knowledge in the radical reality of life, one of whose essential components is reason itself. This system of thought, which he introduces in ''History as System'', escaped from Nietzsche's vitalism in which life responded to impulses; for Ortega, reason is crucial to create and develop the above-mentioned project of life.

===Historical reason===
For Ortega y Gasset, vital reason is also "historical reason", for individuals and societies are not detached from their past. In order to understand a reality we must understand, as [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]] pointed out, its history.<ref name="SEP"/>

==Influence==
Ortega y Gasset's influence was considerable, not only because many sympathized with his philosophical writings, but also because those writings did not require that the reader be well-versed in technical philosophy.

Among those strongly influenced by Ortega y Gasset were [[Luis Buñuel]], {{ill|Manuel García Morente|es}}, {{ill|Joaquín Xirau|es}}, [[Xavier Zubiri]], [[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Milan Komar|Emilio Komar]], [[José Gaos]], [[Luis Recasens]], {{ill|Manuel Granell|es}}, [[Francisco Ayala (novelist)|Francisco Ayala]], [[María Zambrano]], {{ill|Agustín Basave (writer)|es|Agustín Basave Fernández del Valle|lt=Agustín Basave}}, [[Máximo Etchecopar]], [[Pedro Laín Entralgo]], {{ill|José Luis López-Aranguren|es}}, [[Julián Marías]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], {{ill|Paulino Garagorri|es}}, [[Olavo de Carvalho]], [[Vicente Ferreira da Silva]], [[Vilém Flusser]] and [[Félix Martí-Ibáñez]].

The [[Ortega hypothesis]], based on a quote in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'', states that average or mediocre scientists contribute substantially to the advancement of [[science]].

German grape breeder Hans Breider named the grape variety [[Ortega (grape)|Ortega]] in his honor.<ref>[http://www.wein-plus.eu/en/Ortega_3.0.1714.html Wein-Plus Glossar: Ortega], accessed 6 March 2013</ref>

The American philosopher [[Graham Harman]] has recognized Ortega y Gasset as a source of inspiration for his own [[object-oriented ontology]].

''La rebelión de las masas'' (''The Revolt of the Masses'') has been translated into English twice. The first, in 1932, is by a translator who wanted to remain anonymous,<ref>José Ortega y Gasset (1930/1950), ''The Revolt of the Masses'', reprint, New York: New American Library, p. 4.</ref> generally accepted to be J.R. Carey.<ref>as referenced by the Project Gutenberg eBook of U.S. Copyright Renewals, 1960 January – June.</ref>
The second translation was published by the [[University of Notre Dame Press]] in 1985, in association with [[W.W. Norton]] & Co. This translation was by Anthony Kerrigan (translator) and Kenneth Moore (editor), with an introduction by [[Saul Bellow]].

[[Mildred Adams]] is the translator (into English) of the main body of Ortega's work, including ''Invertebrate Spain'', ''Man and Crisis'', ''What is Philosophy?'', ''Some Lessons in Metaphysics'', ''The Idea of Principle in Leibniz and the Evolution of Deductive Theory'', and ''An Interpretation of Universal History''.

===Madrid School<!--'School of Madrid' and 'Madrid School' redirect here-->===
The '''Madrid School'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (also '''School of Madrid'''; {{lang-es|Escuela de Madrid}}) was a group of philosophers, the members of which were students of Ortega y Gasset, who share an intellectual tradition of arguing against [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[positivism]].<ref name=:0>A. Pablo Iannone, ''Dictionary of World Philosophy', Routledge, 2013, p. 328: "Madrid School".</ref> Members included [[José Gaos]], [[Julián Marías]], and [[Xavier Zubiri]].<ref name=:0/>

===Influence on the Generation of '27===
Ortega y Gasset had considerable influence on writers of the [[Generation of '27]], a group of poets that arose in Spanish literature in the 1920s.
