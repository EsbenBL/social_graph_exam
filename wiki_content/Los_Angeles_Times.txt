The '''''Los Angeles Times''''' (abbreviated as '''''LA Times''''') is a [[Newspaper#Daily|daily newspaper]] based in [[El Segundo, California]], which has been published in [[Los Angeles]], California, since 1881.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Los Angeles Times {{!}} History, Ownership, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Los-Angeles-Times|access-date=2020-10-01|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> It has the [[List of newspapers in the United States|fifth-largest circulation in the U.S.]], and is the largest American [[newspaper]] not headquartered on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The 10 Most Popular Daily Newspapers In The United States |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-popular-daily-newspapers-in-the-united-states.html |access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref> The paper focuses its coverage of issues particularly salient to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], such as [[immigration]] trends and [[natural disasters]]. It has won more than 40 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for its coverage of these and other issues. {{As of|2018|June|18|df=US}}, ownership of the paper is controlled by [[Patrick Soon-Shiong]], and the executive editor is [[Norman Pearlstine]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/norman-pearlstine-los-angeles-times.html |title=Norman Pearlstine Named Editor of The Los Angeles Times |last=Arango |first=Tim |date=2018-06-18 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2018-06-18 |language=en}}</ref>

In the 19th century, the paper developed a reputation for civic [[boosterism]] and opposition to [[Trade union|labor unions]], the latter of which led to the bombing of its [[headquarters]] in 1910. The paper's profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher [[Otis Chandler]], who adopted a more national focus. In recent decades the paper's readership has declined, and it has been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies. In January 2018, the paper's staff voted to [[unionize]] and finalized their first union contract on October 16, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-16/los-angeles-times-first-guild-contract |title=Los Angeles Times reaches historic agreement with its newsroom union |date=2019-10-17 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> The paper moved out of its [[Los Angeles Times Building|historic downtown headquarters]] to a facility in [[El Segundo, California]] near [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in July 2018.

[[File:Chandler and Otis 001.jpg|thumb|Chandler and Otis 1917]]

===Otis era===
The ''Times'' was first published on December 4, 1881, as the ''Los Angeles Daily Times'' under the direction of [[Nathan Cole Jr.]] and [[Thomas Gardiner (publisher)|Thomas Gardiner]]. It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by [[Jesse Yarnell]] and [[T.J. Caystile]]. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, [[S. J. Mathes]] had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the ''Times'' continued publication. In July 1882, [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] moved from [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to become the paper's editor.<ref name=LAT1923>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/161491578 "Mirror Acorn, 'Times' Oak," ''Los Angeles Times,'' October 23, 1923, page II-1] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Otis made the ''Times'' a financial success.

Historian [[Kevin Starr]] wrote that Otis was a businessman "capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment".<ref>{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |author-link=Kevin Starr |title=Inventing the Dream: California Through the Progressive Era |url=https://archive.org/details/inventingdream00kevi |url-access=registration |year=1985 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503489-9 |oclc=11089240 |page=[https://archive.org/details/inventingdream00kevi/page/228 228]}}</ref> Otis's editorial policy was based on civic [[boosterism]], extolling the virtues of [[Los Angeles]] and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by [[California Water Wars|acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/los-angeles-times.html |title=A Paper Tears Apart in a City That Never Quite Came Together |last1=Arango |first1=Tim |date=2018-01-30 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-04-03 |last2=Nagourney |first2=Adam |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[File:Photo-los-angeles-times-building-post-bombing.jpg|thumb|right|Rubble of the ''L.A. Times'' building after the [[Los Angeles Times bombing|1910 bombing]]]]
The efforts of the ''Times'' to fight local unions led to the [[Los Angeles Times bombing|bombing of its headquarters]] on October 1, 1910, killing twenty-one people. Two union leaders, [[McNamara brothers|James and Joseph McNamara]], were charged. The [[American Federation of Labor]] hired noted trial attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.

Otis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new ''Times'' headquarters building designed by [[Gordon Kaufmann]], proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: "Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True".<ref>{{cite book |last=Berges |first=Marshall |title=The Life and Times of Los Angeles: A Newspaper, A Family and A City |publisher=Atheneum |location=New York |page=25}}</ref><ref name="answers.com">[http://www.answers.com/topic/clarence-darrow Clarence Darrow: Biography and Much More from Answers.com<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.answers.com</ref>

===Chandler era===
After Otis's death in 1917, his son-in-law, [[Harry Chandler]], took control as publisher of the ''Times''. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, [[Norman Chandler]], who ran the paper during the rapid growth of [[post-war]] Los Angeles. Norman's wife, [[Dorothy Buffum Chandler]], became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], whose main concert hall was named the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in her honor. Family members are buried at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] near [[Paramount Studios]]. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.

In 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the [[Times Mirror Square|Los Angeles Times Building]], to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as [[Times Mirror Square]] and would house the paper until 2018. [[Harry Chandler]], then the president and general manager of [[Times Mirror Co.|Times-Mirror Co.]], declared the Los Angeles Times Building a "monument to the progress of our city and Southern California".<ref name="dimassa">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-times27-2008jun27,0,3304303.story|title=Much has changed around the Los Angeles Times Building|last=DiMassa |first=Cara Mia |date=2008-06-26|access-date=2008-06-26|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

The fourth generation of family publishers, [[Otis Chandler]], held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the [[Northeastern United States]] due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Believing that the newsroom was "the heartbeat of the business",<ref name="mcdougal">{{cite book |last=McDougal |first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis McDougal |title=Privileged Son: Otis Chandler and the Rise and Fall of the L.A. Times Dynasty |year=2002 |publisher=Da Capo |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-306-81161-8 |oclc=49594139}}</ref> Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with ''The Washington Post'' to form the [[Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service]] to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.

During the 1960s, the paper won four [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, more than its previous nine decades combined.

Writing in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, ''Times'' reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:

<blockquote>The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the ''Los Angeles Times'' under the Chandler family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20130807,0,2277462.column |title=Washington Post Buy: Can Jeff Bezos Fix Newspapers' Business Model? |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=October 6, 2014 |first=Michael |last=Hiltzik |date=August 6, 2013}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, ''Thinking Big'' (1977, {{ISBN|0-399-11766-0}}), and was one of four organizations profiled by [[David Halberstam]] in ''[[The Powers That Be (book)|The Powers That Be]]'' (1979, {{ISBN|0-394-50381-3}}; 2000 reprint {{ISBN|0-252-06941-2}}). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.<ref>''ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts''.

===Modern era===
[[File:1984-Newspaper-Vending-Machine.jpg|thumb|''Times'' [[Newspaper vending machine]] featuring news of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]]]
The ''Los Angeles Times'' was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a [[bankruptcy]], a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies.

The newspaper moved to a new headquarters building in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Andrea |date=April 17, 2018 |title=L.A.

====Ownership====
In 2000, [[Times Mirror Company]], publisher of the ''Los Angeles Times'', was purchased by the [[Tribune Company]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]], placing the paper in co-ownership with the then WB-affiliated (now [[CW Television Network|CW]]-affiliated) [[KTLA]], which Tribune acquired in 1985.<ref name=Tribune>{{cite news |title=Tribune called on to sell L.A. Times |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/09/18/news/companies/latimes/index.htm |access-date=June 19, 2012 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=September 18, 2006}}</ref>

On April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur [[Sam Zell]]'s offer to buy the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',  the ''Los Angeles Times'', and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball club. He put up for sale the company's 25 percent interest in [[Comcast SportsNet]] Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires [[Ron Burkle]] and [[Eli Broad]] had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25&nbsp;million buyout fee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/324173,CST-NWS-Trib03.article |title=Tribune goes to Zell |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=April 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918204150/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/324173%2CCST-NWS-Trib03.article |archive-date=September 18, 2008}}</ref>

In December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9&nbsp;billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/09/business/fi-tribune9 |title=Owner of L.A.

On February 7, 2018, [[Tribune Publishing]] (formerly Tronc Inc.), agreed to sell the ''Los Angeles Times'' along with other southern California properties (''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', ''[[Hoy (American newspaper)|Hoy]]'') to billionaire biotech investor [[Patrick Soon-Shiong]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-los-angeles-times-sold-20180207-story.html |title=Billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong reaches deal to buy L.A.

====Editorial changes and staff reductions====
[[John Carroll (journalist)|John Carroll]], former editor of the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper. During his reign at the ''Times'', he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, [[Dean Baquet]], refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.

Baquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll's time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper except ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Pappu, Sridhar |title=Reckless Disregard: Dean Baquet on the gutting of the Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/03/reckless_disregard.html |work=Mother Jones |date=March–April 2007}}</ref> However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group—as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson—and was replaced by James O'Shea of the ''Chicago Tribune''. O'Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher [[David Hiller]].

The paper's content and design style were overhauled several times in attempts to increase circulation. In 2000, a major change reorganized the news sections (related news was put closer together) and changed the "Local" section to the "California" section with more extensive coverage. Another major change in 2005 saw the Sunday "Opinion" section retitled the Sunday "Current" section, with a radical change in its presentation and featured columnists. There were regular [[cross-promotion]]s with Tribune-owned television station KTLA to bring evening-news viewers into the ''Times'' fold.

The paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by [[Labor Day]] and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hiltzik |first=Michael A. |title=Los Angeles Times to cut 250 jobs, including 150 from news staff: The newspaper cites falling ad revenue in economic slowdown |url=https://latimes.com/business/printedition/la-fi-times3-2008jul03,0,1545512.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Politi |first=Daniel |title=Today's Papers: "You Have Been Liberated" |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2194811/ |work=Slate |date=July 3, 2008}}</ref> That included about 17 percent of the news staff, as part of the newly private media company's mandate to reduce costs. "We've tried to get ahead of all the change that's occurring in the business and get to an organization and size that will be sustainable", Hiller said.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121503420966124113|title=Los Angeles Times to Cut Staff|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Shiva Ovide|date=July 3, 2008|access-date=July 17, 2020}}</ref> In January 2009, the ''Times'' eliminated the separate California/Metro section, folding it into the front section of the newspaper.

The ''Times'' has suffered continued decline in distribution. Reasons offered for the circulation drop included a price increase<ref>Shah, Diane, "The New Los Angeles Times" ''Columbia Journalism Review'' 2002, 3.</ref> and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version.<ref>Rainey, James, "Newspaper Circulation Continues to Fall," ''Los Angeles Times'' May 1, 2007: D1.</ref> Editor Jim O'Shea, in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary, [[reduction in force]], characterized the decrease in circulation as an "industry-wide problem" which the paper had to counter by "growing rapidly on-line", "break[ing] news on the Web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper."<ref>{{cite news |author=E&P Staff |title=California Split: 57 More Job Cuts at 'L.A.

The ''Times'' closed its [[San Fernando Valley]] printing plant in early 2006, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. Also that year the paper announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The ''Times''{{'}}s loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lieberman, David |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-05-08-newspaper-circulation_x.htm |title=Newspaper sales dip, but websites gain |work=[[USA Today]] |date=May 9, 2006}}</ref> Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany. Still, others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher [[Otis Chandler]] relinquished day-to-day control in 1995.<ref name="mcdougal"/> Willes, the former president of [[General Mills]], was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as ''The Cereal Killer''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Shaw, David |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/20/news/ss-46240/26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024050929/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/20/news/ss-46240/26 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 24, 2015 |title=Crossing the Line |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref> [[File:AbandonedLosAngelesTimesVendingMachine2011.jpg|thumb|Abandoned ''Los Angeles Times'' vending machine in Covina, California, in 2011]]

====Other controversies====
It was revealed in 1999 that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the ''Times'' and [[Staples Center]] in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine's editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the [[Chinese wall]] that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.<ref>{{cite news |author=Elder, Sean |title=Meltdown at the L.A.

[[Michael Kinsley]] was hired as the Opinion and Editorial ([[op-ed]]) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, for he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a [[Wikitorial]], the first [[Wiki]] by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged with inappropriate material. He resigned later that year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Naughton |first=Philippe |date=June 21, 2005 |title=Foul language forces LA Times to pull plug on 'wikitorial' |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/foul-language-forces-la-times-to-pull-plug-on-wikitorial-gt3wpr3n5jq |work=[[The Times]] |access-date=October 12, 2020}}</ref>

The ''Times'' drew fire for a last-minute story before the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election]] alleging that [[gubernatorial]] candidate [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist [[Jill Stewart]] wrote on the ''American Reporter'' website that the ''Times'' did not do a story on allegations that former Governor [[Gray Davis]] had verbally and physically abused women in his office, and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the ''Times'' decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources.<ref>{{cite news |author=Stewart, Jill |date=October 14, 2003 |title=How the Los Angeles Times Really Decided to Publish its Accounts of Women Who Said They Were Groped |url=http://www.jillstewart.net/php/issues/issue1014.php |work=jillstewart.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201073120/http://www.jillstewart.net/php/issues/issue1014.php |archive-date=February 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Cohn, Gary |author2=Hall, Carla |author3=Welkos, Robert W. |date=October 2, 2003 |title=Women Say Schwarzenegger Groped, Humiliated Them |url=https://latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-women2oct02001424,1,7931228,print.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage |work=Los Angeles Times }}{{dead link|date=June 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1002-01.htm Alt URL]</ref> The [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] said that the ''Times'' lost more than 10,000 subscribers because of the negative publicity surrounding the Schwarzenegger article.<ref>{{cite news |title=ASNE recognizes Los Angeles Times editor for leadership |url=http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=5133 |work=ASNE.org |publisher=American Society of Newspaper Editors |date=March 24, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115004604/http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=5133 |archive-date=November 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The ''Times'' also came under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip ''[[Brevity (comic strip)|Brevity]]'', while retaining the Sunday edition.

In November 2017, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] blacklisted the ''Times'' from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on [[Disney]]'s political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be "biased and inaccurate". As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including ''The New York Times'',  ''[[Boston Globe]]'' critic [[Ty Burr]], ''[[Washington Post]]'' blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' and ''[[Flavorwire]]'', announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The [[National Society of Film Critics]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], [[New York Film Critics Circle]], and [[Boston Society of Film Critics]] jointly announced that Disney's films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being "antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists". On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company "had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the ''Los Angeles Times'' regarding our specific concerns".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/07/disney-los-angeles-times-media-boycott |title=Disney's blackout of LA Times triggers boycott from media outlets |last=Carroll |first=Rory |date=2017-11-07 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-11-07 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/11/06/why-i-wont-be-reviewing-the-last-jedi-or-any-other-disney-movie-in-advance/ |title=Why I won't be reviewing 'The Last Jedi,' or any other Disney movie, in advance |work=The Washington Post |access-date=2017-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/07/disney-los-angeles-times-media-boycott |title=Disney ends blackout of LA Times after boycott from media outlets |last=Carroll |first=Rory |date=2017-11-07 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-11-07 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==Competition and rivalry==
In the 19th century, the chief competition to the ''Times'' was the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Herald]],'' followed by the smaller ''[[Los Angeles Tribune (1886–1890)|Los Angeles Tribune]].'' In December 1903, newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] began publishing the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' as a direct morning competitor to the ''Times.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulwaf.com/LA-1900s/03.12.html |title=December 1903: Hearst's Examiner comes to L.A |publisher=Ulwaf.com |access-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref> In the 20th century, the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Express]]'' was an afternoon competitor, as was [[Manchester Boddy]]'s '' [[Los Angeles Daily News (historic)|Los Angeles Daily News]]'', a Democratic newspaper.<ref name=RedInk>[https://openlibrary.org/b/OL11566287M/Red_Ink_White_Lies Red Ink, White Lies: The Rise and Fall of Los Angeles Newspapers, 1920–1962] by Rob Leicester Wagner, Dragonflyer Press, 2000.</ref>

By the mid-1940s, the ''Times'' was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. In 1948, it launched the ''Los Angeles Mirror'', an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the ''Daily News'' and the merged ''Herald-Express''. In 1954, the ''Mirror'' absorbed the ''Daily News''. The combined paper, the ''Mirror-News'', ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner|Herald-Express]]'' and the morning ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' merged to become the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner]]''.<ref name="Pitt">Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt, ''Los Angeles: A to Z,'' University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-20274-0}}.</ref> The ''Herald-Examiner'' published its last number in 1989.

At first, it was called the "Trade Number," and in 1886 it featured a special press run of "extra scope and proportions"; that is, "a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed."<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/163431815 "Our Annual Trade Number," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 18, 1886, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Two years later, the edition had grown to "forty-eight handsome pages (9x15 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation," was "equivalent to a 150-page book."<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/163487649 "Our Annual Edition," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 21, 1888, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> The last use of the phrase ''Trade Number'' was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/163679906 "General Contents," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 1, 1895] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

The Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' in 1923:

{{quote|It is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages – the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition, it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/161410760 Quoted in "Highest Praise Given to 'Times,'" ''Los Angeles Times'', January 28, 1923, page II-12] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>}}

In 1948 the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to "7 big picture magazines in beautiful [[rotogravure]] reproduction."<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/165823792 Display advertisement, ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 13, 1947] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a ''Times'' advertisement on January 10, 1954.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/166561544 "Bigger and Better Than Ever," page F-10] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

====Midsummer====
Between 1891 and 1895, the ''Times'' also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one with the theme "The Land and Its Fruits".<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/163529010 "'The Land and Its Fruits' — Our Harvest Number," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 5, 1891, page 6] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/163522458 "Ready Tomorrow," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 4, 1891, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

===Zoned editions and subsidiaries===

In 1903, the Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]]. In the summer of that year, the ''Times'' made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, called ''The Wireless'', which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/p2independen55newy#page/2436/mode/1up "The Wireless Daily Achieved"] by C. E. Howell, ''The Independent'', October 15, 1903, pages 2436-2440.</ref> However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.<ref>[http://www.islapedia.com/index.php?title=Wireless_Newspaper,_Avalon,_Santa_Catalina_Island "Wireless Newspaper, Avalon, Santa Catalina Island"] (islapedia.com)</ref>

In the 1990s, the ''Times'' published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], [[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] & a "National Edition" that was distributed to [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The National Edition was closed in December 2004.

Some of these editions{{howmany|date=September 2017}} were succeeded by ''Our Times'', a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular Los Angeles Metro newspaper.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the ''[[Daily Pilot]]'' of [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] and [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://latimes.com/services/newspaper/mediacenter/la-mediacenter-factsheet-tcn2,0,1436442.story |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826154450/http://www.latimes.com/services/newspaper/mediacenter/la-mediacenter-factsheet-tcn2,0,1436442.story |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 26, 2009 |title=''Los Angeles Times'' website |date=April 17, 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://latimes.com/la-mediagroup-2011-0112-htmlstory.html |title=Los Angeles Times Community Newspapers Add New Title, Increase Coverage and Circulation with Sunday News-Press & Leader |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 12, 2011 |quote=''Los Angeles Times Community Newspapers'' (TCN) include the ''Huntington Beach Independent'', ''Daily Pilot'' (Costa Mesa, Newport and Irvine) and ''Laguna Beach Coastline Pilot''.

On April 30, 2020, Charlie Plowman, publisher of Outlook Newspapers, announced he would acquire the ''Glendale News-Press'',
''Burbank Leader'' and ''La Cañada Valley Sun'' from Times Community Newspapers. Plowman acquired the ''South Pasadena Review'' and ''San Marino Tribune''
in late January 2020 from the Salter family, who owned and operated these two community weeklies.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Features==

One of the ''Times''{{'}} features was "Column One", a feature that appeared daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it was a place for the weird and the interesting; in the ''How Far Can a Piano Fly?'' (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, [[Patt Morrison]] wrote that the column's purpose was to elicit a "Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that" type of reaction.

The ''Times'' also embarked on a number of [[investigative journalism]] pieces. A series in December 2004 on the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Care Center|King/Drew Medical Center]] in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]], which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, ''[[The Soloist]].'' It also won 62 awards at the SND{{clarify|date=September 2020}} awards.

From 1967 to 1972, the ''Times'' produced a Sunday [[Supplement (publishing)|supplement]] called ''[[Los Angeles Times Magazine|West]]'' magazine. ''West'' was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later became art director of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine).<ref name=Heller>Heller, Steven. [https://designobserver.com/feature/go-west-young-art-director/7357 "Go West, Young Art Director,"] ''Design Observer'' (Sept. 23, 2008).</ref> From 2000 to 2012, the ''Times'' published the ''[[Los Angeles Times Magazine]]'', which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in [[Los Angeles]] and its surrounding cities and communities. Since 2014, ''[[The California Sunday Magazine]]'' has been included in the Sunday ''L.A. Times'' edition.

===Festival of Books===
[[File:Fest of Books 2009.jpg|thumb|2009 [[Los Angeles Times Festival of Books]] on the [[UCLA]] campus]]
In 1996, the ''Times'' started the annual [[Los Angeles Times Festival of Books]], in association with the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. It has panel discussions, exhibits, and stages during two days at the end of April each year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://latimes.com/extras/festivalofbooks/index.html |title=Los Angeles Times Festival of Books |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> In 2011, the Festival of Books was moved to the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Rebecca Buddingh |work=Daily Trojan |url=http://dailytrojan.com/2010/09/26/l-a-times-fair-comes-to-usc/ |title=L.A.

Since 1980, the ''Times'' has awarded annual book prizes. The categories are now biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction, history, mystery/thriller, poetry, science and technology, and young adult fiction. In addition, the [[Robert Kirsch Award]] is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://latimes.com/extras/bookprizes/index.html |title=Los Angeles Times Book Prizes home page |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Los Angeles Times Grand Prix===
From 1957 to 1987, the ''Times'' sponsored the [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix]] that was held over at the [[Riverside International Raceway]] in [[Moreno Valley, California]].

==Other media==
===Book publishing ===
The Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years, including [[New American Library]] and [[C.V. Mosby]], as well as [[Harry N. Abrams]], [[Matthew Bender]], and [[Jeppesen]].<ref name=NAL />

In 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher [[New American Library]], known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Korda |first1=Michael |title=Another life: a memoir of other people |url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord |url-access=registration |date=1999 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0679456597 |page=[https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/103 103] |edition=1st}}</ref> The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and within the Mirror Company.

In 1967, Times Mirror acquired [[C.V. Mosby Company]], a professional publisher and merged it over the years with several other professional publishers including Resource Application, Inc., Year Book Medical Publishers, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., PSG Publishing Company, B.C. Decker, Inc., among others. Eventually in 1998 Mosby was sold to Harcourt Brace & Company to form the Elsevier Health Sciences group.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mosby Company History |url=http://www1.us.elsevierhealth.com/HHS/Help/historyMosby.html |publisher=Elsevier |access-date=October 3, 2015}}</ref>

The Times-Mirror Company was a founding owner of television station [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]], which opened in January 1949. It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to [[CBS]] in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, [[Nassour Studios]], in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as [[Metromedia Square]], the studio was sold along with KTTV to [[Metromedia]] in 1963.

After a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated '''Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company''' with its 1970 purchase of the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' and its radio and television stations, [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD-AM]]-[[KZPS|FM]]-TV in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Storch |first=Charles |title=Times Mirror Selling Dallas Times Herald |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-06-27/business/8602150886_1_john-buzzetta-gloucester-county-times-dallas-times-herald |access-date=June 26, 2012 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=June 27, 1986}}</ref> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted an exemption of its [[Concentration of media ownership|cross-ownership]] policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed [[KDFW-TV]].

Times-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired [[KTBC-TV]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1973;<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/6Z9oj5TPV?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive%2DBC%2DIDX/72%2DOCR/1972%2D09%2D04%2DBC%2DOCR%2DPage%2D0006.pdf "Johnson family sells Austin TV."] ''[[Broadcasting and Cable|Broadcasting]]'', September 4, 1972, pg. 6.</ref> and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by [[Advance Publications|Newhouse Newspapers]]: WAPI-TV (now [[WVTM-TV]]) in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; [[KTVI]] in [[St. Louis]]; WSYR-TV (now [[WSTM-TV]]) in [[Syracuse, New York]] and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now [[WETM-TV]]) in [[Elmira, New York]]; and WTPA-TV (now [[WHTM-TV]]) in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/6Z9oj5zuX?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive%2DBC%2DIDX/80%2DOCR/1980%2D03%2D31%2DBC%2DOCR%2DPage%2D0030.pdf "Times Mirror's deal for Newhouse's TVs gets FCC approval."] ''Broadcasting'', March 31, 1980, pg. 30.</ref>  The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] areas, amongst others. They were originally titled '''Times-Mirror Cable''', and were later renamed to '''Dimension Cable Television'''. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] movie network; it wasn't successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to [[Cox Communications]].

Times-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/6Z9oj83AU?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive%2DBC%2DIDX/85%2DOCR/BC%2D1985%2D09%2D30%2DOCR%2DPage%2D0109.pdf "Changing hands: Proposed."] ''Broadcasting'', September 30, 1985, pg. 109.</ref> The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/93-OCR/BC-1993-03-22-OCR-Page-0007.pdf "Times Mirror set to sell four TV'."] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z9oj6aQs?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/93-OCR/BC-1993-03-22-OCR-Page-0007.pdf |date=June 9, 2015}} ''Broadcasting and Cable'', March 22, 1993, pg. 7.</ref> These stations were acquired by [[New World Communications]] shortly thereafter and became key components in [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994 and 1995]].
