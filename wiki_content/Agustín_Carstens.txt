Carstens took up his appointment as the [[general manager]] at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], where he was appointed to a five-year term, starting on 1 December 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bank of Mexico’s Agustín Carstens Leaving to Lead Bank for International Settlements| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-mexico-gov-agustin-carstens-leaving-to-take-top-bis-post-1480609947|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=1 December 2016|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Agustín Carstens renuncia al Banco de México| url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/cartera/economia/2016/12/1/agustin-carstens-renuncia-al-banco-de-mexico|newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=1 December 2016|accessdate=2 December 2016|language=spanish}}</ref>

==Early years==

Carstens graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the [[Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology]] (ITAM). After working as an intern in the [[Bank of Mexico]] he received a scholarship and completed both a master's degree (1983) and a doctorate in economics (1985) at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="financiero">{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=24999&docTipo=1&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC|title=Entrevista a Agustín Carstens|last=Cárdenas Estandía|first=Rogelio|date=17 October 2006|publisher=El Financiero|language=Spanish|accessdate=2 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001806/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=24999&docTipo=1&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> His thesis advisor was [[Michael Mussa]], former economic counselor and director of the Department of Research at the International Monetary Fund from 1991 to 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/staffp/2005/03/carstens.htm |title=IMF Conference in Honor of Michael Mussa: MussaFest – Opening Remarks |first= Agustín |last= Carstens |authorlink=Agustín Carstens |date=September 2005 |work= IMF Staff Papers |publisher= International Monetary Fund |pages=1–5 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202093917/http://imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/staffp/2005/03/carstens.htm |archivedate= 2 February 2009 |accessdate= 10 June 2011 |quote= I took several courses with Mike, and he was generous enough to direct my thesis dissertation in the mid-1980s. |ref= Carstens_2005 }}</ref>

He is married to Catherine Mansell, an American academic, writer and economist who has authored several books on finance and on literary fiction and nonfiction under the pen name [[C. M. Mayo]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Catherine Mansell, el apoyo de Carstens |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/381653.html |language=Spanish |newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref>

In the mid-1980s Carstens returned to Mexico and rejoined the Bank of Mexico. Before turning thirty he was appointed treasurer, effectively taking charge of the national reserves. Rising through the ranks in the early 1990s, he was appointed chief of staff of chairman [[Miguel Mancera]], and served as Director General of Economic Research at the end of the 1990s, in charge of designing the Bank's economic policy with Governor [[Guillermo Ortiz Martínez]] in the aftermath of the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|Tequila Crisis]] and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian default crisis]]. While at the bank he produced several research articles on the Mexican economy and, in particular, co-authored an analysis of the Mexican Crisis along with then Deputy Governor [[Francisco Gil Díaz]], which suggests the Mexican crisis was to a large extent an avoidable run on the [[Mexican peso]] brought about by external circumstances and political problems.<ref name=paper>{{cite web|last=Carstens|first=Agustín|title=Some Hypotheses RelatedTo The Mexican 1994–95 Crisis|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-discursos/publicaciones/documentos-de-investigacion/banxico/%7B45B84863-EC5A-96E1-85D8-B61DC6476A82%7D.PDF|publisher=Bank of Mexico|accessdate=5 March 2012|author2=Gil Díaz, Francisco}}</ref>

After many years at the Bank of Mexico, Carstens took a position at the IMF and served as the deputy managing director – one of three deputies reporting to the director and the board— from 1 August 2003 to 16 October 2006.<ref name="imf-bio"/>

Carstens left the IMF to coordinate the economic policy program of [[Felipe Calderón]], then [[president-elect]] of Mexico, who appointed him as secretary of finance shortly after the election was validated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mexico's Calderon names Carstens finance minister |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2006-11-21T142202Z_01_N21329161_RTRIDST_0_MEXICO-CALDERON-CABINET-URGENT.XML |work=Reuters |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=21 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102233658/http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=bondsNews |archivedate=2 January 2007 }}</ref>

==Secretary of Finance==
On 26 March 2007, Carstens was additionally appointed as new chairman of the joint [[World Bank]]/IMF Development Committee, a position customarily occupied by a developing country finance minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/X0EOQ8JPV0| title=Mexico’s Minister of Finance Agustin Carstens Becomes Development Committee chairman|publisher=World Bank |date=27 March 2007|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>

As secretary, Carstens took the unconventional decision to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] Mexico's oil earnings for 2009 against possible price falls, leading to an $8 billion profit for the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ccd87f9e-9bd9-11de-b214-00144feabdc0.html| title=Mexico to enjoy $8bn windfall from oil bet|first=Javier| last=Blas|newspaper=Financial Times|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the 2007 popular protests against rising [[food prices]], Carstens regarded high food prices as a positive driver for investment in agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2008/07/08MEXICO2184.html |title=Cable Viewer |publisher=Wikileaks.org |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>

==Bank of Mexico==

Carstens was nominated to the [[Bank of Mexico]] on 9 December 2009 by President [[Felipe Calderón]],<ref name="nomination_Banxico">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aGAA7ahBlANk|title=Calderon Nominates Carstens for Mexico Central Bank|last=Gould|first=Jens|author2=Martínez, Andrés|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 December 2009}}</ref> replacing 12-year veteran [[Guillermo Ortiz Martínez|Guillermo Ortiz]], who reduced inflation from double digits to 4 percent by the end of 2009.<ref name="nomination_NYTimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/business/global/10peso.html|title=New Chief Nominated for Mexico’s Central Bank|last=Malkin|first=Elisabeth|date=9 December 2009|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=9 December 2009}}</ref> He was confirmed by the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate]] on 15 December 2009 with 81 votes in favor and 19 votes against.<ref name="confirmation_Banxico" />

==Economic views==

He identifies five characteristics of [[business cycles]] in [[emerging economies]] that distinguish them from those in [[industrialized]] nations:<ref name="fuhrer-2002-p21">{{cite book|author1=Fuhrer, Jeffrey C. |author2=Schuh, Scott|chapter=Beyond Shocks; What causes business cycles?; An Overview|editor1=Rabin, Jack |editor2=Stevens, Glenn L.|title=Handbook of monetary policy|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8247-0578-7|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6QfSWmB4KAC&pg=PA21}}</ref>
# Business cycles in emerging economies are strongly tied to those in industrialized nations.
# Cycles in emerging economies are more [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]]
# Volatility of emerging economies can be affected by additional factors that don't affect industrialized economies, such as price fluctuations
# Rapid capital outflows made possible under corporate [[globalization]] can have severely harmful effects on emerging economies
# Emerging economies are subject to the problems associated with [[exchange-rate]] regimes

Carstens claims that the solution to these problems is for emerging nations to:<ref name="fuhrer-2002-p21" />
# Adopt more [[free trade|open trade and investment regimes]]
# Allow [[financial markets|market]] control of [[interest rates]]
# Ensure that their banks are robust enough to handle severe [[macroeconomic]] changes
# Enact [[structural adjustment|structural changes]] such as [[central bank]] autonomy, [[privatization]] of production, reduced regulations over [[labor markets]] and reduced dependence on foreign savings
