==Building==
The Blavatnik School of Government is located in the University of Oxford's [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with its main entrance on [[Walton Street, Oxford|Walton Street]].<ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/roq/ Radcliffe Observatory Quarter], University of Oxford, 27 May 2010; Retrieved 20 February 2011.</ref> The building is designed by architects [[Herzog & de Meuron]] to promote open discussion, interaction and collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blavatnik School of Government new building|url=http://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about/new-building|publisher=Blavatnik School of Government|access-date=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328064658/http://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about/new-building|archive-date=28 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The central forum is inspired by the idea of openness and transparency and connects all the floors together.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Herzog & de Meuron |url = https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/376-400/387-blavatnik-school-of-government.html|website = herzogdemeuron.com | access-date = 2015-12-22}}</ref> Construction work started in autumn 2013, after some controversy,<ref name="oxford-mail">{{cite news| first=Freddie | last=Whittaker | url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10407466.Controversial_Blavatnik_building_gets_planning_consent/ | title=Controversial Blavatnik School of Government building gets planning consent | newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] | date=2013 | access-date=29 December 2015 }}</ref> and ended in late 2015. The building is controlled by a combination of systems and technology that helps minimise its environmental impact.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Pioneering green technology set for new £75m uni building | url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/13899479.Pioneering_green_technology_set_for_new___75m_uni_building/ | newspaper=Oxford Mail | access-date=2015-12-22 }}</ref>

The building is taller than [[Carfax Tower]] in the centre of Oxford, thus dominating the site<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/herzog-de-meuron-blavatnik-school-of-government-oxford/ | title=Herzog & de Meuron: Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford | website=designboom.com | access-date=29 December 2015 }}</ref> and causing opposition to the scheme by local residents in the [[Jericho, Oxford|Jericho]] district of the city and elsewhere.<ref name="oxford-mail" /><ref>{{cite news| title=University is facing battle over £30 Jericho plan | first=Reg |last=Little | newspaper=[[The Oxford Times]] |pages=1, 3 | date=28 February 2013 }}</ref> The site is immediately to the south of the café/bar [[Freud, Oxford|Freud]], in the historic 1836 [[Greek revival]] St Paul's Church on Walton Street.<ref name="little13">{{cite news|title=Shadow over cafe culture | first=Reg | last=Little |newspaper=[[The Oxford Times]] |page=29 | date=7 March 2013 }}</ref> The scheme was opposed by the cafe's owner, David Freud, due to its size compared to the church building. The site is also opposite the classical [[Oxford University Press]] building. In spring 2013, a public meeting was held in [[St Barnabas Church, Oxford|St Barnabas Church]] and the building was described as "a concrete [[marshmallow]]".<ref>{{cite news| title='A concrete marshmallow': Damian Fantato reports from a public meeting on controversial proposals for Jericho | first=Damian | last=Fantato  | newspaper=The Oxford Times | page=10 | date=4 April 2013 }}</ref> A historic wall on [[Walton Street, Oxford|Walton Street]] would be demolished as part of the plans.<ref name="little13" />

Later in 2015, the building was described as "the latest striking building nearing completion in Oxford".<ref>{{cite news| title=Glass goes in at the Blavatnik | url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/13407131.Glass_goes_in_at_the_Blavatnik/ | newspaper=Oxford Mail | date=11 July 2015 }}</ref>
