The '''American Psychological Association''' ('''APA''') is the largest scientific and professional organization of [[psychologist]]s in the United States,<ref name="About">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/ |title=About APA |publisher=APA.org |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref> with over 122,000 members, including scientists, educators, clinicians, consultants, and students.<ref name="About"/> It has 54 divisions—interest groups for different subspecialties of [[psychology]] or topical areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Divisions of the APA |url=http://www.apa.org/about/division/ |publisher=APA.org |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref> The APA has an annual budget of around $115m.<ref name="Reports">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/ |title=APA Reports |publisher=APA.org |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>

==Profile==
The APA has task forces that issue policy statements on various matters of social importance, including [[abortion]], [[human rights]], the welfare of detainees, [[human trafficking]], the rights of the [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]], [[IQ]] testing, [[sexual orientation change efforts]], and gender equality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/ |title=Council Policy Manual |access-date=December 14, 2012 |publisher=APA.org}}</ref>

===Governance===
APA is a corporation chartered in the District of Columbia. APA's bylaws describe structural components that serve as a system of checks and balances to ensure democratic process. The organizational entities include:
* APA President. The APA's president is elected by the membership. The president chairs the Council of Representatives and the Board of Directors. During his or her term of office, the president performs such duties as are prescribed in the bylaws.
* Board of Directors. The board is composed of six members-at-large, the president-elect, president, past-president, treasurer, recording secretary, CEO, and the chair of the [[American Psychological Association of Graduate Students]] (APAGS). The board oversees the association's administrative affairs and presents an annual budget for council approval.
* APA Council of Representatives. The council has sole authority to set policy and make decisions regarding APA's roughly $60 million annual income. It is composed of elected members from state/provincial/territorial psychological associations, APA divisions and the APA Board of Directors.
* APA Committee Structure: Boards and Committees. Members of boards and committees conduct much of APA's work on a volunteer basis. They carry out a wide variety of tasks suggested by their names. Some have responsibility for monitoring major programs, such as the directorates, the journals and international affairs.<ref name="APA Gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/index.aspx|title=APA Governance |publisher=APA.org |access-date=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

===Good Governance Project===
The Good Governance Project (GGP) was initiated in January 2011 as part of the strategic plan to "[assure] APA's governance practices, processes and structures are optimized and aligned with what is needed to thrive in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex environment."<ref name="APA GGP">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/good-governance/ |date=July 2, 2013 |title=Good Governance Project |publisher=APA.org |access-date=July 20, 2013}}</ref> The charge included soliciting feedback and input stakeholders, learning about governance best practices, recommending whether change was required, recommending needed changes based on data, and creating implementation plans.<ref name="APA GGP" /> The June 2013 GGP update on the recommended changes can be found in the document "Good Governance Project Recommended Changes to Maximize Organizational Effectiveness of APA Governance".<ref name="GGP July 2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/good-governance/final-report.pdf |title=Good Governance Project Recommended Changes to Maximize Organizational Effectiveness of APA Governance |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=June 28, 2013 |access-date=July 20, 2013}}</ref> The suggested changes would change APA from a membership-based, representational structure to a corporate structure. These motions were discussed and voted upon by council on July 31, 2013, and August 2, 2013.<ref name="GGP July 2013" />

===Organizational structure===
APA comprises an executive office, a publishing operation, offices that address administrative, business, information technology, and operational needs, and five substantive directorates:
*the Education Directorate accredits doctoral psychology programs and addresses issues related to psychology education in secondary through graduate education;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/ed/ |title=Education Directorate of the American Psychological Association |publisher=APA.org |access-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>
*the Practice Directorate engages on behalf of practicing psychologists and health care consumers;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/practice/ |title=APA Practice Directorate |publisher=APA.org |access-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>
*the Public Interest Directorate advances psychology as a means of addressing the fundamental problems of human welfare and promoting the equitable and just treatment of all segments of society;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ |title=Public Interest Directorate |publisher=APA.org |access-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>
*the Public and Member Communications Directorate is responsible for APA's outreach to its members and affiliates and to the general public;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/offices/directorates/communications.aspx |title=Public and Member Communications |publisher=APA.org |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref>
*the Science Directorate provides support and voice for psychological scientists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/science/ |title=Science Directorate |publisher=APA.org |access-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>

===Membership and title of "psychologist"===
{{Main|Psychologist#United States and Canada}}
APA policy on the use of the title [[psychologist]] is contained in the Model Act for State Licensure of Psychologists:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apapracticecentral.org/ce/state/model-act.aspx |title=Model Act for State Licensure of Psychologists |publisher=APA.org |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref> psychologists have earned a doctoral degree in psychology and may not use the title "psychologist" and/or deliver psychological services to the public, unless the psychologist is licensed or specifically exempted from licensure under the law. State licensing laws specify state specific requirements for the education and training of psychologists leading to licensure. Psychologists who are exempted from licensure could include researchers, educators, or general applied psychologists who provide services outside the health and mental health field.

Full membership with the APA in United States and Canada requires doctoral training whereas associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or approved related discipline. The minimal requirement of a doctoral dissertation related to psychology for full membership can be waived in certain circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/division/officers/handbook/ |title=Division Officers Handbook |publisher=APA.org |access-date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>

===Affiliate organizations===
American Psychological Association Services, Inc. (APASI) was formed in 2018 and is a [[501(c)(6)]] entity, which engages in advocacy on behalf of psychologists from all areas of psychology.

===APA style===
{{Main|APA style}}
'''American Psychological Association''' ('''APA''') '''style''' is a set of rules developed to assist reading comprehension in the social and behavioral sciences. Used to ensure clarity of communication, the layout is designed to "move the idea forward with a minimum of distraction and a maximum of precision."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apastyle.org/about-apa-style.aspx |title=APA Style |publisher=APAstyle.org |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> The ''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'' contains the rules for every aspect of writing, especially in the [[social sciences]] from determining authorship to constructing a [[Table (information)|table]] to avoiding [[plagiarism]] and constructing accurate reference citations. "The General Format of APA is most commonly used to cite sources within the social sciences. General guidelines for a paper in APA style includes: typed, double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5" x 11") with 1" margins on all sides. The font should be clear and highly readable. APA recommends using 12 pt. [[Times New Roman]] font."<ref>{{cite web |title=APA Formatting and Style Guide |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/ |work=[[Purdue OWL]] |access-date=February 9, 2012}}</ref> The seventh edition of the ''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'' was published in October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/publication-manual-7th-edition-paperback|title=Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Seventh Edition}}</ref>

===Databases===
APA maintains a number of databases, including [[PsycINFO]], PsycARTICLES, PsycBOOKS, PsycEXTRA, [[PsycCRITIQUES]], PsycTESTS, and PsycTHERAPY.<ref>{{cite web |title=APA Databases & Electronic Resources |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/ |publisher=APA.org |access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=American Psychological Association (APA) - Information for CAUL |url=http://www.caul.edu.au/caul-programs/ceirc/publishers/apa |publisher=[[Council of Australian University Librarians]] |access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref> APA also operates a comprehensive search platform, PsycNET, covering multiple databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usfca.edu/library/psycnet |title=PsycNET |publisher=[[University of San Francisco]]: Gleeson Library |access-date=August 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905232516/https://www.usfca.edu/library/psycnet |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==

===Founding===
The APA was founded in July 1892 at [[Clark University]] by a small group of around 30 men; by 1916 there were over 300 members.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004369830|title=125 years of the American Psychological Association|others=Pickren, Wade E.,, Rutherford, Alexandra, 1971-|year=2018|isbn=978-1-4338-2790-7|edition=First|location=Washington, DC|oclc=1004369830}}</ref> The first president was [[G. Stanley Hall]]. During World War II, the APA merged with other psychological organizations, resulting in a new divisional structure. Nineteen divisions were approved in 1944; the divisions with the most members were the clinical and personnel (now counseling) divisions. From 1960 to 2007, the number of divisions expanded to 54.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/apa/archives/apa-history.aspx |publisher=APA.org |title=APA History and Archives |access-date=September 24, 2014}}</ref> Today the APA is affiliated with 60 state, territorial, and Canadian provincial associations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/apa/organizations/associations.aspx |publisher=APA.org |title=State and Provincial Psychological Associations |access-date=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Dominance of clinical psychology===
Due to the dominance of [[clinical psychology]] in APA, several research-focused groups have broken away from the organization. These include the [[Psychonomic Society]] in 1959 (with a primarily cognitive orientation), and the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (which changed its name from the American Psychological Society in early 2006) in 1988 (with a broad focus on the science and research of psychology). [[Theodore H. Blau]] was the first clinician in independent practice to be elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1977.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 1, 2003 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/01/Hillsborough/Noted_psychologist_Th.shtml |title= Noted psychologist Theodore Blau |work=St. Petersburg Times |access-date=September 14, 2007}}</ref>

== Positions on homosexuality ==

===Cause of homosexuality===
{{Further|Biology and sexual orientation|Environment and sexual orientation|Homosexuality and psychology}}
The APA states the following:{{quote|There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx|title=Answers to your questions for a better understanding of sexual orientation and homosexuality|publisher=APA.org|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>}}

The APA adopted a resolution in August 2009 stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments. The approval, by APA's governing Council of Representatives, came at APA's annual convention, during which a task force presented a report<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf |title=Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation |first1=Judith M. |last1=Glassgold |first2=Lee |last2=Beckstead |first3=Jack |last3=Drescher |author-link3=Jack Drescher |first4=Beverly |last4=Greene |first5=Robin Lin |last5=Miller |first6=Roger L. |last6=Worthington |first7=Clinton W. |last7=Anderson |publisher=APA.org |date=September 28, 2009 |access-date=October 13, 2012}}</ref> that in part examined the efficacy of so-called "[[reparative therapy]]", or sexual orientation change efforts.

The "Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts" also advises that parents, guardians, young people, and their families avoid sexual orientation treatments that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or [[developmental disorder]] and instead seek [[psychotherapy]], [[social support]], and educational services "that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx|title=Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts|publisher=APA.org|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== Same-sex marriage ===
{{Further|Same-sex marriage}}
The APA adopted a resolution stating that it is unfair and [[Discrimination|discriminatory]] to deny same-sex couples legal access to [[civil marriage]] and to all its attendant rights, benefits, and privileges. It also filed an [[amicus brief]] in [[Hollingsworth v. Perry|the federal court case]] in which Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] struck down [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California's constitutional ban]] on same-sex marriage.<ref name="amici">{{cite web |url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf |title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees - Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R. Walker) |access-date=November 5, 2010}}</ref> The APA later praised the decision and denied the existence of any "scientific justification" for a ban on same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/08/prop-8-decision.aspx |title=APA Praises Prop 8 Decision as Victory for Science, Human Dignity |publisher=APA.org |date=August 4, 2010 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>

In August 2011, the APA clarified their support of same-sex marriage in light of continued research suggesting that the same community benefits accepted as result of heterosexual marriage apply to same-sex couples as well. Dr. Clinton Anderson, associate executive director of the APA and director of the Office on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns, said that, prior to this research, "We knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in very significant ways, but we didn't know if that would be true for same-sex couples". Anderson also put forward the APA's view that merely allowing same-sex civil unions is an inadequate option: "Anything other than marriage is, in essence, a stigmatization of same-sex couples. Stigma does have negative impacts on people."<ref>{{cite web |author=Alden Mahler Levine, CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/08/04/psychologists.gay.marriage/ |title=Psychological association calls for legalization of same-sex marriage |publisher=CNN.com |access-date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>

==APA internship crisis for graduate students==
The APA is the main accrediting body for U.S. clinical and counseling psychology doctoral training programs and internship sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/about/about-accreditation.aspx |title=About Accreditation |publisher=APA.org |access-date=October 14, 2012}}</ref> APA-accredited Clinical Psychology PhD and PsyD programs typically require students to complete a one-year clinical internship in order to graduate (or a two-year part-time internship). However, there is currently an "internship crisis" as defined by the American Psychological Association, in that approximately 25% of clinical psychology doctoral students do not match for internship each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/apags/resources/internships.aspx |title=Doctoral Internships in Professional Psychology |publisher=APA.org |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appic.org/Match/MatchStatistics/MatchStatistics2011PhaseI.aspx|title=2011 APPIC Match Statistics - Phase I|date=February 25, 2011|website=APPIC: Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers|publisher=Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers|access-date=July 16, 2013}}</ref> This crisis has led many students (approximately 1,000 each year) to re-apply for internship, thus delaying graduation, or to complete an unaccredited internship, and often has many emotional and financial consequences.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/04/pc.aspx |last=Vasquez |first=Melba |title=The internship crisis: strategies and solutions |journal=Monitor on Psychology |date=April 2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |page=5}}</ref> Students who do not complete an APA accredited internships in the U.S. are barred from certain employment settings, including VA hospitals, the military, and cannot get licensed in some states, such as Utah and Mississippi.<ref name="appic1">{{cite web |url=http://www.appic.org/Match/FAQs/Applicants/Eligibility-and-Participation#q3 |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Internship Applicants - Match Eligibility & Participation |publisher=Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers |access-date=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2004/04/accreditation.aspx |last=Smith Bailey |first=Deborah |title=Why accreditation matters: Accreditation guidelines set the standard for your education—and can ease your way to licensure |journal=GradPSYCH Magazine |date=April 2004}}</ref> Additionally, some post-doctoral fellowships and other employment settings require or prefer an APA accredited internship.<ref name="appic1"/> The APA has been criticized for not addressing this crisis adequately and many psychologists and graduate students have petitioned for the APA to take action by regulating graduate training programs.

== Warfare and the use of torture ==
A year after the establishment of the [[Human Resources Research Organization]] by the U.S. military in 1951, the [[CIA]] began funding numerous psychologists (and other scientists) in the development of [[psychological warfare]] methods under the supervision of APA treasurer [[Meredith Crawford]]. [[Donald O. Hebb]], the APA president in 1960 who was awarded the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961, defended the [[torture]] of research subjects, arguing that what was being studied was other nations' methods of [[brainwashing]]. Former APA president [[Martin Seligman]] spoke upon the invitation of the CIA on his [[animal experimentation]] where he shocked a dog unpredictably and repeatedly into total, [[Learned helplessness|helpless]] passivity. Former APA president [[Ronald F. Levant]], upon visiting [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], affirmed that psychologists were present during the torture of prisoners, arguing that their presence was to "add value and safeguards" to interrogations.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chalquist |first=Craig |title=Why I Am Not a Member of the American Psychological Association |url=http://www.chalquist.com/apa.html |access-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref> Former APA president [[Gerald Koocher]] argued, referring to allegations of continuing systemic abuse by psychologists, that such allegations were originating from "opportunistic commentators masquerading as scholars".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koocher |first1=Gerald |author-link=Gerald Koocher |title=Speaking against torture |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb06/pc.aspx |journal=Monitor on Psychology |date=February 2006 |volume=37 |issue=2 |page=5}}</ref>

When it emerged that psychologists, as part of the [[Behavioral Science Consultation Team]], were advising interrogators in Guantánamo and other U.S. facilities on improving the effectiveness of the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]", the APA called on the U.S. government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques and labeled specific techniques as torture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/councilres0807.html |title=American Psychological Association calls on U.S. government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques |publisher=APA.org |date=August 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513130900/http://www.apa.org/releases/councilres0807.html |archive-date=May 13, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Critics pointed out that the APA declined to advise its members not to participate in such interrogations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93740405 |title=Psychologists and Guantanamo |publisher=NPR.org |date=August 19, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/american-psychological-association-sees-no-evil |title=American Psychological Association Sees No Evil |publisher=ACLU.org |date=June 16, 2009 |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> In September 2008, the APA's members passed a resolution stating that psychologists may not work in settings where "persons are held outside, or in violation of, either International Law (e.g., the UN Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions) or the U.S. Constitution (where appropriate), unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights."<ref name="coercion"/> The resolution became official APA policy in February 2009. However, the APA has refused to sanction those members known to have participated in and, in some cases, designed abusive interrogation techniques used in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan interrogation centers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/22/guantanamo-torture-mohammed-al-qahtani-suspected-9-11-hijacker |last=Ackerman |first=Spencer |title=US psychology body declines to rebuke member in Guantánamo torture case |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ethicalpsychology.org/pens/ |title=A Call for Annulment of the APA's PENS Report |publisher=Coalition for an Ethical Psychology |access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

They recently stated their continuing disagreement with APA leadership in an open letter posted on their website on October 31, 2012, in which they reiterated their condemnation of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques, and called for the APA to require its members to refuse participation in military conducted interrogations of any kind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ethicalpsychology.org/materials/Coalition-Response-to-Div42-Board.pdf | title=Open Letter |publisher=Coalition for an Ethical Psychology |access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

===Amending the Ethics Code===
In February 2010, the APA's Council of Representatives voted to amend [[APA Ethics Code|the association's Ethics Code]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/02/ethics-code.aspx |title=American Psychological Association amends ethics code to address potential conflicts among professional ethics, legal authority and organizational demands |publisher=APA.org |date=February 24, 2010 |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> to make clear that its standards can never be interpreted to justify or defend violating human rights. Following are the two relevant ethical standards from the Ethics Code, with the newly adopted language shown in bold:{{quote|1.02, Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority}}{{quote|If psychologists' ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, psychologists '''clarify the nature of the conflict''', make known their commitment to the Ethics Code and take '''reasonable''' steps to resolve the conflict '''consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code.

In its 2013 ''"Policy Related to Psychologists' Work in National Security Settings and Reaffirmation of the APA Position Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment'' the APA condemns the use of any of the following practices by military interrogators trying to elicit anti-[[terrorism]] information from detainees, on the ground that "there are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether induced by a state of war or threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, that may be invoked as a justification."<ref name="coercion">{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx |title=Policy Related to Psychologists' Work in National Security Settings and Reaffirmation of the APA Position Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment |publisher=APA.org |date=2013 |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== Hoffman report===
In November 2014, the APA ordered an independent review into whether it cooperated with the government's use of torture of prisoners during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

On July 14, 2015, the APA announced the retirement of its CEO, [[Norman B.

For at least a decade, dissident psychologists within and outside the APA, including the group WithholdAPAdues,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sectionfive.org/writings/withholding-apa-dues-in-protest-over-policy-on-torture|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201144757/http://www.sectionfive.org/writings/withholding-apa-dues-in-protest-over-policy-on-torture|url-status=dead|title=The Sphinx: A site for inquiry and innovation in psychoanalysis, ''Withholding APA Dues in Protest over Policy on Torture''|archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref> had protested the involvement of psychologists "in interrogations at CIA black sites and Guantánamo". Prior to the release of the Hoffman report, which undermined the APA's repeated denials and showed that some APA leaders were complicit in torture, the dissidents were ignored or ridiculed.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology'', Volume 1, By Daniel J. Christie, Wiley-Blackwell, December 2011, pp 580-581, {{ISBN|1405196440}}</ref><ref name=demnow/>

On August 7, 2015, just weeks following the release of the Hoffman report, the APA council of representatives met at the association's 123rd annual convention in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. At that meeting, the APA council passed Resolution 23B, which implemented the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from settings that operate outside [[international law]], and banning the participation of psychologists in unlawful interrogations. With 156 votes in favor and only one vote against, the resolution passed with the near unanimous approval of council members.<ref name=banned>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/us/politics/psychologists-approve-ban-on-role-in-national-security-interrogations.html |title=Psychologists Approve Ban on Role in National Security Interrogations |first=James |last=Risen |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 7, 2015 }}</ref> The adoption of Resolution 23B aligned the APA's policy with that of the American Psychiatric Association and that of the American Medical Association by prohibiting psychologists from participating in interrogations deemed illegal by the [[Geneva Conventions]] and the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]].<ref name=demnow>{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2015/8/10/no_more_torture_world_s_largest |title=No More Torture: World's Largest Group of Psychologists Bans Role in National Security Interrogations |website=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=August 10, 2015 }}</ref>{{quote|'''Implementation of the 2008 Membership Vote to Remove Psychologists from All Settings That Operate Outside of International Law (NBI #23B)'''}}{{quote|Council is asked to approve the substitute main motion below that includes a revised resolution with a new title, '''Resolution to Amend the 2006 and 2013 Council Resolutions to Clarify the Roles of Psychologists Related to Interrogation and Detainee Welfare in National Security Settings, to Further Implement the 2008 Petition Resolution, and to Safeguard Against Acts of Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in All Settings'''. This resolution further aligns the APA policy definition for "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" (in the 2006 and 2013 Council resolutions) with the United Nations (UN) Convention Against Torture and ensures that the definition applies broadly to all individuals and settings; offers APA as a supportive resource for ethical practice for psychologists, including those in military and national security roles; prohibits psychologists from participating in national security interrogations; clarifies the intended application of the 2008 petition resolution... and calls for APA letters to be sent to federal officials to inform them of these policy changes and clarifications of existing APA policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/independent-review/item6-nbi23b.pdf|title=Implementation of the 2008 Membership Vote to Remove Psychologists from All Settings That Operate Outside of International Law (NBI #23B)|date=2015|publisher=APA.org|access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>}} The ban will not "prohibit psychologists from working with the police or prisons in criminal law enforcement interrogations".<ref name=banned/>

==Class action lawsuit by members claiming deceptive dues assessments==
In 2013 a class action lawsuit was brought against APA on behalf of approximately 60,000 of its 122,000 members who were licensed clinicians. Those members paid an additional $140 practice assessment fee as part of their membership dues every year beginning in 2001 to fund the lobbying arm of APA, the APA Practice Organization (APAPO). The lawsuit accused APA of using deceptive means by representing that the assessment was mandatory for APA membership even though payment of the assessment was only required for membership in the APAPO. In 2015 APA settled the case by establishing a $9.02 million settlement fund to be used to pay claims made by members of APA who paid the practice assessment, as well as attorneys' fees and certain other costs. APA agreed to change its policies to make clear that the APAPO membership dues are not required for membership in APA.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/05/06/american-psychological-association-will-repay-members-9-million-in-settlement/|title=American Psychological Association will repay members $9 million in settlement|newspaper=Washington Post|date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://associationsnow.com/2015/05/psychological-association-reaches-9-million-settlement-members/|title=Psychological Association Reaches $9 Million Settlement With Members|date=May 11, 2015|website=Associations Now}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/closed-settlements/55001-apa-practice-assessment-fee-class-action-settlement/|title=APA Practice Assessment Fee Class Action Settlement|date=April 30, 2015|website=Top Class Actions}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/apa-sued-over-misleading-membership-fees-again/|title=APA Sued Over Misleading Membership Fees — Again|first1=John M.|last1=Grohol|date=April 14, 2013|website=psychcentral.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpsychologist.com/2013/06/apapo-dues-assessment-draws-new-lawsuit/101886.html|title=APAPO dues assessment draws new lawsuit|date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Ethical controversies==

===Conversion therapy===
{{See also|Conversion therapy}}

Conversion therapy (also referred to as reparative therapy) is the practice of attempting to change the patient’s [[sexual orientation]] to [[heterosexual]].  Among the most prominent supporters of conversion therapy is the [[National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), which continues to characterize [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder, despite the declassification of homosexuality as a disorder in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) in 1973.<ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation" /> One of the most notable members of NARTH is founder and former president Dr. [[Joseph Nicolosi]], who practices conversion therapy and has published case studies some of his clients.<ref name="josephnicolosi.com">{{cite web|title=Joseph Nicolosi {{ndash}} Reparative Therapy|url=http://josephnicolosi.com/|website=Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic|access-date=May 31, 2015}}</ref>

The American Psychological Association (APA) task force report on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation concluded that conversion therapy was "unlikely to be successful" and involved "some risk of harm".<ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation">{{cite web|author=APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|title=Report of the Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=Washington, DC: American Psychological Association|access-date=May 31, 2015}}</ref>  Likewise, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a call to action in 2001, concluding that "there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Office of the Surgeon General (US)|author2=Office of Population Affairs (US)|title=The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior.|journal=U. S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=2001|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44225/|access-date=May 31, 2015}}</ref>

In the task force's report, the APA recommends that therapists adopt an affirmative, supportive approach for clients who present for therapy to change their sexual orientation rather than attempting to convert their sexual orientation.<ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation"/>

===Animal research===

Currently, the APA enforces ethical standards to protect nonhuman animal subjects from unnecessary harm during the research process.  Some of the requirements for using nonhuman animals in research include: proper justification of the research, maintenance and inspection of appropriate housing for the animals, minimizing discomfort and stress whenever possible, and preference of noninvasive measures.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of Nonhuman Animals in Research|url=http://www.apa.org/science/leadership/care/guidelines.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>

Despite these guidelines, however, many advocacy groups exist to either reduce or eliminate animal research, arguing that it is unethical to capture animals and subject them to research procedures.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Humane Society of the United States|title=The Humane Society of the United States|url=https://secure.humanesociety.org/site/SPageServer/;jsessionid=FCE8B02875D82EC42BA68E2ED1463192.app304b?pagename=hsus_donation_general_ppc_splash&cr=THSR_Donate&s_src=ad_search_gg_donoracq2015&gclid=CPbGyOWrg8YCFQeKaQodqpYA8w|website=The Humane Society of the United States|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|title=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|url=http://www.peta.org/|website=PETA|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|title=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|url=https://www.aspca.org/secure/ps-gn-p2?ms=MP_PMK_Googlenonbrand-T4&initialms=MP_PMK_Googlenonbrand-T4&pcode=WPSE9XXGOGN2PK00024&lpcode=WPSE9XXGOGN1PK00024&gclid=CMTpxOGsg8YCFQccaQodXQMAJw|website=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>  Indeed, a recent study showed that only 52% of the public approves of animal research.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pew Research Center|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|journal=Pew Research Center|date=July 9, 2009|url=http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/public-praises-science-scientists-fault-public-media/|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>  Some scientists believe that this low approval rate is primarily the result of receiving manipulative misinformation from anti-animal research groups.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Allyson J.|title=Animal research: The bigger picture and why we need psychologists to speak out|url=http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2012/04/animal-research.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>

===Evidence-based practice===

A current controversy among mental health professionals involves the use of the terms evidence based practice or evidence based treatment.  Proponents of the evidence-based treatments movement argue that it is unethical to administer a therapeutic intervention with questionable research support when another treatment's effectiveness has been demonstrated for the client's condition, particularly when the intervention in question is potentially harmful (such as conversion therapy).  Proponents argue that administration of an empirically questionable treatment violates the general Principle A of the ethical principles of psychologist: Beneficence and nonmaleficence (or "do no harm").<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott O. |title=Psychological Treatments That Cause Harm |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |date=June 21, 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00029.x |pmid=26151919 |citeseerx=10.1.1.531.9405 |s2cid=26512757 }}</ref>

Critics of the evidence-based practice movement note ethical concerns regarding the research and practice of evidenced-based treatments themselves. Despite  the demonstrated effectiveness of a range of treatments, including psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Steinert |first1=Christiane |last2=Munder |first2=Thomas |last3=Rabung |first3=Sven |last4=Hoyer |first4=Jürgen |last5=Leichsenring |first5=Falk |title=Psychodynamic Therapy: As Efficacious as Other Empirically Supported Treatments?

Among the problems associated with an exclusive focus on randomized control trials to determine treatment effectiveness is that the relevance of these trials (conducted on highly selected patient populations) is unclear for psychologists working with real-word patients.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gnaulati |first1=Enrico |title=Overlooked Ethical Problems Associated With the Research and Practice of Evidenced-Based Treatments |journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology |pages=002216781880021 |date=September 15, 2018 |doi=10.1177/0022167818800219 }}</ref> Furthermore, while the public may assume evidence-based is synonymous for "likely to help", research studies indicate that most patients do not show meaningful improvement in so-called evidence based treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shedler |first1=Jonathan |title=Where Is the Evidence for 'Evidence-Based' Therapy? |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |date=June 2018 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=319–329 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2018.02.001 |pmid=29739529 }}</ref>

===Psychologists involved in torture===

During the [[Iraq War]], [[Amnesty International]] released a series of reports, calling attention to violations of the human rights of prisoners in [[Abu Ghraib Prison]] and American detention camps, and the role of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in enacting these abuses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Amnesty International|title=Iraq: Responsibilities of the occupying powers|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/089/2003/en/|access-date=June 5, 2015|agency=Amnesty International|date=April 15, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Irene|title=Open letter from AI Secretary General, Irene Khan to President George Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister José Maria Aznar and President Saddam Hussein|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/027/2003/en/|access-date=June 5, 2015|agency=Amnesty International|date=March 19, 2003}}</ref><ref name="amnesty.org">{{cite news|author=Amnesty International|title=Iraq: People come first: Amnesty International's 10-point appeal to all parties involved in possible military action in Iraq|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/022/2003/en/|access-date=June 5, 2015|agency=Amnesty International|date=March 18, 2003}}</ref>  The reports called on the occupying powers to protect the human rights of any detained civilians by giving them a fair and timely trial, not detaining civilians arbitrarily, and treating all people ethically while in detention.  Amnesty International also called for justice, by trying individual perpetrators of abuse for their crimes.<ref name="amnesty.org"/>

Despite these reports, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] instituted "enhanced" interrogation techniques, stating publicly that reported abuses were isolated incidents, and not standard practice.  Internal memos from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] revealed that an [[executive order]] by [[George W. Bush]] had sanctioned certain interrogation techniques, such as playing loud music, depriving prisoners of sleep, and stripping prisoners of their clothing.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Civil Liberties Union|title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Interested Persons Memo on FBI documents concerning detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay|url=https://www.aclu.org/aclu-interested-persons-memo-fbi-documents-concerning-detainee-abuse-guantanamo-bay|website=ACLU|access-date=June 5, 2015}}</ref>

The CIA reportedly required involvement from health professionals to continue its practice of "enhanced" interrogations on detainees, to maintain the lawfulness of their practices.  Psychiatrists and medical doctors were reluctant to participate in interrogations, however some psychologists participated.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hajjar|first1=Lisa|title=How the World's Largest Psychological Association Aided the CIA's Torture Program|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/how-worlds-largest-psychological-association-aided-cias-torture-program/|access-date=June 5, 2015|agency=The Nation|date=May 7, 2015}}</ref>  A recently released report by a group of psychologists alleges the same, implicating a number of APA officials as well.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Stephen Soldz |author2=Nathaniel Raymond |author3=Steven Reisner |title=Report on American Psychological Association's Role in Bush-Era Interrogation Program|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/01/us/document-report.html|access-date=June 5, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 2015}}</ref>

After the abuses were made public, the APA created a task force called Psychological Ethics and National Security (PENS) and released a report stating that the APA Code of Ethics applies to psychologists working in any setting, and that psychologists do not facilitate or participate in any degrading or cruel behavior, referring back to the APA's 1986 Resolution Against Torture.  The report also called on psychologists to report any suspected or observed inhumane treatment to the appropriate authorities and obey federal law.<ref>{{cite news|author=Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security|title=Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/pens.pdf|access-date=June 7, 2015|agency=American Psychological Association|date=June 2005}}</ref>
