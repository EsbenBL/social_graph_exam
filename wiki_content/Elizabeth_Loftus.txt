==Education and early life==
Elizabeth Fishman grew up in a Jewish family in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], California.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-based-justice-acknowledges-our-corrupt-memories/ | title=Evidence-based Justice Acknowledges Our Corrupt Memories | website=[[Scientific American]] | access-date=2019-08-14 | archive-date=2015-01-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105004641/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-based-justice-acknowledges-our-corrupt-memories/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name = Saletan>{{cite journal | last = Saletan | first = William | author-link = William Saletan | title = The memory doctor: the future of false memories | journal = Slate | date = 2010-06-04 | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_memory_doctor/2010/06/the_memory_doctor.single.html | access-date = 2012-05-08 | archive-date = 2019-05-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190516084842/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_memory_doctor/2010/06/the_memory_doctor.single.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Her parents were Sidney and Rebecca Fishman; her father was a doctor and her mother a librarian.<ref name=Saletan /> When Loftus was 14 years old, her mother drowned.<ref name=Neimark /><ref name=Saletan />

Elizabeth Fishman received her Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and psychology with highest honors from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1966. She received her MA in 1967 and Ph.D in 1970 (both in mathematical psychology and both from [[Stanford University]]), the only woman in her cohort.<ref name="chap 2 Do Justice" /> Her thesis was entitled "An Analysis of the Structural Variables That Determine Problem-Solving Difficulty on a Computer-Based Teletype."<ref name="chap 1 Do Justice">{{cite book | last = Loftus | first = EF | year = 2007 | chapter = Memory distortions: Problems solved and unsolved |editor = Garry M |editor2=Hayne H | title = Do Justice and Let the Sky Fall: Elizabeth F.

In 1968, Elizabeth Fishman married fellow psychologist [[Geoffrey Loftus]], taking his surname.

==Career and research==
Loftus took her first academic appointment in 1970 at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City.<ref name="chap 2 Do Justice" /> Her research during her time there focused on the organization of [[Semantic memory|semantic information in longterm memory]]; however, Loftus soon realized she wanted to do research with greater social relevance.<ref name="chap 2 Do Justice" /><ref name="chap 1 Do Justice" />  Loftus attributes this realization in part to a conversation with an acquaintance to whom she was describing her findings about semantic memory, who wondered at the cost of the research compared to its value.<ref name="chap 1 Do Justice" />

===The misinformation effect===
{{main|Misinformation effect}}
In 1973, Loftus accepted an assistant professorship at the [[University of Washington]] and used the new position to begin a new line of research into how memory works in real-world settings,<ref name="chap 2 Do Justice" /><ref name="pnas" /><ref name=Saletan /> beginning the empirical study of [[eyewitness testimony]].<ref name=Neimark /> One of the first studies she conducted was the reconstruction of automobile destruction study,<ref name=Saletan /> which was designed to investigate whether eyewitness memory can be altered by information supplied to them after an event—for example, through the use of leading questions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://webfiles.uci.edu/eloftus/LoftusPalmer74.pdf | last = Loftus | first = EF | author2 = Palmer JC | author-link = Elizabeth Loftus | year = 1974 | title = Reconstruction of Automobile Destruction : An Example of the Interaction Between Language and Memory | journal = Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 585–9 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5371(74)80011-3 | access-date = 2015-12-15 | archive-date = 2019-10-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191008011633/https://webfiles.uci.edu/eloftus/LoftusPalmer74.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> Previous studies had established that memories were not necessarily accurate representations of actual events but were in fact constructed using past experiences and other manipulations. The study showed that the way in which questions were worded altered the memories subjects reported.<ref name="chap 4 Do Justice" /><ref name=Saletan />  Loftus' next step was to investigate whether asking leading questions, or providing misleading information in other forms, might also affect people's memory for the original event.<ref name="chap 4 Do Justice" />  To answer this question, she developed the [[misinformation effect]] paradigm, which demonstrated that the memories of eyewitnesses are altered after being exposed to incorrect information about an event&nbsp;– through leading questions or other forms of post-event information; and that memory is highly malleable and open to suggestion.<ref name="chap 4 Do Justice" /><ref name=Neimark /><ref name = Wilson />  The misinformation effect became one of the most influential and widely known effects in psychology,<ref name="chap 4 Do Justice" /> and Loftus' early work on the effect generated hundreds of follow-up studies examining factors that improve or worsen the accuracy of memories, and to explore the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.<ref name="chap 4 Do Justice" /><ref name=Neimark />

====Expert testimony====
Loftus has testified and advised courts about the nature of eyewitness memory in various cases.<ref name="pnas" /><ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /> This direct involvement with the application of her work to the legal system grew from an article Loftus published in 1974 about the relationship between findings from psychological science and the witness testimony in a murder trial she had observed,<ref name="chap 2 Do Justice" /><ref name="pnas" /><ref name=Saletan /> in which conflicting witness memory played a key role in the evidence.<ref name=Saletan /> Lawyers who read the article began to contact Loftus to consult her about their cases, and judges requested educational seminars about eyewitness evidence, so she began her work as an educator of legal practitioners.<ref name="chap 2 Do Justice" /><ref name=Saletan />  In 1975 Loftus set a legal [[precedent]] when she provided [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]'s first expert testimony about eyewitness memory (specifically, on the topic of eyewitness identification).<ref name="pnas" /><ref name="chap 3 Do Justice" /> She has since testified in over 250 cases and consulted on many more.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson />

Notable cases she has been involved in due to her expertise include the [[McMartin preschool trial]], [[O. J. Simpson]], the trials of mass murderers [[Ted Bundy]], [[Wah Mee massacre|Willie Mak]], and [[Angelo Buono Jr.]], the [[Abscam]] cases, the trial of [[Oliver North]], the trial of the officers accused in the [[Rodney King]] beating, the trial of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|Harvey Weinstein]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=York|first=Associated Press in New|date=2020-02-07|title=Harvey Weinstein trial hears from expert on unreliable memories|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/harvey-weinstein-trial-unreliable-memories-elizabeth-loftus|access-date=2021-01-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-date=2020-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207215612/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/harvey-weinstein-trial-unreliable-memories-elizabeth-loftus|url-status=live}}</ref> the trial of the [[Menendez brothers]], the [[Bosnian War]] trials in the Hague, the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] case, and litigation involving [[Michael Jackson]], [[Martha Stewart]], [[Scooter Libby|Lewis "Scooter" Libby]] and the [[Duke lacrosse case|Duke University Lacrosse team]].<ref name="pnas" /><ref name=Neimark /><ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref>{{cite news | title = Memory Expert Pressed In C.I.A.

===The memory wars===
In the early 1990s, the focus of Loftus' work shifted to investigating whether it was possible to implant [[False memory|false memories]] for entire events that had never taken place. The impetus for this new line of research was a case for which Loftus had been asked to provide expert testimony in 1990.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name="chap 1 Do Justice" /><ref name="chap 8 Do Justice">{{cite book | last = Strange | first = D | author2 = Clifasefi S | author3 = Garry M | year = 2007 | chapter = False memories |editor = Garry M |editor2=Hayne H | title = Do Justice and Let the Sky Fall: Elizabeth F. Loftus and Her Contributions to Science, Law, and Academic Freedom | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=lVxZDB1fyqoC&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false 137–68] | isbn = 978-0805852325 | location = Mahwah, NJ | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}</ref>  The unique point in this case was that George Franklin stood accused of murder, but the only evidence against him was provided by his daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, who claimed that she had initially [[repressed memory|repressed the memory]] of him raping and murdering her childhood friend, Susan Nason, 20 years earlier, and had only recently [[recovered memory|recovered]] it while undergoing therapy.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name="chap 8 Do Justice" /> Loftus gave evidence about the malleability of memory, but had to concede that she did not know of any research about the particular kind of memory Franklin-Lipsker was claiming to have; Franklin was convicted (though in 1996 he was released upon appeal).<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name="chap 8 Do Justice" />

At that time, many others were also making accusations, both in and out of court, based on recovered memories of trauma.<ref name="chap 8 Do Justice" /> Loftus began work to find out whether some of these recovered memories might in fact be false memories, created by the suggestive techniques used by some therapists at the time and encouraged in some self-help books.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name="chap 8 Do Justice" /> Ethically, she could not try to convince research subjects that they had been sexually abused by a relative as a child, so Loftus had to come up with a paradigm that involved childhood trauma without causing harm to subjects. Her student [[Jim Coan]] developed the [[lost in the mall technique]]. The method involves attempting to implant a false memory of being lost in a shopping mall as a child and testing whether discussing a false event could produce a "memory" of an event that never happened.  In her initial study, Loftus found that 25% of subjects came to develop a "memory," also known as a "rich false memory,"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=French |first1=Chris |author-link=Chris French |title=The John Maddox Prize Nomination for Elizabeth Loftus |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=20–23}}</ref> for the event which had never actually taken place.<ref name = Wilson /><ref name="chap 8 Do Justice" />  Extensions and variations of the lost in the mall technique found that an average of one third of experimental subjects could become convinced that they experienced things in childhood that had never really occurred—even highly traumatic, and impossible events.<ref name="chap 8 Do Justice" />  Loftus' work was used to oppose recovered memory evidence provided in court<ref name = Wilson /> and resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials as well as a greater requirement for [[corroborating evidence]].  In addition, some states no longer allowed prosecution based on recovered memory testimony and insurance companies were more reluctant to insure therapists against malpractice suits relating to recovered memories.<ref name=Neimark /><ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson />

====Criticisms and harassment related to research====

=====Criticisms=====
Loftus' first study using the lost in the mall technique was criticized by Lynn Crook and Martha Dean based on the ethics of the subject recruitment method used.<ref name =Crook>{{cite journal | last1 = Crook | first1 = L. | year = 1999 | title = "Lost in a Shopping Mall"–A Breach of Professional Ethics | journal = Ethics & Behavior | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–50 | url = http://users.owt.com/crook/memory/ | access-date = 2008-01-18 | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0901_3 | last2 = Dean | first2 = Martha | pmid = 11657487 | archive-date = 2019-08-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190830153237/http://users.owt.com/crook/memory/ | url-status = live }}</ref>  Also, Kenneth Pope has argued she inappropriately generalized the findings to draw conclusions about false memories and therapeutic techniques.<ref name =Crook /><ref name=pope1996b>{{cite journal | last = Pope | first = K. | year = 1996 | title = Memory, Abuse, and Science: Questioning Claims about the False Memory Syndrome Epidemic | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 51 | issue = 9 | pages = 957–974 | url = http://www.kspope.com/memory/memory.php | access-date = 2008-01-31 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.9.957 | pmid = 8819364 | archive-date = 2008-01-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113042031/http://www.kspope.com/memory/memory.php | url-status = live }}</ref>  These writers purported to identify errors, exaggerations, and omissions in her research. Loftus published a rebuttal to these critics and stated that the criticisms appeared to be based on personal animosity rather than a valid understanding of the research. Regarding the ethics of the creation of the study, Loftus stated that it was primarily a colleague who piloted the study with his daughter, and later revisited the idea as part of an undergraduate class she was teaching.  She also emphasized that participants demonstrated no adverse effects upon follow-up and pointed out that the study design and findings had been replicated repeatedly, demonstrating the soundness of the conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = E | year = 1999 | journal =  Ethics & Behavior| title = Lost in the mall: Misrepresentations and misunderstandings | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 | pmid = 11657488 | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0901_4 | access-date = 2010-02-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082741/http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf | archive-date = 2010-06-19 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  In addition to opposition from fellow researchers, Loftus has been insulted by a prosecutor, attacked by an airplane passenger who recognized her,<ref name=Neimark /><ref name = Wilson /> received hate mail and death threats,<ref name = Wilson /><ref name=Abramsky>{{cite news | last = Abramsky | first = S | date = 2004-08-19 | title = Memory and Manipulation: The trials of Elizabeth Loftus, defender of the wrongly accused | work = [[LA Weekly]] | url = http://www.laweekly.com/2004-08-19/news/memory-and-manipulation/ | access-date = 2012-06-10 | archive-date = 2013-01-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130106093521/http://www.laweekly.com/2004-08-19/news/memory-and-manipulation/ | url-status = live }}</ref> and has had to have protection by security guards while giving invited addresses.<ref name=Neimark /><ref name=Saletan /> Her invitation to give the keynote address at the New Zealand Psychological Society's conference in 2000 provoked the society's director of scientific affairs, John Read, to resign from his position and for conference attendees to distribute materials critical of Loftus' work.<ref name="NZSkepticsKeynote">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Annette|date=1 November 2000|title=A Good Time Was Had By All|url=http://skeptics.nz/journal/issues/57/editorial-57|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306085321/http://skeptics.nz/journal/issues/57/editorial-57|archive-date=6 March 2016|access-date=11 November 2016|website=NZ Skeptics}}</ref> Loftus stated that she "didn't wear her best jacket" to give her address for "fear of flying tomatoes."<ref name=NZSkepticsKeynote />

=====Harassment=====
After criticizing the theory of recovered memory and testifying about the nature of memory and [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations of child sexual abuse]] as part of the [[day care sex abuse hysteria]], Loftus was subject to online harassment by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]] [[Diana Napolis]], who believed Loftus was engaged in [[satanic ritual abuse]] or assisted in covering up these crimes as part of a larger conspiracy.<ref name = Cyberstalking>{{cite book | author = Bocij, Paul | title = Cyberstalking: harassment in the Internet age and how to protect your family | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]] | location = New York | year = 2004 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=q8NZLBE0sm0C&pg=PA34 34] | isbn = 978-0-275-98118-1 }}</ref>

===="Jane Doe" case====
{{main|Jane Doe case}}
The case that has arguably had the biggest negative impact on Loftus is that of [[Jane Doe case|"Jane Doe"]] (real name Nicole Taus). In 1997, [[David Corwin]] and his colleague Erna Olafson published a case study<ref>{{cite journal | last = Corwin | first = D. | author2 = Olafson E. | year = 1997 | title = Videotaped Discovery of a Reportedly Unrecallable Memory of Child Sexual Abuse: Comparison with a Childhood Interview Videotaped 11 Years Before | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–112 | doi = 10.1177/1077559597002002001| s2cid = 143444117 }}</ref> of an apparently bona fide case of an accurate, [[recovered memory]] of childhood sexual abuse.<ref name=Abramsky /><ref name="Tavris 08">{{cite journal | last = Tavris | first = Carol | author-link = Carol Tavris | year = 2008 | title = Whatever Happened to 'Jane Doe'? | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–30 | issn = 0194-6730 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/whatever_happened_to_jane_doe/ | access-date = 2010-02-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150204133011/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/whatever_happened_to_jane_doe | archive-date = 2015-02-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Skeptical, Loftus and her colleague Melvin Guyer decided to investigate further. Using public records and interviewing people connected to Taus, they uncovered information Corwin had not included in his original article—information that they thought strongly suggested Taus' memory of abuse was false.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name=Abramsky />  While Loftus and Guyer were conducting their investigation, Taus contacted the [[University of Washington]] and accused Loftus of breaching her privacy.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name="Tavris 02">{{cite journal | last = Tavris | first = C | year = 2002 | title = The high cost of skepticism | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 41–44 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/high_cost_of_skepticism | access-date = 2011-04-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150130051320/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/high_cost_of_skepticism | archive-date = 2015-01-30 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In response, the university confiscated Loftus' files and put Loftus under investigation for 21 months, forbidding her to share her findings in the meantime.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name=Abramsky /><ref name="Tavris 02" /> She was eventually cleared of all wrongdoing by the university, and allowed to publish her findings{{sfn|Loftus & Guyer|2002a}}{{sfn|Loftus & Guyer|2002b}} in 2002.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name = Wilson /><ref name="Tavris 02" />

In 2003, Loftus, the University of Washington and a few others were [[Taus v. Loftus|sued by Taus]] regarding the 2002 publication.<ref name=Saletan /><ref name="Tavris 08" /> The suit initially involved allegations of [[Privacy laws of the United States|invasion of privacy]], [[defamation]], [[fraud]], and [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|infliction of emotional distress]]; 21 counts and [[Cause of action|causes of action]] in total; however, in February, 2007 the [[Supreme Court of California]] dismissed all but one count under [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]] legislation.<ref name="Tavris 08" /><ref name ="Taus case">{{cite court | url = http://www.firstamendmentcoalition.org/handbook/cases/Taus_V.pdf | format = PDF | litigants = Taus v.

The case was settled in August 2007 when Loftus' insurance company agreed to a [[Frivolous litigation|nuisance settlement]] of $7,500 rather than cover the cost of a trial for the one remaining allegation.<ref name="Tavris 08" /> Taus was ordered to pay the legal bills for all of the defendants, which amounted to $450,578.50.<ref name="Tavris 08" /> This order was subsequently appealed.<ref name="Tavris 08" /> Loftus published her own analysis of the case in 2009.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = Elizabeth | date = May 2008 | title = Perils of Provocative Scholarship | journal = Observer | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 13–15 | issn = 1050-4672 | url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2339 | access-date = 2008-05-30 | archive-date = 2012-02-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120223233456/http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2339 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = E | author2 = Geis G | title = ''Taus v.

In her acceptance speech for the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award, Loftus states that the word "freedom" is personally important to her, as when she began speaking out about repressed memory, she never imagined she would become "the target of organized, relentless vitriol and harassment".  Loftus feels that today's world  for science is a perilous one and if scientists want to preserve their freedoms they need to speak out "against even the most cherished beliefs that reflect unsubstantiated myths".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = Elizabeth | title = We Live in Perilous Times for Science | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | page = 13 | date = May–June 2011}}</ref>
