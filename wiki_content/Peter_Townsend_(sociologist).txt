'''Peter Brereton Townsend''' (6 April 1928, [[Middlesbrough]] – 8 June 2009, [[Dursley]]) was a British [[sociologist]]. The last position he held was Professor of International Social Policy at the [[London School of Economics]]. He was also Emeritus Professor of Social Policy in the [[University of Bristol]], and was one of the co-founders of the [[University of Essex]]. He wrote widely on the economics of poverty and was co-founder of the [[Child Poverty Action Group]].<ref name=ind130609>''[[The Independent]]'', 13 June 2009, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-peter-townsend-campaigner-for-social-justice-who-cofounded-the-child-poverty-action-group-1704169.html Professor Peter Townsend: Campaigner for social justice who co-founded the Child Poverty Action Group]</ref> [https://web.archive.org/web/20110325010733/http://www.britac.ac.uk/about/medals/townsend.cfm The Peter Townsend Policy Press Prize] was established by the [[British Academy]] in his memory.

==Career==
Townsend was dedicated to studying "very carefully the life of the poorest and most handicapped members of society".<ref name=ind130609/> He applied this consistently outside academia as well as within it.

During the 1960s, Townsend served as a member on the [[Council for Training in Social Work]]'s Research Committee. The committee was chaired by [[Charles Morrison|Sir Charles Morris]].<ref>"First Report of The Council for Training in Social Work, 1962-1964"; Kendal Archive, WC/W/A1568/Box 19/W/6/4</ref>

Townsend was co-founder of the [[Child Poverty Action Group]] in 1965, was its chair for 20 years and Life President from 1989. He also co-founded the [[Disability Alliance]] in response to the [[Thalidomide]] scandal, and chaired it for 25 years.<ref name="ind130609" />

==Work==
===Definition of relative poverty===
*''"Individuals, families and groups in the population can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and the amenities which are customary, or at least widely encouraged or approved in the societies to which they belong. Their resources are so seriously below those commanded by the average family that they are in effect excluded from the ordinary living patterns, customs, and activities (page 31)."<ref name=Townsend1979>{{cite book|author=Townsend, P.|year=1979|title=Poverty in the United Kingdom|location=London|publisher=Penguin}}</ref>

===Townsend inefficiency===
Townsend inefficiency is a possible property of monetary exchange. Rather than evaluating the utility he generated in production, one of the parties is evaluating the value of the money he gets in the transaction.<ref>[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/townsend.htm economics.about.com] Accessed 18 June 2008.</ref> In other words, a worker may only be looking at his [[paycheck]] instead of the amount of labour he promises to perform to get that paycheck. This sets up an inefficiency in the monetary exchange.

== Personal life ==
Peter Townsend was educated at Fleet Road Elementary School, Gospel Oak, [[University College School]], [[St John's College, Cambridge]] (MA) and the [[Free University, Berlin]]. He was married three times: Ruth Pearce (1949) with whom he had four sons; Joy Skegg (1977) with whom he had one daughter; [[Jean Corston|Jean Ann Corston]], a Labour peer and former MP (1985) (one stepson, one stepdaughter) who was his partner from 1980.<ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Marriages England and Wales 1984–2005]</ref>

Townsend died of heart failure on 8 June 2009. He was survived by Corston and his five children.<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 June 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jun/09/obituary-peter-townsend Peter Townsend – Social policy professor at the LSE and joint founder of the Child Poverty Action Group]</ref>
