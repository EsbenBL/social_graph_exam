==Life and work==
David Friedman is the son of economists [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. He graduated magna cum laude from [[Harvard University]] in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.<ref>[http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ Faculty Profile: David Friedman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722163211/http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ |date=2014-07-22 }}.

He is currently a Professor [[Emeritus]]. He is an [[Atheism|atheist]].<ref>Friedman, David D. [http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/01/atheism-and-religion.html "Atheism and Religion"], ''Ideas''.</ref> His son, [[Patri Friedman]], has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly [[seasteading]]. 

===''The Machinery of Freedom''===
{{Main|The Machinery of Freedom}}
In his book ''The Machinery of Freedom'' (1973), Friedman sketched a form of [[anarcho-capitalism]] where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the [[free market]].  Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual [[privatization]] of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing the law itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|pages=[https://archive.org/details/machineryoffreed00frie/page/149 149–150]|chapter=Revolution Is the Hell of It|author=Friedman, David D|isbn=0-8126-9069-9|year=1995|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/machineryoffreed00frie/page/149}}</ref>

He advocates a [[Consequentialist libertarianism|consequentialist]] version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for it on a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of state versus no state.<ref>Morris, Christopher. 1992. An Essay on the Modern State. Cambridge University Press. p. 62.</ref> It is contrasted with the [[Natural-rights libertarianism|natural-rights]] approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist [[Murray Rothbard]].

==Non-academic interests==
Friedman is a longtime member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], where he is known as ''Duke Cariadoc of the Bow''. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Restructuring.html|title=Friedman, David D. "On Restructuring the SCA"}}</ref> His work is compiled in the popular ''Cariadoc's Miscellany''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/miscellany.html|title=Cariadoc's Miscellany|website=www.pbm.com}}</ref> He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the [[Pennsic War]]; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge and lost (to himself).<ref>F.L. Watkins (Fólki Þorgilsson). 2005. ''HERSTAĐR-SAGA: An Incomplete History of Pennsic'' Urbana, Illinois: Folump Enterprises</ref>

He was a teenage [[wargamer]] who taught his school friend, [[Jack Radey]], founder of People's War Games, how to play such wargames as [[Tactics II]].<ref name="Homo Ludens">{{cite web |last1=Serval |first1=Fred |title=Jack Radey part 1 – The Origins of People's War Games |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGuMsL2dlpA |website=Homo Ludens |publisher=Fred Serval |access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref> Radey relates how Friedman and himself wrote to [[Charles S. Roberts]] claiming that they had found a first turn winning strategy for each of the two sides. Roberts replied that their interpretation of the rules was valid.<ref name="Homo Ludens"/>

He is a long-time [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan]], and has written two [[fantasy]] novels, ''Harald'' ([[Baen Books]], 2006) and ''Salamander'' (2011).

He has spoken in favor of a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO1xXD1Cws4|title=Dr David Friedman on US Foreign Policy, Syria, Assad, Terrorism, WWII, Hitler, and much more...|last=VoluntaryVirtues0com|date=22 September 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>
