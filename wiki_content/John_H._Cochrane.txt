'''John Howland Cochrane''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|r|ən}}; born 26 November 1957) is an American [[economist]] specializing in [[financial economics]] and [[macroeconomics]]. Formerly a professor of economics and finance at the [[University of Chicago]], Cochrane serves as the Rose-Marie and Jack Anderson Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]].

== Life and career ==
Cochrane was born in Chicago.  He attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and graduated in 1979 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[physics]]. He then did graduate study in [[economics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and received a [[Ph.D.]] in 1986. He worked as a junior economist on the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] from 1982 to 1983. Cochrane was hired by the [[University of Chicago]] economics department in 1986 and moved to the business school in 1993. Prior to joining the Hoover Institution, he was the [[AQR Capital Management]] Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]].

Cochrane has served as head of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] asset pricing group, and was the editor of the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' from 1998 to 2003. He was elected Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] in 2001, served as vice-president of the [[American Finance Association]] in 2008, and was elected president of this [[learned society]] for the 2010 term.

=== Main contributions ===
The central idea of Cochrane's research is that macroeconomics and finance should be linked, and a comprehensive theory needs to explain both of the following:
* how, given the observed prices and financial returns, households and firms decide on consumption, investment, and financing.
* how, in equilibrium, prices and financial returns are determined by households and firms decisions.

That is a standard general equilibrium logic, but many financial economists do not view it as a priority and prefer to explain prices without an ultimate reference to choices of households and firms. Similarly, many macroeconomists choose not to worry about asset prices.

In this vein, Cochrane's work has been to document some empirical patterns and offer some potential explanations. His 1999 ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', with [[John Y. Campbell]], develops a representative agent model with nonlinear habits that matches the high and volatile risk premium on stocks, the predictability of stock returns, etc.<ref>Campbell, John Y. and Cochrane, John H. "By Force of Habit: A Consumption-Based Explanation of Aggregate Stock Market Behavior" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 107, 205–251 (April 1999).</ref> In several articles (1991 ''[[The Journal of Finance]]'', 1996 ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''), he develops and tests a "production-based asset pricing model" based on the [[Tobin's q|q-theory of investment]].<ref>Cochrane, John H. "Production-Based Asset Pricing and the Link Between Stock Returns and Economic Fluctuations." ''Journal of Finance'' 46 (1) (March 1991) 209–237.</ref><ref>Cochrane, John H. "A Cross-Sectional Test of an Investment-Based Asset Pricing Model" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 104 (June 1996).</ref>

In two 1992 articles, Cochrane emphasized some features of asset prices which are difficult to account for, such as the predictability of equity returns, and the longterm equity premium.<ref>Cochrane, John H. and Lars Peter Hansen, "Asset Pricing Explorations for Macroeconomics",1992 ''NBER  Macroeconomics  Annual'' 115–165.</ref><ref>Cochrane, John H. "Explaining the Variance of Price-Dividend Ratios" ''Review of Financial Studies'' (1992) 5:2, 243–280</ref>
His more recent work, with [[Monika Piazzesi]], studies bond markets. In particular, in a number of papers, Cochrane and Piazzesi study the predictability of bond returns.

=== Other contributions ===
Cochrane has also worked on the fiscal theory of the price level,<ref>Cochrane, John H., "Long term debt and optimal policy in the fiscal theory of the price level"  ''Econometrica'' 69, 69–116 (2001).</ref> on the debate between permanent and temporary shocks in macroeconomic fluctuations,<ref>Cochrane, John H., "Permanent and Transitory Components of GNP and Stock Prices", ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 109(1) (February 1994) 241–266.</ref> and the cost of near-rational behavior.<ref>Cochrane, John H. "The Sensitivity of Tests of the Intertemporal Allocation of Consumption to Near-Rational Alternatives" ''American Economic Review'' 79 (June 1989) 319–337.</ref>

== ''Asset Pricing'' ==
Cochrane is the author of ''Asset Pricing'',<ref>Cochrane, John H., ''Asset Pricing'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2001.</ref> a widely used textbook in graduate courses on asset pricing. According to his own words, the organizing principle of the book is that everything can be traced back to specializations of a single equation: the basic pricing equation.<ref>Cochrane, John H., ''Asset Pricing'', Princeton University Press, 2001, p. xvii</ref> Cochrane received the TIAA-CREF Institute [[Paul A. Samuelson]] Award for this book.

== Media appearances ==
Since 2008, Cochrane has appeared more extensively in the media as he contributed to the debate on the financial crisis. [[Paul Krugman]] criticized repeatedly his viewpoint on his blog <ref>Krugman, Paul, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/a-dark-age-of-macroeconomics-wonkish/ "A Dark Age of macroeconomics (wonkish)"], January 27, 2009.</ref><ref>Krugman, Paul, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/brad-delongs-foolishness/ "Brad DeLong’s Foolishness"], February 23, 2010.</ref> and in a New York Times Magazine article,<ref>Krugman, Paul, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?pagewanted=all "How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?"], [[New York Times Magazine]], September 2, 2009.</ref> leading John Cochrane to write a response on his website, which was subsequently published in [[The Wall Street Journal]].<ref>Cochrane, John H., [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/Papers/krugman_response.htm "How did Paul Krugman get it so Wrong?"], September 16, 2009.</ref>

* 2014, Doctor ''honoris causa'' in Economics awarded by [[University of St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]<ref>[http://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/wirtschafts-und-finanzportal/stelldichein-mit-dem-muffel-1.18309649 Interview given to ''Neue Zuercher Zeitung'', May 26, 2014, p. 17]</ref>
