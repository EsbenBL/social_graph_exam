{{Short description|American psychologist}}
'''Harlene Anderson''' (born 1942) is an American psychologist and a cofounder of the Postmodern Collaborative Approach to therapy. In the 1980s, Anderson and her colleague Harold A. Goolishian pioneered a new technique that is used to relate to patients within therapy through language and collaboration, and without the use of diagnostic labels. This approach to therapy places the patient in control of the therapy session and asks the therapist to focus on the present session and ignore any preconceived notions they may have. This approach was first developed for the use of family and mental health therapists, but has since expanded into a variety of professional practices such as [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational psychology]], higher education, and research.

== Education ==

Anderson has her PhD in Psychology and is licensed to practice professional counseling and marriage and family therapy. Anderson received both her Bachelor's and Master's Degree from the University of Houston, Texas. She went on to receive her Doctorate in Psychology with a focus around Marriage and Family Therapy from [[Union Institute and University]] which is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.<ref>Irby, B., Brown, G. H., LaraAiecio, R., & Jackson, S. A. (Eds.). (2013). Handbook of educational theories. IAP.</ref>

== Research == 

In 1997, Anderson published her first book based around her theory around collaborative therapy called "Conversation, Language, and Possibilities: A Postmodern Approach to Therapy". This theory, called the Postmodern Collaborative Approach, focuses on therapists collaborating with their clients in a non-judgmental way to ensure that the client is being accurately understood. Outside of therapy sessions, therapists must continuously go through a process of self-reflection and self-awareness so as to avoid the innate judgmental nature of humans from clouding their own opinion of a future therapy session.<ref>Cheon, H. S., & Murphy, M. J. (2007). The self-of-the-therapist awakened: Postmodern approaches to the use of self in marriage and family therapy. Journal of Feminist Family Therapy, 19(1), 1-16.</ref> Within therapy sessions, therapists take on a conversational role with their client and view the client as the expert in the conversation rather than themselves. Contrary to other therapeutic approaches from the time, the postmodern collaborative approach requested that therapists do not use diagnostic labels either since these may have preconceived notions and opinions behind them which may alter a therapists' view as well.<ref>Par√©, D., & Tarragona, M. (2006). Generous pedagogy: Teaching and learning postmodern therapies. Journal of Systemic Therapies, 25(4), 1-7.</ref>
