'''Walter Edward Williams''' (March 31, 1936{{spnd}}December 1, 2020) was an American economist, commentator, and academic.

Williams was the [[John M. Olin]] Distinguished Professor of Economics at [[George Mason University]], as well as a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[columnist]] and [[author]]. Known for his [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[libertarian]] views,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=4699|title=Free Market Mojo<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> Williams's writings frequently appeared in ''[[Townhall]]'', ''[[WorldNetDaily|WND]]'', and ''[[Jewish World Review]]''. Williams was also a popular guest host of the [[Rush Limbaugh]] radio show when Limbaugh was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Limbaugh |first1=Rush |title=The World Will Miss the Hilarious and Brilliant Walter Williams |url=https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/12/07/the-world-will-miss-the-hilarious-and-brilliant-walter-williams/ |website=RushLimbaugh.com |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |access-date=12 October 2021}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Williams was born in [[Philadelphia]] on March 31, 1936.<ref name = NYT>{{cite web|title=Walter E. Williams, 84, Dies; Conservative Economist on Black Issues|date=December 4, 2020|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/business/economy/walter-e-williams-dead.html|last=Hershey|first=Robert D. Jr.|access-date=December 4, 2020}}</ref> His family during childhood consisted of his mother, his sister, and him; Williams's father played no role in raising Williams or his sister.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=3}}</ref> The family initially lived in West Philadelphia, moving to North Philadelphia and the Richard Allen [[housing project]]s when Williams was ten years old.  His neighbors included a young [[Bill Cosby]]. Williams knew many of the individuals that Cosby speaks of from his childhood, including Weird Harold and Fat Albert.<ref name=Reason>{{cite web|last=Root|first=Damon|date=January 28, 2011|url=https://reason.com/2011/01/28/man-versus-the-state/|title=Man Versus the State|work=[[Reason magazine|Reason]]|access-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131093006/http://reason.com/archives/2011/01/28/man-versus-the-state|archive-date=January 31, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

After graduating from [[Benjamin Franklin High School (Philadelphia)|Benjamin Franklin High School]], Williams traveled to California to live with his father and attend [[Los Angeles City College]] for one semester.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=28}}</ref> He later returned to Philadelphia and secured a job as a [[cab driver]] for the [[Yellow Cab Company]].<ref name="military draft">{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Walter E.|date=December 27, 2006|title=Reinstating the military draft|publisher=Creators Syndicate |url=http://walterewilliams.com/reinstating-the-military-draft/ |access-date=December 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022225634/http://gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/06/draft.html |archive-date=October 22, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1959, he was drafted into the military and served as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army]].<ref name=Reason/><ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=36}}</ref>

While stationed in the South, Williams "waged a one-man battle against [[Jim Crow]] from inside the army." He challenged the racial order with provocative statements to his fellow soldiers. This resulted in an overseeing officer filing a [[court-martial]] proceeding against Williams.  Williams argued his own case and was found not guilty.<ref name=Reason/> While considering filing countercharges against the officer who had brought him up for court martial, Williams found himself transferred to Korea. Upon arriving there, Williams marked "Caucasian" for race on his personnel form.  When challenged on this, Williams replied wryly if he had marked "Black," he would end up getting all the worst jobs. From Korea, Williams wrote a letter to President [[John F. Kennedy]] denouncing the pervasive racism in the American government and military and questioning the actions black Americans should take given the state of affairs, writing:

{{quote|Should Negroes be relieved of their service obligation or continue defending and dying for empty promises of freedom and equality? Or should we demand human rights as our Founding Fathers did at the risk of being called extremists? I contend that we relieve ourselves of oppression in a manner that is in keeping with the great heritage of our nation.<ref name=Reason/>}}

He received a reply from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, [[Alfred B. Fitt]], a response which he termed "the most reasonable response that I received from any official."<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|pp=63–65}}</ref>

Following his military service, Williams served as a juvenile group supervisor for the [[Los Angeles County Probation Department]] from 1963 to 1967.<ref name="Creators bio"/> Williams also resumed his education, earning a bachelor's degree in economics in 1965 from California State College at Los Angeles (now [[Cal State Los Angeles]]).<ref name="Creators bio">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000226111122/http://creators.com/opinion/bio/bio-will.htm|archive-date=February 26, 2000|title=About Walter Williams|publisher=Creators Syndicate|url=http://creators.com/opinion/bio/bio-will.htm|access-date=June 3, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> He earned both his master's degree and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in economics from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Keenan |first1=Patrick |title=Walter E.

Speaking of his early college days, Williams said: "I was more than anything a radical. I was more sympathetic to [[Malcolm X]] than [[Martin Luther King]], because Malcolm X was more of a radical who was willing to confront discrimination in ways that I thought it should be confronted, including perhaps the use of violence.  But I really just wanted to be left alone. I thought some laws, like minimum-wage laws, helped poor people and poor black people and protected workers from exploitation. I thought they were a good thing until I was pressed by professors to look at the evidence." During his time at UCLA, Williams came into contact with economists such as [[Armen Alchian]], [[James M. Buchanan]], and [[Axel Leijonhufvud]] who challenged his assumptions.<ref name="Riley" />

While Williams was attending UCLA, [[Thomas Sowell]] arrived on campus in 1969 as a visiting professor. Although he never took a class from Dr. Sowell, the two met and began a friendship that lasted for decades. In the summer of 1972, Sowell was hired as director of the Urban Institute's Ethnic Minorities Project, which Williams joined shortly thereafter.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|pp=91–93}}</ref> Correspondence between Sowell and Williams appears in "A Man of Letters," a 2007 [[autobiography]] authored by Sowell.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Man of Letters, by Thomas Sowell|url=https://www.hoover.org/press-releases/man-letters-thomas-sowell|access-date=December 2, 2020|website=Hoover Institution|language=en}}</ref>

== Academic career ==
During his doctoral studies, Williams was an instructor in [[economics]] at [[Los Angeles City College]] from 1967 to 1969, and at [[Cal State Los Angeles]] from 1967 to 1971.<ref name="Creators bio"/>

After returning to his native Philadelphia, Williams taught economics at [[Temple University]] from 1973 to 1980.<ref name="Creators bio"/> For the 1975–76 academic year, Williams was a visiting scholar at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|pp=106–108}}</ref> In 1980, Williams joined the economics faculty at [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. That same year, Williams began writing a syndicated column, "A Minority View", for Heritage Features Syndicate, which merged with [[Creators Syndicate]] in 1991.<ref name="Creators bio"/> From 1995 to 2001, Williams chaired the economics department at George Mason.<ref name="official biography"/> Courses taught by Williams at George Mason include "Intermediate [[Microeconomics]]" for undergraduate students and "Microeconomic Theory I" for graduate students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://walterewilliams.com/courses/econ306spring2019.pdf |title=Course outline |website=walterewilliams.com |access-date=December 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economics.gmu.edu/courses/econ811/course_sections/40395|title=Economics &#124; ECON 811: Microeconomic Theory I|website=Economics}}</ref> Williams continued to teach at George Mason until his death in 2020.<ref name="Boudreaux">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/walter-williams-r-i-p-11606934313|title=Walter Williams, R.I.P.|last=Boudreaux|first=Donald J.|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202185431/https://www.wsj.com/articles/walter-williams-r-i-p-11606934313|archive-date=December 2, 2020|url-status=dead|access-date=December 2, 2020}}</ref>

In his nearly fifty year career, Williams wrote hundreds of research articles, book reviews, and commentaries for scholarly journals including ''[[American Economic Review]]'', ''[[Policy Review]]'', and ''[[Journal of Labor Research]]'' as well as popular journals including ''[[The American Spectator]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name="publications">{{Cite web|url=http://walterewilliams.com/publications/publications/|title=Walter E.

Williams was awarded an honorary degree at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]]. He served on advisory boards including the Review Board of Economics Studies for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[Reason Foundation]], the National Tax Limitation Committee, and the [[Hoover Institute]].<ref name="Creators bio"/><ref name="official biography"/>

Williams wrote ten books, beginning in 1982 with ''The State Against Blacks'' and ''America: A Minority Viewpoint''.<ref name="official biography">{{cite web | url = http://walterewilliams.com/about/ | title = Walter E.

== Economic and political views ==
As an [[economist]], Williams was a proponent of [[free market]] economics and opposed [[Socialism|socialist]] systems of government intervention.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1999|pp=42–44}}</ref> Williams believed laissez-faire capitalism to be the most moral, most productive system humans have ever devised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/capitalism-and-the-common-man |title=Capitalism and the Common Man | author = Williams, Walter |work=The Freeman |date=January 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209100218/http://www.fee.org/vnews.php?nid=4535|archive-date=December 9, 2003|url-status=live |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref>

In the mid-to-late 1970s, Williams conducted research into the [[Davis–Bacon Act]] of 1931 and on the impact of minimum wage laws on minority employment. His research led him to conclude the government's interventional programs are harmful. Williams was critical of state programs, including [[minimum wage]] and [[affirmative action]] laws, stating both practices inhibit liberty and are detrimental to the blacks they are intended to help. He published his results in his 1982 book ''The State Against Blacks'', where he argued that laws regulating economic activity are far greater obstacles to economic progress for blacks than racial bigotry and discrimination.<ref name=Riley>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576094221050061598|title=The State Against Blacks|last=Riley|first=Jason|date=January 22, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123112055/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704881304576094221050061598.html|archive-date=January 23, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequently, Williams spoke on the topic and penned a number of articles detailing his view that increases in the minimum wage price low skill workers out of the market, eliminating their opportunities for employment.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://walterewilliams.com/minimum-wage,-maximum-folly/ |title=Minimum Wage, Maximum Folly | first=Walter E. | last=Williams|publisher=Creators Syndicate | date=December 1, 2010d|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209050829/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/articles/10/MinimumWageMaximumFolly|archive-date=February 9, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |publisher=Creators Syndicate | url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/articles/10/MinimumWageCruelty.htm| title=Minimum wage cruelty | first=Walter E. | last=Williams | date=April 14, 2010a|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730031545/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/articles/10/MinimumWageCruelty.htm|archive-date=July 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Williams |first=Walter E. |date=March 24, 2005 |url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=1473 |work=Investors Business Daily |title=Minimum Wage Is Not An Anti-Poverty Tool}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Walter E. |title=Minimum wage cruelty |url=https://www.creators.com/read/walter-williams/07/17/minimum-wage-cruelty |publisher=Creators Syndicate |access-date=June 3, 2020 |date=July 12, 2017}}</ref>

Williams believed that [[racism]] and the legacy of [[slavery]] in the United States are overemphasized as problems faced by the black community today. He pointed to the crippling effects of a welfare state and the disintegration of the black family as more pressing concerns. "The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn't do, and that is to destroy the black family."<ref name=Riley/> Although in favor of equal access to government institutions such as court houses, city halls, and libraries, Williams opposed anti-discrimination laws directed at the private sector on the grounds that such laws infringe upon the people's right of [[freedom of association]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter E.|date=April 1, 1998|title=Discrimination and Liberty {{!}} Walter E. Williams |website=fee.org |url=https://fee.org/articles/discrimination-and-liberty/|access-date=December 2, 2020}}</ref>

Williams viewed [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] laws as a governmental infringement upon the rights of individuals, and argued that they end up endangering the innocent while failing to reduce crime.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1999|pp=59–61}}</ref> Williams also made the argument that the true proof of whether or not an individual [[Ownership|owns]] something is whether or not they have the right to sell it. Taking this argument to its conclusion, he supported legalization of [[Organ sale|selling one's own bodily organs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1999|pp=138–140}}</ref>  He argued that government prohibiting the selling of one's bodily organs is an infringement upon one's property rights.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1999|p=140}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://walterewilliams.com/publications/freeman/organs.html|title=My Organs Are For Sale|work=Ideas on Liberty|date=October 2002|author= Williams, Walter E.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030106160209/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/fee/organs.html|archive-date=January 6, 2003|url-status=live|access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref>

Williams praised the views of [[Thomas DiLorenzo]],<ref name="Williams">{{cite web | url = http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig2/w-williams1.html | title = DiLorenzo Is Right About Lincoln | author = Williams, Walter | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] | date = March 22, 2005 | access-date = April 7, 2007 }}</ref> and wrote a [[foreword]] to DiLorenzo's anti-[[Abraham Lincoln]] book, ''[[The Real Lincoln]]''.<ref name="Forward">{{cite book|last=DiLorenzo |first=Thomas |date=2003 |title=The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War |chapter=Foreword |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5B9qs5dAnuwC |others=Foreword by Walter Williams |location=New York, New York |publisher=Three Rivers Press |page=xii–xiii |isbn=0-7615-2646-3 |access-date=December 7, 2014}}</ref> Williams maintained that the American states are entitled to [[Secession in the United States|secede from the union]] if they wish, as the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states attempted to do during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],<ref name="Williams"/> and asserted that the Union's victory in the Civil War allowed the federal government "to run amok over [[states' rights]], so much so that the protections of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments mean little or nothing today."<ref name="Forward"/>

In reaction to what he viewed as inappropriate racial sensitivity that he saw hurting blacks in higher education, Williams began in the 1970s to offer colleagues a "certificate of amnesty and pardon" to all white people for Western Civilization's sins against blacks – and "thus obliged them not to act like damn fools in their relationships with Americans of African ancestry." It is still offered to anyone. The certificate can be obtained at his website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/gift.pdf|title=Gift of Amnesty and Pardon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626165122/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/gift.pdf|archive-date=June 26, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Williams was opposed to the [[Federal Reserve System]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams110409.php3#.UI8U_2cqlbI|title=Walter Williams|work=jewishworldreview.com}}</ref> arguing that [[central banks]] are dangerous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/walterewilliams/2008/12/17/counterfeiting_versus_monetary_policy/page/full/|title=Counterfeiting Versus Monetary Policy|work=townhall.com}}</ref>

In his autobiography, Williams cited [[Frederick Bastiat]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Milton Friedman]] as influences that led him to become a libertarian.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=83}}</ref> Williams praised [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' as "one of the best defenses and explanations of capitalism one is likely to read."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/readings.html | work=Walter Williams Homepage | title=Book Recommendations| last=Williams|first=Walter E.}}(ret'd. Dec 30, 2011)</ref>

Aside from authoring his weekly columns, Williams was a frequent guest host for [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s [[The Rush Limbaugh Show|radio program]] when Limbaugh was away traveling. In 2009, Greg Ransom, a writer for the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], ranked Williams as the third-most important "[[Friedrich Hayek|Hayekian]]" Public Intellectual in America, behind only [[Thomas Sowell]] and [[John Stossel]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Top 30 Hayekian Public Intellectuals In America | url = http://blog.mises.org/9727/the-top-30-hayekian-public-intellectuals-in-america/ | author = Ransom, Greg | date = April 2, 2009 | access-date = November 16, 2010 | work = Mises Economics Blog, [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] }}</ref> ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' called Williams "one of the country's leading libertarian voices."<ref name=Reason/>

== Personal life and death ==
Williams lived in [[Devon, Pennsylvania]], since 1973.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=94}}</ref> He was married to Connie (née Taylor) from 1960 until her death in 2007. They had one daughter, Devyn.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rockwell |first1=Lew |title=Connie Williams, RIP |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/018108.html |website=LewRockwell.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101143848/http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/018108.html |archive-date=January 1, 2008 |date=December 30, 2007}}</ref> When he began teaching at George Mason, he rented a cheap hotel room in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], where he lived from Tuesdays through Thursdays around his teaching schedule.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=113}}</ref> Williams was a cousin of former [[NBA]] player [[Julius Erving]].<ref name="big classroom">{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=John J. |title=Walter Williams's Big Classroom |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2011/04/04/walter-williamss-big-classroom/ |website=National Review |access-date=June 3, 2020 |date=April 4, 2011}}</ref>

Williams served on the board of directors of [[Media General]], parent company of the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', from 2001 until his retirement from the board in 2011. He was also chairman of the company's [[audit committee]].

Williams died in his car on December 1, 2020, at age 84, shortly after teaching a class at George Mason University.<ref name="Boudreaux"/> His daughter said that he suffered from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and [[hypertension]].<ref name = NYT/>
