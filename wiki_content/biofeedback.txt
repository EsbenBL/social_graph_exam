'''Biofeedback''' is the process of gaining greater awareness of many [[physiology|physiological]] functions of one's own body, commercially by using electronic or other instruments, and with a goal of being able to manipulate the body's systems at will. Humans conduct biofeedback naturally all the time, at varied levels of consciousness and intentionality. Biofeedback and the biofeedback loop can also be thought of as self-regulation.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Durand | first1 = Vincent Mark | last2 = Barlow | first2 = David | name-list-style = vanc |title=Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2009 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mo_q4zFVNo4C&pg=PA331 331] |isbn=978-0-495-09556-9 }}</ref><ref name = AAPB>{{cite news|publisher=[[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]]|title=What is Biofeedback|url=http://www.aapb.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1|others=(See bottom of page.)|date=18 May 2008|access-date=2015-03-05}}</ref>  Some of the processes that can be controlled include [[Electroencephalography|brainwaves]], [[muscle tone]], [[skin conductance]], [[heart rate]] and [[pain]] perception.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = deCharms RC, Maeda F, Glover GH, Ludlow D, Pauly JM, Soneji D, Gabrieli JD, Mackey SC | display-authors = 6 | title = Control over brain activation and pain learned by using real-time functional MRI | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 51 | pages = 18626–31 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16352728 | pmc = 1311906 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0505210102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10218626D | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Biofeedback may be used to improve health, performance, and the physiological changes that often occur in conjunction with changes to thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Recently, technologies have provided assistance with intentional biofeedback.  Eventually, these changes may be maintained without the use of extra equipment, for no equipment is necessarily required to practice biofeedback.<ref name = AAPB/>

Meta-analysis of different biofeedback treatments have shown some benefit in the treatment of [[headache]]s and [[migraine]]s and [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], though most of the studies in these meta-analyses did not make comparisons with alternative treatments.<ref>Nestoriuc Y, Martin A.

==Information coded biofeedback==
'''Information coded biofeedback''' is an evolving form and methodology in the field of biofeedback.  Its uses may be applied in the areas of health, wellness and awareness.  Biofeedback has its modern conventional roots in the early 1970s.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Barbara B | name-list-style = vanc |title=New mind, new body: Bio-feedback; new directions for the mind|url=https://archive.org/details/newmindnewbody00barb|url-access=registration|date=January 1, 1975|isbn=9780553128741 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Karlins|first1=Marvins | name-list-style = vanc |title=Biofeedback|date=January 1, 1973|isbn=978-0446760188}}</ref>

Over the years, biofeedback as a discipline and a technology has continued to mature and express new versions of the method with novel interpretations in areas utilizing the [[Electromyography|electromyograph]], electrodermograph, [[electroencephalograph]] and [[electrocardiogram]] among others.
The concept of biofeedback is based on the fact that a wide variety of ongoing intrinsic natural functions of the organism occur at a level of awareness generally called the "unconscious".<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  The biofeedback process is designed to interface with select aspects of these "unconscious" processes.

The definition reads:
Biofeedback is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance. Precise instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. These instruments rapidly and accurately feed back information to the user. The presentation of this information—often in conjunction with changes in thinking, emotions, and behavior—supports desired physiological changes. Over time, these changes can endure without continued use of an instrument.<ref name="AAPB" />

A more simple definition could be:
Biofeedback is the process of gaining greater awareness of many physiological functions primarily using instruments that provide information on the activity of those same systems, with a goal of being able to manipulate them at will.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durand |first1=Vincent Mark|last2=Barlow |first2= David| name-list-style = vanc |title=Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach|date=2009|location=Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-09556-9|page=331}}</ref> (Emphasis added by author.)

In both of these definitions, a cardinal feature of the concept is the association of the "will" with the result of a new cognitive "learning" skill.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Barbara B | name-list-style = vanc |title=Biological Awareness as a State of Consciousness|journal=Journal of Altered States of Consciousness|date=1975|volume=2|issue=1–14}}</ref> Some examine this concept and do not necessarily ascribe it simply to a willful acquisition of a new learned skill but also extend the dynamics into the realms of a behavioristic conditioning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis|first1=Garnet| name-list-style = vanc |title=The Unconscious and Its Role in Biofeedback Processes|journal=Center of International Studies|date=November 29, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Sherlin LH, Arns M, Lubar J, Heinrich H, Kerson C, Strehl U, Sterman MB | title = Neurofeedback and Basic Learning Theory: Implications for Research and Practice. | journal = Journal of Neurotherapy | date = October 2011 | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–304 | doi = 10.1080/10874208.2011.623089 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Behaviorism contends that it is possible to change the actions and functions of an organism by exposing it to a number of conditions or influences.  Key to the concept is not only that the functions are unconscious but that conditioning processes themselves may be unconscious to the organism.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Skinner BF |title=About Behaviorism|date=1974|isbn=978-0-394-71618-3}}</ref>  Information coded biofeedback relies primarily on the behavior conditioning aspect of biofeedback in promoting significant changes in the functioning of the organism.

The principle of "information" is both complex and, in part, controversial. The term itself is derived from the Latin verb informare which means literally "to bring into form or shape".  The meaning of "information" is largely affected by the context of usage.  Probably the simplest and perhaps most insightful definition of "information" was given by Gregory Bateson—"Information is news of change" or another as "the difference that makes a difference".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bateson|first1=Gregory| name-list-style = vanc |title=Form, Substance, and Difference, in Steps to an Ecology of Mind|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1972}}</ref>   Information may also be thought of as "any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Claude|first1=Shannon| name-list-style = vanc |title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|date=1949}}</ref>  Recognizing the inherent [[complexity]] of an organism, information coded biofeedback applies algorithmic calculations in a [[stochastic]] approach to identify significant probabilities in a limited set of possibilities.

==Sensor modalities==

===Electromyograph===
[[File:Muscle Whistler with EMG surface electrodes (1971).jpg|thumb|The "Muscle Whistler", shown here with surface EMG electrodes, was an early biofeedback device developed by [[Harry Garland]] and [[Roger Melen]] in 1971.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = Popular Electronics | title = Build the Muscle Whistler | last1 = Garland | first1 = Harry | last2 = Melen | first2 = Roger | name-list-style = vanc | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 60–62 | year = 1971 }}</ref><ref name="Whistler"/>]]
An [[electromyograph]] ([[Electromyography|EMG]]) uses surface electrodes to detect muscle action potentials from underlying skeletal muscles that initiate muscle contraction. Clinicians record the surface electromyogram (SEMG) using one or more active electrodes that are placed over a target muscle and a reference electrode that is placed within six inches of either active. The SEMG is measured in [[microvolt]]s (millionths of a volt).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Tassinary LG, Cacioppo JT, Vanman EJ | date = 2007 | chapter = The skeletomotor system: Surface electromyography. | veditors = Cacioppo JT, Tassinary LG, Berntson GG | title = Handbook of psychophysiology | edition = 3rd | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Florimond V | date = 2009 | title = Basics of surface electromyography applied to physical rehabilitation and biomechanics | location = Montreal | publisher = Thought Technology Ltd. }}</ref>

In addition to surface electrodes, clinicians may also insert wires or needles intramuscularly to record an EMG signal. While this is more painful and often costly, the signal is more reliable since surface electrodes pick up cross talk from nearby muscles.  The use of surface electrodes is also limited to superficial muscles, making the intramuscular approach beneficial to access signals from deeper muscles. The electrical activity picked up by the electrodes is recorded and displayed in the same fashion as the surface electrodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electromyography (EMG)|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/electromyography_emg_92,P07656/|work=Johns Hopkins Medicine|access-date=2014-03-18}}</ref> Prior to placing surface electrodes, the skin is normally shaved, cleaned and exfoliated to get the best signal. Raw EMG signals resemble noise (electrical signal not coming from the muscle of interest) and the voltage fluctuates, therefore they are processed normally in three ways: rectification, filtering, and integration. This processing allows for a unified signal that is then able to be compared to other signals using the same processing techniques.

Biofeedback therapists use EMG biofeedback when treating [[anxiety]] and [[worry]], [[chronic pain]], computer-related disorder, [[essential hypertension]], headache (migraine, mixed headache, and [[tension-type headache]]), [[low back pain]], [[physical rehabilitation]] ([[cerebral palsy]], incomplete spinal cord lesions, and [[stroke]]), [[temporomandibular joint dysfunction]] (TMD), [[torticollis]], and [[fecal incontinence]], [[urinary incontinence]], and [[pelvic pain]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Peper E, Gibney KH | year = 2006 | title = Muscle biofeedback at the computer: A manual to prevent repetitive strain injury (RSI) by taking the guesswork out of assessment, monitoring, and training | location = Amersfoort, The Netherlands | publisher = BFE | url = http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_35_2_biofeedback.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101019023511/http://aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_35_2_biofeedback.pdf | archive-date = 2010-10-19 }}</ref><ref name = Yucha2008>{{cite book | vauthors = Yucha C, Montgomery D | year = 2008 | title = Evidence-based practice in biofeedback and neurofeedback | location =Wheat Ridge, CO | publisher = AAPB | url = http://www.isnr.org/uploads/EvidenceBasedYuchaMontgomeryW.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101009135554/http://isnr.org/uploads/EvidenceBasedYuchaMontgomeryW.pdf | archive-date = 2010-10-09 }}</ref> Physical therapists have also used EMG biofeedback for evaluating muscle activation and providing feedback for their patients.<ref name="Whistler">{{cite journal | vauthors = Forward E | title = Patient evaluation with an audio electromyogram monitor: "The Muscle Whistler" | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 402–3 | date = April 1972 | pmid = 5012359 | doi = 10.1093/ptj/52.4.402 }}</ref>

===Feedback thermometer===
A feedback thermometer detects skin temperature with a [[thermistor]] (a temperature-sensitive resistor) that is usually attached to a finger or toe and measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Skin temperature mainly reflects [[arteriole]] diameter. Hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by separate mechanisms, and their regulation involves different skills.<ref name="Andreassi, J.

Biofeedback therapists use temperature biofeedback when treating chronic pain, [[edema]], headache (migraine and tension-type headache), essential hypertension, [[Raynaud's phenomenon|Raynaud's disease]], anxiety, and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].<ref name = Yucha2008/>

===Electrodermograph===
An electrodermograph (EDG) measures skin electrical activity directly (skin conductance and skin potential) and indirectly (skin resistance) using electrodes placed over the digits or hand and wrist. Orienting responses to unexpected stimuli, arousal and worry, and cognitive activity can increase [[eccrine]] sweat gland activity, increasing the conductivity of the skin for electric current.<ref name="Andreassi, J. L. 2007"/>
 
In ''skin conductance'', an electrodermograph imposes an imperceptible current across the skin and measures how easily it travels through the skin. When anxiety raises the level of sweat in a sweat duct, conductance increases. Skin conductance is measured in microsiemens (millionths of a [[siemens (unit)|siemens]]). In ''skin potential'', a therapist places an active electrode over an active site (e.g., the palmar surface of the hand) and a reference electrode over a relatively inactive site (e.g., forearm). Skin potential is the voltage that develops between eccrine sweat glands and internal tissues and is measured in millivolts (thousandths of a volt). In ''skin resistance'', also called [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), an electrodermograph imposes a current across the skin and measures the amount of opposition it encounters. Skin resistance is measured in kΩ (thousands of ohms).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Dawson ME, Schell AM, Filion DL | date = 2007 | chapter = The electrodermal system. | veditors = Cacioppo JT, Tassinary LG, Berntson GG | title = Handbook of psychophysiology | edition = 3rd | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>

===Electroencephalograph===
An [[electroencephalograph]] (EEG) measures the electrical activation of the brain from scalp sites located over the human cortex.  The EEG shows the amplitude of electrical activity at each cortical site, the amplitude and relative power of various wave forms at each site, and the degree to which each cortical site fires in conjunction with other cortical sites (coherence and symmetry).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kropotov JD | date = 2009 | title = Quantitative EEG, event-related potentials and neurotherapy. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher = Academic Press }}</ref>

The EEG uses precious metal electrodes to detect a voltage between at least two electrodes located on the scalp. The EEG records both excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that largely occur in dendrites in pyramidal cells located in macrocolumns, several millimeters in diameter, in the upper cortical layers. [[Neurofeedback]] monitors both slow and fast cortical potentials.<ref name="Thompson, M. 2003">{{cite book | vauthors = Thompson M, Thompson L | date = 2003 | title = The biofeedback book: An introduction to basic concepts in applied psychophysiology. | location = Wheat Ridge, CO | publisher = Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback }}</ref>

Slow cortical potentials are gradual changes in the membrane potentials of cortical dendrites that last from 300 ms to several seconds. These potentials include the [[contingent negative variation]] (CNV), [[readiness potential]], [[movement-related potentials]] (MRPs), and [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] and [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] potentials.<ref name="Stern, R. M. 2001">{{cite book | vauthors = Stern RM, Ray WJ, Quigley KS | date = 2001 | title = Psychophysiological recording | url = https://archive.org/details/psychophysiologi00robe | url-access = registration | edition = 2nd | location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press }}</ref>

Fast cortical potentials range from 0.5&nbsp;Hz to 100&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = LaVaque TJ | date = 2003 | chapter = Neurofeedback, Neurotherapy, and quantitative EEG | veditors = Moss D, McGrady A, Davies T, Wickramasekera I | title = Handbook of mind-body medicine for primary care | pages = 123–136 | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | publisher = Sage }}</ref> The main frequency ranges include delta, theta, alpha, the sensorimotor rhythm, low beta, high beta, and gamma. The thresholds or boundaries defining the frequency ranges vary considerably among professionals. Fast cortical potentials can be described by their predominant frequencies, but also by whether they are synchronous or asynchronous wave forms. Synchronous wave forms occur at regular periodic intervals, whereas asynchronous wave forms are irregular.<ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"/>

The synchronous [[delta rhythm]] ranges from 0.5 to 3.5&nbsp;Hz. Delta is the dominant frequency from ages 1 to 2, and is associated in adults with deep sleep and brain pathology like trauma and tumors, and learning disability.

The synchronous [[theta rhythm]] ranges from 4 to 7&nbsp;Hz. Theta is the dominant frequency in healthy young children and is associated with drowsiness or starting to sleep, REM sleep, hypnagogic imagery (intense imagery experienced before the onset of sleep), hypnosis, attention, and processing of cognitive and perceptual information.

The synchronous [[alpha rhythm]] ranges from 8 to 13&nbsp;Hz and is defined by its waveform and not by its frequency. Alpha activity can be observed in about 75% of awake, relaxed individuals and is replaced by low-amplitude desynchronized beta activity during movement, complex problem-solving, and visual focusing. This phenomenon is called alpha blocking.

The synchronous [[sensorimotor rhythm]] (SMR) ranges from 12 to 15&nbsp;Hz and is located over the sensorimotor cortex (central sulcus). The sensorimotor rhythm is associated with the inhibition of movement and reduced muscle tone.

The [[beta rhythm]] consists of asynchronous waves and can be divided into low beta and high beta ranges (13–21&nbsp;Hz and 20–32&nbsp;Hz). Low beta is associated with activation and focused thinking. High beta is associated with anxiety, [[hypervigilance]], [[panic]], peak performance, and [[worry]].

EEG activity from 36 to 44&nbsp;Hz is also referred to as gamma. Gamma activity is associated with perception of meaning and meditative awareness.<ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"/><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Steriade M | date =  2005 | chapter = Cellular substrates of brain rhythms. | veditors = Niedermeyer E, Lopes da Silva F | title = Electroencephalography: Basic principles, clinical applications, and related fields | edition = 5th | location = Philadelphia | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins }}</ref><ref name="Shaffer">{{cite book | vauthors = Shaffer F, Moss D | date = 2006 | chapter = Biofeedback | veditors = Yuan CS, Bieber EJ, Bauer BA | title = Textbook of complementary and alternative medicine | edition = 2nd | pages = 291–312 | location = Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK | publisher = Informa Healthcare }}</ref>

===Photoplethysmograph===
[[File:EmWave2, powering up.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|An ''emWave2'' photoplethysmograph for monitoring heart rate variability]]

[[File:Photoplethysmograph - Biofeedback HRV with ear sensor.jpg|thumb|180px|upright| ''Stone'' computer-based photoplethysmograph with ear sensor]]

A [[photoplethysmograph]] (PPG) measures the relative blood flow through a digit using a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor attached by a Velcro band to the fingers or to the temple to monitor the [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal artery]]. An infrared light source is transmitted through or reflected off the tissue, detected by a [[phototransistor]], and quantified in arbitrary units. Less light is absorbed when blood flow is greater, increasing the intensity of light reaching the sensor.<ref name="Combatalade, D. 2009">Combatalade, D. (2009). ''Basics of heart rate variability applied to psychophysiology''. Montreal, Canada: Thought Technology Ltd.</ref>

A photoplethysmograph can measure blood volume pulse (BVP), which is the phasic change in blood volume with each heartbeat, heart rate, and [[heart rate variability]] (HRV), which consists of beat-to-beat differences in intervals between successive heartbeats.<ref name="Lehrer, P.

A photoplethysmograph can provide useful feedback when temperature feedback shows minimal change. This is because the PPG sensor is more sensitive than a thermistor to minute blood flow changes.<ref name="Shaffer" />  Biofeedback therapists can use a photoplethysmograph to supplement temperature biofeedback when treating chronic pain, edema, headache (migraine and tension-type headache), essential hypertension, Raynaud's disease, anxiety, and stress.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

===Electrocardiogram===
The [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) uses electrodes placed on the torso, wrists, or legs, to measure the electrical activity of the heart and measures the [[interbeat interval]] (distances between successive [[R-wave]] peaks in the [[QRS complex]]). The interbeat interval, divided into 60 seconds, determines the heart rate at that moment.

===Pneumograph===
A [[pneumograph]] or respiratory strain gauge uses a flexible sensor band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback about the relative expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure [[respiratory rate]] (the number of breaths per minute).<ref name="Stern, R. M. 2001"/> Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional breathing patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional breathing patterns include [[clavicular breathing]] (breathing that primarily relies on the [[external intercostals]] and the [[accessory muscles of respiration]] to inflate the lungs), [[reverse breathing]] (breathing where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and [[thoracic breathing]] (shallow breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional breathing behaviors include [[apnea]] (suspension of breathing), gasping, sighing, and wheezing.<ref name="Peper, E. 2008">{{cite book | vauthors = Peper E, Tylova H, Gibney KH, Harvey R, Combatalade D | date = 2008 | title = Biofeedback mastery: An experiential teaching and self-training manual | location = Wheat Ridge, CO | publisher = Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback }}</ref>

===Capnometer===
A [[capnometer]] or [[capnograph]] uses an infrared detector to measure end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} (the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in expired air at the end of expiration) exhaled through the nostril into a latex tube. The average value of end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} for a resting adult is 5% ({{convert|36|torr|kPa|abbr=on|disp=or}}). A capnometer is a sensitive index of the quality of patient breathing. Shallow, rapid, and effortful breathing lowers {{chem|CO|2}}, while deep, slow, effortless breathing increases it.<ref name="Peper, E. 2008"/>

===Rheoencephalograph===

[[Rheoencephalography]] (REG), or brain blood flow biofeedback, is a biofeedback technique of a conscious control of blood flow. An electronic device called a [[rheoencephalograph]] [from Greek rheos stream, anything flowing, from rhein to flow] is utilized in brain blood flow biofeedback. Electrodes are attached to the skin at certain points on the head and permit the device to measure continuously the electrical conductivity of the tissues of structures located between the electrodes. The brain blood flow technique is based on non-invasive method of measuring bio-impedance. Changes in bio-impedance are generated by blood volume and blood flow and registered by a rheographic device.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Tokarev VE | title = A Rheoencephalogram (REG) Variability System Based on ISKRA-226 Personal Computer | conference = Institute for Complex Problem of Hygiene Healthcare Conference | location = Novokuznetsk, Russia | date = 1989 | pages = 115–116 }}</ref> The pulsative bio-impedance changes directly reflect the total blood flow of the deep structures of brain due to high frequency impedance measurements.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Tokarev VE | title = Regulatory Mechanisms of Physiological Systems During REG Biofeedback | conference = 25th Annual Meeting of Association of Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | location = Atlanta, USA | date =  1994 }}</ref>

===Hemoencephalography===
[[Hemoencephalography]] or HEG biofeedback is a functional [[infrared]] imaging technique. As its name describes, it measures the differences in the color of light reflected back through the scalp based on the relative amount of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood in the brain. Research continues to determine its reliability, validity, and clinical applicability. HEG is used to treat [[ADHD]] and migraine, and for research.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Toomim H, Carmen J | chapter = Homoencephalography: Photon-based blood flow neurofeedback. | veditors = Budzynski TH, Budzynski HK, Evans JR, Abarbanel A | date = 2009 | title = Introduction to quantitative EEG and neurofeedback | edition = 2nd | location = Burlington, MA | publisher = Academic Press }}</ref>

==Applications==

===Urinary incontinence===
Mowrer detailed the use of a bedwetting alarm that sounds when children urinate while asleep. This simple biofeedback device can quickly teach children to wake up when their bladders are full and to contract the urinary sphincter and relax the detrusor muscle, preventing further urine release. Through classical conditioning, sensory feedback from a full bladder replaces the alarm and allows children to continue sleeping without urinating.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Mowrer OH | date = 1960 | title = Learning theory and behavior | url = https://archive.org/details/learningtheorybe00mowr | location = New York | publisher = Wiley }}</ref>

===Fecal incontinence, constipation and anismus===
Biofeedback is a treatment for [[anismus]] (paradoxical contraction of puborectalis during defecation). This therapy directly evolved from the investigation [[anorectal manometry]] where a probe that can record pressure is placed in the anal canal. Biofeedback therapy is also a commonly used and researched therapy for fecal incontinence, but the benefits are uncertain.<ref name="Norton 2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton C, Cody JD | title = Biofeedback and/or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = CD002111 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22786479 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3 }}</ref> Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered. It is also unknown if one type has benefits over another.<ref name="Norton 2012" /> The aims have been described as to enhance either the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), rectal sensitivity (by discrimination of progressively smaller volumes of a rectal balloon and promptly contracting the [[external anal sphincter]] (EAS)), or the strength and endurance of the EAS contraction. Three general types of biofeedback have been described, though they are not mutually exclusive, with many protocols combining these elements.<ref name="Norton 2012" /> Similarly there is variance of the length of both the individual sessions and the overall length of the training, and if home exercises are performed in addition and how. In rectal sensitivity training, a balloon is placed in the rectum, and is gradually distended until there is a sensation of rectal filling. Successively smaller volume reinflations of the balloon aim to help the person detect rectal distension at a lower threshold, giving more time to contract the EAS and prevent incontinence, or to journey to the toilet. Alternatively, in those with urge incontinence/ rectal hypersensitivity, training is aimed at teaching the person to tolerate progressively larger volumes. Strength training may involve electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, manometric pressures, intra-anal EMG, or [[endoanal ultrasound]]. One of these measures are used to relay the muscular activity or anal canal pressure during anal sphincter exercise. Performance and progress can be monitored in this manner. Co-ordination training involves the placing of 3 balloons, in the rectum and in the upper and lower anal canal. The rectal balloon is inflated to trigger the RAIR, an event often followed by incontinence. Co-ordination training aims to teach voluntary contraction of EAS when the RAIR occurs (i.e. when there is rectal distension).<ref name="Norton 2012" /> 

There is some research that shows the effects of biofeedback on irritable bowel syndrome. However, there may be some adverse effects when using these devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Joshua Z|last2=Brignall|first2=Matthew|last3=Hamilton|first3=Michelle|last4=Beardsley|first4=Jennifer|last5=Batson|first5=Richard D|last6=Hawrelak|first6=Jason|last7=Lichtenstein|first7=Brad|last8=Johnston|first8=Bradley C|date=2019-11-12|editor-last=Cochrane IBD Group|title=Biofeedback for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome|url=https://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD012530.pub2|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012530.pub2|pmc=6848969|pmid=31713856}}</ref>

[[Hans Berger|Berger]] (1924) published the first human EEG data. He recorded electrical potentials from his son Klaus's scalp. At first he believed that he had discovered the physical mechanism for telepathy but was disappointed that the electromagnetic variations disappear only millimeters away from the skull. (He did continue to believe in telepathy throughout his life, however, having had a particularly confirming event regarding his sister). He viewed the EEG as analogous to the ECG and introduced the term ''elektenkephalogram''. He believed that the EEG had diagnostic and therapeutic promise in measuring the impact of clinical interventions. Berger showed that these potentials were not due to scalp muscle contractions. He first identified the alpha rhythm, which he called the Berger rhythm, and later identified the beta rhythm and [[sleep spindles]]. He demonstrated that alterations in consciousness are associated with changes in the EEG and associated the beta rhythm with alertness. He described interictal activity (EEG potentials between seizures) and recorded a partial complex seizure in 1933. Finally, he performed the first QEEG, which is the measurement of the signal strength of EEG frequencies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger H | year = 1920 | title = Ueber das elektroenkephalogramm des menschen | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten | volume = 87 | pages = 527–570 | doi = 10.1007/BF01797193 | s2cid = 10835361 | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-002A-5DE0-7 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

Kleitman has been recognized as the "Father of American sleep research" for his seminal work in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles, [[circadian rhythms]], the sleep patterns of different age groups, and the effects of [[sleep deprivation]].

Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be [[operant]]ly conditioned. He published an influential article in ''Psychology Today'' that summarized research that showed that subjects could learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1&nbsp;Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant "alpha state" characterized as an "alert calmness." These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the EEG correlates of meditative states.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kamiya J | date = 1969 | chapter = [[Operant]] control of the EEG alpha rhythm. | veditors = Tart C | title = Altered states of consciousness | location = NY | publisher =  Wiley }}</ref>

Brown (1970) demonstrated the clinical use of alpha-theta biofeedback. In research designed to identify the subjective states associated with EEG rhythms, she trained subjects to increase the abundance of alpha, beta, and theta activity using visual feedback and recorded their subjective experiences when the amplitude of these frequency bands increased. She also helped popularize biofeedback by publishing a series of books, including ''New Mind, New body'' (1974) and ''Stress and the Art of Biofeedback'' (1977).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brown B | date = 1974 | title = New mind, new body | url = https://archive.org/details/newmindnewbody0000unse | url-access = registration | location = New York | publisher = Harper & Row | isbn = 9780060105495 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brown B | date = 1977 | title = Stress and the art of biofeedback | location = New York | publisher = Harper & Row }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brown B | date = 1980 | title = Supermind: The ultimate energy | location = New York | publisher = Harper & Row }}</ref>

Green and Green (1986) investigated voluntary control of internal states by individuals like Swami Rama and American Indian medicine man Rolling Thunder both in India and at the [[Menninger Foundation]]. They brought portable biofeedback equipment to India and monitored practitioners as they demonstrated self-regulation. A film containing footage from their investigations was released as ''Biofeedback: The Yoga of the West'' (1974). They developed alpha-theta training at the Menninger Foundation from the 1960s to the 1990s. They hypothesized that theta states allow access to unconscious memories and increase the impact of prepared images or suggestions. Their alpha-theta research fostered Peniston's development of an alpha-theta addiction protocol.<ref name="Green, E. 1977">{{cite book | vauthors = Green E, Green A | date = 1977 | title = Beyond biofeedback | location = San Francisco | publisher = Delacorte Press }}</ref>

Sterman (1972) showed that cats and human subjects could be operantly trained to increase the amplitude of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex. He demonstrated that SMR production protects cats against drug-induced generalized seizures (tonic-clonic seizures involving loss of consciousness) and reduces the frequency of seizures in humans diagnosed with [[epilepsy]]. He found that his SMR protocol, which uses visual and auditory EEG biofeedback, normalizes their EEGs (SMR increases while theta and beta decrease toward normal values) even during sleep. Sterman also co-developed the Sterman-Kaiser (SKIL) QEEG database.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterman MB | title = Neurophysiologic and clinical studies of sensorimotor EEG biofeedback training: some effects on epilepsy | journal = Seminars in Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 507–25 | date = November 1973 | pmid = 4770578 }}</ref>

===Musculoskeletal system===
[[Edmund Jacobson|Jacobson]] (1930) developed hardware to measure EMG voltages over time, showed that cognitive activity (like imagery) affects EMG levels, introduced the deep relaxation method [[Progressive muscle relaxation|Progressive Relaxation]], and wrote ''Progressive Relaxation'' (1929) and ''You Must Relax'' (1934). He prescribed daily Progressive Relaxation practice to treat diverse psychophysiological disorders like hypertension.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Jacobson E | date = 1938 | title = Progressive relaxation | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}</ref>

"While Marinacci used EMG to treat neuromuscular disorders, his colleagues used the EMG only for diagnosis. They were unable to recognize its potential as a teaching tool even when the evidence stared them in the face! Many electromyographers who performed nerve conduction studies used visual and auditory feedback to reduce interference when a patient recruited too many motor units. Even though they used EMG biofeedback to guide the patient to relax so that clean diagnostic EMG tests could be recorded, they were unable to envision EMG biofeedback treatment of motor disorders."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peper E, Shaffer F | title = Biofeedback history: An alternative view. | journal = Biofeedback | date = Winter 2010| volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 142–147 | doi = 10.5298/1081-5937-38.4.03 }}</ref>

Whatmore and Kohli (1968) introduced the concept of dysponesis (misplaced effort) to explain how functional disorders (where body activity is disturbed) develop.

Engel and Chism (1967) operantly trained subjects to decrease, increase, and then decrease their heart rates (this was analogous to ON-OFF-ON EEG training). He then used this approach to teach patients to control their rate of [[premature ventricular contractions]] (PVCs), where the ventricles contract too soon.

Schwartz (1971, 1972) examined whether specific patterns of cardiovascular activity are easier to learn than others due to biological constraints.

Schultz and Luthe (1969) developed [[Autogenic Training]], which is a deep relaxation exercise derived from hypnosis. This procedure combines passive volition with imagery in a series of three treatment procedures (standard Autogenic exercises, Autogenic neutralization, and Autogenic meditation). Clinicians at the Menninger Foundation coupled an abbreviated list of standard exercises with thermal biofeedback to create autogenic biofeedback.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Schultz JH, Luthe W | date = 1969 | title = Autogenic therapy: Autogenic methods. | location = New York | publisher = Grune & Stratton }}</ref> Luthe (1973) also published a series of six volumes titled ''Autogenic therapy''.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Luthe W | date = 1973 | title = Autogenic therapy: Treatment with autogenic neutralization | location = New York | publisher = Grune & Stratton }}</ref>

Fahrion and colleagues (1986) reported on an 18–26 session treatment program for hypertensive patients. The Menninger program combined breathing modification, autogenic biofeedback for the hands and feet, and frontal EMG training. The authors reported that 89% of their medication patients discontinued or reduced medication by one-half while significantly lowering blood pressure.

Freedman and colleagues (1991) demonstrated that hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by different mechanisms. The primary hand-warming mechanism is [[beta-adrenergic]] (hormonal), while the main hand-cooling mechanism is alpha-adrenergic and involves sympathetic C-fibers. This contradicts the traditional view that finger blood flow is controlled exclusively by sympathetic C-fibers. The traditional model asserts that, when firing is slow, hands warm; when firing is rapid, hands cool. Freedman and colleagues' studies support the view that hand-warming and hand-cooling represent entirely different skills.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freedman RR, Keegan D, Migály P, Galloway MP, Mayes M | title = Plasma catecholamines during behavioral treatments for Raynaud's disease | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–9 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1924655 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199107000-00008 | s2cid = 41125990 }}</ref>

The opposite happens when blood pressure goes down. Because it takes about 5 seconds for blood pressure to change after changes in heart rate (think of different amounts of blood flowing through the same sized tube), the baroreflex produces a rhythm in heart rate with a period of about 10 seconds. Another rhythm in heart rate is caused by respiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia), such that heart rate rises during inhalation and falls during exhalation. During HRV biofeedback, these two reflexes stimulate each other, stimulating resonance properties of the cardiovascular system caused by the inherent rhythm in the baroreflex,<ref name="Vaschillo_2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vaschillo EG, Vaschillo B, Lehrer PM | title = Characteristics of resonance in heart rate variability stimulated by biofeedback | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–42 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16838124 | doi = 10.1007/s10484-006-9009-3 | s2cid = 2451332 }}</ref> and thus causing very big oscillations in heart rate and large-amplitude stimulation of the baroreflex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehrer PM, Vaschillo E, Vaschillo B, Lu SE, Eckberg DL, Edelberg R, Shih WJ, Lin Y, Kuusela TA, Tahvanainen KU, Hamer RM | display-authors = 6 | title = Heart rate variability biofeedback increases baroreflex gain and peak expiratory flow | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 796–805 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14508023 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000089200.81962.19 | s2cid = 5741194 }}</ref> Thus HRV biofeedback exercises the baroreflex, and strengthens it.

===Pain===
In 2021, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended against the use of biofeedback in managing chronic pain in adults.<ref name="ReferenceD">Chronic pain (primary and secondary) in over 16s: assessment of all chronic pain and management of chronic primary pain. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. NICE guideline [NG193]. Published date: 07 April 2021</ref>

====Chronic back pain====
Newton-John, Spense, and Schotte (1994) compared the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Electromyographic Biofeedback (EMG-Biofeedback) for 44 participants with chronic low back pain. Newton-John et al. (1994) split the participants into two groups, then measured the intensity of pain, the participants' perceived disability, and depression before treatment, after treatment and again six months later. Newton-John et al.(1994) found no significant differences between the group which received CBT and the group which received EMG-Biofeedback. This seems to indicate that biofeedback is as effective as CBT in chronic low back pain. Comparing the results of the groups before treatment and after treatment, indicates that EMG-Biofeedback reduced pain, disability, and depression as much as by half.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton-John TR, Spence SH, Schotte D | title = Cognitive-behavioural therapy versus EMG biofeedback in the treatment of chronic low back pain | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 691–7 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7654161 | doi = 10.1016/0005-7967(95)00008-l }}</ref>

====Muscle pain====
Budzynski and Stoyva (1969) showed that EMG biofeedback could reduce [[frontalis muscle]] (forehead) contraction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Budzynski TH, Stoyva JM | title = An instrument for producing deep muscle relaxation by means of analog information feedback | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 231–7 | year = 1969 | pmid = 16795225 | pmc = 1311072 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1969.2-231 }}</ref> They demonstrated in 1973 that analog (proportional) and binary (ON or OFF) visual EMG biofeedback were equally helpful in lowering masseter SEMG levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bydyznski T, Stoyva J | title = An electromyographic feedback technique for teaching voluntary relaxation of the masseter muscle | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–9 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4509482 | doi = 10.1177/00220345730520010201 | s2cid = 34753419 }}</ref>

====Tension headache====
Budzynski, Stoyva, Adler, and Mullaney (1973) reported that auditory frontalis EMG biofeedback combined with home relaxation practice lowered tension headache frequency and frontalis EMG levels. A control group that received noncontingent (false) auditory feedback did not improve. This study helped make the frontalis muscle the placement-of-choice in EMG assessment and treatment of headache and other psychophysiological disorders.<ref>Budzynski, T. H., Stoyva, J. M., Adler, C.

====Migraine====
Sargent, Green, and Walters (1972, 1973) demonstrated that hand-warming could abort migraines and that autogenic biofeedback training could reduce headache activity. The early Menninger migraine studies, although methodologically weak (no pretreatment baselines, control groups, or random assignment to conditions), strongly influenced migraine treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sargent JD, Green EE, Walters ED | title = The use of autogenic feedback training in a pilot study of migraine and tension headaches | journal = Headache | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 120–4 | date = October 1972 | pmid = 5075461 | doi = 10.1111/j.1526-4610.1972.hed1203120.x | s2cid = 36834854 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sargent JD, Walters ED, Green EE | title = Psychosomatic self-regulation of migraine headaches | journal = Seminars in Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 415–28 | date = November 1973 | pmid = 4770571 }}</ref>

=== Anxiety Management ===

A [[Meta-analysis|meta analysis]] by the ''University of Cambridge'' compiles previous studies on biofeedback being used in the management and control of anxiety. In this article the previous studies are evaluated for validity and relevance into how they attribute to the effectiveness of biofeedback being used in tandem with other forms of therapy to produce reduced and manageable anxiety. This analysis concluded that the use of biofeedback in the form of [[Heart rate variability|HRV]] monitoring produced self reported large reduction of anxiety as a consistent finding in the studies that were a part of the meta analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goessl|first1=V.

===Research===
Moss, LeVaque, and Hammond (2004) observed that "Biofeedback and neurofeedback seem to offer the kind of evidence-based practice that the healthcare establishment is demanding."<ref>{{cite book | veditors = Geyman JP, Deyon RA, Ramsey SD | date = 2000 | title = Evidence-based clinical practice: Concepts and approach | location = Boston | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Sackett DL, Straus SE, Richardson WS, Rosenberg W, Haynes RB | title = Evidence-based medicine: How to practice and teach EBM | year = 2000 | url = https://archive.org/details/evidencebasedmed00davi | url-access = registration | location = Edinburgh, New York | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | isbn = 9780443062407 }}</ref> "From the beginning biofeedback developed as a research-based approach emerging directly from laboratory research on psychophysiology and behavior therapy.

The Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) have collaborated in validating and rating treatment protocols to address questions about the clinical efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback applications, like ADHD and headache. In 2001, Donald Moss, then president of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, and Jay Gunkelman, president of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, appointed a task force to establish standards for the efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback.

The 2008 edition reviewed the efficacy of biofeedback for over 40 clinical disorders, ranging from alcoholism/substance abuse to [[vulvar vestibulitis]]. The ratings for each disorder depend on the nature of research studies available on each disorder, ranging from anecdotal reports to [[double blind]] studies with a [[control group]]. Thus, a lower rating may reflect the lack of research rather than the ineffectiveness of biofeedback for the problem.

===Efficacy===
Yucha and Montgomery's (2008) ratings are listed for the five levels of efficacy recommended by a joint Task Force and adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology (AAPB) and the International Society for Neuronal Regulation (ISNR).<ref name="LaVaque, T. J. 2002"/> From weakest to strongest, these levels include: not empirically supported, possibly efficacious, probably efficacious, efficacious, and efficacious and specific.

Level 1: '''Not empirically supported.''' This designation includes applications supported by anecdotal reports and/or case studies in non-peer-reviewed venues. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned eating disorders, immune function, [[spinal cord injury]], and [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 2: '''Possibly efficacious.''' This designation requires at least one study of sufficient statistical power with well-identified outcome measures but lacking randomized assignment to a control condition internal to the study. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned asthma, [[autism]], [[Bell palsy]], cerebral palsy, COPD, [[coronary artery disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], depression, [[erectile dysfunction]], fibromyalgia, hand dystonia, [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[PTSD]], [[repetitive strain injury]], [[respiratory failure]], stroke, [[tinnitus]], and urinary incontinence in children to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 3: '''Probably efficacious.''' This designation requires multiple observational studies, clinical studies, waitlist-controlled studies, and within subject and intrasubject replication studies that demonstrate efficacy. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned [[alcoholism]] and substance abuse, [[arthritis]], [[diabetes mellitus]], fecal disorders in children, fecal incontinence in adults, [[insomnia]], pediatric headache, [[traumatic brain injury]], urinary incontinence in males, and vulvar vestibulitis ([[vulvodynia]]) to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 4: '''Efficacious.''' This designation requires the satisfaction of six criteria:

(a) In a comparison with a no-treatment control group, alternative treatment group, or sham (placebo) control using randomized assignment, the investigational treatment is shown to be statistically significantly superior to the control condition or the investigational treatment is equivalent to a treatment of established efficacy in a study with sufficient power to detect moderate differences.

(b) The studies have been conducted with a population treated for a specific problem, for whom inclusion criteria are delineated in a reliable, operationally defined manner.

(c) The study used valid and clearly specified outcome measures related to the problem being treated.

(d) The data are subjected to appropriate data analysis.

(e) The diagnostic and treatment variables and procedures are clearly defined in a manner that permits replication of the study by independent researchers.

(f) The superiority or equivalence of the investigational treatment has been shown in at least two independent research settings.

Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, chronic pain, epilepsy, [[constipation]] (adult), headache (adult), hypertension, [[motion sickness]], [[Raynaud's disease]], and temporomandibular joint dysfunction to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 5: '''Efficacious and specific.''' The investigational treatment must be shown to be statistically superior to credible sham therapy, pill, or alternative bona fide treatment in at least two independent research settings. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned urinary incontinence (females) to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

===Criticisms===

The effects of the perception of autonomic nervous system activity was initially explored by [[George Mandler]]'s group in 1958.

'''Hinduism:'''

Biofeedback systems have been known in India and some other countries for millennia. Ancient Hindu practices like yoga and Pranayama (breathing techniques) are essentially biofeedback methods. Many yogis and sadhus have been known to exercise control over their physiological processes. In addition to recent research on Yoga, Paul Brunton, the British writer who travelled extensively in India, has written about many cases he has witnessed.

==In popular culture==
* Biofeedback data and biofeedback technology are used by Massimiliano Peretti in a contemporary art environment, the [[Amigdalae]] project.  This project explores the way in which emotional reactions filter and distort human [[perception]] and observation.  During the performance, biofeedback medical technology, such as the [[EEG]], [[body temperature]] variations, heart rate, and galvanic responses, are used to analyze an audience's emotions while they watch the video art.  Using these signals, the music changes so that the consequent sound environment simultaneously mirrors and influences the viewer's [[emotional state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kontinuita.com/ |title=under changes |publisher=Kontinuita.com |access-date=2012-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scope-art.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=102&Itemid=206 |title=Scope New York Home |publisher=Scope-art.com |access-date=2012-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145912/http://www.scope-art.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=102&Itemid=206 |archive-date=2007-10-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  More information is available at the website of the CNRS French National Center of Neural Research.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cogimage.dsi.cnrs.fr/seminaires/resumes/resume_amygdalae_2005.htm | title=Cogimage Cnrs Upr640}}</ref>
* Charles Wehrenberg implemented ''competitive-relaxation'' as a gaming paradigm with the ''Will Ball Games'' circa 1973. In the first bio-mechanical versions, comparative GSR inputs monitored each player's relaxation response and moved the ''Will Ball'' across a playing field appropriately using stepper motors.[[Image:WillBall table.png|thumb|WillBall gaming table 1973]] In 1984, Wehrenberg programmed the ''Will Ball'' games for Apple II computers. The ''Will Ball'' game itself is described as pure ''competitive-relaxation''; ''Brain Ball'' is a duel between one player's left- and right-brain hemispheres; ''Mood Ball'' is an obstacle-based game; ''Psycho Dice'' is a psycho-kinetic game.<ref>{{cite book | first = Charles | last = Wehrenberg | name-list-style = vanc | title = Will Ball | publisher = Solo Zone | location = San Francisco | date = 1995–2001 | isbn = 1-886163-02-2 }}</ref> In 1999, The HeartMath Institute developed an educational system based on heart rhythm measurement and display on a Personal Computer (Windows/Macintosh). Their systems have been copied by many but are still unique in the way they assist people to learn about and self-manage their physiology. A handheld version of their system was released in 2006 and is completely portable, being the size of a small mobile phone and having rechargeable batteries. With this unit, one can move around and go about daily business while gaining feedback about inner psycho-physiological states.
* In 2001, the company [[Journey to Wild Divine]] began producing biofeedback hardware and software for the [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]s. Third-party and open-source software and games are also available for the Wild Divine hardware. ''[[Tetris 64]]'' makes use of biofeedback to adjust the speed of the tetris puzzle game.
* [[David Rosenboom]] has worked to develop musical instruments that would respond to mental and physiological commands. Playing these instruments can be learned through a process of biofeedback.
* In the mid-1970s, an episode of the television series ''The Bionic Woman'' featured a doctor who could "heal" himself using biofeedback techniques to communicate to his body and react to stimuli. For example, he could exhibit "super" powers, such as walking on hot coals, by feeling the heat on the sole of his feet and then convincing his body to react by sending large quantities of perspiration to compensate. He could also convince his body to deliver extremely high levels of adrenalin to provide more energy to allow him to run faster and jump higher. When injured, he could slow his heart rate to reduce blood pressure, send extra platelets to aid in clotting a wound, and direct white blood cells to an area to attack infection.<ref>{{IMDb episode|0526163}}</ref>
* In the science-fiction book ''Quantum Lens'' by Douglas E. Richards, bio-feedback is used to enhance certain abilities to detect quantum effects that give the user special powers.
