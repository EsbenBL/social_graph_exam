A '''financial analyst''' is a professional, undertaking  [[financial analysis]] for external or internal clients as a core feature of the job.<ref>See generally: Leon Wansleben (2012) 'Financial Analysts' In: K. Knorr Cetina & A. Preda (eds.), Handbook of the Sociology of Finance, Oxford: Oxford UP, pp. 250–271</ref>
The role may specifically  be titled '''securities analyst''', '''research analyst''', '''equity analyst''', '''investment analyst''', or '''ratings analyst'''.<ref name="BLS1">[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm Financial Analysts], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]</ref><ref name="collegegrad.com 2">[https://collegegrad.com/careers/financial-analysts Financial Analysts], collegegrad.com</ref>
The job title is a broad one:<ref name="Rasmussen">[https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/business/blog/what-does-financial-analyst-do/ What does a financial analyst do?], [[Rasmussen College]]</ref><ref name="collegegrad.com"/><ref name="roberthalf">[https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/finance-accounting/financial-analyst-jobs Financial Analyst job description guide], [[Robert Half]]</ref><ref name="BLS5">[https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2014/article/financial-specialists.htm Financial Specialists], Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref>
in banking, and industry more generally, various other analyst-roles cover [[financial management]] and (credit) [[Finance#Risk_management|risk management]], as opposed to focusing on investments and valuation; these are also discussed in this article.
The term “financial analyst” is not usually taken to include [[quantitative analyst]]s, or “quants”.

==Role==
Financial analysts are employed by [[mutual fund|mutual-]] and [[pension fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, securities firms, banks, [[investment bank]]s, insurance companies, and other businesses, helping these companies or their clients make investment decisions. 
<ref name="BLS1"/>
In corporate roles, financial analysts perform budget, revenue and cost modelling and analytics as part of their responsibilities;<ref name="roberthalf"/><ref name="BLS2"/><ref name="BLS3"/>
[[Credit analyst|credit analysis]] is likewise a distinct area.
<ref name ="BLS4">[https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132041.htm Credit Analysts], Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref>

Financial analysts invariably use [[spreadsheet]]s (and [[statistical software]] packages) to analyze financial data, spot trends, and develop forecasts; see [[Financial modeling#Accounting|Financial modeling]].  The analyst often also meets with company officials to gain a better insight into a company's prospects and to determine the company's managerial effectiveness.

As mentioned, "quantitative analysts" are usually seen as distinct from “financial analysts”. 
Typically “quants” are concerned with [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[fixed income analysis]] and [[financial risk management]], and focus on [[mathematical modeling]] as opposed to accounting-related analytics
(compare {{slink|Financial modeling#Quantitative finance}} and  [[Financial modeling#Accounting|§ Accounting]]).
At the same time, particularly in banking, "quants" often work on the same projects as financial analysts, dealing with the mathematically intensive elements.

===Securities firms===
{{Main|Securities research}}
In a stock brokerage house or investment bank (discussed below), the analyst will read company financial statements and analyze commodity prices, sales, costs, expenses, and tax rates in order to [[business valuation|determine a company's value]] and [[financial forecast|project future earnings]]. On the basis of their results, they [[research report|write reports]] and make presentations, usually making recommendations to buy or sell a particular investment or security.

Typically, at the end of the assessment, an analyst would provide a rating recommending or investment action: to buy, sell, or hold the security. Senior analysts may actually make the decision to buy or sell for the company or client if they are the ones responsible for managing the assets. Other, "junior" analysts use the data to model and measure the financial risks associated with making a particular investment decision. See {{slink|Securities research#Career path}}.

Usually, financial analysts study a specific industry ([[Securities research#Analyst specialization|"sector specialist"]]), assessing current trends in business practices, products, and industry competition.
<ref name="collegegrad.com 2"/>
Among the industries with the most analyst coverage are [[biotechnology]], [[financial services]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[mining]] / resources, and computer hardware, software and services. 
Analysts must keep abreast of new regulations or policies that may affect the industry, as well as monitor the economy to determine its effect on earnings.
A 1999 paper by Ezra Zuckerman found that, as equity analysts divide securities by discrete sectors, companies which fall outside or across multiple sectors are punished in the ratings of analysts <ref>{{cite journal|jstor=10.1086/210178|title=The Categorical Imperative: Securities Analysts and the Illegitimacy Discount|first=Ezra W.|last=Zuckerman|s2cid=143734005|date=18 May 1999|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=104|issue=5|pages=1398–1438|doi=10.1086/210178}}</ref>

Analysts may also specialize in fixed Income.
Similar to Equity Analysts, ''Fixed Income Analysts'' [[bond valuation|assess the value]] and [[Corporate bond#Risk analysis|analyze the risks]] of various securities, here focusing on [[Interest rate derivative|interest rate-]] and [[fixed income security|fixed income securities]], particularly [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. 
They may further specialize, but here by issuer-type, i.e. [[municipal bond]]s, [[government bond]]s, and [[corporate bonds]]; 
the latter specialization is often decomposed into [[convertible bond]]s, [[high-yield debt|high yield bonds]], and [[distressed securities|distressed bonds]]; some cover [[Syndicated_loan|syndicated bank loans]]. 
The reporting focuses on the ability of the issuer to make payments - similar to the credit analysis [[#Corporate_and_other|described below]] - but also on the [[Bond valuation#Relative price approach|relative value]] of the security in question, and in context of the overall market and [[yield curve]].
See [[Fixed income analysis]].

Analysts are generally divided into [[Sell-side analyst|'sell-side']] and [[Buy-side analyst|'buy-side']].  The buy-side is sometimes considered more prestigious, professional, and scholarly, while the sell-side may be higher-paid and more like a sales and marketing role.  It is common to begin careers on the sell-side at large banks then move to the buy-side at a fund. 
*A sell-side analyst's work is not used by its employer to invest directly, rather it is sold either for money or for other benefits by the employer to buy-side organisations. Sell-side research is often used as 'soft money' rather than sold directly, for example provided to preferred clients in return for business. [[research report|Writing reports]] or notes expressing opinions is always a part of "sell-side" (brokerage) analyst job and is often not required for "buy-side" (investment firms) analysts. It is sometimes used to promote the companies being researched when the sell-side has some other interest in them, as a form of marketing, which can lead to conflicts of interest.  
*A buy-side analyst,  such as a [[fund manager]], works for a company which buys and holds stocks itself, on the analyst's recommendation.  As they gain experience, analysts often move from buy-side research, concerning individual securities and sectors, into [[portfolio manager|portfolio management]] itself, selecting the [[asset allocation|mix of investments]] for a [[Investor#Institutional investor|company's portfolio]].  They may also become [[fund manager]]s and manage large investment portfolios for [[Investor#Retail investor|individual investors]].

Typically, analysts use [[fundamental analysis]] principles, but [[technical analysis]] and tactical evaluation of the market environment are also routine. Analysts obtain information by studying public records and [[SEC filing|filings by the company]], as well as by participating in public [[earnings call]]s where they can ask direct questions to the management. Additional information can be also received in small group or one-on-one meetings with senior members of management teams. However, in many markets such information gathering became difficult and potentially illegal due to legislative changes brought upon by corporate scandals in the early 2000s. One example is [[Regulation FD]] (Fair Disclosure) in the United States. Many other developed countries also adopted similar rules.

Analyst performance is ranked by a range of services such as StarMine owned by [[Thomson Reuters]] or Institutional Investor magazine. 
Research by [[Numis]] found that small companies with the most analyst coverage outperformed peers by 2.5 per cent — while those with low coverage underperformed by 0.7 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/473a37a8-1720-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44|title=Brokers and managers grapple with Mifid ‘inducement’ rule (Subscribe to read)|website=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref>

====Controversies about financing====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2020}} 
Analyst recommendations on stocks owned by firms employing them may be seen as potentially biased.
Debate still exists about the way sell-side analysts are paid.

Usually brokerage fees pay for their research. 
But this creates a temptation for analysts to act as stock sellers and to lure investors into "overtrading".
Some consider that it would be sounder if investors had to pay for financial research separately and directly to fully independent research firms.

The research department sometimes doesn't have the ability to bring in enough money to be a self-sustaining research company. The research analysts' department is therefore sometimes part of the [[marketing department]] of an [[investment bank]], [[brokerage]], or [[investment advisory]] firm.

Since 2002 there has been extra effort to overcome perceived [[conflicts of interest]] between the investment part of the firm and the public and client research part of the firm (see [[accounting scandals]]). For example, research firms are sometimes separated into two categories, brokerage and independent. Independent researchers are not part of an investment firm and so don't have the same incentive to issue overly favorable views on companies. But this might not be sufficient to avoid all conflicts of interest. In Europe, the [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004]] and subsequent related legislation has in part been an attempt to clarify the exact remit of equity analysts.

A recent development is the introduction of "MiFID 2" ([[Directive 2014/65/EU]]), a legal framework for securities markets, investment intermediaries, and trading venues.  Particularly, here, the way that research may be sold is regulated;
see [[Directive_2014/65/EU#Substance|§ Substance]] there, and {{slink|Securities research#Industry Rules}}.

===Investment Banking===
{{See also| Investment banking #Corporate finance| Investment banking #Research}}
Financial analysts in the [[investment banking]] departments of securities or banking firms often work in teams, analyzing the future prospects of companies, and selling shares to the public for the first time via an [[initial public offering]] (IPO), or [[Bond (finance)#Issuance|issuing bonds]]; this task is often identical to that of a securities analyst. 
On this basis, they will then make presentations to prospective investors re the merits of investing in the new company, presenting their "[[pitch book]]s" on a “[[financial roadshows|roadshow]];” see [[bookrunner]] and [[securities underwriting]].
An additional component of the IB role here: analysts ensure that all forms and written materials necessary for compliance with [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] regulations are accurate and complete.

Many IB analysts work in [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&A) departments, similarly preparing analyses on the costs and benefits of a proposed merger or takeover, and assisting with [[Securities regulation in the United States|regulatory submissions]]; here there are both [[buy-side analyst|buy-side-]] and [[sell-side analyst]]s.
See {{slink|Chinese wall#Finance}}.
The analysis is somewhat more specialized than for an IPO, as it must consider: 
(i) [[Mergers and acquisitions#Business valuation|valuation pre- and post-merger]], a function of efficiencies, synergies, and / or increased market share, 
(ii) [[Mergers and acquisitions#Financing|financing employed]], including M&A specific considerations such as the [[swap ratio]],
and (iii) tax implications.
Compare [[Business valuation]] and [[Stock valuation]].

At more senior levels, [[Vice president#In financial services companies|"vice presidents"]] (VP, or SVP) will manage the workflow and deliverables (modelling performed by "associate" AVPs), but not be involved in the detail ''per se''. 
[[Corporate title#United States|Directors]] will be responsible for [[Rainmaker (business)|"rainmaking"]] and maintaining existing client relationships.  
The latter role incorporates a significant advisory element - guiding the client re [[Relative valuation|their profile and exposure]] in the [[capital markets]], and advising on M&A and other corporate activity <ref>Shaun Beaney, Katerina Joannou and David Petrie [http://www.icaew.com/en/technical/corporate-finance/corporate-finance-faculty/what-is-corporate-finance-122299 What is Corporate Finance?], Corporate Finance Faculty, [[ICAEW]], April 2005 (revised January 2011 and September 2020)</ref> (and liaising with [[sales and trading]]).

====Middle office====
Within banking, there are other non-quant analyst roles (not necessarily titled "financial analyst"), mainly within the [[Investment banking#Middle office|"middle office"]]; these are generally linked, at least [[Solid line reporting#Dotted-line (indirect) reporting|by dotted line]], to both the Finance and Risk Management areas.
*[[Corporate treasury|Corporate Treasury]] is responsible for an investment bank's funding, capital structure management, and [[liquidity risk]] monitoring; see {{slink|Bank#Capital and risk}}. It is then (co)responsible for the bank's [[funds transfer pricing]] (FTP) framework.
*[[product control|Product Control]] is primarily responsible for [[P&L Explained|"explaining" the P&L]]; i.e.: attributing returns to [[Trading room#Organization|individual desks]], [[PnL Explained#Sensitivities method|decomposing these]] into their [[Risk factor (finance)#Financial Risks for the Market|risk factors]], and ensuring that traders' positions [[Mark-to-market accounting|are reflected]] at [[Fair value|their market values]]; the tools here are often built by a separate quant team, possibly [[Investment banking#Front office|front office]], but maintained by Product Control.
*Credit Risk monitors the bank's debt-clients on an ongoing basis, as [[#Corporate_and_other|described below]]; it is additionally responsible for tracking the [[risk capital]] and [[Risk-adjusted return on capital|risk adjusted returns]] on these clients, and reporting re [[concentration risk]] and [[risk appetite]].
These areas allow "Finance" to advise Senior Management re the firm's global risk exposure and the profitability and structure of the firm's various businesses.
A [[comptroller]] (or financial controller) is a senior position, responsible for these analyses and [[internal control]] more generally, usually reporting to the bank's [[chief financial officer]].

===Corporate and other===
[[Financial_management#Role|Analysts in corporate roles]]<ref name="corporatefinanceinstitute">[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/jobs/financial-analyst-job-description/ Financial Analyst Job Description], Corporate Finance Institute</ref><ref name="FP&A"/> provide inputs into all elements of the firm's [[financial management]].<ref name="BLS2">[https://www.bls.gov/OOH/management/financial-managers.htm#tab-2 Financial Managers], Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref><ref name="collegegrad.com"/>
The ''short term'' focus is on [[working capital management]], and includes tasks such as [[profitability analysis]], [[Cost analyst|cost analysis]],  [[Variance (accounting)|variance analysis]], and [[Treasury management#Corporate Finance|treasury management]].
''Medium term'' elements are [[budgeting]] and planning; their models here form the basis for [[financial forecast]]ing, [[scenario analysis]] (sometimes re corporate strategy),<ref name="SiegelShim1997">{{cite book|author1=Joel G. Siegel|author2=Jae K. Shim|author3=Stephen Hartman|title=Schaum's quick guide to business formulas: 201 decision-making tools for business, finance, and accounting students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JpojQPk8YsC|access-date=12 November 2011|date=1 November 1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-058031-2}} §39 "Corporate Planning Models". See also, §294 "Simulation Model".</ref> and [[Corporate finance#Capitalization structure|balance sheet optimization]] .<ref name="BLS3">[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/budget-analysts.htm#tab-2 Budget Analysts], Bureau of Labor Statistics</ref> The latter, extends to involvement with [[dividend policy]], and [[capital structure]]; relatedly, forecasts here also feed into group [[Asset and liability management|ALM]].
Analysts are also involved with ''long term'' "[[capital budgeting]]", i.e. decisions relating to [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|"project" selection and valuation]] and related funding decisions; these forecasts feed through to the [[debt capital markets|Debt Capital Markets]] team, "DCM", responsible for securing and managing long-term funding.
Management of these deliverables sits with the [[financial manager]] (FM); 
treasury analyst/manager, [[budget analyst]] and [[cost analyst]] are often specialized roles. 
The area overall is sometimes referred to as "FP&A" (Financial Planning and Analysis). <ref name="FP&A">[https://www.accaglobal.com/pk/en/qualifications/why-acca/competency-framework/job-profiles/corporate-and-business-accounting/fpa-professional.html Financial planning and analysis (FP&A) professional], [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]</ref>
The [[financial director]] or [[chief financial officer]] (FD, CFO)  has primary responsibility for managing the company's finances, including financial planning, management of financial risks, record-keeping, and financial reporting.

There are several analyst roles related to [[credit risk]], macro or micro.<ref name ="BLS4"/>
[[ratings agency|Ratings analysts]] (who are often employees of [[ratings agencies]]), evaluate the ability of companies or governments that issue bonds to repay their debt. On the basis of their evaluation, a management team [[Bond credit rating|assigns a rating]] to a company's or government's bonds. 
Financial analysts employed in [[Commercial Loan|commercial lending]] perform balance sheet analysis, examining the borrower's [[financial statements|audited financial statements]] and corollary data in order to similarly assess lending risks, and to confirm that [[Yield spread#Yield spread analysis|yield is appropriate given risk]]; this task is both upfront and on a monitoring basis thereafter.  The focus is on current and forecasted [[Financial ratio#Debt ratios (leveraging ratios)|debt-]] and [[Financial ratio#Liquidity ratios|liquidity ratios]] generally, and specifically those related to any [[loan covenant]]s, such as [[Debt service coverage ratio|DSCR]] and [[Loan-to-value ratio|LTVR]].
In [[retail banking]], [[credit analyst]]s build models to determine an applicant's creditworthiness, assign an initial [[credit score]], and monitor this and the loan on the basis of an ongoing [[Consumer credit risk#Credit strategy|"behavioral" score]]. 
In the latter two roles, [[Impairment (financial reporting)|impairment-]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provision]]-modelling are a prominent deliverable (see [[IFRS 9]]);
the [[probability of default|PD]], [[exposure at default|EAD]] and [[loss given default|LGD]] statistics or models are (often) provided by a separate (but dedicated) [[Quantitative_analysis_(finance)#Risk_management|credit-quant]] team.

Some financial analysts specialize as "[[accounting analyst]]s"; they will collect industry data (mainly balance sheet, income statement and capital adequacy in banking sector), merger and acquisition history and financial news for their clients. They then typically “standardize“ the different companies' data, facilitating  [[peer group analysis]]: the main objective here is to enable their clients to make better decisions about the investment across different regions. They also provide the abundance of [[financial ratio]]s calculated from the data gathered from financial statements, and possibly other sources.

==Qualification==
{{See|Outline of finance #Education| Financial modeling #Accounting| Quantitative analysis (finance) #Education}}

===General===
In general, a [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business-related bachelor's degree]] majoring [[Bachelor of Accountancy|in Accounting]], Finance,  [[Bachelor of Economics|or Economics]] is a minimum requirement for an entry or junior role (as well as proficiency in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]<ref name="corporatefinanceinstitute"/> – see under [[Financial modeling#Accounting|Financial Modeling]]). 
<ref name="collegegrad.com"/>
Often, more senior analysts are expected to then earn an [[MBA]], having gained 2–3 years experience in the junior role.  
Increasingly, it is preferred that, even to enter, analysts hold a [[Master of Finance|master's degree in finance]].

More specific qualifications may be required.<ref name="collegegrad.com">[https://collegegrad.com/careers/financial-managers Financial Managers], collegegrad.com</ref>
In (senior) financial management roles, a [[Professional accounting body|professional accounting certification]] – the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]], [[Chartered accountant|CA]], [[Certified Management Accountant|CMA]], or [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]] – is often a prerequisite; this, given the overlap with tax and financial reporting.<ref>[https://collegegrad.com/careers/top-executives Top Executives], collegegrad.com</ref>
Credit-related analysts, depending on their role, may require the [[Financial Risk Manager|FRM]] / [[professional risk manager|PRM]], or an actuarial qualification; in more commercial roles, an industry certification, such as the Credit Business Associate from the [[National Association of Credit Management]] (NACM).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://learn.org/articles/How_Do_I_Become_a_Credit_Analyst.html|title=How Do I Become a Credit Analyst?|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref>
In [[treasury management]] roles, analysts may require the [[Association of Corporate Treasurers#Membership|ACT]] or [[Certified Treasury Professional|CTP]] credential.<ref name="collegegrad.com"/>

===Securities and Investment banking===
In securities and IB roles,<ref name="BLS1"/> it is lately preferred that, similarly, even to enter, analysts earn a master's or the [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA designation]] (in Europe, the   [[Certified International Investment Analyst|CIIA]] also), with the MBA still common at senior levels.
There are also many regulatory requirements. For example, in the United States, sell-side or Wall Street research analysts must register with the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA). In addition to passing the [[General Securities Representative Exam]], candidates must pass the ''Research Analyst Examination'' ([[List of securities examinations#United States of America|series 86/87]]) in order to publish research for the purpose of selling or promoting publicly traded securities.
For other jurisdictions, see [[List of securities examinations]].

For sector-specialists – with approximately five years industry experience – less weight is placed on finance qualifications, as a relevant advanced degree or qualification in the field is often necessary. <ref name="Definitive Guide">[https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/equity-research-recruiting/  Equity Research Recruiting: The Definitive Guide], Luis Miguel Ochoa</ref>
(They will later be encouraged to earn the CFA, CIIA, or MBA.) 
For example, [[Valuation (finance)#Valuing financial service firms|valuing financial service firms]] and  [[Valuation (finance)#Valuation of mining projects|valuing mining corporates]], require specialized knowledge regarding their [[Business valuation standard|valuation-]], regulatory-, and [[accounting standard]]s; and, respectively, qualifications in [[actuarial science]],<ref>[https://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/career-paths-actuaries/ Career Paths for Actuaries]</ref> and [[mining engineering]] / [[geologist|geology]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside the world of the mining analyst {{!}} Investec Focus |url=https://www.investec.com/en_za/focus/beyond-wealth/inside-the-world-of-the-mining-analyst.html |website=www.Investec.com |language=en-za}}</ref> will often be required.
[[Outline of industry|Other sectors]] may similarly require specific technical qualifications: e.g. [[bachelor of pharmacy|in pharmacy]] / [[life sciences]] for [[:Category:Life sciences industry|"bio-tech"]]; <ref>[https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/biotech-equity-research/ Biotech Equity Research], Brian DeChesare </ref> in [[electronic engineering]] for (some) areas in "[[high tech]]", e.g. [[semiconductors]].<ref name="Definitive Guide"/>

Most large teams will also include a CPA or CA in a dedicated technical role.  (In [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]], the CA qualification is often sufficient to access (junior) analyst roles.)
Large trading houses, and banks, often employ an [[economist|economics team]], usually [[chief economist|led]] by a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in the discipline, while a [[Master of Economics|masters in economics]] is the typical requirement to join the team;
see {{slink|Investment banking#Research}}. This team produces the [[economic forecast]]s informing the various valuations and [[investment strategy]].
Banks often recruit analysts with [[qualified accountant|accounting qualifications]] to the middle office roles.

<!-- == Compensation ==
The job title is a broad one. As of 2012, the median pay in the United States was $76,950 per year according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].<ref name="BLS1">[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm Financial Analysts], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]</ref> SumZero found that professionals in the [[hedge fund]] industry average $409,826 per year including bonus and deferred pay.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-people-make-at-hedge-funds-2014-4 This Is How Much The Average Person Can Make Working For A Hedge Fund].
