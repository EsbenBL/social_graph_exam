'''Sir William Paterson''' (April 1658 - 22 January 1719) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[merchant|trader]] and [[banker]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Bank of England]] and was one of the main proponents of the catastrophic [[Darien scheme]]. Later he became an advocate of Union with England.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
William Paterson was born in his parents' farmhouse at [[Tinwald, Dumfries and Galloway|Tinwald]] in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, and lived with them until he was seventeen, when he emigrated first (briefly) to [[Bristol]] and then to the [[Bahamas]], although accounts differ as to the duration of his stays.<ref name=Prebble>{{cite book |last=Prebble |first=John |date=1968 |title=The Darien Disaster |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page=10-15 |isbn=978-0-7126-6853-8}} </ref> During his time in the [[West Indies]] he first conceived the idea of the [[Darién scheme]], his plan to create a colony on the isthmus of [[Panama]], facilitating trade with the [[Far East]].<ref name=Prebble/> While in the West Indies, it is said that he acted as a merchant, developing a reputation for business acumen and dealings with local buccaneers.<ref name=Prebble/>

=== Career ===

Paterson returned to [[Europe]] by the middle of the 1680s, and attempted to convince the [[England|English]] government under [[James II of England|James II]] to undertake the Darién scheme.<ref name=Prebble/> When they refused, he tried again to persuade the governments of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] to establish a colony in Panama, but failed in both cases.

Paterson then went to London in 1687 and made his fortune with foreign trade (primarily through the [[slave trade]] with the [[West Indies]]) in the [[Merchant Taylors' Company]].<ref name=Prebble/> He also helped to found a company for supplying water to North London from the Hampstead Hills, known as the Hampstead Water Company which exited until the late 19th century.<ref name=Prebble/>

In 1694, he co-founded the [[Bank of England]].<ref name=Prebble/> It was said that the project originated with him in 1691, as described in his pamphlet ''A Brief Account of the Intended Bank of England'', to act as the English government's banker. He proposed a loan of £1.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with banking privileges including the issue of notes. The Royal Charter was granted on 27 July 1694. On the foundation of the bank in 1694 he became a director. In 1695, owing to a disagreement with his colleagues, he withdrew from the board and devoted himself to the colony of Darien, unsuccessfully planted in 1698.<ref name=Prebble/>

===Darien scheme===

Paterson relocated to [[Edinburgh]], where he was able to convince the [[Privy council of Scotland|Scottish government]] to undertake the Darién scheme, a failed attempt to found an independent Scottish Empire in what is today Panama. Paterson personally accompanied the disastrous Scottish expedition to Panama in 1698, where his wife and child died while he himself became seriously ill.<ref>Hidalgo, Dennis R.

He spent the last years of his life in [[Westminster]], and died in January 1719.  A mystery still surrounds the burial site of Paterson.  Many (including officials at the Bank of England), believe he is buried in [[Sweetheart Abbey]], [[New Abbey]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]].
