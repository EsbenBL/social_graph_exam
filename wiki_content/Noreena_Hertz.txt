Hertz graduated from [[University College London]] in philosophy and economics at the age of 18.<ref name="Beckett">{{Cite news |title=In search of a radical way |last=Beckett |first=Francis |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=21 October 2004 |page=18}}</ref> She then attended [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|The Wharton School]], [[Philadelphia]], where she majored in finance and earned her [[MBA]] at age 23.<ref name=Beckett/> Hertz then worked for a short period at [[William Morris Endeavor|Triad Artists]], a [[Talent agent|talent agency]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], where she originally planned to break into the [[film industry]] as a producer. Following her stint in the [[creative industries]], Hertz took up a position as a consultant to the [[World Bank Group]] working for the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC) in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].<ref name=Self/><ref name=Fraser/><ref name=Crichton/><ref name=Beckett/>

Disillusioned by what she perceived as failings in the [[World Bank]]'s approach to [[Privatization in Russia|post-Soviet reforms]], she quit her post and worked briefly for the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD). Of the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), she said: "Early on I raised the issue of social safety nets and was quite shocked to see how clearly my concerns were dismissed."<ref name="Roberts">{{Cite news |title=They call me the Nigella Lawson of economics |last=Roberts |first=Alison |work=[[Evening Standard]] |location=London |date=9 May 2001 |page=29}}</ref> Having returned to the UK she studied for a PhD in economics and business at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref name=Self/><ref name=Crichton/><ref name=Beckett/> Her Cambridge doctoral thesis, ''Russian Business Relationships in the Wake of Reform'' was published in 1997 by [[St. Martin's Press]].<ref name=Self/>

==Published books==
===''The Silent Takeover'' (2001)===
In ''The Silent Takeover: Global Capitalism and the Death of Democracy'' Hertz warned that unregulated markets, corporate greed, and over-powerful [[financial institution]]s would have serious global consequences that would impact most heavily on the ordinary citizen. Hertz received a record six-figure advance from [[Random House]] for the book which, in pre-publicity, she promised would "make economics sexy."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Diary |last=Jasper |first=Gerard |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=26 April 1999 |page=20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Stirred into action by political apathy |date=6 April 2001 |publisher=[[Times Higher Education]] |location=London |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/158644.article |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref> Although the book became a [[bestseller]], it was not well-received when first published.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Best selling business books |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |location=London |date=6 May 2001 |page=10}}</ref>

[[Francis Beckett]], for ''[[The Independent]]'', later observed that the book "was lavishly praised and savagely attacked in equal measure" but had nevertheless "launched her as a new sort of thinker - the first prominent British radical left winger to come out of the business schools."<ref name=Beckett/> [[Howard Davies (economist)|Howard Davies]], reviewing it for London's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, dismissed it as "globaloney", written in "a style beloved of airport-newsstand business books: random statistic piled on borrowed anecdote, larded with a bit of homespun cod philosophy, shaken not stirred."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Breathless globaloney: Are there no genuine political choices? |first=Howard |last=Davies |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 May 2001 |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/may/19/politics |access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> [[Tariq Ali]], for ''The Independent'', called the book "well-intentioned" but "a much milder version [of] three more vigorous North American texts that have already achieved cult status", referring to [[Naomi Klein]]'s ''[[No Logo]]'', [[Thomas Frank]]'s ''[[One Market Under God]]'' and [[Kalle Lasn]]'s ''Culture Jam''. Ali categorised Hertz's book as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] and dismissed the Hertz's positions as [[third Way]] [[anti-capitalism]]. Ali concluded: "What Hertz really wants is a government that can unite business interests with those of ordinary people - like expecting homoeopathic drops to cure a cancer."<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Third Way for anti-capitalists |last=Ali |first=Tariq |authorlink=Tariq Ali |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=1 May 2001 |page=5}}</ref> [[Jennifer Szalai]], for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', wrote that the book was "at best, an anaemic objection to global capitalism" and pointed out: "For anybody who has read anything about corporations beyond their annual reports... the examples in this book are nothing new." Szalai described Hertz's "line of argument" as "a listless string of tired phrases, exposing her apparent ambivalence on the subject."<ref>{{Cite news |title=We can't, we won't |last=Szalai |first=Jennifer |publisher=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |volume=14 |issue=660 |date=11 June 2001 |pages=69–70}}</ref>

[[Will Self]] described the book as "superficially readable" but was critical of Hertz's ideology, calling it "an aggressive questioning of the pernicious status quo, but with only a febrile grasp on any potential solution - what used to be expected of a precocious adolescent, rather than a Cambridge assistant professor entering her mid-thirties."<ref name=Self/> [[Frank Fitzgibbon]], for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', described the book as "well-written, colourful and sometimes entertaining" but ultimately "one long whinge, full of hackneyed observations... like a 212-page ''Guardian'' editorial on the venality of politicians, the evils of big business and the right-on credentials of concerned citizens." Responding to the book's advance publicity, which claimed that Hertz would in ''The Silent Takeover'' provide "a new and startling take on the way we live now", Fitzgibbon observed: "With the possible exception of a quote from Bhutan's king, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] - "gross national happiness is more important than gross national product" - there is nothing in this book that is not already known to anybody with a passing interest in business and current affairs. It has all been said before but, to her credit, Hertz says it with style and with her telegenic looks she should be in demand on the chat-show circuit."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Whinger's guide to globalisation |last=Fitzgibbon |first=Frank |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |location=London |date=6 May 2001 |page=10}}</ref>

===''IOU: The Debt Threat'' (2004)===
The 2004 book ''IOU: The Debt Threat and Why We Must Defuse It'' comprised a study of [[debt]] in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and provided Hertz's blueprint for [[economic development]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=THE DEBT THREAT: How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-056052-2 |date=3 January 2005 |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> [[Paul Kingsnorth]], reviewing for the ''New Statesman'', wrote: "Noreena is the [[Joanne Harris]] of political writing - and ''IOU'', like its author, is all style and no substance." Kingsnorth said that her explanation of the debt issue was: "All fine, but also largely redundant, because this stuff has been circulating for years, and Hertz adds nothing new to the mix." He also found sections of the book "misleading" and noted that "her old employer the [[World Bank]] emerges with a curiously positive report card from a book about a problem it created almost single-handedly. The bank's former chief economist [[Lawrence Summers|Larry Summers]] is represented as a passionate champion of the poor. Perhaps Hertz is not aware of the infamous internal memo that was leaked from the bank, in which this angelic man wrote: ''I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that... I've always thought that underpopulated countries in Africa are vastly underpolluted...''" He dismissed the book as simply "going through the motions" and "remarkably bad writing."<ref name="Kingsnorth">{{Cite news |title=On the money |last=Kingsnorth |first=Paul |publisher=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |volume=17 |issue=832 |date=8 November 2004 |pages=52–53}}</ref>

Richard Adams, for ''The Guardian'', wrote: "There is nothing here that will surprise readers of [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]]'s 1988 book ''A Fate Worse than Debt'', which remains the most forceful call for undoing the burden of the developing world." Hertz's proposed solutions were, he wrote, not well defined. "Some of her suggestions are patronising - setting up panels of international "overseers" for aid funding is a bit rich given her diatribes against external IMF and World Bank meddling - while one is downright dangerous: that wealthy nations hypothecate the taxes paid by immigrant workers for use as overseas aid (so removing their last shield against the xenophobe or racist, that they too pay taxes for the NHS)." Adams also found the book "littered with errors... that smack of economic illiteracy and careless research." Of her style, he observed: "Readers may also be unimpressed with Hertz's informal prose style and strangled syntax... The first chapter, especially, reads like a rejected screenplay for an unhappy episode of ''[[The West Wing]]''." Adams concluded his review by writing: "While no one can doubt Hertz's good intentions, the road to hell is paved with books like ''IOU''. Developing-world debt is a serious issue, and it deserves more judicious treatment than this."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Hard to credit: Richard Adams tackles some grim reading on the debt burden |last=Adams |first=Richard |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=30 October 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/30/highereducation.news |access-date=2 August 2013}}</ref>

[[Diane Coyle]], for ''The Independent'', called ''IOU'' "another pamphlet disguised as a book" and opined that "It pretends to weigh up the details and evidence, but its tone implies that anyone who disagrees is stupid or bad... HIV/Aids, the loss of Amazon rainforests and terrorism [are not] caused by these debts, which is the facile claim Hertz makes."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Facile claims on debt that don't add up |last=Coyle |first=Diane |authorlink=Diane Coyle |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=23 September 2004 |page=37}}</ref> Hannah Betts, for ''The Times'', labelled the book "more than liberal breast-beating - it endeavours to be a psychology of debt... Without ever falling into the pat illiberalisms that the West brought [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and its aftermath on itself, Hertz discusses the ways in which terrorism, disease and ecological meltdown may be the consequences of Third World stagnation."<ref name=Betts/> [[Desmond Tutu]] credited the book with a "remarkable clarity" and said it "puts forward clear recommendations that can and must be taken." Writing for the ''New Statesman'' he declared: "''IOU'' should not go unnoticed. When the truth is told about international debt, then we can begin to overcome the scandalous debt slavery of the world's poor."<ref>{{Cite news |title=IOU: The Debt Threat and Why We Must Defuse It |first=Desmond |last=Tutu |authorlink=Desmond Tutu |publisher=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |issue=Political Studies Guide 2005 |date=25 October 2004}}</ref>

===''Eyes Wide Open: How to Make Smart Decisions in a Confusing World'' (2013)===
In the 2013 book ''Eyes Wide Open: How to Make Smart Decisions in a Confusing World'' Hertz takes issue with the rise of unchecked [[data]], and suggests simple solutions to allow her readers to take control of their lives."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Alexander |last=Larman |title=Short Reviews: Eyes Wide Open |publisher=[[The Observer]] |location=London |date=13 October 2013 |page=33 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/12/eyes-wide-open-noreena-hertz-review |access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref> The book has received praise from prominent social psychologists and best-selling authors, including [[Robert Cialdini]], author of ''Influence''. He writes; "With 10 sensible steps to take, Noreena Hertz charts a sound decision-making route for us through a world in hyper-drive. I’d recommend a prudent first step-get this book". [[John Crace (writer)|John Crace]], reviewing for ''The Guardian'', wrote: "Every week, another 150 self-help books are published. How do you know this one is any different from the others? It isn't." He summarised the book as "Eyes fast closing."<ref>{{Cite news |first=John |last=Crace |authorlink=John Crace (writer) |title=Digested read: If your doctor has given you the all-clear, you almost certainly have a year to live: Eyes Wide Open by Noreena Hertz |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=23 September 2013 |page=19 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/23/eyes-wide-open-noreena-hertz-digested-read |access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref> [[Daisy Goodwin]], for the ''Sunday Times'', concluded that although the books reads like an airport book, "it is actually a practical guide to critical thinking in the digital age that is as useful for students as it is for CEOs." Despite finding the book "slightly exhausting", she concluded it was "an admirable guide to predicting the factors that affect our decision-making."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Never trust an expert; A practical guide aims to show us all how to make informed decisions |work=[[Sunday Times]] |location=London |date=15 September 2013 |page=42}}</ref> [[Julian Baggini]], for the ''Financial Times'', observing: "[T]he more confidently a book claims to help you make better choices, the less it is likely to do so. Noreena Hertz's ''Eyes Wide Open'' is a case in point. Reading it, I did, indeed, often find myself wide-eyed, startled by its bold, simplistic claims. There is a need for a synthesis of the many insights gathered by recent research into cognitive biases and the other often hidden processes that shape our decisions." Baggini claims that [[Daniel Kahneman]] has published much better advice in 2011 with ''Thinking, Fast and Slow''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Baggini |first=Julian |title=Multiple choice |work=[[Financial Times]] |location=London |date=7 September 2013 |page=8}}</ref>

=== ''Generation K (2015)''===
In 2015 Hertz began researching what she has called Generation K - 13- to 20-year-olds. K is for [[Katniss Everdeen]], the feisty heroine of the global franchise The Hunger Games.  Noreena presented her initial thinking on Generation K in 2015 at the [[World Economic Forum]] and at the ''Women in the World Summit'' in New York City. Here she unveiled results from her 2015 study of 2000 American and British Teenagers. Key findings include that this Generation is more anxious than previous ones, more intent on being unique, and more concerned about inequality. She posits that they have been profoundly shaped not only by technology but also by the recession and an increasing sense of existential threat. She writes "unlike those currently aged between 20 and 30, the "Yes we can" generation, who grew up believing the world was their oyster, for Generation K the world is less oyster, more Hobbesian nightmare."<ref name="campaignlive.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/why-brands-care-generation-katniss/1348538|title=Why brands should care about Generation Katniss|website=campaignlive.co.uk|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>
 
Hertz defines this generation as having been profoundly shaped by three global forces: the rapid development of technology – this is the first smartphone generation, the worst recession the West faced in decades, and the increased existential threat from evolving terrorist groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-generation-k-2016-4|title=Here's what you should know about 'Generation K' — the teens shaped by terrorism, technology, and anxiety|last=Heilpern|first=Will|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> According to her, distinct traits of Generation K include anxiety, loneliness, a desire for connection, a desire to co-create, a commitment to societal equality, anti-traditional institutions, commitment to the environment and fear about their own financial futures.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/think-millennials-have-it-tough-for-generation-k-life-is-even-harsher|title=Think the millennials have it tough?

=== ''The Lonely Century: Coming Together in a World that's Pulling Apart (2020)'' ===
Hertz's most recent book, ''The Lonely Century: Coming Together in a World that's Pulling Apart,'' was published in the UK by [[Sceptre (imprint)|Sceptre]] in September 2020. The author argues that [[loneliness]] is becoming the defining condition of the twenty-first century and is contributing to the rise of political [[populism]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why loneliness fuels populism |work = Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ffadb189-5661-40c3-b142-43f91cf38bdf|access-date=2020-09-25}}</ref>

== Campaigns ==
In 2001 Hertz contemplated whether "increasingly the most effective way to be political is not to register one's demands and wants at the ballot box". As [[consumer activism]] went mainstream in [[Europe]], she reasoned that "all over the developed, democratic world, people are shopping rather than voting".<ref>{{cite book |first1=James W.

She claimed that it achieved "next to nothing". According to Hertz the campaign was not successful in advancing [[justice]], [[empowerment]] or [[accountability]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Patrick |last1=Bond |title=Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation |publisher=Zed Books |date=2006 |isbn=9781842778111|page=137}}</ref>

===Mayday for Nurses===
In April 2007 Hertz launched the "Mayday for Nurses" campaign in Britain to alleviate the problems of low pay in nursing. Hertz promised nurses at the [[Royal College of Nursing]] annual conference that she would make sure that every football player in the [[Premier League]] would, by the end of the season, have donated one day's pay (totalling around £1.5 million) to a hardship fund for nurses struggling in their first few years.<ref name=Standard/><ref>{{Cite news |title=That's rich: Southgate should be applauded for tough stance on nurses |last=Rudd |first=Alyson |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=12 October 2007 |page=89 |authorlink=Alyson Rudd}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Triggle |first=Nick |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6563277.stm |title=Footballers highlight nurse woes |work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 April 2007 |access-date=3 February 2011}}</ref> The campaign was filmed for a [[Channel 4]] documentary, ''The Million Pound Footballers' Giveaway'', broadcast on 7 June 2007.<ref name=Standard/>

Although the Nurses' hardship fund raised £750,000 after some of the Premiership's best-paid stars pitched in with a day's pay, the campaign received a "mixed response" and was described by some commentators as "intellectually flawed" and "a thinly-veiled form of blackmail."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rooney's flaw show |last=Martin |first=Samuel |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=15 October 2007 |page=7}}</ref> [[Gareth Southgate]], then the manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.]], cancelled his club's donation after Hertz published a list of footballers who had contributed, "effectively 'outing' those who had not."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Football's Charitable Status |last=Moore |first=Glenn |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=7 May 2008 |page=46}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Southgate in war of words with charity |last=Stewart |first=Rob |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=12 October 2007 |page=7}}</ref> Southgate said: "I am disgusted with the manner in which this campaign has gone about its fundraising. Mayday for Nurses is a worthy cause, but there are many others. The players at this club support any number of local and national charities and good causes, either via financial support, giving up their own time or both. This is often done privately, meaning they neither receive nor ask for any public gratitude or praise."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Angry soccer boss blocks donation to nurses' fund in 'blackmail' row |work=[[The Yorkshire Post]] |location=Leeds |date=12 October 2007}}</ref> [[Moritz Volz]], then playing for [[Fulham F.C.]], explained in ''The Times'': "Everyone in our squad decided to donate a day's pay to the Mayday for Nurses appeal.

Instead of focusing on poor pay for nurses, the media coverage ended up being primarily about footballers and their money.".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Mayday for Nurses appeal |last=Volz |first=Moritz |authorlink=Moritz Volz |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=29 October 2007 |page=15}}</ref>
