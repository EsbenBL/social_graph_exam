==Early life==
Altman was born in Haifa, Israel and attended school in New Zealand. In 1973 he completed a BA in Economics and Philosophy at the [[University of Auckland]] and went on to complete a MA (Hons) in Economics. Altman relocated to Australia in 1976.

==Career==
In his early career Altman sought to examine Indigenous disadvantage from an economic rather than the then dominant social welfare perspective and to place Indigenous economic development issues in a comparative international context.<ref>Altman, J.C. and Nieuwenhuysen, J.P. 1979. The Economic Status of Australian Aborigines, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. xix & 230 (republished in 2006 as a Cambridge paperback).</ref>

Between 1978 and 1982 Altman completed a PhD in Anthropology at the [[Australian National University]]. He used ethnographic methods and comparative analysis from the field of [[economic anthropology]] to examine Aboriginal ways of living at remote outstations on Aboriginal-owned land. He undertook fieldwork amongst the [[Kuninjku]] people in Western Arnhem Land.<ref>Altman, J.C. 1987. Hunter-Gatherers Today: An Aboriginal Economy in North Australia, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, pp. xvi & 251.</ref>

Throughout the 1980s he undertook a series of research projects about Indigenous engagement with new industries including mining,<ref>Altman, J.C. 1983. Aborigines and Mining Royalties in the Northern Territory, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, pp. xvii & 164.</ref> tourism,<ref>Altman, J.C. 1988. Aborigines, Tourism, and Development: the Northern Territory Experience, North Australia Research Unit of the Australian National University, Darwin, pp. xvi & 345.</ref>  and the visual arts.<ref>Altman, J.C. 1989. The Aboriginal Arts and Craft Industry, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, pp. xviii & 376.</ref>  He collaborated with [[Chris Gregory]], an anthropologist at the Australian National University, to theorise and document this methodology.<ref>Gregory, C.A. and Altman, J.C. 1989. Observing the Economy, ASA Research Methods in Social Anthropology 3, Routledge, London, pp. x & 252.</ref>

In 1990, Altman established the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR) at the [[Australian National University]] as a multidisciplinary centre to enhance Australiaâ€™s capacity to undertake social sciences research about the economic situation of Indigenous people. He was director of the Centre from 1990 to 2010. Since 2001, he has focused his research on the hybrid economy framework and theory that encompasses the intercultural nature of Aboriginal livelihood approaches particularly in remote regions, the articulations between customary, market and state sectors of remote Aboriginal economies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caepr.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/cck_misc_documents/2011/06/Hybrid%20Economy%20Topic%20Guide_2.pdf|title=The Hybrid Economy Topic Guide|publisher=Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research|last=Russell|first=Susie|pages=<!-- insert page(s) from the 39-page document that verify the text -->|date=May 2011}} (Page information missing)</ref>

Since 2006, Altman shifted his intellectual focus to political ecology and critical development studies. He has been an outspoken critic of policies of the Australian government in Indigenous affairs, labelling them "neoliberal assimilation" and "neo paternalist". Since the 2007 [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response]], he has co-edited two books with his partner, anthropologist Melinda Hinkson, criticising the intervention.<ref name="Altman">Altman, J.C. and Hinkson, M. (eds) 2010. Culture Crisis: Anthropology and Politics in Aboriginal Australia, UNSW Press, Sydney, pp. xvi & 288.</ref>

Altman was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2017 Australia Day Honour's list for significant service to tertiary education as a researcher and administrator, and to the social sciences and Indigenous economic policy.<ref>[[2017 Australia Day Honours]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2020}}
