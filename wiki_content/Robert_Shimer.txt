'''Robert Shimer''' (born August 21, 1968) is an American [[macroeconomics|macroeconomist]] and [[labour economics|labor economist]] who currently holds the Alvin H. Baum Chair in the Economics Department of the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>[http://economics.uchicago.edu/faculty.shtml#s Faculty list, Dept. of Economics, University of Chicago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811203228/http://economics.uchicago.edu/faculty.shtml |date=2006-08-11 }}</ref> He was an editor of the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' from 2004 to 2012.<ref>[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/page/jpe/board.html Editorial Board, ''Journal of Political Economy''.]</ref> His research focuses on the [[Matching theory (macroeconomics)|search and matching approach]] to labor economics. He is especially known for arguing that the standard [[Matching theory (macroeconomics)|labor market matching model]] predicts fluctuations in the unemployment rate much smaller than those actually observed over the business cycle,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Shimer |year=2005 |title=The Cyclical Behavior of Equilibrium Unemployment and Vacancies |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=25–49 |jstor=4132669 |doi=10.1257/0002828053828572}}</ref> an observation which has sometimes been called the '''Shimer puzzle'''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Cardullo |title=Matching Models Under Scrutiny: An Appraisal of the Shimer Puzzle |journal=[[Journal of Economic Surveys]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=622–656 |year=2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6419.2009.00596.x |s2cid=153445313 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1184634 }}</ref> His book ''Labor Markets and Business Cycles'' was published in 2010 by Princeton University Press, and was recommended by [[Robert Hall (economist)|Robert Hall]]:
:Shimer's definitive account of the modern theory of labor market volatility presents many new results and deserves a prominent place on the bookshelf of every macroeconomist and labor economist.<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9217.html Endorsements of ''Labor Markets and Business Cycles'', by R. Shimer]</ref>

==Research==

===Labor Choice===
In 2017, Shimer coauthored a paper entitled, "High Wage Workers Work for High Wage Firms."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Borovičková|first1=Katarina|last2=Shimer|first2=Robert|title=High Wage Workers Work for High Wage Firms |journal=[[National Bureau of Economic Research No. 24074]]  |issue=November 2017 |year=2017 |doi=10.3386/w24074 |doi-access=free}}</ref> The working paper sought to measure the correlation between worker quality and firm wage rates.  Using Austrian administrative data, he found a correlation between worker and firm types of 0.4 to 0.6.  This implies a contradiction to previous work which found no correlation between types.
