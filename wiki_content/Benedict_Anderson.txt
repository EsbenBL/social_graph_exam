'''Benedict Richard O'Gorman Anderson '''(August 26, 1936 – December 13, 2015) was an Anglo-Irish [[political science|political scientist]] and historian who lived and taught in the United States. Anderson is best known for his 1983 book ''[[Imagined Communities]]'', which explored the origins of [[nationalism]]. A polyglot with an interest in southeast Asia, he was the Aaron L. Binenkorb Professor of International Studies, Government & Asian Studies at [[Cornell University]]. His work on the "[[Cornell Paper]]", which disputed the official story of [[Indonesia]]'s [[30 September Movement]] and the subsequent [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|anti-Communist purges of 1965–1966]], led to his expulsion from that country. Benedict Anderson was the elder brother of the historian [[Perry Anderson]].<ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/13/indonesianist-benedict-anderson-dies-79.html |title=Indonesianist Benedict Anderson dies at 79 |publisher=[[Jakarta Post]] |access-date=2015-12-16 |author=Koswaraputra, Dandy |website=www.thejakartapost.com |date=December 13, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215205258/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/13/indonesianist-benedict-anderson-dies-79.html |archive-date=December 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Anderson's maternal grandfather [[Trevor Bigham]] was the [[Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Deputy Commissioner]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]] from 1914 to 1931. One of Anderson's grandmothers, Lady Frances O'Gorman, belonged to the [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] [[Gorman (surname)|Mac Gormáin]] [[Irish clans|clan]] of [[County Clare]] and was the daughter of the [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] Major Purcell O'Gorman.<ref name="clarelibrary.ie">{{cite web |url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/frost/chap9_macgormans.htm |title=The History and Topography of the County of Clare by James Frost: Chapter 9 – Pedigree of MacGorman (O'Gorman) |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130110657/http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/frost/chap9_macgormans.htm |archive-date=November 30, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/frost/chap9_ui_bracain.htm |title=The History and Topography of the County of Clare by James Frost: Chapter 9 – Ui Bracain.

=== California, Ireland and Cambridge ===
Anderson's family moved to California in 1941 to avoid the invading Japanese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and then to Ireland in 1945.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> He studied at [[Eton College]], where he won the [[Newcastle Scholarship]], and went on to attend [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Historical Construction of Southeast Asian Studies: Korea and Beyond|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-6ThAwAAQBAJ&q=%2522benedict%2520anderson%2522%2520%2522eton%2520college%2522&pg=PA16|publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|date = 2013-06-17|isbn = 9789814414586|first1 = Park Seung|last1 = Woo|first2 = Victor T.|last2 = King|page = 16|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222110849/https://books.google.ca/books?id=-6ThAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=%2522benedict+anderson%2522+%2522eton+college%2522&source=bl&ots=Kjw8R1E83K&sig=EQF7FTIUmtuCYj-xw3jRNkpJQBA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcxrz5u93JAhXJXD4KHZziBHIQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&q=%2522benedict%2520anderson%2522%2520%2522eton%2520college%2522&f=false|archive-date = December 22, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> While at Cambridge, he became an anti-imperialist during the [[Suez Crisis]], which influenced his later work as a [[Marxist historiography|Marxist]] and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialist]] thinker.<ref name=":1" />

=== Southeast Asia studies ===
He earned a classics degree from Cambridge in 1957 before attending [[Cornell University]], where he concentrated on Indonesia as a research interest and in 1967 received his Ph.D. in government studies.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> His doctoral advisor at Cornell was Southeast Asian scholar [[George McTurnan Kahin|George Kahin]].<ref name=":2" />

The [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|violence]] following the [[30 September Movement|September 1965 coup attempt]] that led to [[Suharto]] taking power in Indonesia disillusioned Anderson, who wrote that it "felt like discovering that a loved one is a murderer".<ref name=":1" /> Therefore, while Anderson was still a graduate student at Cornell, he anonymously co-wrote the "[[Cornell Paper]]" with Ruth T. McVey that debunked the official Indonesian government accounts of the abortive coup of the [[30 September Movement]] and the subsequent [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|anti-Communist purges of 1965–66]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The "Cornell Paper" was widely disseminated by Indonesian dissidents.<ref name=":1" /> One of two foreign witnesses at the [[show trial]] of [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] general secretary [[Sudisman]] in 1971, Anderson published a translated version of the latter's unsuccessful testimony.<ref name=":1" /> As a result of his actions, Anderson was in 1972 expelled from Indonesia and banned from reentering, a restriction that lasted until 1998 when Suharto resigned to be replaced by [[B.J. Habibie]] as president.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Anderson was fluent in many languages relevant to his Southeast Asian field, including [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], as well as the major European languages.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> After the American experience in the [[Vietnam War]] and the subsequent wars between Communist nations such as the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]] and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], he began studying the origins of nationalism while continuing his previous work on the relationship between language and power.<ref name=":0" />

Anderson is best known for his 1983 book ''[[Imagined Communities]]'', in which he described the major factors contributing to the emergence of nationalism in the world during the past three centuries.<ref name=":0" /> Anderson defined a nation as "an imagined political community [that is] imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign".<ref name="ic">Anderson, Benedict. ''Imagined Communities'', p. 6. {{ISBN|0-86091-329-5}}</ref> (See below for a more extensive discussion.)

Anderson was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=April 17, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|archive-date=May 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1998, Anderson's return trip to Indonesia was sponsored by the Indonesian [[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|''Tempo'']] publication, and he gave a public speech in which he criticized the Indonesia opposition for "its timidity and historical amnesia—especially with regard to the massacres of 1965–1966".<ref name=":1" />

He taught at Cornell until his retirement in 2002, when he became a [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]] of International Studies.<ref name=":0" /> After his retirement, he spent most of his time traveling throughout South East Asia. Anderson died in [[Batu, East Java|Batu]], a hill town near [[Malang]], Indonesia, in his sleep on December 13, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indonesianis Asal Amerika, Ben Anderson, Meninggal di Batu |work=Tempo |url=http://nasional.tempo.co/read/news/2015/12/13/078727328/indonesianis-asal-amerika-ben-anderson-meninggal-di-batu |date=December 13, 2015 |access-date=December 13, 2015 |language=id |author1=Tito Sianipar |author2=Rezki Alvionitasari |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093051/http://nasional.tempo.co/read/news/2015/12/13/078727328/indonesianis-asal-amerika-ben-anderson-meninggal-di-batu |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/121382/asian-scholar-benedict-anderson-dies-in-his-sleep-in-indonesia|title=Asian scholar Benedict Anderson dies in his sleep in Indonesia|date=13 December 2015|newspaper=InterAksyon|access-date=13 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217082245/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/121382/asian-scholar-benedict-anderson-dies-in-his-sleep-in-indonesia|archive-date=December 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to close friend [[Tariq Ali]], Anderson died of heart failure.<ref name=":0" /> He had been in the middle of correcting the proofs of his memoir ''A Life Beyond Boundaries,'' which had initially been published in Japanese translation. He was survived by two adopted sons of Indonesian origin.<ref name=":0" />

== ''Imagined Communities'' ==
{{main|Imagined Communities}}
Anderson is best known for his 1983 book, ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'', in which he examined how nationalism led to the creation of nations, or as the title puts it, imagined communities.<ref name=":0" /> In this case, an "[[imagined community]]" does not mean that a national community is fake, but rather refers to Anderson's position that any community so large that its members do not know each another on a face-to-face basis must be imagined to some degree.<ref name=":0" />

According to Anderson, previous Marxist and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] thinkers did not fully appreciate nationalism's power, writing in his book that "Unlike most other isms, nationalism has never produced its own grand thinkers: no [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbeses]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocquevilles]], [[Karl Marx|Marxes]] or [[Max Weber|Webers]]."<ref name=":0" /> Anderson begins his work by bringing up three paradoxes of nationalism that he would address in the work:
# Nationalism is a recent and modern creation despite nations being thought of by most people as old and timeless;
# Nationalism is universal in that every individual belongs to a nation, yet each nation is supposedly completely distinct from every other nation;
# Nationalism is an idea so influential that people will die for their nations, yet at the same time an idea difficult to define.<ref name=":0" />
In Anderson's theory of nationalism, the phenomenon only came about as people began rejecting three key beliefs about their society: 
# That certain languages such as Latin were superior to others in respect to access to universal truths;
# That [[Divine right of kings|divine right to rule]] was granted to the rulers of society, usually monarchs, and was a natural basis for organizing society;
# That the origins of the world and the origins of humankind were the same.<ref name=":0" />
Anderson argued that the prerequisites for the rejection of these beliefs began in Western Europe through the numerous factors that led to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], such as the power of economics, the [[scientific revolution]], and the advent of improvements in communication brought about by the invention of the [[printing press]] under a system of capitalism (or as Anderson calls it, [[print capitalism]]).<ref name=":0" /> Anderson's view of nationalism places the roots of the notion of "nation" at the end of the 18th century when a replacement system began, not in Europe, but in the Western Hemisphere, when countries such as Brazil, the United States, and the newly freed Spanish colonies became the first to develop a [[national consciousness]].<ref name=":0" />

Therefore, in contrast to other thinkers such as [[Ernest Gellner]], who considered the spread of nationalism in connection with industrialism in Western Europe, and [[Elie Kedourie]], who construed nationalism as a European phenomenon carried around the world by colonization,<ref name=":3">{{cite web | url=http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/nationalism/kemper1.html | title=Five Approaches to Nationalism | access-date=2015-12-16 | author=Landow, George P. | website=www.postcolonialweb.org | date=14 December 2000 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128110801/http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/nationalism/kemper1.html | archive-date=November 28, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Anderson sees the European [[nation state]] as a response to the rise of nationalism in the European diaspora beyond the oceans, especially in the Western Hemisphere, which was then retransmitted to Africa and Asia through colonization.<ref name=":0" /> Anderson considers nation state building as an imitative and transportable action, in which new political entities were copying the model of the nation state.<ref name=":3" /> As Anderson sees it, the large cluster of political entities that sprang up in North America and South America between 1778 and 1838, almost all of which self-consciously defined themselves as nations, were historically the first such states to emerge and therefore inevitably provided the first real model of what such states should look like.<ref name=":0" /> According to Anderson, this phenomenon led to the rise of nations: communities that were limited by their borders and were [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].<ref name=":0" /> Anderson conceived nationalism as having come about in different "waves."<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title = Dependent Communities: Aid and Politics in Cambodia and East Timor|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6resn1_6YcQC|publisher = SEAP Publications|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 9780877277484|first = Caroline|last = Hughes|page = 4}}</ref>

=== Nationalism and print ===
{{main|Print capitalism}}
Like other thinkers such as [[Marshall McLuhan]] in his ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'', of particular importance to Anderson's theory on nationalism is his stress on the role of printed literature and its dissemination.<ref name=":3" /> Thinkers like McLuhan, [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], and Anderson did not believe that nationalism came about because of a vaguely-defined "European" way of thinking, but because of the social, economic, and cultural practices associated with the rise of the printing press and the mass reproduction of printed material.<ref name=":3" />

According to Anderson, "the revolutionary vernacularizing thrust of capitalism" was central to the creation of imagined communities, as the mass mechanical reproduction of printed works united people that would otherwise have found it difficult to imagine themselves as part of the same community, mainly because of extreme linguistic differences.<ref name=":0" /> With the advent of the printing press, languages became more stable and certain dialects became "languages of power" (such as the [[Queen's English]] in the United Kingdom) that were inherently more prestigious than sub-regional vernacular dialects.<ref name=":0" /> Print capitalism also meant a culture in which people were required to be socialized as part of a literate culture, in which the standardized language of their nation became both the language of printed material and education for the masses.<ref name=":4" />

Fellow nationalism scholar Steven Kemper described the role of print technology in Anderson's theory as "mak[ing] possible for enormous numbers of people to know of one another indirectly, for the printing press bec[a]me the middleman to the imagination of the community." Kemper also stated that for Anderson the "very existence and regularity of newspapers caused readers, and thus citizens-in-the-making, to imagine themselves residing in a common time and place, united by a print language with a league of anonymous equals."<ref name=":3" />

Therefore, for Anderson, the rise of print technology was essential to create the "deep horizontal comradeship" that despite its socially constructed origins, was also genuine and deep-seated, explaining why nationalism can drive people to fight, die, and kill for their countries.<ref name=":0" />

=== Multi-ethnic empires ===
Anderson also studied how the 19th century European dynasties that represented retention of power over huge polyglot domains, underwent naturalization at the same time as they developed programs of official nationalism in a process that he called the "willed merger of nation and dynastic empire".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Feminist Locations: Global and Local, Theory and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mska_acpMkcC|publisher = Rutgers University Press|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780813529233|language = en|first = Marianne|last = DeKoven|page = 148}}</ref> Anderson considered the empire as solely a pre-modern, "dynastic realm" and focused his attention on the official nationalism in multiethnic empires (e.g. the Russian [[Official Nationality]]), programs that he described as "reactionary, secondary modelling".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Nationalizing Empires|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=__9fCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Central European University Press|date = 2015-06-30|isbn = 9789633860168|language = en|first1 = Stefan|last1 = Berger|first2 = Alexei|last2 = Miller|page = 574}}</ref> Whereas previously, the legitimacy of European dynasties had nothing to do with nationalness, Anderson argued that after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[German Empire|German]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the nation-state superseded the empire as the norm in international affairs, as demonstrated by how delegates from the imperial powers in the post-war [[League of Nations]] were careful to present themselves as national delegates instead of imperial ones.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of Nationalism in Modern Japan: Placing the People|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SLuwCQAAQBAJ|publisher = BRILL|date = 2006-12-28|isbn = 9789047411826|language = en|first = Kevin|last = Doak|page = 226}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Japan and the Great War|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bm3eCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|date = 2015-10-06|isbn = 9781137546753|language = en|first1 = Oliviero|last1 = Frattolillo|first2 = Antony|last2 = Best|page = Introduction}}</ref>
