'''Henry Alexander Murray''' (May 13, 1893&nbsp;– June 23, 1988) was an American [[psychologist]] at [[Harvard University]], where from 1959 to 1962 he conducted a series of psychologically-damaging experiments on undergraduate students, one of whom was [[Ted Kaczynski]], later known as the Unabomber.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/harvard-and-the-making-of-the-unabomber/378239/|title=Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber|first=Alston|last=Chase|date=June 1, 2000|website=The Atlantic}}</ref> He was Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the School of Arts and Sciences after 1930. Murray developed a theory of [[personality psychology|personality]] called personology, based on "[[need]]" and "press".  Murray was also a co-developer, with [[Christiana Morgan]], of the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT), which he referred to as "the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music."

==Early life & education==

Murray was born in New York City into a wealthy family of Henry Alexander Murray Sr., and Fannie Morris Babcock, daughter of financier [[Samuel Denison Babcock]].<ref name="ANB">{{Cite ANB|title=Murray, Henry Alexander, Jr. |id=1400869 |first=Eugene |last=Taylor}}</ref> Murray had an older sister and a younger brother. Carver and Scheier note that "he got on well with his father but had a poor relationship with his mother", resulting in a deep-seated feeling of depression. They hypothesize that the disruption of this relationship led Murray to be especially aware of people's needs and their importance as underlying determinants of behavior.<ref name=carve>Carver and Scheier (1992) ''Perspectives on Personality'' (2nd edition), Allyn & Bacon.</ref>{{rp|100}}

At Harvard, he majored in history with a poor performance, but compensated with [[American football|football]], [[Sport rowing|rowing]] and [[boxing]]. At [[Columbia University]] he did much better in medicine, completed his M.D. and also received an M.A. in [[biology]], in 1919. For the next two years he was an instructor in physiology at Harvard. 
He received his doctorate in [[biochemistry]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1928, aged 35.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1916, Murray married, aged 23, and after seven years of marriage, in 1923, he met and fell in love with [[Christiana Morgan]]. He experienced a serious conflict as he did not want to leave his wife, Josephine. This was a turning point in Murray's life as it raised his awareness of conflicting needs, the pressure that can result, and the links to motivation. Carver and Scheier note that it was Morgan who was "fascinated by the psychology of Carl Jung" and it was as a result of her urging that he meet [[Carl Jung]] in Switzerland.<ref name=carve/> He described Jung as "The first full blooded, spherical—and Goethean, I would say, intelligence I had ever met." He was analyzed by him and studied his works. "The experience of bringing a problem to a psychologist and receiving an answer that seemed to work had a great impact on Murray, leading him to seriously consider psychology as a career".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = J.

==Professional career==
During his period at Harvard, Murray sat in on lectures by [[Alfred North Whitehead]], whose [[process philosophy]] marked his philosophical and metaphysical thinking throughout his professional career.<ref name=laugh>{{citation | pmid  = 11609728 | last = Laughlin | first = C D | publication-date = 1973 | year = 1973 | title = Discussion: The influence of Whitehead's organism upon Murray's personology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| periodical = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | pages = 251–57 | doi  = 10.1002/1520-6696(197307)9:3<251::AID-JHBS2300090308>3.0.CO;2-4 }}</ref>

In 1927, at the age of 33, Murray became assistant director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. He developed the concepts of latent needs (not openly displayed), manifest needs (observed in people's actions), "press" (external influences on motivation) and "thema"—"a pattern of press and need that coalesces around particular interactions". {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Murray collaborated with [[Stanley Cobb]], Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna.  He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society]] after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
 
In 1935, Murray and Morgan developed the concept of apperception and the assumption that everyone's thinking is shaped by subjective processes, the rationale behind the [[Thematic apperception test]]. They used the term "apperception" to refer to the process of projecting fantasy imagery onto an objective stimulus.

In 1937, Murray became director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. 
In 1938 he published ''Explorations in Personality'', a classic in psychology, which includes a description of the Thematic Apperception Test. 
In 1938 Murray acted as a consultant for the British Government, setting up the Officer Selection Board. Murray's work at The Harvard Psychological Clinic enabled him to apply his theories in the design of the selection processes with a "situation test", an assessment based on practical tasks and activities, an analysis of ''specific criteria'' (e.g. "leadership") by a number of raters across a range of activities. Results were pooled to achieve an overall assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===World War II, Office of Strategic Services, 1939–45===
During [[World War II]], he left Harvard and worked as [[lieutenant colonel]] for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS). James Miller, in charge of the selection of secret agents at the OSS during World War ll, said the situation test was used by British War Officer Selection Board and OSS to assess potential agents.

In 1943 Murray helped complete ''[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]'', commissioned by OSS boss MGen. [[William Joseph Donovan|William "Wild Bill" Donovan]]. The report was done in collaboration with [[psychoanalyst]] [[Walter C. Langer]], Ernst Kris, [[New School for Social Research]], and [[Bertram D. Lewin]], [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]]. The report used many sources to profile [[Hitler]], including informants such as [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]], [[Hermann Rauschning]], [[Stephanie von Hohenlohe|Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe]], [[Gregor Strasser]], [[Friedelinde Wagner]], and [[Kurt Ludecke]]. The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of [[offender profiling]] and political psychology. In addition to predicting that Hitler would choose suicide if defeat for Germany was near, Murray's collaborative report stated that Hitler was impotent as far as heterosexual relations were concerned and that there was a possibility that Hitler had participated in a homosexual relationship. The report stated: "The belief that Hitler is homosexual has probably developed (a) from the fact that he does show so many [[Femininity|feminine]] characteristics, and (b) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Party]] during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions. It is probably true that Hitler calls [[Albert Forster]] "Bubi", which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners."

===Harvard human experiments, 1959–62===
In 1947, he returned to Harvard as a chief researcher, lectured and established with others the ''Psychological Clinic Annex''.

From late 1959 to early 1962, Murray was responsible for unethical experiments in which he used twenty-two Harvard undergraduates as research subjects.<ref name = Unabomber>{{cite news | author = Chase A | date = June 1, 2000 | title = Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber | publisher = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | pages = 41–65 | access-date = October 16, 2008 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/06/chase.htm }}</ref> 
Among other goals, experiments sought to measure individuals' responses to extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray called "vehement, sweeping and personally abusive" attacks. Specifically-tailored assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were used to cause high levels of stress and [[distress (medicine)|distress]]. The subjects then viewed recorded footage of their reactions to this verbal abuse repeatedly.

Among them was 17-year-old [[Ted Kaczynski]], a mathematician who went on to become the [[Unabomber]], a domestic terrorist targeting academics and technologists for 18 years.<ref name=chase>{{cite book | last = Chase | first = Alston | title = Harvard and the Unabomber The Education of an American Terrorist | publisher = [[W.

In 1960, [[Timothy Leary]] started research in [[psychedelic drugs]] at Harvard, which Murray is said to have supervised.<ref>Jonathan D Moreno [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/impromptu-man/201205/harvards-experiment-the-unabomber-class-62 Harvard's Experiment on the Unabomber, Class of '62] Psychology Today May 25, 2012</ref>

Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of, or indemnified by, the US Government's research into mind control known as the [[MKUltra]] project.<ref name="mindwars">{{cite book|last1=Moreno|first1=Jonathan|title=Mind Wars: Brain Science and the Military in the 21st Century|isbn=9781934137437|publisher=Bellevue Literary Press, NYU School of Medicine|year=2012}}</ref><ref name="mkultra">{{cite web|title=MKUltra: Inside the CIA's Cold War mind control experiments|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/86961/mkultra-inside-the-cias-cold-war-mind-control-experiments|website=The Week|access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name="UNABOM">{{cite web|last1=Chase|first1=Alston|title=Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/harvard-and-the-making-of-the-unabomber/378239/|website=The Atlantic|date=June 2000|access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref>

==Retirement and death==
In 1962, Murray became emeritus professor, and earned the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the [[American Psychological Association]] and the Gold Medal Award for lifetime achievement from the [[American Psychological Foundation]].<ref name=mcgraw>Staff [http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/psychtesting/profiles/murray.htm Henry A.

==Personology==
Murray's Theory of Personality, also called ''personology'', is explained in his book, ''Explorations in Personality'', written in 1938.<ref name="Cramer2004">{{cite book|author=Phebe Cramer|title=Storytelling, Narrative, and the Thematic Apperception Test|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cn4imBke3QC&pg=PA11|year=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-071-5|pages=11–}}</ref>  [[Murray's system of needs]] is an important part of the personological system.<ref name="ChandraChandra2003">{{cite book|author1=Ram Nath Sharma, S.S. Chandra|author2=S.S. Chandra|title=General Psychology 2 Vols. Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA490|year=2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0303-0|pages=490–}}</ref> and developed while personality theory in psychology was becoming dominated by the statistics of trait theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Patterned after chemistry's [[Henderson–Hasselbalch equation]] for the [[pH]] of a solution, personology was a holistic approach that studied the person at many levels of complexity all at the same time by an interdisciplinary team of investigators.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

According to Murray's ideas, an individual's personality develops dynamically as each person responds to complex elements in her or his specific environment.  Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called "personology". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies.

Murray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone.

Murray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists,<ref>{{cite book|title=Obeying the Voice of God: Jack MacDonald's Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BAERfC1k2EC&pg=PA11|year=2008|publisher=Brian Van Brunt|isbn=978-0-9778545-1-6|pages=11–}}</ref> and extended by others, such as D. C. McClelland.<ref name="PaschenDihsmaier2013">{{cite book|author1=Michael Paschen|author2=Erich Dihsmaier|title=The Psychology of Human Leadership: How To Develop Charisma and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9q4BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA233|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-37054-0|pages=233–}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Murray's identification of psychological needs, the [[Murray's system of needs]], including Achievement, Affiliation and Power (1938) provided the theoretical basis for the later research of [[David McClelland]] and underpins development of competency-based models of management effectiveness such as [[Richard Boyatzis]]'s. McClelland, Boyatzis and Spencer went on to found the McBer Consultancy. However, Murray's contribution is rarely acknowledged in contemporary academic literature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

''Explorations in Personality''  underlying principles were later adopted by AT&T in the development of [[the Assessment Centre]] methodology, now widely used to assess management potential in both private and public sector organisations.
