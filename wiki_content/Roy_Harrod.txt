'''Sir Henry Roy Forbes Harrod''' (13 February 1900 – 8 March 1978) was an English [[economist]]. He is best known for writing ''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]'' (1951) and for the development of the [[Harrod–Domar model]], which he and [[Evsey Domar]] developed independently. He is also known for his ''International Economics'', a former standard textbook, the first edition of which contained some observations and ruminations (wanting in subsequent editions) that would foreshadow theories developed independently by later scholars (such as the [[Balassa–Samuelson effect]]).

==Biography==
Born in London<ref>Oxford DNB</ref> he attended St Paul's and then Westminster School. Harrod attended [[New College, Oxford|New College]] in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on a history scholarship. After a brief period in the Artillery in 1918 he gained a first in "literae humaniores" in 1921, and a first in modern history the following year.
Afterwards he spent some time in 1922 at [[King's College, Cambridge]]. It was there that he met and befriended Keynes.<ref>Roy Harrod, ''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]'', Macmillan, 1951.</ref>

After moving back to Oxford, he became a Student (i.e., [[Fellow]]) and Tutor in economics at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. He held the fellowship in modern history and economics until 1967. He remained in contact with Keynes until Keynes's death in 1946, and was later his biographer (1951).  Harrod was additionally a Fellow at [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] 1938 to 1947 and from 1954 to 1958.

At Oxford Harrod was part of the Railway Club, which included: [[Henry Vincent Yorke|Henry Yorke]], Roy Harrod, [[Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath]], [[David Plunket Greene]], [[Edward Henry Charles James Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester]], [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]], [[Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse]], [[John Sutro]], [[Hugh Lygon]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne]], [[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross]], [[Mark Ogilvie-Grant]], [[John Drury-Lowe]].<ref name="Lancaster">{{cite book|last1=Lancaster|first1=Marie-Jaqueline|title=Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure|date=2005|publisher=Timewell Press|page=122|isbn=9781857252118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IVRYLb2wcAC&pg=PA122|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref>

During the Second World War, he was briefly in [[Winston Churchill]]'s "[[S-branch]]" – a statistical section within the Admiralty.

At the 1945 General Election he stood as Liberal candidate for [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] and finished third.

In 1966, Harrod, was the 2nd winner of the prestigious [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy#Bernhard Harms Prize|Bernhard-Harms-Preis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifw-kiel.de/institute/events/prizes-and-awards/bernhard-harms-prize/recipients-of-the-prize/|title=Recipients of the Prize|work=Bernhard Harms Prize|access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> After retiring in 1967, he moved to [[Holt, Norfolk]].

Interviewed for the book ''Authors take Sides on Vietnam'', Harrod declared himself a supporter of the American military campaign in Indochina.<ref>Cecil Woolf and John Bagguley (editors),''Authors Take Sides on Vietnam'', Peter Owen, 1967,(p.49).</ref>

[[Assar Lindbeck]], the former chairman of the [[Nobel Prize Committee]], wrote that Harrod would have been awarded a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] if he had lived longer.

Harrod married [[Billa Harrod|Wilhelmine "Billa" Cresswell]] (1911–2005), step-daughter of General [[Peter Strickland (British Army officer)|Sir Peter Strickland]], in 1938.<ref>Josceline Dimbleby [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/jun/10/guardianobituaries.conservationandendangeredspecies Billa Harrod], ''The Guardian'', 10 June 2005</ref> One of their sons was [[Dominick Harrod]], an economics correspondent for the BBC.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10223953/Dominick-Harrod.html Obituary: Dominick Harrod], telegraph.co.uk, 5 August 2013</ref>

==''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]''==
After the death of his Cambridge friend and colleague, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], in 1946, Harrod and [[Austin Robinson]] wrote a lengthy obituary of Keynes for ''The Economic Journal''.<ref>Volume 57, March 1947.</ref> At the encouragement of [[Geoffrey Keynes]], Harrod then undertook the task of writing a major biography of Keynes. ''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]'' was published to widespread acclaim in 1951, at a time when most of Keynes's family and friends were still alive.

With the post-war influence of so-called [[Keynesian economics]] and then challenges to it, cultural interest in the [[Bloomsbury Group]], and the publication of thirty volumes of ''The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes'' in the 1970s and 1980s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/au/academic/subjects/economics/history-economic-thought-and-methodology/collected-writings-john-maynard-keynes|title=The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes &#124; History of economic thought and methodology}}</ref> high interest in Keynes's life led to further biographies, most prominently by [[Robert Skidelsky]] and Donald Moggridge, and to detailed studies such as by [[Donald Markwell]] on Keynes and international relations. These works have corrected and added details to the Keynes depicted by Harrod, and Skidelsky in particular has contrasted his account of Keynes with what he has depicted as Harrod's hagiography.<ref>For example, Skidelsky in his ''John Maynard Keynes: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920'' (1983) (unlike Harrod) gave prominence to Keynes's homosexual activity in his early adulthood, and to Keynes being a conscientious objector in World War I. See also, e.g., {{jstor|40257846}} Markwell contrasted his account of Keynes's approach to free trade after the 1920s with Harrod's. See, Donald Markwell, ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', 2006.</ref>
