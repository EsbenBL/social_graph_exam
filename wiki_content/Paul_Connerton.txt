'''Paul''' James '''Connerton''' (April 22, 1940 – July 27, 2019) was a British [[Social anthropology|social anthropologist]] best known for his work on social and body memory.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]] to James Connerton, and his wife, Mary (born Perry), he was first educated at Chesterfield Grammar School for Boys, then studied history at [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. After Graduating Connerton went to [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] to study the works of [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxis]]<nowiki/>t philosopher [[György Lukács]] who is best known for his concept of [[Reification (Marxism)|Reification]]. His interest in Lukács motivated him to deepen his knowledge of [[literary theory]] so he enrolled at [[Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge]] and gained another first degree in English. From 1968 to 1972 he continued his research as an unofficial fellow of Caius. Connerton felt increasingly alienated from Lukács, canceled his dissertation project and instead turned to the works of the German neo-Marxist [[Frankfurt School]] around [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]] and [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]], finishing this second dissertation project with his first published monograph ''The Tragedy of Enlightenment: An Essay on the Frankfurt School.'' Paul Connerton spent his career as a private scholar lacking the financial basis that usually enables for such a path.<ref name=":0" /> Later he became a research associate in the [[Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Department of Social Anthropology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/42/kastner_najafi_connerton.php|title=Historical Amnesia: An Interview with Paul Connerton.

He was taken care of by his sister Clare Campbell and loyal friends.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/19/paul-connerton-obituary|title=Paul Connerton obituary|last=Boyle|first=Nicholas|date=August 19, 2019|website=The Guardian|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref>

== Works ==
Connerton gained wide attention in the humanities and social sciences with his trilogy on social memory: ''How Societies Remember'' (1989), ''How [[Modernity]] Forgets'' (2009) and ''The Spirit of Mourning'' (2011). The main focus of these theoretical works lies on the interplay of cognitive and non-cognitive processes that preserve and create knowledge and images of the past, repetitive [[habit]]ualized [[Social practice theory|social practices]] and the socially shaped human body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olick|first=Jeffrey K.|last2=Robbins|first2=Joyce|date=1998|title=Social Memory Studies: From ‚Collective Memory’ to the Historical Sociology of Mnemonic Practices|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=24|pages=105}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Theories of Social Remembering|last=Misztal|first=Barbara A.|publisher=Open University Press|year=2003|location=Maidenhead; Philadelphia|pages=70, 80}}</ref>

In his book ''How Societies Remember'' (1989) Connerton builds upon the basic assumption of scholars like [[Maurice Halbwachs|Halbwachs]], [[Invented tradition|Hobsbawm/Ranger]], [[Pierre Nora|Nora]] and [[David Lowenthal|Lowenthal]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=How Societies Remember|last=Connerton|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|location=Cambridge et al.|pages=105}}</ref> “that there is some such thing as a [[Collective memory|collective or social memory]]“", but he takes a different position  "to where this phenomenon, [...] can be found to be most crucially operative”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How Societies Remember|last=Connerton|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|location=Cambridge et al.|pages=1}}</ref> "The author argues that images of the past and recollected knowledge of the past are conveyed and sustained by [[ritual]] [[Performative turn|performances]] and that performative memory is bodily",<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/how-societies-remember/6CC86C87803676EB0559C10E0E228CC4#fndtn-information|title=How Societies Remember|last=Connerton|first=Paul|date=1989|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref> an argument he takes up from [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=How Societies Remember|last=Connerton|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|location=Cambridge et al.|pages=23}}</ref> [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=How Societies Remember|last=Connerton|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|location=Cambridge et al.|pages=2, 3, 17, 89f.}}</ref> and others. His goal is to show that "bodily social memory is an essential aspect of social memory, but it is an aspect which has until now been badly neglected".<ref name=":1" /> Connerton followed up this work with ''How Modernity Forgets'' (2009), which emphasizes what he calls "place memory," or memory that is dependent upon [[topography]] and particularly upon topography as it relates to the human [[Sociology of the body|body]]. Connerton argues that [[modernity]] is characterized by a particular sort of forgetting "associated with [[Modernization theory|processes]] that separate social life from locality and from human dimensions: superhuman speed, [[Urbanization|megacities]] that are so enormous as to be unmemorable, [[consumerism]] disconnected from the labour process, the [[Obsolescence|short lifespan]] of urban architecture, the disappearance of walkable cities."<ref>Connerton, Paul.
