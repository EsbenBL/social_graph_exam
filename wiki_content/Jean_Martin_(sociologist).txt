==Early life and education==
Martin was born in Melbourne to Elizabeth (née Alexander) and David Craig. Her father was a civil servant born in Scotland.

Martin lectured at the University of Sydney until the birth of her first child, after which she worked part-time and often carried out unpaid research. In 1965, she was appointed as the inaugural professor of sociology at [[La Trobe University]].
