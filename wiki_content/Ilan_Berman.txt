In November 2002, ''[[Al Ahram Weekly]]'' quoted him as remarking with regard to the U.S.'s [[targeted killing]] of al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen,

<blockquote>It is too early to tell whether this event alone will precipitate a shift toward explicit support of such tactics as employed by Israel on Washington's part.  What does seem clear, however, is that the United States and Israel are gravitating toward increasingly similar perceptions, and possibly strategies, in the war on terrorism.<ref>{{cite news|author=Nyier Abdou |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/612/re5.htm |title=Region &#124; Death by Predator |work=Al-Ahram Weekly |date=November 20, 2002 |access-date=May 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123030641/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/612/re5.htm |archive-date=January 23, 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>

He wrote in his 2005 book ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ihhZ8K0dawwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Ilan+inauthor:Berman&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=0&ei=RU34S43AFJCaywT5zoCJCg&client=firefox-a&cd=2 Tehran Rising: Iran's Challenge to the United States]'' and has said in speeches that in displacing Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq which had been an enemy of Iran, and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan which had been a rival, the United States had unintentionally taken away two significant checks on the power of Iran in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/04/27/1615733.htm |title=Iran flaunts options on striking back at West |publisher=Tmcnet.com |date=April 27, 2006 |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-10-02/news/TEHRANRISING_1_1_iran-nuclear-program-berman |title=A Dire Threat; Author details the dangers Iran poses, including its nuclear program and how it finances terror with oil |author=Paul Owens |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=October 2, 2005 |access-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/435142/article-1G1-138963972/focus-iraq-helps-iran |title=Focus on Iraq helps Iran |author=Alexis Fabbri|publisher= UPI Security & Terrorism |date=November 21, 2005 |access-date=November 17, 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=112008172 |title=War in Iraq has Opened Door for Iran |work=Indiana Gazette |date=October 2, 2005 |author= John Hall|access-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

In August 2006 he noted that to that point in time, the U.S. had had a lot of difficulty in convincing especially Russia and China, to support sanctions on Iran for its moving forward with its uranium enrichment program, and that "both Moscow and Beijing are major strategic partners of the Islamic republic and have a vested interest in protecting their investments in the Iranian regime."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-08-27/news/17308451_1_uranium-enrichment-program-iran-sanctions |title=U.N. unlikely to punish Iran – experts / Some say even light sanctions wrong way to curb nuclear drive  |work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 27, 2006 |access-date=May 23, 2010 | first=Matthew B. | last=Stannard}}</ref>  In July 2008 he observed: ""The Iranians are playing a colossal game of chicken with us," and asked: "Does the international community have the will to take the short-term pain and disarm these guys, or accept the long-term pain of a region completely dominated by this regime? I think the world community has essentially come to grips with the fact that Iran is going to go nuclear."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/464747 |title=Iran talks 'colossal game of chicken' |work=The Toronto Star |date=July 22, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2010 |location=Toronto |first=Olivia |last=Ward}}</ref>

In October 2009, Berman noted:  "The Iranian strategy has been pretty consistent all along; to keep the West talking while they work on their nuclear program."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aYp.EUNWOqco |title=Iran Reply to UN Fuel Plan Falls Short of Acceptance (Update1) |author=Jonathan Tirone and Ali Sheikholeslami|publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=October 29, 2009 |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref>  In March 2010, commenting on Iran's warning to Europe not to sanction it, he observed:

<blockquote>The Iranians have a pattern of warning anyone threatening to get tough with them, basically saying, 'Don't do this, because there will be consequences.  What's notable here is that they are singling out Europe.  It's a sure sign Europe is being more activist [about curtailing economic ties to Iran] than it normally is."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/0301/Nuclear-weapons-worries-Is-threat-of-Iran-sanctions-making-Tehran-testy-with-Europe |title=Nuclear weapons worries: Is threat of Iran sanctions making Tehran testy with Europe? |work=The Christian Science Monitor  |author= Howard LaFranchi |date=March 1, 2010 |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Lou Dobbs]] of CNN in 2008 described him as "one of the [U.S.]'s leading experts on the Middle East and Iran."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0812/17/ldt.01.html |title=CNN.com – Transcripts |publisher=CNN |date=December 17, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref>
