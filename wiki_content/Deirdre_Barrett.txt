'''Deirdre Barrett''' is an American author and psychologist known for her research on [[dream]]s, [[hypnosis]] and [[imagery]], and has written on [[evolutionary psychology]]. Barrett is a teacher at [[Harvard Medical School]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/display/person/39720 |title=Harvard Catalyst Profiles |publisher=Harvard College |access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>  and a past president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams and of the [[American Psychological Association]]’s Div. 30, the Society for Psychological Hypnosis. She is editor-in-chief of the journal ''Dreaming: The Journal of the Association for the Study of Dreams'' and a consulting editor for ''Imagination, Cognition, and Personality'' and ''The International Journal for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis''.

She has written five books for the general public: ''[[Pandemic Dreams]]'' (2020), ''[[The Pregnant Man and Other Cases From a Hypnotherapist's Couch]]'' (1998), ''[[The Committee of Sleep]]'' (2001), ''[[Waistland]]'' (2007), and ''[[Supernormal Stimuli]]'' (2010). She is the editor of four academic books: ''[[Trauma and Dreams]]'' (1996), ''[[The New Science of Dreaming]]'' (2007), ''[[Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams]]'' (2012).

==Research==
Barrett is best known for her work on dreams and their contributions to creativity and objective problem solving.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1152884251.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+29%2C+2006&author=&desc=Four+Experts+Try+to+Get+Inside+Readers%27+Heads. THE WASHINGTON POST; Four Experts Try to Get Inside Readers' Heads Oct 29, 2006; M.4]</ref> She interviewed modern artists and scientists about their use of their dreams, documenting dramatic anecdotes including [[Nobel Prizes]] and [[MacArthur Foundation]] '[[genius grant]]s' whose ideas originated in dreams.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812932412 Barrett, Deirdre.

The 'Committee of Sleep': A Study of Dream Incubation for Problem Solving.

The New Science of Dreaming, Volume III: Cultural and Theoretical Perspectives on Dreaming NY, NY: Praeger/Greenwood, 2007.]</ref> and believes we continue to work on all the same problems—personal and objective—in that state. Her research concludes that while anything—math, musical composition, business dilemmas—may get solved during dreaming, the two areas dreams are especially likely to help are 1) anything where vivid visualization contributes to the solution, whether in artistic design or invention of 3-D technological devices and 2) any problem where the solution lies in thinking outside the box&mdash;i.e. where the person is stuck because the conventional wisdom on how to approach the problem is wrong.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/61116074.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+28%2C+2000&author=Don+Oldenburg&desc=You%3A+Dream+a+Little+Dream--and+Pay+Attention.

Barrett’s studies of hypnosis have focused on different types of high hypnotizables, finding two subgroups which she terms fantasizers and dissociaters. Fantasizers are people who have vivid imaginations, find it easy to block out real-world stimuli, spend much time daydreaming, report imaginary companions as a child and grew up with parents who encouraged imaginary play. Dissociaters usually had a history of [[Child abuse|childhood abuse]] or other significant trauma, had learned to escape into numbness, and to forget unpleasant events. Their association to “daydreaming” was often going blank rather than vividly recalled fantasies. Both score equally high on formal scales of [[hypnotic susceptibility]].<ref>Barrett, Deirdre.

Other research by Barrett focused on the similarities and differences of daydreams and nocturnal dreaming<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o_Y3HwAACAAJ&dq=inauthor:Deirdre+inauthor:Barrett Barrett, Deirdre.

Hypnosis in Film and Television American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, Vol. 49, No. 1, July 2006, pp. 13-30.</ref>

Most recently Barrett has written on evolutionary psychology, especially the concept of [[Supernormal Stimuli|supernormal stimuli]]—the idea that technology can create an artificial object which pulls an instinct more strongly than that for which it evolved. The phrase "supernormal stimuli" was coined by the Dutch scientist Niko Tinbergen in the 1930s.
