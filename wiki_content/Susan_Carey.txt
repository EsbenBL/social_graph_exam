==Biography==
Carey was born in 1942 to William and Mary Carey. She received her BA from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1964, a [[Fulbright]] scholarship to study in [[University of London]] in 1965, and her PhD in [[experimental psychology]] from Harvard University in 1971.

She was employed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1972 to 1996 in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. She was an assistant professor from 1972-1977, an associate professor from 1977 to 1984, and a full professor from 1984 to 1996. She was a professor at New York University in the department of psychology from 1996 to 2001. In 2001 she joined the faculty at Harvard University.

Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett coined the term "[[fast mapping]]" in 1978.<ref name=AASNW /><ref name=APS /> This term refers to the hypothesized mental process where a new concept is learned based only on a single exposure. In 1985 Carey wrote "Conceptual Change in Childhood", a book about the cognitive differences between children and adults. It is a case study about children's acquisition of biological knowledge and analyzes the ways the knowledge is restructured during development. The book reconciles [[Jean Piaget]]'s work on [[animism]] with later work on children's knowledge of biological concepts.

On returning to Harvard, Carey began working alongside Elizabeth Spelke, and they started the Laboratory for Developmental Studies. Carey also studied alongside George Miller, Jerome Butler, and Roger Brown. She conducted experiments on infants, toddlers, adults, and non-human primates. Carey coined the term "Quinian bootstrapping", a theory that people build complex concepts out of simple ones.<ref name=APA_bootstrapping>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.apa.org/quinian-bootstrapping|title=APA Dictionary of Psychology}}</ref>

In 2009 Carey wrote ''The Origin of Concepts'', which shows the basis of development of cognitive science.<ref name=Rumelhart /> The book won the 2010 Eleanor Maccoby Book Award of the [[American Psychological Association]].

Carey has served on editorial boards for the Psychological Review, Psychological Science, Journal of Acquisition, and Development Psychology.

==Personal life==

Carey is married to the professor of philosophy [[Ned Block]] (NYU).

==Awards==

Carey received the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] for philosophy of mind in 1998. In 2009 she was the first woman to receive the [[Rumelhart Prize|David E. Rumelhart Prize]] for significant contributions to the theoretical foundation of human [[cognition]].

Carey is a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Susan+E.+Carey&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-05-17|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine]],{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and the [[British Academy]].
