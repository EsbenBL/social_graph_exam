== Biography ==
Rubinstein was born in Czernowitz (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], now [[Chernivtsi|Chernivtsi, Ukraine]])<ref name="nord" /> into the [[Jews|Jewish]] family of the banker and parliamentarian Isak Rubinstein (c. 1804–1878). Her mother died when she was young.<ref>''History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries'', Volume 2 edited by Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, p. 66</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kurzbiografie Rubinstein|url=https://www.parlament.gv.at/WWER/PARL/J1848/Rubinstein.shtml|access-date=2020-10-02|website=www.parlament.gv.at}}</ref>

She and her three siblings were greatly encouraged to pursue their education, even though this was a time when girls were often denied that opportunity. (A high school for girls was eventually opened in Czernowitz in1898 and a girls' grammar school was established only during the years just before the [[World War I|First World War]].)<ref name=":0" />

At first, her father arranged for Rubinstein to take private lessons but, when it came time to finish high school, she was unable to take the necessary examinations from tutors, so she did so before an academic committee from a boys' high school.<ref name=":0" />

Rubinstein went on to study psychology and German literature at the [[Charles University|University of Prague]], in the spring of 1870, and then at the [[Leipzig University]] three years later.<ref name=":0" /> After being denied admission to the doctoral program in [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]], she enrolled at the University of Bern and there she gained a Ph.D. in 1874 in psychology and German literature. By doing so, she became the first woman to receive a doctorate in Bern.<ref name=":0" /> Her thesis was "''Uber die sensoriellen und sensitiven Sinne''" ("''About the sensory and sensitive senses''").<ref name="cornis">{{cite book|last1=Cornis-Pope|first1=Marcel|last2=Neubauer|first2=John|title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries, Volume 2|date=2004|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=9789027234537|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&q=%22Susanna+Rubinstein%22&pg=PA66}}</ref>

With the  completion of her doctorate, Rubinstein spent a year in Germany visiting Leipzig, Heidelberg and Munich.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Lexikoneintrag zu der Schriftstellerin Dr. phil.

Her 1878 work "''Psychologisch-Asthetische Essays''" ("Psychological-Aesthetic Essays") has been described as "a major contribution to the study of human emotions".<ref name="cornis" /> It was reprinted in 2012 (Nabu Press, {{ISBN| 978-1277814729}}).

Susanna Rubinstein died 29 March 1914 in [[Würzburg]], Germany.<ref name=":0" />
