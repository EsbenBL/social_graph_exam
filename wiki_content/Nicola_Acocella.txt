'''Nicola Acocella''' (born 3 July 1939) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[economist]] and [[academic]], [[Emeritus Professor]] of Economic Policy since 2014.<ref>[http://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/estratti/Delibera%20n.%20461_8.20%20Titolo%20emerito%20ACOCELLA.pdf Resolution n. 461/14 of the University’s].</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/60654c58-7883-11e3-831c-00144feabdc0.html|title= Recovery claims met with derision in Rome|publisher= Financial Times|date= January 8, 2014|access-date= January 14, 2014}}</ref>

In 1963 he graduated in [[Economics]] from the “[[Sapienza University of Rome]]” with a thesis on ‘''Time lags in economic policy''’, under the supervision of [[Federico Caffè]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.repubblica.it/dal-quotidiano/r2/2012/04/08/news/i_ragazzi_che_cercarono_il_professor_caff-32956773/?ref=search|title= it: 'I ragazzi che cercarono il professor Caffè (EN: 'The boys who looked for Professor Caffè.')|publisher= Repubblica|date= April 8, 2012|access-date= September 12, 2013}}</ref> After becoming full professor (1980), he got a reputation for his holistic contribution to systematisation and development of Economic policy. He also introduced remarkable innovations in the theory of economic policy as well as in monetary and fiscal policy and the theory of social pacts.

== Academic career ==
During his career Prof. Acocella had the opportunity to exchange views or to co-operate with some of the most important economists of the twentieth century, such as [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and other eminent professors like [[Paul De Grauwe]], [[Alexis Jacquemin]], [[Adrian Pagan]], [[Luigi Pasinetti|Luigi L. Pasinetti]], Douglas Hibbs, [[Andrew Hughes Hallett]], Peter J. Hammond.

He has visited, among others, the [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Toronto|Toronto]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Reading|Reading]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] as well as the [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]].<ref>Curriculum Vitae of Prof. Acocella on the website of the Department of Methods and Models for Economics, Territory and Finance, [https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/acocella-nicola-curriculum Faculty of Economics, Sapienza University of Rome].</ref>

He has been Professor of Economics with the [[University of Perugia]]; Professor of [[Industrial organization]] and [[Economic Policy]] at the [[University of Calabria]]; Professor of Economic Policy, Sapienza University of Rome. He has also been Head of the Department of Economics, [[University of Calabria]]; Head of the Economics Graduate Studies Program, Sapienza University of Rome; Member of the Research Commission, Sapienza University of Rome<ref>Profile on the website of the Department of Methods and Models for Economics, Territory and Finance, [https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/users/acocella-nicola Faculty of Economics, Sapienza University of Rome].</ref>

== Membership and associations ==
* Member of the Executive Committee of the ‘Società Italiana degli Economisti’ (<small>EN</small>: ‘Italian Economic Association’) (2007–10).
* Vice-president of the ‘Società Italiana degli Economisti’ (EN: ‘Italian Economic Association’) (2016–)
* Member of the Committee for a full professorship in Macroeconomics, [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|Wirtschaftsuniversität]], [[Vienna]] (2009).

== Research and contributions to economic analysis ==
Prof. Acocella has developed his expertise in several research fields. He worked first on [[industrial organisation]] and [[globalization]]. Among his numerous contributions in this field: a dynamic version of the static limit pricing model by [[Joe S. Bain|Bain]], [[Franco Modigliani|Modigliani]] and Sylos Labini and a model for transfer pricing by [[Multinational corporation|multinational firms]] as well as a number of essays on the distributional and employment effects of [[globalization]]<ref>{{cite news| url= http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1999/12/13/se-produrre-all-estero-crea-lavoro.html?ref=search|title= it: 'Se produrre all'estero crea lavoro' (EN: 'Does producing abroad create jobs?')|publisher= Repubblica|date= December 13, 1999|access-date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1984/10/30/la-multinazionale-italia-ha-205-mila-dipendenti.html?ref=search|title= it: 'La multinazionale Italia ha 205 mila dipendenti' (EN: 'Italian multinationals have 205,000 employees abroad')|publisher= Repubblica|date= October 30, 1984|access-date=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

He has also contributed to the theory of social pacts, their substitutability with other institutions – such as a conservative central banker – in order to ensure monetary stability, their implementation, with specific reference to the long-term Italian issue of a low [[productivity]] dynamics.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2012/10/08/un-nuovo-modello-di-patto-sociale-per.html?ref=search|title= it: 'Un nuovo modello di PattoSociale per la produttività' (EN: 'A new model of Social Pact for productivity growth.')|publisher= Repubblica|date= October 8, 2012|access-date=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

He has also investigated [[Monetary policy|monetary]] and [[fiscal policy]], both in abstract terms (dealing in particular with: conditions for their effectiveness, existence of a non vertical long-run [[Phillips curve]], optimal [[Inflation|inflation rate]]) and with reference to the European institutional architecture (optimality of co-ordinated fiscal action and monetary policy orientation).<ref>{{cite news| url= http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2000/05/01/la-bce-il-mito-della-stabilita-monetaria.html?ref=search|title= it: 'La Bce e il mito della stabilità monetaria' (EN: 'The ECB and the myth of monetary stability')|publisher=Corriere|date= May 1, 2000|access-date=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

A final path of analysis has led him to lay down a systematic approach to economic policy as a discipline to some extent autonomous from the rest of economic science, by enquiring on the various needs to heal market failures as well as the directions and the design of [[public policy]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/dcf358c4-ab4d-11e0-b4d8-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dcf358c4-ab4d-11e0-b4d8-00144feabdc0.html&_i_referer=http://search.ft.com/search?queryText=acocella|title= 'Europe's leaders must look seriously at New Deal plan.

About one of his contributions the [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel prize]] [[Amartya Sen]] has said:

{{cquote|“Professor Nicola Acocella has provided an illuminating and challenging account of the foundations of economic policy. His analysis covers the established ground as well as providing new departures; the book is a rich addition to the existing literature.”<br>Praise for: Acocella, N. [1994], “The Foundations of Economic Policy. Values and Techniques”.<ref>See the last page of the book [https://books.google.com/books?id=ud0UEDeh_kUC&pg=PA522 “The Foundations of Economic Policy. Values and Techniques”].</ref> |4=[[Amartya Sen|A. Sen]]}}

Of specific interest is his reformulation (together with [[Giovanni Di Bartolomeo]] and [[Andrew Hughes Hallett]]) of the classical theory of [[economic policy]] laid down by [[Jan Tinbergen]], [[Henri Theil|Theil]] and [[Ragnar Frisch]] in a setting immune from [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Lucas]] critique. This offers a novel contribution to the analysis of conditions not only for policy effectiveness or neutrality (showing the limits of validity of many currently accepted propositions on the effects of rational [[Expected value|expectations]] and time inconsistency as well as on the role of policy announcements), but also for existence, uniqueness or multiplicity of the equilibrium in strategic games. The theory is of use also in an institutional perspective as a theory of conflict resolutions and optimal institution setting.
