==Moralistic therapeutic deism==
In his 2005 book ''Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers'' co-written with  Melinda Lundquist Denton, he introduced the term ''[[moralistic therapeutic deism]]'' (abbreviated ''MTD'') to describe the common religious beliefs exhibited by [[Demographics of the United States|American youth]] in a survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/aprilweb-only/116-11.0.html|title=Death by Deism|last=Collin|first=Hansen|date=20 April 2009|website=[[Christianity Today]]|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="veith">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/10775|title=A nation of deists|last=Veith|first=Gene Edward|authorlink=Gene Edward Veith|date=25 June 2005|website=[[World (magazine)|World]]|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.youthandreligion.org/news/2005-0929.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027232841/http://www.youthandreligion.org/news/2005-0929.html |archive-date=2012-10-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has also been referred to as ''egonovism''.<ref name="Egonovism">{{cite web|title=The Number One Religion in the U.S. May Be Egonovism, Not Christianity|access-date=15 September 2010|url=http://www.revrob.com/society-topmenu-49/152-the-number-one-religion-in-the-us-may-be-egonovism-not-christianity-}}</ref> The book summarized the "National Study of Youth and Religion", privately funded by the [[Lilly Endowment]].

They label moralistic therapeutic deism as a religion with the following traits:
{{quote|
#A God exists who created and ordered the world and watches over human life on earth.
#God wants people to be good, nice, and fair to each other, as taught in the Bible and by most world religions.
#The central goal of life is to be happy and to feel good about oneself.
#God does not need to be particularly involved in one's life except when God is needed to resolve a problem.
#Good people go to [[heaven]] when they die.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Christian |last2=Denton |first2=Melinda Lundquist |year=2005 |title=Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers |url=https://archive.org/details/soulsearchingrel00smit_748 |url-access=limited |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/soulsearchingrel00smit_748/page/n172 162]–163 |isbn=978-0-19-803997-6}}</ref>

==Critical realism==
Critical realism (CR) is, in Smith's view, the most promising general approach to social science for best framing our research and theory. CR, as a philosophy of (social) science (not a [[sociological theory]] ''per se''), offers the best alternative to the problems and limits presented by positivist empiricism, hermeneutical interpretivism, strong social constructionism, and postmodernist deconstruction. It is the meta-theoretical direction in which American sociology needs to move

Smith's work in CR involves ''What is a Person? Rethinking Humanity, Social Life, and the Moral Good from the Person Up'' (Chicago 2010) (with ''Moral, Believing Animals'' (OUP 2003) forming a pre-CR theoretical backdrop); ''To Flourish or Destruct: A Personalist Theory of Human Goods, Motivations, Failure, and Evil'' (Chicago 2014), and ''Religion: What it Is, How it Works, and Why it Matters ''(Princeton 2017).''

CR is a significant position within which scholars work in Great Britain, Scandinavia, and the rest of Europe. Yet few North American sociologists are aware of the substance and importance of the CR account. Smith's view is that CR is a genuinely alternative approach to reality and social science that requires serious, focused study and intellectual re-tooling in order to learn well enough to not simply fall back into the old assumptions, instincts, and paradigms.
