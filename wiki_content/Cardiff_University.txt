'''Cardiff University''' ({{lang-cy|Prifysgol Caerdydd}}), a [[public research university]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], was established in 1883 as the '''University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire''' and became a founding college of the [[University of Wales]] in 1893. It merged with the '''University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology''' (UWIST) in 1988 as the '''University of Wales College, Cardiff''' ('''University of Wales, Cardiff''', from 1996). In 1997 it received [[Academic degree|degree]]-awarding powers, but held them in abeyance. It adopted the [[trade name|operating name]] of Cardiff University in 1999; this became its legal name in 2005, when it became an independent university awarding its own degrees.

Cardiff University is the only Welsh member of the [[Russell Group]] of research-intensive British universities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://russellgroup.ac.uk/about/our-universities/ |title=Our universities |publisher=Russell Group |access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref> Academics and alumni of the university have included three heads of state or government, two Nobel Prize winners, 15 fellows of the Royal Society, 11 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering, seven fellows of the British Academy, 21 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences and 34 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Honours and awards |url=https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/about/honours-and-awards|access-date=2021-04-29 |website=Cardiff University |language=en}}</ref>

==Present status==
Cardiff University is the third oldest [[Universities in Wales|university in Wales]] and contains three colleges: Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; Biomedical and Life Sciences; and Physical Sciences and Engineering.

In 2018–2019, Cardiff had a turnover of £537.1 million, including £116.0 million in research grants and contracts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1738880/CU_AnnualReviewAccounts2018-19-English.pdf| title=FS Cardiff University}}</ref> It has an undergraduate enrolment of {{HESA undergraduate population|INSTID=0179}} and a total enrolment of {{HESA student population|INSTID=0179}} (according to HESA data for {{HESA year}})<ref name="HESA citation">{{HESA citation}}</ref> making it one of the ten [[list of universities in the United Kingdom by enrolment|largest UK universities]]. The [[Cardiff University Students' Union]] works to promote student interests in the university and further afield.

==History==
===University College===
[[File:Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare NPG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Lord Aberdare]] was instrumental in the University's founding.]]
Discussions on the founding of a university college in [[South Wales]] began in 1879, when a group of Welsh and English [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]] urged the government to consider the poor provision of higher and intermediate [[education in Wales]] and "the best means of assisting any local effort which may be made for supplying such deficiency."<ref>{{Cite hansard |house=House of Commons |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1879/jul/18/education-wales-resolution#S3V0247P0_18790718_HOC_65 |title=Education (Wales Resolution) |date=18 July 1879}}</ref>

In October 1881, [[William Gladstone]]'s government appointed a departmental committee to conduct "an enquiry into the nature and extent of intermediate and higher education in Wales", chaired by [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Lord Aberdare]] and consisting of [[Frederick Campbell, 3rd Earl Cawdor|Viscount Emlyn]], Reverend Prebendary H. G. Robinson, [[Henry Richard]], [[John Rhys]] and [[Lewis Morris (1833–1907)|Lewis Morris]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=W.

The committee cited the unique Welsh national identity and noted that many students in Wales could not afford to travel to University in England or Scotland. It advocated a national degree-awarding university for Wales, composed of regional colleges, which should be non-sectarian in nature and exclude the teaching of theology.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=W.

[[File:Statue of John Viriamu Jones.jpg|thumbnail|right|John Viriamu Jones was the founding Principal of the College.]]
After the recommendation was published, [[Cardiff Council|Cardiff Corporation]] sought to secure the location of the college in Cardiff, and on 12 December 1881 formed a University College Committee to aid the matter.<ref name="Cardiff Council Minutes">{{Cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=John Hobson |title='Cardiff Council Minutes: 1881-3', Cardiff Records: volume 5 |date=1905 |pages=62–84 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=48187 |access-date=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710034203/http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=48187 |archive-date=10 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> There was competition to be the site between [[Swansea]] and Cardiff. On 12 March 1883, after arbitration, a decision was made in Cardiff's favour.<ref name="Cardiff Council Minutes"/> This was strengthened by the need to consider the interests of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], at that time not legally incorporated into Wales, and the greater sum received by Cardiff in support of the college, through a public appeal that raised £37,000 and a number of private donations, notably from the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|Lord Bute]] and [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Lord Windsor]].<ref>{{Cite hansard |house=House of Commons |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1884/jun/09/instruction-to-the-committee#S3V0288P0_18840609_HOC_11 |title=Cardiff Corporation Bill |date=9 June 1884}}</ref><ref name="Studies in higher education in Ireland and Wales, with suggestions for universities and colleges in the United States">{{Cite book |last1=MACLEAN |first1=GEORGE EDWIN |title=Studies in higher education in Ireland and Wales, with suggestions for universities and colleges in the United States |date=1917 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE |location=Washington DC |page=71 |url=https://archive.org/stream/studiesinhighere00macl/studiesinhighere00macl_djvu.txt |access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref> In April Lord Aberdare was appointed as the College's first president.<ref name="Cardiff Council Minutes"/> The possible locations considered included [[Cardiff Arms Park]], Cathedral Road, and Moira Terrace, [[Roath]], before the site of the Old Royal Infirmary buildings on Newport Road was chosen.<ref name="Cardiff Council Minutes"/>

The ''University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire'' opened on 24 October 1883 with courses in Biology, Chemistry, English, French, German, Greek, History, Latin, Mathematics and Astronomy, Music, Welsh, Logic and Philosophy, and Physics. It was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] the following year, this being the first in Wales to allow the enrolment of women, and specifically forbidding religious tests for entry.<ref name="Studies in higher education in Ireland and Wales, with suggestions for universities and colleges in the United States"/> [[John Viriamu Jones]] was appointed as the University's first Principal at the age of 27. As Cardiff was not an independent university and could not award its own degrees, it prepared its students for examinations of the [[University of London]] or for further study at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Student Lists |url=http://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/our-collections/historic-collections/archives-manuscripts/university-of-london-student-records-1836-1931/ |publisher=Senate House Library |access-date=27 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914105055/http://www.shl.lon.ac.uk/specialcollections/archives/studentrecords.shtml |archive-date=14 September 2010 |df=dmy}}</ref>

In 1888 the University College at Cardiff and that of North Wales (now [[Bangor University]]) proposed to the University College Wales at Aberystwyth joint action to gain a university charter for Wales, modelled on that of [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|Victoria University]], a confederation of new universities in Northern England. Such a charter was granted to the new [[University of Wales]] in 1893, allowing the colleges to award degrees as members. The Chancellor was set ''[[ex officio]]'' as the [[Prince of Wales]], and the position of operational head would rotate among heads of the colleges.<ref name="Studies in higher education in Ireland and Wales, with suggestions for universities and colleges in the United States"/>

In 1885, [[Aberdare Hall]] opened as the first hall of residence, allowing women access to the university. This moved to its current site in 1895, but remains a single-sex hall. In 1904 came the appointment of the first female associate professor in the UK, [[Millicent Mackenzie]], who in 1910 became the first female full professor at a fully chartered UK university.

In 1901 Principal Jones persuaded Cardiff Corporation to give the college a five-acre site in Cathays Park (instead of selling it as they would have done otherwise).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Poulton |first1=Edward |title=John Viriamu Jones and other Oxford Memories |url=https://archive.org/details/johnviriamujone00poulgoog |date=1911 |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnviriamujone00poulgoog/page/n180 156] }}</ref> Soon after, in 1905, work on a new building commenced under the architect [[W. D. Caröe]]. Money ran short for the project, however. Although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s, the planned Great Hall has never been built. Caroe sought to combine the charm and elegance of his former ([[Trinity College, Cambridge]]) with the picturesque balance of many [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] colleges. On 14 October 1909 the "New College" building in Cathays Park (now Main Building) was opened in a ceremony involving a procession from the "Old College" in Newport Road.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Opening of the New College |work=Cap and Gown |issue=7 |publisher=University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire |date=14 October 1909}}</ref>

In 1931, the School of Medicine, founded as part of the college in 1893 along with the Departments of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Pharmacology, was split off to form the Welsh National School of Medicine, which was renamed in 1984 the [[University of Wales College of Medicine]].

In 1972, the institution was renamed ''University College Cardiff''.<ref>[http://www.hefcw.ac.uk/about_he_in_wales/higher_education_institutions/cardiff_university.aspx "Cardiff University"], Higher Education Funding Council for Wales</ref>

===1988 merger===
In 1988, University College Cardiff underwent financial difficulties, and a declaration of insolvency was considered.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shattock |first1=Michael |title=Financial Management in Universities: The Lessons from University College, Cardiff |journal=Financial Accountability & Management |date=1988 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=99–112 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0408.1988.tb00063.x }}</ref> This led to a merger with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST), to form the ''University of Wales College of Cardiff''. The Principal of the new institution was [[Sir Aubrey Trotman-Dickenson]], who had been the principal of UWIST. After changes to the constitution in 1996, its name was changed to the ''University of Wales, Cardiff''.

In the early 1990s, the university's computer systems served as the home for [[The Internet Movie Database]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://help.imdb.com/imdb?history|title=IMDb &#124; Help|website=help.imdb.com}}</ref>

===Independence and 2004 merger===
[[File:AJ Moses and Queen.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Elizabeth II with Anthony J. Moses during her visit in Cardiff University in 2000]]
In 1997, the college was granted full independent degree-awarding powers by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], though, as a member of the University of Wales it could not begin using them, and in 1999 the public name of the university was changed to Cardiff University.

In 2002, ideas were floated to merge Cardiff again with the [[University of Wales College of Medicine]], after publication of the [[Welsh Assembly|Welsh Assembly Government's]] review of higher education in Wales. This merger became effective on 1 August 2004, when Cardiff University ceased to be a constituent of the University of Wales and became an independent "link institution" affiliated to the federal university. The process of the merger was completed on 1 December 2004, when the [[Act of Parliament]] transferring UWCM's assets to Cardiff University received Royal Assent. On 17 December it was announced that the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] had given approval to the new Supplemental Charter and had granted university status to Cardiff, legally changing the name of the institution to Cardiff University. Cardiff awarded University of Wales degrees to students admitted before 2005, but these have been replaced by Cardiff degrees.

[[File:Cardiff University Graduation Ceremony.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Cardiff University graduation ceremony in 2006]]
In 2005, Wales College of Medicine, as part of the University, launched the North Wales Clinical School in [[Wrexham]], in collaboration with the [[Glyndŵr University|North East Wales Institute of Higher Education]] in Wrexham, the [[University of Wales, Bangor]], and the [[NHS Wales|National Health Service in Wales]]. This received funds of £12.5&nbsp;million from the [[Welsh Assembly]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/news/archivepress/healthpress/healthpress2005/708646/?lang=en |access-date=4 July 2008 |title=Health Minister opens North Wales Clinical School |publisher=[[Welsh Assembly Government]] }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and trebled the number of trainee doctors in clinical training in Wales over a four-year period.

The university also has a popular Centre for [[Lifelong Learning]], which has been teaching a wide range of courses for over 125 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/mediacentre/mediareleases/Dec08/new-book-celebrates-125-years-of-lifelong-learning-at-cardiff-university.html |access-date=16 May 2009 |title=New book celebrates 125 years of Lifelong Learning at Cardiff University=Cardiff University }}{{dead link |date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> However in July 2009, the University announced it was ending over 250 humanities courses at the centre, making over 100 staff redundant. The University has since reintroduced a number of humanities courses for a trial period beginning in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/part-time-courses-for-adults|title=Part-time courses for adults|website=Cardiff University}}</ref>

In June 2010, the University launched three new research institutes,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2010/06/14/cardiff-creating-three-research-institutes-91466-26644003/ |title=Cardiff creating three research institutes |date=13 June 2010 |access-date=21 June 2010 |publisher=[[WalesOnline]]}}</ref> each offering a new approach to a major modern research issue. The Neurosciences and Mental Health Research Institute and the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute are housed in the purpose-built [[Hadyn Ellis]] Building, and in the Sustainable Places Research Institute. Another part of the Science and Development Campus, the [[Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre]] (CUBRIC), opened in June 2016 for [[neuroimaging]] research.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibigroup.com/2016/06/08/hrh-the-queen-opens-innovative-cubric-building/ |title=Her Majesty The Queen Opens Innovative CUBRIC Building |date=8 June 2016 |publisher=IBI Group |access-date=24 July 2017}}</ref>

==Insignia and other representations==
===Motto===

It is taken from the prayer for the [[Church militant and church triumphant|Church militant]] as it appears in the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]].<ref name="Cardiff Motto">{{Cite web |title=Cardiff Motto |last=Cardiff Motto |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/about/history/index.html |access-date=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815174049/http://cardiff.ac.uk/about/history/index.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Coat of arms===

Cardiff University's current [[coat of arms]] was granted by the [[College of Arms]] in 1988 following the merger of University College Cardiff and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology.<ref name="History of Cardiff University">{{Cite web |title=History of Cardiff University |url=http://cardiff.ac.uk/about/history/ |access-date=25 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101032813/http://cardiff.ac.uk/about/history/ |archive-date=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The coat of arms incorporates features from the [[heraldry]] of both former institutions. The three [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] are derived from the arms of the [[de Clare]] [[Lordship of Glamorgan|lords of Glamorgan]]. The open book signifies learning; on it are the [[crescent]] and [[Annulet (heraldry)|annulet]], [[Marks of Cadency|marks of cadence]] that indicate that University College Cardiff was the second of the University of Wales' institutions, and that the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology was the fifth.<ref name="Cardiff University coat of arms">{{Cite web |title=Cardiff University coat of arms |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/identity/coatofarms.html |access-date=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924054418/http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/identity/coatofarms.html |archive-date=24 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A notable feature of the arms are the [[Supporter (heraldry)|supporters]], which in heraldry are rarely granted to universities. The supporters are an angel from University College Cardiff and a [[Welsh Dragon]] from the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a Welsh dragon in the stance of a lion; it stands on the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]]. Both the dragon and the helmet are distinguished by being front-facing rather than in profile as is more usually found in [[Welsh heraldry]].<ref name="Cardiff University coat of arms" />

==Workload controversy==
On 19 February 2018, Malcolm Anderson, a university lecturer committed [[suicide]] off of a university building and died at age 48.<ref name="BBC News Feb 2018 1" /><ref name="BBC News Feb 2018 2" /><ref name="BBC News 2018" /><ref name="Reidy 2020" /><ref name="Haf Jones 2019">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47296631|title=Lecturer's widow hits out at Cardiff University workload|last=Haf Jones|first=Catrin|date=20 February 2019|website=[[BBC News]]|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> The inquiry determined that Anderson's suicide was the result of a high-pressure workload.<ref name="BBC News 2018" /><ref name="Reidy 2020" />

In 2020, Grace Krause, a PhD student employed at Cardiff University started experiencing [[headache]]s and [[back pain]] after lengthy work at a computer.<ref name="Reidy 2020" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/overworked-undervalued-crippling-stress-university-15422303|title=Overworked and undervalued: The crippling stress university lecturers face|last=Deacon|first=Thomas|date=18 November 2018|website=WalesOnline|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> She [[Twitter|tweeted]] that "Staff are marking hundreds of essays in an impossibly short time. It is exhausting. Everyone is in crisis mode. Stressed, moody, morose, everyone feels like they’re drowning."<ref name="Reidy 2020" /> Soon after, an email from the university was sent to all PhD students asking for these comments to be deleted, in order to avoid negative media attention.<ref name="Reidy 2020" /> This has since sparked a debate about [[freedom of speech]] between employers and employees.<ref name="Reidy 2020" />
