'''Jacob Levy Moreno''' (born '''Iacob Levy'''; May 18, 1889 – May 14, 1974) was a Romanian-American [[psychiatrist]], [[psychosociology|psychosociologist]], and [[educator]], the founder of [[psychodrama]], and the foremost pioneer of [[group psychotherapy]]. During his lifetime, he was recognized as one of the leading [[social scientists]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:J L Moreno Pleven TB.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Moreno's ancestral home in [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]], and a close-up view of the commemorative plaque]]
Jacob Levy Moreno was born in [[Bucharest]] in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. His father was Moreno Nissim Levy, a [[Sephardi]] [[Jewish]] merchant born in 1856 in Plevna in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (today [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]]). Jacob's grandfather Buchis had moved to Plevna from [[Constantinople]], where his ancestors had settled after they left Spain in 1492. It is thought that the Morenos left Plevna for Bucharest during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], following the Plevna rabbi, Haim Bejarano in search of a more hospitable environment. Jacob Moreno's mother, Paulina Iancu or Wolf, was also a Sephardi Jew, born in 1873, and originated from [[Călăraşi]], Romania.<ref name="marineau">{{cite book|last=Marineau|first=René F.|title=Jacob Levy Moreno, 1889-1974: father of psychodrama, sociometry, and group psychotherapy|publisher=Routledge|year=1989|pages=4–6|chapter=Ancestors and family: the birth of a myth|isbn=978-0-415-04383-0}}</ref>

In 1895, a time of great intellectual creativity and political turmoil, the family moved to [[Vienna]]. He studied [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Vienna]], becoming a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1917. He had rejected Freudian theory while still a medical student, and became interested in the potential of group settings for therapeutic practice.<ref name="lucyozarin">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030727190530/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/38/10/60 Biographical detail]: article by Lucy Ozarin, ''Psychiatric News'' (Volume 38, Number 10), May 16, 2003. Retrieved on December 29, 2007.</ref>

In his autobiography, Moreno recalls this encounter with [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1912. "I attended one of Freud’s lectures. He had just finished an analysis of a telepathic dream. As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them on the street and in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'"<ref name="autobiography">The Autobiography of J. L. Moreno, M.D.

==Marriages and children==
In Brooklyn, New York, Moreno married Beatrice Beecher in 1926. The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1938 he married Florence Bridge, with whom he had one child, [[Regina Moreno]] (born 1939). They too were divorced, and he married [[Zerka T. Moreno|Zerka Toeman]] in 1949, with whom he had one child [[Jonathan D. Moreno]] (born 1952).<ref>[http://www.anb.org/articles/12/12-02119.html Jacob Moreno] from [[American National Biography]]</ref>

==Career==
While living in Vienna in the early 1900s Moreno started an improvisational theater company, ''Stegreiftheater'', the Theater of Spontaneity <ref name=imprompt>{{cite book|last1=Moreno|first1=Jonathan D.|title=Impromptu Man|date=2014|publisher=Bellevue Literary Press|location=NYU School of Medicine, NY|isbn=978-1-934137-84-0|edition=1st|url=http://www.jonathandmoreno.com/about/impromptu-man-2/}}</ref>{{rp|72}} where he formulated a form of psychotherapy he called psychodrama, which employed improvised dramatizations, role-plays and other therapeutic, spontaneous dramatic expressions that utilized and unleashed the spontaneity and creativity of the group and its individual members.<ref name=imprompt/>{{rp|15,16}} Moreno saw "psychodrama as the next logical step beyond psychoanalysis."  It was "an opportunity to get into action instead of just talking, to take the role of the important people in our lives to understand them better, to confront them imaginatively in the safety of the therapeutic theater, and most of all to become more creative and spotantaneous human beings."<ref name=imprompt/>{{rp|50}}

In his book ''Who Shall Survive?'' (Preludes, p.xxviii) Moreno wrote of the genesis of his Group Psychotherapy in 1913–14 in Vienna, formulating his ideas while working with groups of prostitutes.

Moving to the US in 1925, he began working in New York City. There, Moreno worked on his theory of [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relations]], and the development of his work in [[psychodrama]], [[sociometry]], [[group psychotherapy]], [[sociodrama]], and [[sociatry]].  In his autobiography he wrote "only in New York, the melting pot of the nations, the vast metropolis, with all its freedom from all preconceived notions, could I be free to pursue sociometric group research in the grand style I had envisioned".<ref>Journal of Group Psychotherapy, Psychodrama & Sociometry (Vol. 42, No. 1), J. L. Moreno, spring 1989.</ref>

The New York Times wrote “He found that acceptance of his theories was slow, particularly because some colleagues deplored his showmanship.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/16/archives/jacob-l-moreno-psychiatrist-82-pioneer-of-the-psychodrama-technique.html|title = Jacob L Moreno, Psychiatrist, 82|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 16 May 1974|last1 = Weisman|first1 = Steven R.}}</ref>

He worked at the Plymouth Institute, Brooklyn, and at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]]. In 1929, he founded an Impromptu Theater at [[Carnegie Hall]] and later did work at the Guild Theater. He made studies of sociometry at [[Sing Sing Prison]] in 1931. In 1936, he founded the Beacon Hill Sanitarium, and the adjacent Therapeutic Theater.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/16/archives/jacob-l-moreno-psychiatrist-82-pioneer-of-the-psychodrama-technique.html|title = Jacob L Moreno, Psychiatrist, 82|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 16 May 1974|last1 = Weisman|first1 = Steven R.}}</ref>

He later held positions at [[Columbia University]]<ref>[http://www.agpa.org/pubs/GC_0802_moreno.html Taught at Columbia University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106022838/http://www.agpa.org/pubs/GC_0802_moreno.html |date=2009-01-06 }}, evidenced in recollection: article by Mary Nicholas & Gene Eliasoph, ''The Group Circle'' (August/September 2002), [[American Group Psychotherapy Association]].

Retrieved on December 30, 2007.</ref>

In 1932, Moreno first introduced group psychotherapy to the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and co-authored the monograph ''Group Method and Group Pschotherapy'' with [[Helen Hall Jennings]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qkaAAAAIAAJ |title = Group method and group psychotherapy|last1 = Moreno|first1 = Jacob Levy|last2 = Jennings|first2 = Helen Hall|last3 = Whitin|first3 = Ernest Stagg|year = 1932}}</ref> He and Jennings were the first to use a stochastic network model (or, "chance sociogram", as they called it),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science|last=Freeman|first=Linton C.|publisher=Empirical Press|year=2004|isbn=1594577145|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=36|oclc=56137876}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moreno |first1=Jacob L |last2=Jennings |first2=Helen Hall |title=Statistics of Social Configurations |journal=Sociometry |date=Jan 1938 |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |pages=342–374 |doi=10.2307/2785588|jstor=2785588 }}</ref> predating the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] and the network model of [[Anatol Rapoport]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rapoport |first1=Anatol |title=Contribution to the theory of random and biased nets |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |date=December 1957 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=257–277 |doi=10.1007/BF02478417}}</ref>

For the next 40 years he developed and introduced his Theory of Interpersonal Relations and tools for social sciences he called 'sociodrama', 'psychodrama', 'sociometry', and 'sociatry'. In his monograph entitled, "The Future of Man's World", he describes how he developed these sciences to counteract "the economic materialism of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], the psychological materialism of Freud, and the technological materialism" of our modern industrial age.<ref>The Future of Man's World, J. L. Moreno, New York Beacon House, Psychodrama Monographs, 1947.</ref>

His autobiography describes his position as "threefold: 
#Spontaneity and creativity are the propelling forces in human progress, beyond and independent of libido and socioeconomic motives [that] are frequently interwoven with spontaneity-creativity, but [this proposition] does deny that spontaneity and creativity are merely a function and derivative of libido or socioeconomic motives.
#Love and mutual sharing are powerful, indispensable working principles in group life. Therefore, it is imperative that we have faith in our fellow man’s intentions, a faith which transcends mere obedience arising from physical or legalistic coercion.
#That a super dynamic community based on these principles can be brought to realization through new techniques..."<ref name="autobiography" />

Moreno died in New York City in 1974, aged 84.<ref name="lucyozarin" /> He chose to die by abstaining from all food and water after a long illness. His ashes are buried at [[Feuerhalle Simmering]] in Vienna. His epitaph, at his request, reads "DER MANN, DER FREUDE UND LACHEN IN DIE PSYCHIATRIE BRACHTE" (The man who brought joy and laughter to psychiatry).<ref>{{cite book|title=Current Approaches in Drama Therapy|edition=2nd|editor1-first=David Read|editor1-last=Johnson|editor2-first=Renée|editor2-last=Emunah|year=2009|publisher=Charles C.

==Summary of contribution==
There is evidence that the methods of J. L. Moreno have held up respectably over time.<ref>Psychotherapy Networker, Clinician's Digest, January/February 2007.</ref> Subsequent research from the [[University of Vienna]] shows the enormous influence that Moreno's theory of the [[Encounter (psychology)|Encounter]] (''Invitations to an Encounter'', 1914) had on the development of [[Martin Buber]]'s I-Thou philosophy, and Buber's influence on philosophy, theology, and psychology.<ref>J.L. MORENO’S INFLUENCE ON MARTIN BUBER’S
DIALOGICAL PHILOSOPHY. Robert Waldl. http://www.blatner.com/adam/pdntbk/BuberMoreno.html</ref> His wife, [[Zerka Moreno]], wrote: "While it is true that Buber broadened the idea of the Encounter, he did not create the instruments for it to occur." Moreno "produced the various instruments we now use for facilitating the human encounter, sociometry, group psychotherapy, psychodrama, and sociodrama".<ref>Psychodrama Network News, Zerka Moreno, winter 2007.</ref>   Zerka was herself an expert in psychodrama and sociometry, and continued her late husband's work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Zerka_Moreno |title=Zerka Moreno |publisher=Psychotherapy.net |date=September 2004 }}</ref>

With training centers and institutes on nearly every continent, there are many thousands of students who are expanding and developing training and teaching the Morenean Arts and Sciences across the disciplines, to more fully realize Moreno's vision to make these social sciences available for "the whole of [hu]mankind."<ref>[http://www.morenoinstituteeast.org/ Morenean Arts & Sciences] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319014147/http://www.morenoinstituteeast.org/ |date=2018-03-19 }}: ''Moreno Institute East'' website. Retrieved on December 29, 2007.</ref>

Moreno is also widely credited as one of the founders of the discipline of [[Social network|social network analysis]], the branch of sociology that deals with the quantitative evaluation of an individual's role in a group or community by analysis of the network of connections between them and others.<ref name=imprompt/>{{rp|21,22}}

His 1934 book ''Who Shall Survive?'' contains some of the earliest graphical depictions of social networks ([[sociogram]]s). In this book, he introduced a famous explanation, why a pandemic of runaways emerged at the [[New York Training School for Girls]] in [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]].
