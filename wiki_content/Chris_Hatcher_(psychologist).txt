'''Chris Hatcher''', Ph.D., (1946&ndash;1999) was a [[clinical psychologist]] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], who was an expert in [[police psychology|police]] and [[forensic psychology]]. He dedicated his professional life to the study of [[violence]] and its prevention. He died unexpectedly at the age of 52.<ref name="klass">{{cite web

==Workplace violence==
Hatcher was one of the first experts to recognize the importance of understanding [[workplace violence]] and develop methods of [[threat assessment]]. He was acutely aware that the damage came not only from the violence itself in the workplace, but from [[Psychological abuse|mental torture]] created by the fear of threats of violence. He tried to develop an organized method of identifying and assessing threats before violence occurred, helping organizations determine the signs and symptoms of stress in an employee that could trigger violence, stressing understanding the process through which stress develops into a violence act by an employee. He served as an effective consultant on site once violence was threatened, working to free employees from the fear created by the threats. He advocated a [[multidisciplinary approach]] in responding to and containing workplace violence through, among other methods, effective [[employee assistance programs]].<ref>{{cite book

Hatcher also worked with the victims of violence to help them cope. For example, he worked with the father of [[Polly Klaas]], [[Marc Klaas]], after her murder.<ref name="klass"/>

==Criminal profiling==
Hatcher was an expert in forensic areas, including the study of the mind of various types of [[murderer]]s. In dealing with the [[cult]] leader, [[David Koresh]], in the [[Waco siege]], he believed that it was important to understand that cults require constant excitement to bind them to the cult leader. He said a violent confrontation with cult members played into their beliefs of being persecuted, increasing the probability of violent deaths. In his analysis, the first stage of violence occurs when the cult leader tells his followers that evil forces are out to get the cult so the cult must develop security to protect itself.<ref>{{cite news

Hatcher analyzed the behavioral patterns of the [[1982 Chicago Tylenol murders|Tylenol killer]] and determined that the Tylenol killer's thinking patterns were similar to that of an [[arsonist]] or [[bomber]], not those of a [[mass murderer]]. While many killers receive some satisfaction in stalking their victims, the Tylenol killer was more technically oriented and removed, not specifically choosing any one victim and not seeming to care who was killed. Unlike most killers, he had no direct contact with his victim.<ref>{{cite news

Through such careful study and organized observation of criminal behavior, Hatcher became expert in [[criminal profiling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/S026223.DOC |title=People v Gregory Scott Smith |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513154325/https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/S026223.DOC |archivedate=May 13, 2005 }}</ref>

==Expert witness==
Hatcher testified as an [[expert witness]] in the case, ''People v. Gregory Scott Smith'' in which he characterized the defendant as a "sadistic pedophile" during the sentencing phase of a death penalty case.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 10, 2005 |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S026223.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530011345/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S026223.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 30, 2006 |title=People v. Gregory Scott Smith |publisher=courtinfo.ca.gov |accessdate=2007-10-17 }}</ref> He described the common characteristics of persons who commit abductions similar to this case, explaining that they are living out a fantasy regarding the rape and molestation of children, and that the components of the fantasy include "forcible sodomy, strangulation, and disfigurement of the victimâ€™s body", all acts committed by Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/S026223.DOC |title=People v. Gregory Scott Smith |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513154325/https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/S026223.DOC |archivedate=May 13, 2005 }}</ref> This testimony was controversial because Hatcher did not evaluate or interview the defendant but came to his conclusions solely on "[[criminal profiler|profile evidence]]". Also, Hatcher's testimony was characterized as an improper attempt by the prosecution to sway the jury toward a death sentence on the grounds of extreme mental illness, contrary to law and precedent.<ref>{{cite journal

He also testified at the trial of [[Cameron Hooker]] who was accused of eight counts of [[kidnapping]], [[rape]] and associated offenses, after kidnapping his victim and keeping her prisoner for seven years. One of Hooker's defenses was that the victim consented to stay with him and a well known expert witness testified the victim's behavior indicates she did not want to escape. In a battle of [[expert witness]]es at Hooker's trial, Hatcher explained the victim's seemingly compliant and apathetic behavior, counteracting the defense expert's portrayal of the victim as willingly complying with Hooker's demands. Unlike the defense expert witness, Hatcher extensively interviewed the victim and was prepared to testify how each element in Hooker's treatment of the victim was capable of coercing an individual into compliant behavior. He went through each of the hypothetical facts in the case&mdash;[[kidnapping]], [[hanging]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], being locked in a box, [[starvation]] and [[sensory deprivation]], describing each of them as [[coercive]] techniques used by [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] persons to control another human being. He said such a continued pattern of [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] would coerce most people into giving up resistance. Hatcher's testimony was essential in explaining to the jury how the victim could seem to be compliant. After the verdict was rendered and Hooker was convicted of seven of the eight counts, the [[judge]] commended the jury for their "intelligence" in accepting Hatcher's testimony rather than that of the defense expert.<ref>{{cite book
