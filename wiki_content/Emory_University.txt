===Nineteenth century===
Emory College was founded in 1836 in [[Oxford, Georgia]] by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/history/index.html |title=A Brief History |last=Hauk |first=Gary S |publisher=Emory University |access-date=May 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030174205/http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/history/index.html |archive-date=October 30, 2013 }}</ref> The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop [[John Emory]].<ref name="history"/> [[Ignatius Alphonso Few]] was the college's first president. In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of [[Emory University School of Medicine]], was founded. On April 12, 1861, the [[American Civil War]] began. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students enlisted on the Confederate side.<ref name="history"/> In late 1863 the war came to Georgia and the college was used as hospital and later a headquarters for the [[Union Army]]. The university produced many officers who served in the war, including General [[George Thomas Anderson]] (1846C) who fought in nearly every major battle in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|eastern theater]]. Thirty-five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war.<ref name="english">English, Thomas H. ''Emory University 1915–1965: A Semicentennial History'' (Atlanta: Emory University, 1966).</ref>

Emory College, as with the entire [[Southeastern United States]], struggled to overcome financial devastation during the [[Reconstruction Era]]. In 1880, [[Atticus Greene Haygood]], Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of [[slavery in the United States]], which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by [[Isaac Stiles Hopkins]], a polymath professor at Emory College. Hopkins became the first president of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1888. Emory University's first international student, [[Yun Chi-ho]], graduated in 1893.<ref name="A Direct Line to Emory's History">{{cite web|url=http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2010/05/a-direct-line-to-emorys-history.html|title=A Direct Line to Emory's History - Emory University - Atlanta, GA|website=shared.web.emory.edu|access-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref> Yun became an important political activist in [[Korea]] and is the author of "[[Aegukga]]", the national anthem of the [[Republic of Korea]].<ref name="Encykorea Aegukga">{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0035201|title=애국가|publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]]|access-date=October 8, 2013}}</ref><ref name="National Anthem Korea">{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/south-korea-aegukga/ | title=South Korea – Aegukga | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | access-date=November 17, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424213957/http://www.nationalanthems.me/south-korea-aegukga/ | archive-date=April 24, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Twentieth century===
On August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the [[Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing]], was established. In 1914, the [[Candler School of Theology]] was established. In 1915, Emory College relocated to [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]] and was rechartered as Emory University after accepting a land grant from [[Asa Griggs Candler]], founder of [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. The [[Emory University School of Law]] was established in 1916. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts.

===First and Second World Wars===
On April 6, 1917, the United States entered the [[World War I|First World War]]. Emory University organized a medical unit, composed of medical school faculty and medical alumni, that would be known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43. The unit served in [[Loir-et-Cher]], [[France]] from July 1918 to January 1919. The Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43 was remobilized during the [[Second World War]] and served in the [[North African campaign]] and Europe. To recognize Emory's participation in the war effort, a ship was christened M.S. Emory Victory and served through World War II and in the Korean War.

In the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the [[Asia-Pacific War]] and [[European theater of World War II]]. Lieutenant Commander James L. Starnes, a graduate of Emory Law, was the navigator of the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} and served as [[officer of the deck]] during the signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A look inside the WWII surrender ceremony|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-missouri-surrender-20150902-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref> [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], the golfer, served during the [[Battle of Normandy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Frost |author-link=Mark Frost |title=The Grand Slam: Bobby Jones, America, and the Story of Golf |year=2004 |publisher=Hyperion Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4013-0751-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/grandslamthe00mark/page/458 458–9] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/grandslamthe00mark/page/458 }}</ref> Dr. Alfred A.

Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] and [[Army Specialized Training Program]], programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Army]]. The [[Candler School of Theology]] trained men for [[military chaplain]]cy. During the war, university enrollment boasted two military students for every one civilian. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the [[Korean War]], [[Second Indochina War]] (Vietnam War), [[Persian Gulf War]], [[Yugoslav Wars]], and the [[Global War on Terrorism]].

===Women's and civil rights movements===
The [[Second-wave feminism#Education|women's movement]] and [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s and 1960s in the [[United States]] profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational institution in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. [[Marvin S. Arrington Sr.]] was Emory University's first, full-time [[African American]] student and graduated from [[Emory University School of Law]] in 1967.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org">{{cite web|title=New Georgia Encyclopedia, Emory University|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/education/emory-university|website=Georgiaencyclopedia.org|access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref>

In 1971, Emory established one of the nation's first [[African-American studies]] programs and the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States.<ref>https://apply.emory.edu/majors/african-american-studies.html</ref> Emory's diversity and academic reputation continued to flourish under the leadership of the university's fifth president, [[James T. Laney]].  In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of [[racial equality]], Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global [[human rights]] and thus were openly opposed to the [[History of South Korea|military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987)]]. On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend [[Kim Dae-jung]], while in political exile in the [[United States]], presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.<ref name="Kim Dae Jung speech, 1983"/> Kim would go on to play a major role in ending [[June Struggle|authoritarianism in South Korea]], served as the 8th [[President of South Korea]] from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the [[Sunshine Policy]]. Laney would later serve as [[United States Ambassador to South Korea]] and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org"/>

In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to [[Civil Rights Movement]] activist [[Rosa Parks]]. The award is one of the highest honors presented by Emory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://president.emory.edu/meet_president_wagner/presidents_medal.html|title=Emory University President's Medal|website=President.emory.edu|access-date=20 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415162003/http://president.emory.edu/meet_president_wagner/presidents_medal.html|archive-date=April 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, [[John Lewis]], the only living "[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, [[Emory University School of Law]] received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. The law school has committed to raise an additional $500,000 to fund the chair fully.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.emory.edu/stories/2015/04/law_john_lewis_chair/campus.html|title=Emory to establish John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights, Social Justice|website=News.emory.edu|access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref>

===Expansion and modernization===
The course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when [[Robert Winship Woodruff]] and [[George Waldo Woodruff]] presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in [[Coca-Cola]] stock. At the time this was the largest single gift to any institution of [[higher education]] in American history.<ref name="history"/>

===Greek life===
Fraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's "temple" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities play a part in leavening Emory's campus life. For undergraduates, Greek life comprises approximately 30% of the Emory student population. The Office of Greek Life recognizes and regulates on-campus chapters of fraternities and sororities. Fraternities have on-campus housing located on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity houses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Residence Life & Housing website|url=http://www.emory.edu/HOUSING/UNDERGRAD/opt_greek.html|website=Emory.edu|access-date=November 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Student organizations===
Hundreds of student clubs and organizations operate on Emory's campus. These include numerous [[student government]], [[special interest]], and [[community service|service organizations]]. The Student Government Association charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.students.emory.edu/SGA/sga/ |title=Emory University SGA — Student Government Association |publisher=Students.emory.edu |access-date=July 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508103008/http://www.students.emory.edu/SGA/sga/ |archive-date=May 8, 2009 }}</ref> The Student Government Association oversees divisional councils, each coinciding with the undergraduate, graduate and professional schools of the university. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students' concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. The Student Programming Council is the school's primary programming organization, responsible for planning multiple events every year: Homecoming Week, Dooley's week, and a plethora of other events that happen around campus that benefit the students in a proactive way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spc.campuslifetech.org/?page_id=2 |title=Emory SPC - Official Website |date=September 14, 2010 |publisher=Students.emory.edu |access-date=October 22, 2010}}</ref> Emory also has several [[Secret society|secret societies]]—the [[Paladin Society]], the [[D.V.S.
