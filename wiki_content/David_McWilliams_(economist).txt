'''David McWilliams''' (born 1966) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] economist, writer, and journalist. McWilliams initially worked as an economist with the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], [[UBS AG|UBS]] bank and the [[Banque Nationale de Paris]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=McGarry|first=Patsy|title=Crash predicted within two years|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crash-predicted-within-two-years-1.209759|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> Since 1999, he has been a broadcaster, writer, economic commentator and documentary-maker. He has written five books, ''[[The Pope's Children]] '', ''The Generation Game'', ''Follow the Money'', ''The Good Room'' and ''Renaissance Nation'', and written regular columns for [[the Irish Times]] and [[Irish Independent]].

McWilliams has a reputation for explaining economic ideas with memorable phrases or stock characters, most famously  "breakfast roll man".{{Clarify|date=August 2021}}<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=McWilliams is a real self-made man - he invented himself|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/mcwilliams-is-a-real-self-made-man-he-invented-himself-26418542.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=independent|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=David McWilliams is sounding like a populist politician|url=http://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/tvandradio/2015/09/26/news/david-mcwilliams-is-sounding-like-a-populist-politician-272968/|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish News|language=en}}</ref>

== Life and career ==

=== Early and private life ===
McWilliams was born in [[Dún Laoghaire]] in 1966 and was raised in Windsor Park, [[Monkstown, County Dublin|Monkstown]], [[Dublin]]. His father, of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, worked in a chemical and paint factory. His Cork-born mother was a teacher. He is married to Sian Smyth, a former corporate lawyer, who is from near [[Belfast]]. They live in Dublin.

=== Education ===
McWilliams attended [[Blackrock College]] in Dublin. He then graduated from [[Trinity College, Dublin]], with a degree in economics (1988). His Masters in economics is from the [[College of Europe]], [[Belgium]] (1989).

=== Early Career: 1990s ===
Between 1990 and 1993 he worked as an economist at the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], a period which covered [[German reunification]], the [[Maastricht Treaty]], [[Bertie Ahern]]'s term as [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] and [[Black Wednesday]]. Watching these phenomena unfold from the perspective of a Central Bank official shaped his opinions, and these events would be revisited in his writings, especially the triangular relationship between access to credit in Ireland, the retirement funds of an ageing German workforce, and European monetary policy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=David McWilliams: Breakdown of trust at the heart of euro crisis|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-breakdown-of-trust-at-the-heart-of-euro-crisis-26879802.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=independent|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=McWilliams|first=David|title=David McWilliams: Ireland was the big winner from the fall of the Berlin Wall|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/david-mcwilliams-ireland-was-the-big-winner-from-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall-1.4075841|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref>

==== Move to London: Early Warnings About Celtic Tiger ====
McWilliams moved to London to work at UBS as a senior European economist and head of Emerging Markets research for Banque Nationale de Paris.<ref name=":1"/> He is credited as, at this time, coining the phrase "[[Celtic Tiger]]" in an analysis that compared the Republic of Ireland to the [[Tiger economy|Tiger economies]] of Asia, predicting threefold growth per annum in the Irish market in the years 1995 - 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Doherty|first=Christine|date=7 February 2002|title=Boom Or Bust? The Irish Economy in 2002|page=44|work=Irish Independent}}</ref> He credited what he described as "an economic miracle" to spending cuts by [[Charles Haughey]]'s 1987 government, "which laid the foundations for the impressive growth in the 1990s".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mcwilliams|first=David|title=EU plots the path to EMU on Irish economic model|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/eu-plots-the-path-to-emu-on-irish-economic-model-1.52305|access-date=2021-03-31|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref>

During this time he was identified as an outlier among economists interested in Ireland in warning that the housing market in the Republic was running a [[Economic bubble|price bubble]] similar to that of the housing markets in [[Boston]] in the 1980s and [[Thailand]] in the early 1990s. In 1996 he predicted a recession by 2005, noting that EMU meant that Ireland would enjoy low interest rates tailored to European neighbours with far lower economic growth than Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mcwilliams|first=David|title=Keep the moths away from that hairshirt|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/keep-the-moths-away-from-that-hairshirt-1.119280|access-date=2021-03-31|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> In 1998 he specified that in the event of a world recession, Irish house prices would drop by 20%.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Casey|first=Jerome|date=5 November 1998|title=Will House Prices Drop As Interest Rates Fall?|page=12|work=Irish Independent}}</ref> and predicted a crash by the year 2000.<ref name=":1" /> While the [[Irish Independent]] described him as "alarmist" in relation to these comments in 1998, the same article also added that mainstream Irish economists who disagreed with him were overly complacent.<ref name=":0" />

From 1999 to 2002, he was an [[emerging markets]] strategist with a New York-based hedge fund, Rockwest Capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/about|title=David Mcwilliams|website=www.davidmcwilliams.ie}}</ref>

In [[2000 in Ireland|2000]] - the year he had previously predicted that the Celtic Tiger would end - <ref name=":1" /> he warned of a "Hong Kong style property market collapse" in the not too distant future, noting that Ireland was experiencing labour shortages, rising asset prices and high borrowing (five times the then European rate and four times the then US rate). Brendan Keenan of the Irish Independent described him as "the best known critic of the Irish economy" at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Keenan|first=Brendan|date=11 October 2000|title=Economist Says 'Collapse' Due|page=15|work=Irish Independent}}</ref> During [[2001 in Ireland|2001]] Ireland experienced a foot and mouth outbreak which had an impact on the economy, with some commentators declaring the Celtic Tiger to be dead. However, when the impact to the economy turned out to be less negative than anticipated, his critics dismissed his analysis of the fragile Irish economy as alarmist.

=== 2000s: Writing and Broadcasting ===
Since returning to work in Ireland, he presented a current affairs programme called ''[[Agenda (Irish TV programme)|Agenda]]'' on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]], a breakfast radio show on [[NewsTalk 106]] from 2002 to 2004 and a topical afternoon discussion programme called ''The Big Bite'' on the television station [[RTÉ One]]. All these shows were cancelled after relatively short runs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Oliver|first=Emmet|title=Dublin news station fails to attract wide audience|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/dublin-news-station-fails-to-attract-wide-audience-1.357293|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> However, in 2005 McWilliams published his first book, [[The Pope's Children]], which became a significant bestseller and firmly established his place as a household name in Ireland,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> well-known enough to be referenced in the [[Ross O'Carroll-Kelly]] books <ref>{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Paul|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144596721|title=This champagne mojito is the last thing I own|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Ireland|others=Alan Clarke|isbn=978-1-84488-124-6|location=Dublin|oclc=144596721}}</ref> and imitated on  the satire TV show ''[[Irish Pictorial Weekly]]''.

In ''The Pope's Children'', McWilliams applied ideas which he saw used with great effect in [[Bobos in Paradise|Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There]] by American conservative writer [[David Brooks (commentator)|David Brooks]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Celtic tagger|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/celtic-tagger-1.962343|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> to Ireland, creating [[neologism]]s to describe certain economic actors as stock characters - HiCo and Breakfast Roll Man, for example. He wrote three more bestsellers: ''The Generation Game'', ''Follow the Money'' and ''The Good Room''.

==== Post 2008 ====
Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 Financial Crisis]], McWilliams was seen as having been finally proven right by many<ref>{{Cite web|last=Finlay|first=Fergus|date=2009-08-25|title=The man who foresaw our decline and fall needs to get back on track|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-20099378.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Irish Examiner|language=en}}</ref> and became a more prominent presence in the Irish media. He wrote and presented documentaries in Ireland and [[Australia]], mostly on economics topics but also exploring the Republic of Ireland's relationship with Britain<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/presspack/2011/05/16/what-have-the-brits-ever-done-for-us/|title=WHAT HAVE THE BRITS EVER DONE FOR US? - RTÉ Presspack|website=www.rte.ie}}</ref> and contributing to [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s [[Ireland's Greatest]] series, arguing on behalf of [[Mary Robinson|President Mary Robinson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/irelandsgreatest/maryrobinson.html|title=RTÉ Television: Ireland's Greatest » Mary Robinson|website=www.rte.ie}}</ref> In 2010, he staged  "Outsiders" a part stand up, part discussion, part social observation at the [[Abbey Theatre]], Dublin.<ref>[http://www.irishtheatremagazine.ie/Reviews/Current/Outsiders Irish Theatre Magazine | Reviews | Current | Outsiders<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105010156/http://www.irishtheatremagazine.ie/Reviews/Current/Outsiders |date=5 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Outsiders: David McWilliams |work=What's On |publisher=[[Abbey Theatre]] |year=2010 |url=http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/outsiders/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131105001541/http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/outsiders/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2013 |access-date=8 February 2015 }}</ref>

McWilliams hosted [[Leviathan: Political Cabaret]], a live discussion, political cabaret and satire event which featured at the [[Electric Picnic]] festival every year from 2005 to 2013.

;Kilkenomics & Dalkey Book Festival

In 2010, McWilliams co-founded two annual events: the Dalkey Book Festival with his wife, Sian,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Doyle|first=Martin|title=Dalkey Book Festival launches €30,000 literary awards|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/dalkey-book-festival-launches-30-000-literary-awards-1.4165184|access-date=2021-03-31|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> and Kilkenomics <ref>{{cite web|title=Kilkenomics Festival – The world's first economics and comedy festival.|url=http://www.kilkenomics.com|website=www.kilkenomics.com}}</ref>  a festival-style conference which combines economics with standup comedy.

McWilliams has worked with another way of looking at current events in economics using his Punk Economics Series of animated videos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/category/teaching/punk-economics|title=David Mcwilliams|website=www.davidmcwilliams.ie}}</ref> published on YouTube and also uses animations, music and video in his online economics course Economics without Boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.udemy.com/economics-without-boundaries-with-david-mcwilliams/|title=Economics for Beginners: How Does the Economy Work – Online Courses – Anytime, Anywhere – Udemy|website=Udemy}}</ref>

;Global Irish Forum

McWilliams conceived [[Global Irish Economic Forum|The Global Irish Forum]], an even modelled on the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Switzerland]]<ref>{{Cite news|date=1 September 2009|title="Global Irish Economic Summit planned for Farmleigh".|work=The Belfast Telegraph}}</ref> and inspired in part by [[Israel]]'s social and economic ties to Jewish communities in trading partner nations (he has frequently referred to harnessing the power of a 'Global Tribe' ).<ref>{{Cite web|title=David McWilliams: Diaspora's 'soft power' will help fuel our future|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-diasporas-soft-power-will-help-fuel-our-future-26736069.html|access-date=2021-03-31|website=independent|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Myers|first=Christian|title=Irish Economist spurs Irish patriotism|url=https://irishstudies.nd.edu/news/irish-economist-spurs-irish-patriotism/|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies|language=en}}</ref>  It is an event where businesses and leaders, both at home and abroad can work together and contribute to Ireland's economic recovery, and to examine ways in which Ireland and its global community could develop a more strategic relationship with each other, particularly in the economic sector.

;Podcast (2019-)

Following an appearance on a live episode of the [[Blindboy Boatclub|Blindboy]] podcast, McWilliams decided to launch his own weekly podcast in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/the-rewind/rewind-recommends-david-mcwilliams-412097|title = 2 Podcasts and a Netflix Series You Should Check Out Today}}</ref>

== Political and economic views ==
While he has refrained from publicly supporting any political party in Ireland, he hinted at running as an Independent in the [[2011 Irish general election|2011 Irish General Election]] and raised awareness of individual candidates such as Dylan Haskins, Evelyn Cawley<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Tim|title=McWilliams backs Cawley campaign|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/mcwilliams-backs-cawley-campaign-1.1203481|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> as well as [[Stephen Donnelly]] who would go on to become Health Minister with [[Fianna Fáil]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Byrne|first=Elaine|title=Loosely aligned Independents could have significant impact in next Dáil|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/loosely-aligned-independents-could-have-significant-impact-in-next-d%C3%A1il-1.1278735|access-date=2021-03-31|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=24 April 2013|title=Donnelly and McWiliams Share Their Business Opinions on Economics Day|work=Wicklow People}}</ref> He has also mentioned a belief in Schumpeterian economics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/inside-politics/inside-politics-should-we-worry-about-the-deficit-with-david-mcwilliams-1.4543683|title=Inside Politics - Should we worry about the deficit? - with David McWilliams}}</ref>

=== Ireland and the 2008 Recession ===
McWilliams had stated on multiple occasions in the 1990s that the circumstances were in place to create a housing bubble in Ireland, and had predicted a massive crash in the early 2000s which did not happen at that time; after Ireland recovered from the economic shock of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and the foot and mouth crisis, and his predictions were dismissed as alarmist, he expanded on his initial theory by describing Ireland's housing boom as  a “confidence trick”  by “an unholy alliance of bankers, landowners and a pliant political class” which would collapse resulting “in a generation in negative equity”<ref name=autogenerated1>{{YouTube|GnCtav9OsV8}}</ref> on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ.]] McWilliams was one of a number of commentators criticised for talking down the economy and damaging consumer sentiment.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Economic doom merchants threaten our future, says Bertie|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/economic-doom-merchants-threaten-our-future-says-bertie-26301340.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=independent|language=en}}</ref> In 2008 and 2009, the Irish economy was especially exposed to the global economic downturn in a manner very similar to that predicted by McWilliams.

==== Bank Guarantee ====
McWilliams was initially supportive of the bank guarantee of  September 2008, describing [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]]'s action as a "masterstroke" and claiming that by "coming up with a unique, Irish plan -- guaranteeing all deposits -- instead of importing a failed solution from abroad, he has instilled confidence in the Irish financial system." McWilliams even predicted that it would "obliterate[s] " the hedge funds who were short selling the Irish financial sector.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|title=Lenihan's masterstroke has bought us time to sort out our own problems – Independent.ie|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/lenihans-masterstroke-has-bought-us-time-to-sort-out-our-own-problems-26481076.html}}</ref> It subsequently emerged that McWilliams had advised Lenihan on this policy.<ref name=":6" />

Regarding the specific implementation of the bank guarantee, he explained in 2011 that his view was that it should have been rescinded (as originally envisaged) rather than prolonged, saying:<blockquote>"Rescind the guarantee. It was due to expire last September and was always supposed to be temporary. This guarantee should not have been open-ended and all-encompassing. It should have copied the Swiss and Swedish model, where those countries lent the credibility of the state to the banks.
Unfortunately, our Government didn't so much lend the State's credibility to the banks as give it to them unconditionally".<ref>{{Cite web|title=If I was Taoiseach... what I would do to save Ireland|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/if-i-was-taoiseach-what-i-would-do-to-save-ireland-26612222.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=independent|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

==== NAMA ====
McWilliams said that, providing the banks were reformed, some sort of “bad bank” would be necessary.
One idea is to divide our banks into good and bad banks. We could set up one or two bad banks, which would be "financial skips" into which we throw bad loans.<ref>{{cite web|title=€10bn bailout not enough without reforming banks|url=http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/2008/12/17/e10bn-bailout-not-enough-without-reforming-banks|publisher=David Mcwilliams}}</ref>
In 2009 McWilliams criticised NAMA as proposed, and was in turn criticised by [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=State's priority is helping economy, not the developers – Independent.ie|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/states-priority-is-helping-economy-not-the-developers-26530981.html}}</ref>

==== Economic and Monetary Union ====
During the post 2008 Financial Crisis, McWilliams questioned Ireland's continued participation in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union in his books.<ref>The Generation Game, 2007, particularly pages 220–223</ref> In an interview with Irish broadcaster [[Marian Finucane]], on RTÉ (17 January 2009) and reported in the international press,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/globalbusiness/4285331/Help-Ireland-or-it-will-exit-euro-economist-warns.html|title=Help Ireland or it will exit euro, economist warns|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Ambrose|last=Evans-Pritchard|date=18 Jan 2009|access-date=21 Jan 2009}}</ref> McWilliams argued: "What I am saying is, that in Europe, if Ireland continues hurtling down this road, which is close to default, the whole of Europe will be badly affected, the credibility of the euro will be badly affected. .. It is very essential that we go to Europe and say we have a serious problem. … the way we get out of this is either – there are two options – either, we default, or we pull out of the euro. If we have a single currency, there are obligations and responsibilities on both sides. The idea that France and Germany can just hang us out to dry – as has been the talk the past few days – should not be taken lying down."<ref>"Listen to an interview with Irish broadcaster Marion Finucane on RTÉ". RTÉ. 17 January 2009. Retrieved 17 January 2009. Available at rte.ie as an mp3.</ref>

Williams is a member of the Advisory Panel of [[DiEM25]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diem25.org/ap/|title = Advisory Panel}}</ref>

=== Brexit and Euroscepticism ===
McWilliams has frequently suggested that Ireland should leave the Euro, argued that the European Union is dominated by economies like [[Germany]] with very different priorities to Ireland,<ref>{{Cite web|title=David McWilliams: On Brexit, we're closer to London than Berlin or Paris|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-on-brexit-were-closer-to-london-than-berlin-or-paris-35500883.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=independent|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mcwilliams|first=David|title=Ireland enjoys a free lunch courtesy of Germany's woes|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/ireland-enjoys-a-free-lunch-courtesy-of-germany-s-woes-1.29249|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> and described [[Brexit]] as an enormous opportunity,<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=Calm down: the Brexit referendum result is not a 21st-century Sarajevo|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/calm-down-the-brexit-referendum-result-is-not-a-21st-century-sarajevo-34842130.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=independent|language=en}}</ref> noting that while [[Switzerland]] and [[Norway]] pay handsomely for access to the [[European Economic Community|common market]] while staying out the political union, they 'are prepared to pay for this luxury".<ref name=":4" />

=== Ireland and Israel ===
McWilliams, who briefly worked in Tel Aviv, has frequently suggested Israel as an economic and social role model for Ireland,<ref>{{Cite web|title=David McWilliams: Our children won't be able to pay cost of our debt folly|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-our-children-wont-be-able-to-pay-cost-of-our-debt-folly-26804353.html|access-date=2021-03-31|website=independent|language=en}}</ref> arguing that the Republic should prioritise ties with the Irish diaspora around the world over EU member states with no historical connections to Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|title=David McWilliams: Harnessing diaspora will help us rebuild economy|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/david-mcwilliams-harnessing-diaspora-will-help-us-rebuild-economy-26693338.html|access-date=2021-03-31|website=independent|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2007-10-03|title=The Generation Game by David McWilliams|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/book-reviews/2007/1003/445717-mcwilliamsd/|language=en}}</ref> 

Although McWilliams has defended and praised Israel in his writings, he has denied that he is a 'Friend of Israel' stating that he is "just somebody who is prepared to see an Israeli point of view".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cotton|first=Miriam|date=18 June 2010|title=The 'Rock Star' Economist|edition=June - July 2010|work=Village|url=https://mediabite.org/2010/06/18/the-rock-star-economist/}}</ref>

== Controversies and Criticisms ==
* During the late 2000s, comments were occasionally made on McWillams' capacity for self-publicity, with the Irish Independent writing in 2006 "when you strip away the clever catchphrases, the cliched buzz words and the soundbite economics, what's left?".<ref name=":2" /> In one instance he was described in [[The Phoenix (magazine)|Phoenix Magazine]] as the [[David Beckham]] of Irish media.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Phoenix Magazine |volume=25| issue = 2 |date=25 January – 8 February 2007 |url=http://www.phoenix-magazine.com}}</ref>
*McWilliams has been criticised for publicly pointing out flaws in projects that he has been involved in. While working for the Central Bank he admitted writing magazine articles criticising speeches he had written for then Finance Minister Bertie Ahern.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Beesley|first=Arthur|title=Broadcaster wrote Ahern speeches|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/broadcaster-wrote-ahern-speeches-1.1304343|access-date=2021-04-01|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> In 2009 while promoting ''Follow The Money'' he declared that [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]] turned up at his house, looking dishevelled and chewing raw garlic, seeking advice on the bank guarantee. McWilliams claimed that he offered advice on this matter,<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Connolly|first=Shaun|date=2009-11-02|title=McWilliams and Lenihan differ over bizarre meeting|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-20104615.html|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Irish Examiner|language=en}}</ref> subsequently writing that the idea was "a masterstroke" <ref name=":5" /> before going on to criticise it because McWilliams believed it was not implemented in the fashion he advised.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/last-nights-tv-crisis-inside-the-cowen-government-26789952.html|title = Last night's TV: Crisis: Inside the Cowen Government}}</ref> Lenihan and McWilliams disagreed on the details of "garlic-gate".{{cn|date=October 2021}}
*While promoting ''Follow The Money,'' McWilliams made comments about senior RTÉ journalist [[Miriam O'Callaghan]] where he accused her of flirting with and effectively trying to seduce her guests, writing "Miriam winks, with a faint pout and the casual lick of those hyper-glossed lips. You're mine now, boy, she signals. This is my web you've just walked into.
