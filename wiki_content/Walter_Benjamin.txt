An eclectic thinker, combining elements of [[German idealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Western Marxism]], and [[Jewish mysticism]], Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], [[literary criticism]], and [[historical materialism]]. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kabbalah]] scholar [[Gershom Scholem]]. He was also related to [[Germans|German]] [[political theory|political theorist]] and philosopher [[Hannah Arendt]] through her first marriage to Benjamin's cousin [[Günther Anders]].

Among Benjamin's best known works are the essays "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1935), and "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]" (1940). His major work as a literary critic included essays on [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Kraus]], [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Robert Walser (writer)|Walser]], and [[translation theory]]. He also made major translations into German of the ''Tableaux Parisiens'' section of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' and parts of Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide at [[Portbou]] on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from the invading [[Wehrmacht]]. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

== Life ==
{{Frankfurt School}}

=== Early life and education ===
Benjamin and his younger siblings, Georg (1895–1942) and Dora (1901–1946), were born to a wealthy business family of assimilated [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the Berlin of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). The patriarch of Walter Benjamin's family, Emil Benjamin, was a banker in Paris who had relocated from France to Germany, where he worked as an antiques trader in Berlin; he later married Pauline Schönflies. He owned a number of investments in Berlin, including ice skating rinks. Benjamin's uncle [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] (born Wilhelm Louis Stern; 1871-1938) was a prominent German [[child psychology|child psychologist]] who developed the concept of the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), and Benjamin's cousin [[Günther Anders]] (born Günther Siegmund Stern; 1902-1992) was a German philosopher and anti-nuclear activist who studied under [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Through his mother, his great-uncle was the classical archaeologist [[Gustav Hirschfeld]].<ref>Howard Eiland, ''Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life'', Harvard University Press (2014), p. 20</ref> In 1902, ten-year-old Walter was enrolled to the Kaiser Friedrich School in [[Charlottenburg]]; he completed his secondary school studies ten years later. Walter was of fragile health and so in 1905 the family sent him to Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, a [[boarding school]] in the [[Thuringia]]n countryside, for two years; in 1907, having returned to Berlin, he resumed his schooling at the Kaiser Friedrich School.<ref name="Witte" />

In 1912, at the age of 20, he enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]], but at summer semester's end returned to Berlin, then matriculated at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] to continue studying philosophy. There Benjamin had his first exposure to [[Zionism]], which had not been part of his liberal upbringing. This gave him occasion to formulate his own ideas about the meaning of Judaism. Benjamin distanced himself from political and nationalist Zionism, instead developing in his own thinking what he called a kind of "[[cultural Zionism]]"—an attitude that recognized and promoted Judaism and [[Jewish ethics|Jewish values]]. In Benjamin's formulation his Jewishness meant a commitment to the furtherance of European culture. He wrote, "My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ... For Judaism is to me in no sense an end in itself, but the most distinguished bearer and representative of the spiritual." This was a position Benjamin largely held lifelong.<ref>Witte, Bernd. (1996) ''Walter Benjamin: An Intellectual Biography''. New York: Verso. pp. 26–27</ref>

Elected president of the ''Freie Studentenschaft'' (Free Students Association), Benjamin wrote essays arguing for educational and general cultural change.<ref>'' Experience'', 1913</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}} When not reelected as student association president, he returned to Freiburg University to study, with particular attention to the lectures of [[Heinrich Rickert]]; at that time he travelled to France and Italy.

His attempt to volunteer for service at the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914 was rejected by the army.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Jay|first=Martin|date=1999|title=Walter Benjamin, Remembrance, and the First World War|journal=Review of Japanese Culture and Society|volume=11/12|pages=18–31|issn=0913-4700|jstor=42800179}}</ref> Benjamin later feigned illnesses to avoid conscription,<ref name=":1" /> allowing him to continue his studies and his translations of works by French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]].

The next year, 1915, he moved to Munich, and continued his schooling at the [[University of Munich]], where he met [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Gershom Scholem]]; the latter became a friend. In that year, Benjamin wrote about the 18th-century [[Romanticism|Romantic]] German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]].

In 1917 Benjamin transferred to the [[University of Bern]]; there he met [[Ernst Bloch]], and Dora Sophie Pollak (née Kellner), whom he married. They had a son, Stefan Rafael, in 1918. In 1919 Benjamin earned his [[Ph.D.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' with the dissertation ''Der Begriff der Kunstkritik in der deutschen Romantik'' (''The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism''). 

For his post-doctoral thesis in 1920, Benjamin hit upon an idea very similar to the thesis proposed by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] in the latter's own postdoctoral project (''Dun Scotus: Theory of Categories and Meaning''). Wolfram Eilenberger writes that Benjamin's plan was, "to legitimize [his theory of language] with reference to a largely forgotten tradition [found in the archaic writings of [[Duns Scotus]]], and to strike the sparks of systematization from the apparent disjunct among modern, logical, and analytical linguistic philosophy and medieval speculations on language that fell under the heading of theology."<ref name=":2" /> After [[Gershom Scholem]] sympathetically informed his friend that his interest in the concept had been pre-empted by Heidegger's earlier publication, Benjamin seems to have derived a lifelong antagonism toward the rival philosopher whose major insights, over the course of both of their careers, sometimes overlapped and sometimes conflicted with Benjamin's.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Eilenberger|first=Wolfram|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1127067361|title=Time of the magicians : Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Cassirer, Heidegger, and the decade that reinvented philosophy|date=2020|others=Shaun Whiteside|isbn=978-0-525-55966-5|location=New York|pages=91-94|oclc=1127067361}}</ref> Incidentally Heidegger, at the time, was soon to embark on a love-affair with [[Hannah Arendt]], later related to Benjamin though marriage to his cousin. 

Later, unable to support himself and family, he returned to Berlin and resided with his parents. In 1921 he published the essay ''Kritik der Gewalt'' (''Critique of Violence''). At this time Benjamin first became socially acquainted with [[Leo Strauss]], and he remained an admirer of Strauss and his work throughout his life.<ref>''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55</ref><ref>Scholem, Gershom. 1981.

=== Career ===
In 1923, when the [[Institute for Social Research]] was founded, later to become home to the [[Frankfurt School]], Benjamin published ''Charles Baudelaire, Tableaux Parisiens''. At that time he became acquainted with [[Theodor Adorno]] and befriended [[Georg Lukács]], whose ''The Theory of the Novel'' (1920) much influenced him. Meanwhile, the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] consequent to the war made it difficult for Emil Benjamin to continue supporting his son's family. At the end of 1923 Scholem emigrated to Palestine, a country under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]; despite repeated invitations, he failed to persuade Benjamin (and family) to leave the Continent for the Middle East.

In 1924 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], in the ''Neue Deutsche Beiträge'' magazine, published Benjamin's "Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften" ("[[Goethe]]'s [[Elective Affinities]]"), about Goethe's third novel, ''[[Elective Affinities|Die Wahlverwandtschaften]]'' (1809). Later that year Benjamin and Bloch resided on the Italian island of [[Capri]]; Benjamin wrote ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'') as a [[habilitation]] dissertation meant to qualify him as a tenured university professor in Germany. At Bloch's suggestion, he read Lukács's ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923). He also met the Latvian Bolshevik and actress [[Asja Lācis]], then residing in Moscow; he became her lover and was a lasting intellectual influence on him.<ref>https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/benjamin.pdf</ref>

A year later, in 1925, Benjamin withdrew ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as his possible qualification for the habilitation teaching credential at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] at Frankfurt am Main, fearing its possible rejection;<ref name="BL">Jane O. Newman, ''Benjamin's Library: Modernity, Nation, and the Baroque'', Cornell University Press, 2011, p. 28: "university officials in Frankfurt recommended that Benjamin withdraw the work from consideration as his Habilitation."</ref> he was not to be an academic instructor. Working with [[Franz Hessel]] he translated the first volumes of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' (''In Search of Lost Time''). The next year, 1926, he began writing for the German newspapers ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' (The Frankfurt Times) and ''Die Literarische Welt'' (The Literary World); that paid enough for him to reside in Paris for some months. In December 1926, the year his father died, Benjamin went to Moscow<ref>Seits, Irina S.

In 1927, he began ''[[The Arcades Project|Das Passagen-Werk]]'' (''The Arcades Project''), his uncompleted ''magnum opus'', a study of 19th-century Parisian life. The same year, he saw Scholem in Berlin, for the last time, and considered emigrating from Germany to Palestine. In 1928, he and Dora separated (they divorced two years later, in 1930); in the same year he published ''Einbahnstraße'' (''One-Way Street''), and a revision of his habilitation dissertation ''Ursprung des Deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''). In 1929 Berlin, Lācis, then an assistant to [[Bertolt Brecht]], socially presented the intellectuals to each other. In that time, he also briefly embarked upon an academic career, as an instructor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

=== Exile and death ===
[[File:BenjaminBnF.jpg|alt= Walter Benjamin's membership card for the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1940).|thumb|257x257px|Walter Benjamin's membership card for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (1940).]]
In 1932, during the turmoil preceding [[Adolf Hitler]]'s assumption of the office of Chancellor of Germany, Benjamin left Germany for the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]] for some months; he then moved to [[Nice]], where he considered killing himself. Perceiving the sociopolitical and cultural significance of the [[Reichstag fire]] (27 February 1933) as the ''de facto'' Nazi assumption of full power in Germany, then manifest with the subsequent [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|persecution of the Jews]], he moved to Paris, but before doing so he sought shelter in [[Svendborg]], at Bertolt Brecht's house, and at [[Sanremo]], where his ex-wife Dora lived.

As he ran out of money, Benjamin collaborated with [[Max Horkheimer]], and received funds from the Institute for Social Research, later going permanently into exile. In Paris, he met other refugee German artists and intellectuals; he befriended [[Hannah Arendt]], novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], and composer [[Kurt Weill]]. In 1936, a first version of "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (originally written in German in 1935) was published in French ("L'œuvre d'art à l'époque de sa reproduction méchanisée") by Max Horkheimer in the ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' journal of the [[Institute for Social Research]]. It was a critique of the authenticity of mass-produced art; he wrote that a mechanically produced copy of an artwork can be taken somewhere the original could never have gone, arguing that the presence of the original is "prerequisite to the concept of authenticity".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Benjamin|first=Walter|date=1968|chapter=The Work Of Art In The Age Of Mechanical Reproduction|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=217–253}}</ref>[[File:Benjamin's apartment in Paris (fot. Mateusz Palka).jpg|thumb|342x342px|Walter Benjamin's Paris apartment at 10 [[:fr:Rue Dombasle|rue Dombasle]] (1938–1940)]] In 1937 Benjamin worked on "Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire" ("The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire"), met [[Georges Bataille]] (to whom he later entrusted the ''Arcades Project'' manuscript), and joined the [[College of Sociology]]. In 1938 he paid a last visit to Brecht, who was exiled to Denmark. Meanwhile, the Nazi régime stripped German Jews of their German citizenship; now a stateless man, Benjamin was arrested by the French government and incarcerated for three months in a prison camp near [[Nevers]], in central [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]].

Returning to Paris in January 1940, he wrote "Über den Begriff der Geschichte" ("On the Concept of History", later published as "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]"). While the [[Wehrmacht]] was pushing back the [[French Army]], on 13 June Benjamin and his sister fled Paris to the town of [[Lourdes]], just a day before the Germans entered the capital with orders to arrest him at his flat. In August, he obtained a travel visa to the US that Horkheimer had negotiated for him. In eluding the [[Gestapo]], Benjamin planned to travel to the US from neutral Portugal, which he expected to reach via [[Francoist Spain]], then ostensibly a neutral country.

[[File:Grab Walter Benjamin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Walter Benjamin's grave in Portbou. The epitaph in German, repeated in Catalan, quotes from Section 7 of "Theses on the Philosophy of History": "There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism"]]The historical record indicates that he safely crossed the French–Spanish border and arrived at the coastal town of [[Portbou]], in [[Catalonia]]. The Franco government had cancelled all transit visas and ordered the Spanish police to return such persons to France, including the Jewish refugee group Benjamin had joined. They crossed the border on 25 September 1940 but were told by the Spanish police that they would be deported back to France the next day, which would have thwarted Benjamin's plans to travel to the United States. Expecting repatriation to Nazi hands, Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of morphine tablets that night, while staying at the ''Hotel de Francia''; the official Portbou register records 26 September 1940 as the date of death.<ref name="Witte"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Arendt|editor=Walter Benjamin|first=Hannah|date=1968|chapter=Introduction|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=23–24}}</ref><ref>Jay, Martin ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Esther|title=Walter Benjamin: Overpowering Conformism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXUN34lH-jgC&pg=PA215|access-date=August 28, 2009|series=Modern European Thinkers|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1568-3|page=215|chapter=Benjamin's Finale}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lester|first=David|title=Suicide and the Holocaust|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&pg=PA74|access-date=August 28, 2009|year=2005|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-427-9|page=74|chapter=Suicide to Escape Capture: Cases}}</ref> Benjamin's colleague [[Arthur Koestler]], also fleeing Europe, attempted suicide by taking some of the morphine tablets, but survived.<ref>"Afraid of being caught by the Gestapo while fleeing France, [Koestler] borrowed suicide pills from Walter Benjamin.

Despite his suicide, Benjamin was buried in the consecrated section of a Roman Catholic cemetery.

The others in his party were allowed passage the next day (maybe because Benjamin's suicide shocked Spanish officials), and safely reached [[Lisbon]] on 30 September. Arendt, who crossed the French-Spanish border at Portbou a few months later, passed the manuscript of ''Theses'' to Adorno. Another completed manuscript, which Benjamin had carried in his suitcase, disappeared after his death and has not been recovered.<ref>{{cite web |last1=van Straten |first1=Giorgio |title=Lost in migration |url=https://aeon.co/essays/what-happened-to-walter-benjamins-precious-black-suitcase |website=aeon.co |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Some critics speculate that it was his ''Arcades Project'' in a final form; this is very unlikely as the author's plans for the work had changed in the wake of Adorno's criticisms in 1938, and it seems clear that the work was flowing over its containing limits in his last years.

== Thought ==
[[File:Klee, Angelus novus.png|thumb|right|293x293px|[[Paul Klee]]'s 1920 painting ''[[Angelus Novus]]'', which Benjamin compared to "the angel of history"]]
Walter Benjamin corresponded much with [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], and was occasionally funded by the [[Frankfurt School]] under the direction of Adorno and [[Horkheimer]], even from their New York City residence. The competing influences—Brecht's Marxism, Adorno's [[critical theory]], Gerschom Scholem's Jewish mysticism—were central to his work, although their philosophic differences remained unresolved. Moreover, the critic [[Paul de Man]] argued that the intellectual range of Benjamin's writings flows dynamically among those three intellectual traditions, deriving a critique via juxtaposition; the exemplary synthesis is "Theses on the Philosophy of History". At least one scholar, [[religious studies|historian of religion]] Jason Josephson-Storm, has argued that Benjamin's diverse interests may be understood in part by understanding the influence of [[Western Esotericism]] on Benjamin. Some of Benjamin's key ideas were adapted from occultists and [[New Age movement|New Age]] figures including [[Eric Gutkind]] and [[Ludwig Klages]], and his interest in esotericism is known to have extended far beyond the Jewish [[Kabbalah]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 226–36 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>

=== "Theses on the Philosophy of History" ===
{{main|Theses on the Philosophy of History}}
"Theses on the Philosophy of History" is often cited as Benjamin's last complete work, having been completed, according to Adorno, in the spring of 1940. The Institute for Social Research, which had relocated to New York, published ''Theses'' in Benjamin's memory in 1942. Margaret Cohen writes in the ''Cambridge Companion to Walter Benjamin'':

{{quote|In the "Concept of History" Benjamin also turned to Jewish mysticism for a model of praxis in dark times, inspired by the kabbalistic precept that the work of the holy man is an activity known as [[Tikkun olam|tikkun]]. According to the kabbalah, God's attributes were once held in vessels whose glass was contaminated by the presence of evil and these vessels had consequently shattered, disseminating their contents to the four corners of the earth. Tikkun was the process of collecting the scattered fragments in the hopes of once more piecing them together. Benjamin fused tikkun with the Surrealist notion that liberation would come through releasing repressed collective material, to produce his celebrated account of the revolutionary historiographer, who sought to grab hold of elided memories as they sparked to view at moments of present danger.}}

In the essay, Benjamin's famed ninth thesis struggles to reconcile the [[Idea of Progress]] in the present with the apparent chaos of the past:

{{quote|A Klee painting named ''[[Angelus Novus]]'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.}}

The final paragraph about the Jewish quest for the [[Messiah]] provides a harrowing final point to Benjamin's work, with its themes of culture, destruction, Jewish heritage and the fight between humanity and nihilism. He brings up the interdiction, in some varieties of Judaism, of attempts to determine the year when the Messiah would come into the world, and points out that this did not make Jews indifferent to the future "for every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter."

=== "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility" ===
Perhaps Walter Benjamin's best known essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility," identifies the perceptual shift that takes place when technological advancements emphasize speed and reproducibility.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://bookoblivion.com/2019/05/13/walter-benjamin-aura/|title=How Time and Space Converge to Evoke Walter Benjamin's Aura|last=Manuel|first=Jessica S.|date=2019-05-13|website=Book Oblivion|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> The aura is found in a work of art that contains presence. The aura is precisely what cannot be reproduced in a work of art: its original presence in time and space.<ref name=":0" /> He suggests a work of art's aura is in a state of decay because it is becoming more and more difficult to apprehend the time and space in which a piece of art is created.

This essay also introduces the concept of the optical unconscious, a concept that identifies the subject's ability to identify desire in visual objects. This also leads to the ability to perceive information by habit instead of rapt attention.<ref name=":0" />

=== ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' ===
{{main|The Origin of German Tragic Drama}}

''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', 1928), is a critical study of German baroque drama, as well as the political and cultural climate of Germany during the [[Counter-Reformation]] (1545–1648). Benjamin presented the work to the University of Frankfurt in 1925 as the ([[postdoctoral]]) dissertation meant to earn him the ''[[Habilitation]]'' (qualification) to become a university instructor in Germany.

Professor Schultz of University of Frankfurt found ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' inappropriate for his ''Germanistik'' department (Department of German Language and Literature), and passed it to the Department of Aesthetics (philosophy of art), the readers of which likewise dismissed Benjamin's work. The university officials recommended that Benjamin withdraw ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' as a ''Habilitation'' dissertation to avoid formal rejection and public embarrassment.<ref name="BL"/> He heeded the advice, and three years later, in 1928, he published ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as a book.<ref>''Introducing Walter Benjamin'', Howard Cargill, Alex Coles, Andrey Klimowski, 1998, p. 112</ref>

{{Main|Arcades Project}}
The ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'' (''Arcades Project'', 1927–40) was Benjamin's final, incomplete book about Parisian city life in the 19th century, especially about the ''[[Passages couverts de Paris]]''—the covered passages that extended the culture of [[flâneur|''flânerie'']] (idling and people-watching) when inclement weather made ''flânerie'' infeasible in the boulevards and streets proper. In this work Benjamin uses his fragmentary style to write about the rise of modern [[European culture|European]] [[urban culture]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|pages=40}}</ref>

The ''Arcades Project'', in its current form, brings together a massive collection of notes Benjamin filed together from 1927 to 1940.<ref>Buck-Morss, Susan. ''The Dialectics of Seeing''. The MIT Press, 1991, p. 5.</ref>

The ''Arcades Project'' was published for the first time in 1982, and is over a thousand pages long.

=== Writing style ===
[[Susan Sontag]] said that in Benjamin's writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence "had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes", a "freeze-frame baroque" style of writing and cogitation. "His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct".<ref>Susan Sontag ''Under the Sign of Saturn,'' p. 129.</ref> The difficulty of Benjamin's style is essential to his philosophical project. Fascinated by notions of reference and constellation, his goal in later works was to use [[Intertextuality|intertexts]] to reveal aspects of the past that cannot, and should not, be understood within greater, monolithic constructs of historical understanding.

Benjamin's writings identify him as a [[Modernism|modernist]] for whom the philosophic merges with the literary: logical philosophic reasoning cannot account for all experience, especially not for self-representation via art. He presented his stylistic concerns in "The Task of the Translator", wherein he posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.

His work "The Task of the Translator" was later commented by the French translation scholar [[Antoine Berman]] (''[[L'âge de la traduction]]'').

== Legacy and reception ==
Since the publication of ''Schriften'' (''Writings'', 1955), 15 years after his death, Benjamin's work—especially the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (French edition, 1936)—has become of seminal importance to academics in the humanities disciplines.<ref> Wengrofsky, Jeffrey , "[http://coilhouse.net/2011/07/on-the-occasion-of-walter-benjamin%e2%80%99s-121st-birthday/ On the Occasion of Walter Benjamin’s 119th Birthday]". Coilhouse Magazine. Archived from the original on 07-2011. Retrieved 2020-05-20.</ref> In 1968, the first [[Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft]] was established by the [[Germany|German]] thinker, poet and artist [[Natias Neutert]], as a free association of philosophers, writers, artists, media theoreticians and editors. They did not take Benjamin's body of thought as a scholastic "closed architecture [...], but as one in which all doors, windows and roof hatches are widely open", as the founder Neutert put it—more poetically than politically—in his manifesto.<ref>Cf. ''Mit Walter Benjamin. Gründungsmanifest der Internationalen Walter-Benjamin-Gesellschaft.'' Copyleft Verlag, Hamburg, 1968, p. 6.</ref> The members felt liberated to take Benjamin's ideas as a welcome touchstone for social change.<ref>Hereto Helmut Salzinger: ''Swinging Benjamin. Verlag Michael Kellner, Hamburg 1990. {{ISBN|3-927623-05-9}}</ref>

Like the first Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft, a new one, established in 2000, researches and discusses the imperative that Benjamin formulated in his "Theses on the Philosophy of History": "In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it."

The successor society was registered in Karlsruhe (Germany); Chairman of the Board of Directors was Bernd Witte, an internationally recognized Benjamin scholar and Professor of Modern German Literature in Düsseldorf (Germany). Its members come from 19 countries, both within and beyond Europe and represents an international forum for discourse. The Society supported research endeavors devoted to the creative and visionary potential of Benjamin's works and their view of 20th century modernism. Special emphasis had been placed upon strengthening academic ties to Latin America and Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://walterbenjamin.info/|title=International Walter Benjamin Society|website=walterbenjamin.info}}</ref>
The society conducts conferences and exhibitions, as well as interdisciplinary and intermedial events, at regular intervals and different European venues:
* Barcelona Conference – September 2000
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Berlin – November 2001
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Karlsruhe – January 2003
* Rome Conference – November 2003
* Zurich Conference – October 2004
* Paris Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – November 2005
* Antwerpen Conference – May 2006
* Vienna Conference – March 2007<ref>Cf. [http://walterbenjamin.info/ WalterBenjamin.info]</ref>

In 2017 Walter Benjamin's ''Arcades Project'' was reinterpreted in an exhibition curated by [[Jens Hoffmann|Jens Hoffman]], held at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City. The exhibition, entitled "The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin", features 36 contemporary artworks representing the 36 convolutes of Benjamin's Project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-arcades-contemporary-art-and-walter-benjamin|title=The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin (March 17 - August 6, 2017)|website=The Jewish Museum. thejewishmuseum.org|access-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref>

== Commemoration ==
[[File:Berliner Gedenktafel Walter Benjamin Prinzregentenstraße 66 Berlin-Wilmersdorf.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Walter Benjamin, Berlin-Wilmersdorf]]
A commemorative plaque is located by the residence where Benjamin lived in Berlin during the years 1930–1933: (Prinzregentenstraße 66, [[Berlin-Wilmersdorf]]). A commemorative plaque is located in Paris (10 rue Dombasle, [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th]]) where Benjamin lived in 1938–1940.

Close by [[Kurfürstendamm]], in the district of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], a town square created by [[Hans Kollhoff]] in 2001 was named "Walter-Benjamin-Platz".<ref>[http://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen_Eroeffnung_der_Leibniz-Kolonnaden_in_Berlin_8927.html ''Stadtplatz aus Stein: Eröffnung der Leibniz-Kolonnaden in Berlin.''] (in German). May&nbsp;14, 2001. ''[[BauNetz]]''. baunetz.de. Retrieved July&nbsp;29, 2017.</ref> There is a memorial sculpture by the artist Dani Karavan at Portbou, where Walter Benjamin ended his life. It was commissioned to mark 50 years since his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://walterbenjaminportbou.cat/en/content/lobra|title=Walter Benjamin a Portbou|website=walterbenjaminportbou.cat}}</ref>
