She was a [[Senate of Colombia|Senator of the Republic of Colombia]] and was the vice-presidential candidate in the [[2018 Colombian presidential election|2018 presidential election]] for the [[Green Alliance (Colombia)|Green Alliance]] party. In October 2019, she was elected mayor of Bogotá, the first woman and as well the first [[openly homosexual|openly LGBT]] person to be elected to this position.

==Biography==
Claudia Nayibe López Hernández, the daughter of Elías López Reyes and María del Carmen Hernández Ruiz, is the oldest of six siblings.

===Education===
She graduated in Finance, Government, and International Relations from the [[Universidad Externado de Colombia]]. She has a master's degree in Public Administration and Urban Politics from [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]], and a Ph.D. in Political Science from [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]].

===Career===
López's appearance in public life is linked to the student movement of the {{ill|Seventh Ballot|es|Séptima papeleta}}, which between 1989 and 1990 was what gave impulse to the 1991 [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]].

She has been a consultant to the [[United Nations]] and has written for several media outlets in the country such as the [[Caracol Radio]] program ''Hora 20'', the portal ''{{ill|La Silla Vacía (website)|es|La Silla Vacía (medio digital)|lt=La Silla Vacía}}'', the newspaper ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'', and the magazine ''[[Semana]]''.

As a researcher for the Arcoiris Corporation and the Electoral Observation Mission (''Misión de Observación Electoral''; MOE), López was recognized for her work on the atypical polls which were the starting point for uncovering the [[Colombian parapolitics scandal|parapolitics scandal]]. Her critical views on the government of ex-president [[Álvaro Uribe]] and his political allies were equally contentious. Controversy was stirred by her public firing from ''El Tiempo'' in October 2009 due to an opinion column she published there which criticized the paper's coverage of certain news.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lasillavacia.com/perfilquien/19516/claudia-lopez |title=Claudia López |website=La Silla Vacía |language=Spanish |date=8 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901060309/http://lasillavacia.com/perfilquien/19516/claudia-lopez |archive-date=1 September 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

López was the Secretary of Social Action of [[Bogotá]] during the first mayoral term of [[Enrique Peñalosa]].

===Senator of the Republic===

==Controversies==
===Investigations into parapolitics===
López began to gain notoriety after publishing a series of reports on anomalies in regional election processes on the ''Semana'' magazine website. These reports were part of a sequence of events that led to the uncovering of the parapolitics scandal in 2006. Her arguments and opinion columns were controversial and led to judicial problems, as in the case of the complaint filed against her by Antioquia governor [[Luis Alfredo Ramos]] for a column which pointed out that he obtained votes with the help of paramilitary groups. "Ramos could have been elected without the support of the paramilitaries and chose not to do so," she said.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/politica/articuloimpreso-quien-le-teme-claudia-lopez |title=¿Quién le teme a Claudia López? |trans-title=Who's Afraid of Claudia López? |last=Ardila Arrieta |first=Laura |work=[[El Espectador]] |language=Spanish |date=24 May 2008 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> The journalist's allegations were confirmed on 28 August 2013 with the issuance of an arrest warrant against the ex-governor for links with paramilitary groups. Later the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia|Supreme Court]] gave him his freedom due to a lack of evidence and for being the victim of an alleged network of false witnesses.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/corte-suprema-ordeno-captura-de-luis-alfredo-ramos-para-articulo-443048 |title=Corte Suprema ordenó captura de Luis Alfredo Ramos por parapolítica |trans-title=Supreme Court Orders Capture of Luis Alfredo Ramos for Parapolitics |work=[[El Espectador]] |language=Spanish |date=28 August 2013 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-13025582 |title=Corte Suprema ordena captura de Luis Alfredo Ramos por 'parapolítica' |trans-title=Supreme Court Orders Capture of Luis Alfredo Ramos for 'Parapolitics' |work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |language=Spanish |date=28 August 2013 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

===''El Tiempo'' dismissal controversy===
In an October 2009 incident which caused controversy and debate on freedom of expression and of the press in Colombia, López was publicly dismissed from the newspaper ''El Tiempo'' after her regular Tuesday column in which she criticized how the paper had covered information related to the {{ill|Agro Ingreso Seguro|es}} scandal. According to López, members of the Santos family who were former owners and now shareholders of the newspaper tried to favor the candidacy of former minister and president [[Juan Manuel Santos]]. López also referred to the paper's interest in acquiring the country's so-called third private television channel.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-3666495 |title=Reflexiones sobre un escándalo |trans-title=Reflections on a Scandal |last=López |first=Claudia |work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |language=Spanish |date=13 October 2009 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> ''El Tiempo'' published the column, with a note appended that López's opinion was being interpreted as a letter of resignation, which was accepted immediately. At the same time it described the columnist's assertions as "false, malicious, and defamatory."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/america_latina/2009/10/091014_colombia_columnista_rg.shtml |title=Colombia: polémica por despido de columnista de El Tiempo |trans-title=Colombia: Controversy Over Dismissal of El Tiempo Columnist |last=Salazar |first=Hernando |publisher=[[BBC Mundo]] |language=Spanish |date=14 October 2009 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

===Denunciation of ex-president Samper===
In 2011 a criminal proceeding was resolved in López's favor, after ex-president [[Ernesto Samper]] denounced her for insult and defamation for linking him to the Mafia in a column in ''El Tiempo''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/columnista-investigadora-claudia-lopez-absuelta/235968-3#visto |title=Columnista e investigadora Claudia López fue absuelta |trans-title=Columnist and Investigator Claudia López Was Acquitted |magazine=[[Semana]] |language=Spanish |date=24 February 2011 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

==Writings==
Claudia López stood out as a columnist for ''Semana'', ''El Tiempo'', and ''La Silla Vacía''. Her investigations into parapolitics were published in the books ''Parapolítica: la ruta de la expansión paramilitar y los acuerdos políticos'' and ''Y refundaron la patria: de cómo mafiosos y políticos reconfiguraron el Estado colombiano''. In mid-2016 she presented her vision on how to end the armed conflict with the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] in her book ''¡Adiós A Las Farc! ¿Y ahora qué?''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/cultura/esta-vez-paz-si-le-cumpla-los-colombianos-articulo-629775 |title='Que ésta vez la paz sí le cumpla a los Colombianos' |trans-title=This Time Peace Does Agree With the Colombians |work=[[El Espectador]] |language=Spanish |date=29 April 2016 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On 2 September 2014, an attorney sued Senator López for having a relationship with [[House of Representatives (Colombia)|Representative]] [[Angélica Lozano Correa]], because the law prohibits two Congress members who have a ''de facto'' marital union from being members of the same political party. However, López and Lozano have argued that this prohibition does not apply to them since they maintain an engagement and not a marital union.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://caracol.com.co/radio/2014/09/02/nacional/1409639340_394910.html |title=Alianza Verde rechaza ataque homofóbico a Claudia López y Angélica Lozano |trans-title=Green Alliance Rejects Homophobic Attack on Claudia López and Angélica Lozano |publisher=[[Caracol Radio]] |language=Spanish |date=2 September 2014 |access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ntn24.com/noticia/presentan-demanda-que-busca-invalidar-la-investidura-de-dos-congresistas-colombianas-por-ser-pareja-24228 |title=Presentan demanda que busca invalidar la investidura de dos congresistas colombianas por ser pareja |trans-title=Suit Seeks To Invalidate the Investiture of Two Colombian Congress Members For Being a Couple |publisher=[[Nuestra Tele Noticias 24 Horas|NTN24]] |language=Spanish |date=2 September 2014 |access-date=16 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903133536/http://www.ntn24.com/noticia/presentan-demanda-que-busca-invalidar-la-investidura-de-dos-congresistas-colombianas-por-ser-pareja-24228 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> López and Lozano married in December 2019.<ref name="guardian-17dec2019">{{cite news |title=Colombia: Bogotá's first female mayor marries same-sex partner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/17/colombia-bogota-claudia-lopez-first-female-mayor-marries-same-sex-partner |accessdate=17 December 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=17 December 2019}}</ref>
