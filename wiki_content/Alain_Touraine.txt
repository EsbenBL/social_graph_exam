'''Alain Touraine''' ({{IPA-fr|tuʁɛn|lang}}; born 3 August 1925) is a French [[sociology|sociologist]]. He is research director at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], where he founded the ''Centre d'étude des mouvements sociaux''. Touraine was an important figure in the founding of French [[Industrial sociology|sociology of work]] after World War II and later became an internationally-renowned sociologist of [[Social movement|social movements]], particularly the [[May 68]] student movement in France and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade-union movement in communist Poland. 

== Biography ==
Touraine completed his [[khâgne]] (preparatory school) at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, and entered the [[École normale supérieure (Paris)|École Normale Supérieure]] in 1945. He left his studies at the ENS for a research trip in Hungary, and then worked at a mine in Valenciennes in 1947-1948 after his return to France. Touraine's work in the industrial milieu and his simultaneous discovery of the sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]]'s ''Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel'' led him to return to studies in history at the ENS and to pass the ''agrégation'' in history in 1950. 

The same year, he became a researcher in sociology at the CNRS, working in the new subfield of sociology of work under Friedmann. Touraine conducted field research at the Renault auto factory in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] in Paris, which would lead to his first sociological monograph, published in 1955.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Touraine|first=Alain|title=L'évolution du travail ouvrier aux usines Renault|publisher=CNRS|year=1955|location=Paris}}</ref> In 1952, he received a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to study at Harvard with [[Talcott Parsons]]. 

Touraine defended his two doctoral theses at the University of Paris in 1964. His major thesis was published as ''Sociologie de l'action'' in 1965, and his minor thesis as ''La conscience ouvrière'' in 1966, both by Éditions du Seuil.

Touraine is the father of two children: [[Marisol Touraine|Marisol]], who served as the French Minister of Social Affairs and Health from 2012 to 2017 in the government of [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] and [[Manuel Valls]]; and Philippe, a professor of endocrinology at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital]] in Paris.

==Work==
Part of the first generation of French ''sociologues du travail'' after World War II, Touraine was a pioneer of sociological [[Field research|fieldwork]] in industrial settings in France, drawing on the influence of American [[industrial sociology]] and [[industrial relations]], as well as the survey research of [[Paul Lazarsfeld]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chapoulie|first=Jean-Michel|date=1991|title=La seconde fondation de la sociologie française, les États-Unis et la classe ouvrière|journal=Revue française de sociologie|volume=32|pages=321–364|doi=10.2307/3322321|jstor=3322321}}</ref> Touraine's 1955 study of Renault articulated the "ABC" theory of [[automation]] which was adopted by 1960s radical sociologists of the "new working class," including Serge Mallet.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Masson|first=Philippe|title=Les enquêtes sociologiques en France depuis 1945|publisher=La Découverte|year=2017|location=Paris|pages=37–56}}</ref>

Touraine's mature work after 1960 is based on a "sociology of action", which he called "actionalism",<ref>Volkmar Gessner, David Nelken, ''European Ways of Law: Towards a European Sociology of Law'' (2007), p. 166.</ref> and believes that society shapes its future through structural mechanisms and its own social struggles. Expressed in his first theoretical statement, ''Sociologie de l'action'', Touraine conceived "actionalism" as an alternative to the functionalism of Talcott Parsons, toward which he has frequently expressed disdain throughout his career.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Touraine|first=Alain|title=Un désir d'histoire|publisher=Stock|year=1977|location=Paris|pages=64–67}}</ref>

Touraine was a professor of sociology at [[Paris Nanterre University|Nanterre]] when the student movement of [[May 68|May 1968]] broke out on its campus. Touraine observed the movement on the ground and wrote one of the first studies of it; 1968 marked a transition in his work away from labor and the working class toward [[Social movement|social movements]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Touraine|first=Alain|title=The May Movement: Revolt and Reform|publisher=Random House|year=1971|location=New York|translator-last=Mayhew|translator-first=Leonard}}</ref> Touraine, who in his 1960s work had been a major theorist of "[[industrial society]]," published one of the first books articulating a concept of "[[post-industrial society]]" in 1969, though the American sociologists [[Daniel Bell]] and [[David Riesman]] had already been using the term.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brick|first=Howard|date=1998|title=Optimism of the Mind: Imagining Postindustrial Society in the 1960s and 1970s|journal=American Quarterly|volume=44:3|pages=348–380}}</ref>

His prime interest for most of his career has been with [[social movements]]. He has studied and written extensively on workers' movements across the world, particularly in [[Latin America]]. In [[Poland]] where he observed and {{citation needed span|text=aided|date=July 2014}} the emergence of the dissident movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarnosc]]. While in Poland, he developed the research method of "Sociological Intervention," which had been outlined in "The Voice and the Eye" (''La Voix et le Regard'') [1981].

Touraine has gained popularity in Latin America as well as in continental [[Europe]].  He has failed to gain the same recognition in the English-speaking world, although half of his books have been translated into English. He participated in 1969 at the Universitas project{{clarify|date=May 2016}} organized by Argentine architect [[Emilio Ambasz]].

== Honours ==
In 2010, he was jointly awarded, with [[Zygmunt Bauman]], the Príncipe de Asturias Prize for Communication and the Humanities.<ref>[http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531174332/http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities/ |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref>
