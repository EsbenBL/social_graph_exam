Particularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'' (1967) to be his most important work.

==Life==
Derrida was born on July 15, 1930, in a summer home in [[El Biar]] ([[Algiers]]), Algeria,<ref name="Jackie"/> into a [[Sephardic]] [[Jews|Jewish]] family (originally from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) that became French in 1870 when the [[Crémieux Decree]] granted full French citizenship to the [[Jews]] of Algeria.<ref>"I took part in the extraordinary transformation of the Algerian Jews; my great-grandparents were by language, custom, etc., still identified with Arabic culture.

Derrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Moïse died at less than three months old, the year before Derrida was born, leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother.''<ref name="Powell 2006, p. 12"/>'' Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.

On the first day of the school year in 1942, [[French Algeria|French administrators in Algeria]] —implementing [[antisemitism]] quotas set by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government—expelled Derrida from his [[lycée]]. He secretly skipped school for a year rather than attend the Jewish lycée formed by displaced teachers and students, and also took part in numerous [[association football|football]] competitions (he dreamed of becoming a professional player). In this adolescent period, Derrida found in the works of philosophers and writers (such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[André Gide|Gide]]) an instrument of revolt against family and society.<ref name="TeenBooks"/> His reading also included [[Albert Camus|Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]].<ref name = "TeenBooks" />

In the late 1940s, he attended the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Bugeaud|fr}}, in Algiers;<ref name="Schrift p. 120"/> in 1949 he moved to Paris,<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="stanford"/> attending the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]],<ref name="Schrift p. 120"/> where his professor of philosophy was [[Étienne Borne]].<ref>Marc Goldschmidt, ''Jacques Derrida : une introduction'', 2003, p. 231.</ref> At that time he prepared for his entrance exam to the prestigious [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS); after failing the exam on his first try, he passed it on the second, and was admitted in 1952.<ref name="stanford"/> On his first day at ENS, Derrida met [[Louis Althusser]], with whom he became friends. After visiting the [[Husserl-Archives Leuven|Husserl Archive]] in [[Leuven]], Belgium (1953–1954), he completed his [[master's degree]] in philosophy (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'') on [[Edmund Husserl]] (see [[#Early works|below]]). He then passed the highly competitive ''[[agrégation]]'' exam in 1956. Derrida received a grant for studies at [[Harvard University]], and he spent the 1956–57 academic year reading [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' at the [[Widener Library]].<ref name = "Caputo97P25">Caputo (1997), p. 25.</ref> In June 1957, he married the psychoanalyst [[Marguerite Aucouturier]] in [[Boston]]. During the [[Algerian War of Independence]] of 1954–1962, Derrida asked to teach soldiers' children in lieu of military service, teaching French and English from 1957 to 1959.

Following the war, from 1960 to 1964, Derrida taught philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he was an assistant of [[Suzanne Bachelard]] (daughter of [[Gaston Bachelard|Gaston]]), [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Paul Ricœur]] (who in these years coined the term ''hermeneutics of suspicion'') and [[Jean Wahl]].<ref>Bennington (1991), p. 330</ref> His wife, Marguerite, gave birth to their first child, [[Pierre Alféri|Pierre]], in 1963. In 1964, on the recommendation of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]], Derrida got a permanent teaching position at the ENS, which he kept until 1984.<ref name="Powell06p34-5"/><ref name="Powell06p58"/> In 1965 Derrida began an association with the ''[[Tel Quel]]'' group of literary and philosophical theorists, which lasted for seven years.<ref name="Powell06p58">Powell (2006), p. 58</ref> Derrida's subsequent distance from the ''Tel Quel'' group, after 1971, has been attributed{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to his reservations about their embrace of [[Maoism]] and of the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>Leslie Hill, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Jacques Derrida'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 55.</ref>

With "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]", his contribution to a 1966 colloquium on [[structuralism]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], his work began to gain international prominence. At the same colloquium Derrida would meet [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Paul de Man]], the latter an important interlocutor in the years to come.<ref>Jacques Derrida and Geoffrey Bennington, ''Jacques Derrida'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994, p. 331</ref> A second son, Jean, was born in 1967. In the same year, Derrida published his first three books—''[[Writing and Difference]]'', ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'', and ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.

In 1980, he received his first [[honorary doctorate]] (from [[Columbia University]]) and was awarded his [[State doctorate]] (''doctorat d'État'') by submitting to the [[University of Paris]] ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title "{{lang|fr|L'inscription de la philosophie : Recherches sur l'interprétation de l'écriture}}" ("Inscription in Philosophy: Research on the Interpretation of Writing").<ref name="Schrift p. 120"/><ref name="Powell p. 145">Powell (2006), p. 145.</ref> The text of Derrida's defense was based on an abandoned draft thesis he had prepared in 1957 under the direction of [[Jean Hyppolite]] at the ENS entitled "The Ideality of the Literary Object"<ref name="Powell p. 145"/> ("{{lang|fr|L'idéalité de l’objet littéraire}}");<ref>[http://www.leseditionsdeminuit.com/f/index.php?sp=livAut&auteur_id=1522 Jacques Derrida - Editions de Minuit]</ref> his 1980 dissertation was subsequently published in English translation as "The Time of a Thesis: Punctuations". In 1983 Derrida collaborated with [[Ken McMullen (film director)|Ken McMullen]] on the film ''[[Ghost Dance (film)|Ghost Dance]]''. Derrida appears in the film as himself and also contributed to the script.

Derrida traveled widely and held a series of visiting and permanent positions. Derrida became full professor ({{lang|fr|directeur d'études}}) at the {{lang|fr|[[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]]}} in Paris from 1984 (he had been elected at the end of 1983).<ref name="Powell p. 145"/>  With [[François Châtelet]] and others he in 1983 co-founded the {{lang|fr|[[Collège international de philosophie]]}} (CIPH; 'International college of philosophy'), an institution intended to provide a location for philosophical research which could not be carried out elsewhere in the academia. He was elected as its first president. In 1985 [[Sylviane Agacinski]] gave birth to Derrida's third child, Daniel.<ref name="Guardian20041011">[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/11/guardianobituaries.france "Obituary: Jacques Derrida"], by Derek Attridge and Thomas Baldwin, ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 11, 2004.

On May 8, 1985, Derrida was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], to Class IV - Humanities, Section 3 -Criticism and Philology.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=American Academy of Arts & Sciences |title=Members Elected May 8, 1985 |journal=Records of the Academy |date=1985 |volume=1984/1985 |issue=1984/1985 |page=51 |jstor=3785759 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3785759?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=%28%28Derrida%29+AND+%28%22American+Academy+of+Arts+and+Sciences%22%29%29&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Fgroup%3Dnone%26q0%3DDerrida%26q1%3D%2522American%2BAcademy%2Bof%2BArts%2Band%2BSciences%2522%26q2%3D%26q3%3D%26q4%3D%26q5%3D%26q6%3D%26sd%3D%26ed%3D%26pt%3D%26isbn%3D%26f0%3Dall%26c1%3DAND%26f1%3Dall%26c2%3DAND%26f2%3Dall%26c3%3DAND%26f3%3Dall%26c4%3DAND%26f4%3Dall%26c5%3DAND%26f5%3Dall%26c6%3DAND%26f6%3Dall%26acc%3Doff%26la%3D&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-5917%2Ftest&refreqid=fastly-default%3A2f38ecab4fd96695d3c3e52917e3ed25&seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents |access-date=17 June 2021}}</ref>

In 1986 Derrida became Professor of the Humanities at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he taught until shortly before his death in 2004. His papers were filed in the university archives. After Derrida's death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI's archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida's widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine's collection, although it dropped the suit in 2007.<ref>[http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/ UC Irvine drops suit over Derrida's personal papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520021511/http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/ |date=May 20, 2012 }}</ref>

Derrida was a regular visiting professor at several other major American and European universities, including [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Yale University]], [[New York University]], [[Stony Brook University]], and [[The New School for Social Research]].

He was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[University of Cambridge]] (1992), [[Columbia University]], [[The New School for Social Research]], the [[University of Essex]], [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], the [[University of Silesia]], the [[University of Coimbra]], the [[University of Athens]], and many others around the world.  In 2001, he received the [[:De:Theodor-W.-Adorno-Preis|Adorno-Preis]] from the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]].

Derrida's honorary degree at Cambridge was protested by leading philosophers in the analytic tradition.  Philosophers including [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus|Marcus]], and [[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong]] wrote a letter to the university objecting that "Derrida's work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour," and "Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2016/03/the-letter-against-derridas-honorary-degree.html |title=The Letter against Derrida's Honorary Degree, re-examined |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

Late in his life, Derrida participated in making two biographical documentaries, ''D'ailleurs, Derrida'' (''Derrida's Elsewhere'') by [[Safaa Fathy]] (1999),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356496/ IMDb]</ref> and ''[[Derrida (film)|Derrida]]'' by [[Kirby Dick]] and Amy Ziering Kofman (2002).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303326/ IMDb]</ref>

Derrida was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2003, which reduced his speaking and travelling engagements.<ref>[http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_derrida.html philosophybasics.com]</ref> He died during surgery in a hospital in Paris in the early hours of October 9, 2004.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21050-2004Oct9.html, Jacques Derrida Dies; Deconstructionist Philosopher], accessed May 9, 2012.</ref><ref name="obituary">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/jacques-derrida-abstruse-theorist-dies-at-74.html |title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74 |last=Kandell |first=Jonathan |work=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2004}}</ref>

At the time of his death, Derrida had agreed to go for the summer to [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] as holder of the [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] professorship,<ref name="uni-heidelberg.de">
"[http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/press358_e.html The University of Heidelberg Mourns the Death of Jacques Derrida]"</ref> whose invitation was expressed by the hermeneutic philosopher himself before his death.

With his detailed readings of works from Plato to Rousseau to Heidegger, Derrida frequently argues that Western philosophy has uncritically allowed metaphorical depth models{{Technical statement|date=July 2019}} to govern its conception of language and consciousness.  He sees these often unacknowledged assumptions as part of a "metaphysics of presence" to which philosophy has bound itself.  This "logocentrism," Derrida argues, creates "marked" or hierarchized binary oppositions that have an effect on everything from our conception of speech's relation to writing to our understanding of racial difference.  Deconstruction is an attempt to expose and undermine such "metaphysics."

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around binary oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This approach to text is, in a broad sense, influenced by the [[semiology]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].<ref name="Royle04p62">[[Nicholas Royle|Royle, Nicholas]] (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC ''Jacques Derrida''], pp. 62–63</ref><ref name="Ferraris97p76">Derrida and Ferraris (1997), p. 76:

The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it.

===Early works<!--linked from the 'Life' section-->===
Derrida began his career examining the limits of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. His first lengthy academic manuscript, written as a dissertation for his {{lang|fr|diplôme d'études supérieures}} and submitted in 1954, concerned the work of [[Edmund Husserl]].<ref>The dissertation was eventually published in 1990 with the title {{lang|fr|Le problème de la genèse dans la philosophie de Husserl}}. English translation: ''The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy'' (2003).</ref> Gary Banham has said that the dissertation is "in many respects the most ambitious of Derrida's interpretations with Husserl, not merely in terms of the number of works addressed but also in terms of the extraordinarily focused nature of its investigation."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Banham|first=Gary|date=2005-01-01|title=The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy, by Jacques Derrida|journal=Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=99–101|doi=10.1080/00071773.2005.11007469|s2cid=170686297|issn=0007-1773}}</ref> In 1962 he published ''Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction'', which contained his own translation of Husserl's essay. Many elements of Derrida's thought were already present in this work. In the interviews collected in ''[[Positions (book)|Positions]]'' (1972), Derrida said: 
{{quote|text=In this essay the problematic of writing was already in place as such, bound to the irreducible structure of 'deferral' in its relationships to consciousness, presence, science, history and the history of science, the disappearance or delay of the origin, etc. ... this essay can be read as the other side (recto or verso, as you wish) of ''Speech and Phenomena''.|source=Derrida, 1967, interview with Henri Ronse<ref name="67RonseP5">J. Derrida (1967), interview with Henri Ronse, p. 5.</ref>}}

Derrida first received major attention outside France with his lecture, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," delivered at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 (and subsequently included in ''Writing and Difference''). The conference at which this paper was delivered was concerned with [[structuralism]], then at the peak of its influence in France, but only beginning to gain attention in the United States. Derrida differed from other participants by his lack of explicit commitment to structuralism, having already been critical of the movement. He praised the accomplishments of structuralism but also maintained reservations about its internal limitations;<ref>Jacques Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," in ''[[Writing and Difference]]'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), p. 278.</ref> this has led US academics to label his thought as a form of [[post-structuralism]].<ref name="Bensmaia05">Bensmaïa, Réda, "Poststructuralism", in Kritzman (2005), pp. 92–93.</ref><ref name="Poster88">Poster (1988), pp. 5–6.</ref><ref>
{{quote|... the entire history of the concept of structure, before the rupture of which we are speaking, must be thought of as a series of substitutions of centre for centre, as a linked chain of determinations of the centre. Successively, and in a regulated fashion, the centre receives different forms or names.

Its matrix ... is the determination of [[Being]] as ''presence'' in all senses of this word. It could be shown that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the centre have always designated an invariable presence – ''[[eidos (philosophy)|eidos]]'', ''[[archē]]'', ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'', ''[[energeia]]'', ''[[ousia]]'' (essence, existence, substance, subject), ''[[aletheia|alētheia]]'', transcendentality, consciousness, God, man, and so forth.|"Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 353.}}</ref>

The effect of Derrida's paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970, the title of the collection had become ''The Structuralist Controversy''. The conference was also where he met [[Paul de Man]], who would be a close friend and source of great controversy, as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], with whose work Derrida had a mixed relationship.

===Phenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959)===
In the early 1960s, Derrida began speaking and writing publicly, addressing the most topical debates at the time. One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of [[structuralism]], which was being widely favoured as the successor to the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] approach, the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier. Derrida's countercurrent take on the issue, at a prominent international conference, was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a "phenomenology vs structuralism debate."

Phenomenology, as envisioned by Husserl, is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's "lived experience;" for those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event.<ref>{{Citation|last=Smith|first=David Woodruff|title=Phenomenology|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/phenomenology/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2021-06-20}}</ref> For the structuralists, this was a false problem, and the "depth" of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Poythress|first=Vern S.|date=May 31, 2012|title=Philosophical Roots of Phenomenological and Structuralist Literary Criticism|url=https://frame-poythress.org/philosophical-roots-of-phenomenological-and-structuralist-literary-criticism/|url-status=live|access-date=June 20, 2021|website=The Works of John Frame & Vern Poythress}}</ref>

In that context, in 1959, Derrida asked the question: Must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be ''already'' structured, in order to be the genesis ''of'' something?<ref>Jacques Derrida, "'Genesis' and 'Structure' and Phenomenology," in ''Writing and Difference'' (London: Routledge, 1978), paper originally delivered in 1959 at Cerisy-la-Salle, and originally published in Gandillac, Goldmann & Piaget (eds.), ''Genèse et structure'' (The Hague: Morton, 1964), p. 167:

{{quote|All these formulations have been possible thanks to the initial distinction between different irreducible types of genesis and structure: worldly genesis and transcendental genesis, empirical structure, eidetic structure, and transcendental structure. To ask oneself the following historico-semantic question: "What does the notion of genesis ''in general'', on whose basis the Husserlian diffraction could come forth and be understood, mean, and what has it always meant? What does the notion of structure ''in general'', on whose basis Husserl ''operates'' and operates distinctions between empirical, eidetic, and transcendental dimensions mean, and what has it always meant throughout its displacements? And what is the historico-semantic relationship between Genesis and structure ''in general''?" is not only simply to ask a prior linguistic question. It is to ask the question about the unity of the historical ground on whose basis a transcendental reduction is possible and is motivated by itself. It is to ask the question about the unity of the world from which transcendental freedom releases itself, in order to make the origin of this unity appear.}}</ref> In other words, every structural or "synchronic" phenomenon has a history, and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis.<ref>If in 1959 Derrida was addressing this question of genesis and structure to Husserl, that is, to phenomenology, then in "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" (also in ''Writing and Difference''; see [[#1967–1972|below]]), he addresses these same questions to Lévi-Strauss and the structuralists. This is clear from the very first line of the paper (p. 278):

{{quote|Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an "event," if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of structural—or structuralist—thought to reduce or to suspect.}}

Between these two papers is staked Derrida's philosophical ground, if not indeed his step beyond or outside philosophy.</ref> At the same time, in order that there be movement or potential, the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity, but must already be articulated—complex—such that from it a "diachronic" process can emerge. This original complexity must not be understood as an original ''positing'', but more like a default of origin, which Derrida refers to as iterability, inscription, or textuality.<ref name="DerridaScarpetta71">Derrida (1971), Scarpetta interview, quote from pp. 77–8:

{{quote|If the alterity of the other is ''posed'', that is, ''only'' posed, does it not amount to ''the same'', for example in the form of the "constituted object" or of the "informed product" invested with meaning, etc.? From this point of view, I would even say that the alterity of the other ''inscribes'' in this relationship that which in no case can be "posed." Inscription, as I would define it in this respect, is not a simple position: it is rather that by means of which every position is ''of itself confounded'' ({{lang|fr|[[différance]]}}): inscription, mark, text and not only ''thesis or theme''-inscription of the ''thesis''.}}

On the phrase "default of origin" as applied to Derrida's work, cf. [[Bernard Stiegler]], "Derrida and Technology: Fidelity at the Limits of Deconstruction and the Prosthesis of Faith," in Tom Cohen (ed.) ''Jacques Derrida and the Humanities'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001). Stiegler understands Derrida's thinking of textuality and inscription in terms of a thinking of originary technicity, and in this context speaks of "the originary default of origin that arche-writing constitutes" (p. 239). See also Stiegler, ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 1998).</ref> It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derrida's work in motion, and from which all of its terms are derived, including "deconstruction".<ref>It is opposed to the concept of original purity, which destabilises the thought of both "genesis" and "structure", cf. [[Rodolphe Gasché]], ''The Tain of the Mirror'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, & London: Harvard University Press, 1986), p. 146:

{{quote|It is an opening that is structural or the structurality of an opening. Yet each of these concepts excludes the other. It is thus as little a structure as it is an opening; it is as little static as it is genetic, as little structural as it is historical. It can be understood neither from a genetic nor from a structuralist and taxonomic point of view, nor from a combination of both points of view.}}

And note that this complexity of the origin is thus not only spatial but temporal, which is why différancedifférance}} is a matter not only of difference but of delay or deferral. One way in which this question is raised in relation to Husserl is thus the question of the possibility of a phenomenology of history, which Derrida raises in ''Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction'' (1962).</ref>

Derrida's method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity, and their multiple consequences in many fields. He achieved this by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the [[aporia]]s and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.<ref>Cf. Rodolphe Gasché, "Infrastructures and Systematicity," in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), ''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago & London: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 3–4:

{{quote|One of the more persistent misunderstandings that have thus far forestalled a productive debate with Derrida's philosophical thought is the assumption, shared by many philosophers as well as literary critics, that within that thought just anything is possible. Derrida's philosophy is more often than not construed as a license for arbitrary free play in flagrant disregard of all established rules of argumentation, traditional requirements of thought, and ethical standards binding upon the interpretative community. Undoubtedly, some of the works of Derrida may not have been entirely innocent in this respect and may have contributed, however obliquely, to fostering to some extent that very misconception. But deconstruction which for many has come to designate the content and style of Derrida's thinking, reveals to even a superficial examination, a well-ordered procedure, a step-by-step type of argumentation based on an acute awareness of level-distinctions, a marked thoroughness and regularity. ... Deconstruction must be understood, we contend, as the attempt to "account," in a certain manner, for a heterogeneous variety or manifold of nonlogical contradictions and discursive equalities of all sorts that continues to haunt and fissure even the ''successful'' development of philosophical arguments and their systematic exposition.}}</ref>

===1967–1972<!--linked from the 'Phenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959)' section-->===
Derrida's interests crossed disciplinary boundaries, and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: ''Speech and Phenomena'', ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' (initially submitted as a {{lang|fr|[[Doctorat de spécialité]]}} thesis under [[Maurice de Gandillac]]),<ref name="Schrift p. 120">Alan D.

Doubtless, I could have bound it as a long note to one or the other of the other two works. ''Of Grammatology'' refers to it and economizes its development. But in a classical philosophical architecture, ''Speech...'' would come first: in it is posed, at a point which appears juridically decisive for reasons that I cannot explain here, the question of the privilege of the voice and of phonetic writing in their relationship to the entire history of the West, such as this history can be represented by the history of metaphysics and metaphysics in its most modern, critical and vigilant form: Husserl's transcendental phenomenology."</ref>

On several occasions, Derrida has acknowledged his debt to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and stated that without them he would not have said a single word.<ref name="67RonseP8">Derrida (1967) interview with Henri Ronse, p. 8</ref><ref name="LetterJap">On the influence of Heidegger, Derrida claims in his "Letter to a Japanese Friend" (''Derrida and différance'', eds.

This relationship with the Heideggerian term was chosen over the Nietzschean term "demolition," as Derrida shared Heidegger's interest in renovating philosophy.</ref> Among the questions asked in these essays are "What is 'meaning', what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric 'voice' as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?"<ref name="67RonseP4"/> In another essay in ''Writing and Difference'' entitled "Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas", the roots of another major theme in Derrida's thought emerges: the Other as opposed to the Same<ref>Derrida, J.

This collection of three books published in 1967 elaborated Derrida's theoretical framework. Derrida attempts to approach the very heart of the [[Western intellectual tradition]], characterizing this tradition as "a search for a transcendental being that serves as the origin or guarantor of meaning". The attempt to "ground the meaning relations constitutive of the world in an instance that itself lies outside all relationality" was referred to by Heidegger as [[logocentrism]], and Derrida argues that the philosophical enterprise is ''essentially'' logocentric,<ref name="Lamont87">{{Cite journal | jstor=2780292| title=How to Become a Dominant French Philosopher: The Case of Jacques Derrida| journal=American Journal of Sociology| volume=93| issue=3| pages=584–622| last1=Lamont| first1=Michele| date=November 1987| doi=10.1086/228790| s2cid=145090666| url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3428546/lamont_derrida.pdf?sequence=4}}</ref> and that this is a [[paradigm]] inherited from Judaism and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]].<ref name="Borody98"/> He in turn describes logocentrism as phallocratic, [[patriarchal]] and [[masculine|masculinist]].<ref name="Borody98"/><ref>[[Hélène Cixous]], [[Catherine Clément]] [1975] ''La jeune née''</ref> Derrida contributed to "the understanding of certain deeply hidden philosophical presuppositions and prejudices in [[Western culture]]",<ref name="Borody98">[http://www.nipissingu.ca/faculty/wayneb/ Wayne A.

It follows the shifting role of ''Geist'' (spirit) through Heidegger's work, noting that, in 1927, "spirit" was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling.<ref>Derrida (1989) ''Of Spirit'', pp.vii-1</ref> With his Nazi political engagement in 1933, however, Heidegger came out as a champion of the "German Spirit," and only withdrew from an exalting interpretation of the term in 1953.

''Of Spirit'' contributes to the long debate on Heidegger's Nazism and appeared at the same time as the French publication of a book by a previously unknown Chilean writer, [[Victor Farías]], who charged that Heidegger's philosophy amounted to a wholehearted endorsement of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) faction. Derrida responded to Farías in an interview, "Heidegger, the Philosopher's Hell" and a subsequent article, "Comment donner raison? How to Concede, with Reasons?" He called Farías a weak reader of Heidegger's thought, adding that much of the evidence Farías and his supporters touted as new had long been known within the philosophical community.<ref>Powell (2006), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sbhlgspwVwMC&pg=PA167 167].</ref>

===1990s: political and ethical themes===
Some have argued that Derrida's work took a political and ethical "turn" in the 1990s. Texts cited as evidence of such a turn include ''[[Force of Law]]'' (1990), as well as ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' (1994) and ''Politics of Friendship'' (1994). Some refer to ''The Gift of Death'' as evidence that he began more directly applying deconstruction to the relationship between ethics and religion. In this work, Derrida interprets passages from the Bible, particularly on [[Abraham]] and the [[Binding of Isaac|Sacrifice of Isaac]],<ref>Jack Reynolds, Jonathan Roffe (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D7jq50nVzGAC Understanding Derrida]'' p. 49</ref><ref>''Gift of Death'', pp. 57–72</ref>  and from [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''.

However, scholars such as [[Leonard Lawlor]], [[Robert Magliola]], and Nicole Anderson have argued that the "turn" has been exaggerated.<ref>Leonard Lawlor, ''Derrida and Hume: The Basic Problem of Phenomenology'', Indiana University Press, 2002, p. 211; Robert Magliola, ''[https://global.oup.com/academic/search?q=Robert+Magliola&cc=us&lang=en On Deconstructing Life-Worlds: Buddhism, Christianity, Culture]'', Scholars Press of American Academy of Religion, 1997; Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 157-165; Nicole Anderson, ''Derrida: Ethics Under Erasure'', Bloomsbury, 2012, p. 24.</ref>{{Additional citation needed|date=May 2020}} Some, including Derrida himself, have argued that much of the philosophical work done in his "political turn" can be dated to earlier essays.<ref name="Martha C.

Derrida develops an ethicist view respecting to hospitality, exploring the idea that two types of hospitalities exist, conditional and unconditional. Though this contributed to the works of many scholars, Derrida was seriously criticized for this.<ref>Rorty, R. (1995). Habermas, Derrida, and the functions of philosophy. Revue internationale de philosophie, 49(194 (4), 437-459.</ref><ref>Rorty, R. (1989). Is Derrida a transcendental philosopher?. The Yale Journal of Criticism, 2(2), 207.</ref><ref>McCumber, J. (2000). Philosophy and Freedom: Derrida, Rorty, Habermas, Foucault. Indiana University Press.</ref>

Derrida's contemporary readings of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Jan Patočka]], on themes such as law, justice, responsibility, and friendship, had a significant impact on fields beyond philosophy. Derrida and Deconstruction influenced aesthetics, literary criticism, architecture, [[film theory]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[historiography]], law, [[psychoanalysis]], [[theology]], [[feminism]], gay and lesbian studies and political theory. [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[Harold Bloom]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]], [[Gary Peller]], [[Drucilla Cornell]], [[Alan Hunt (professor)|Alan Hunt]], [[Hayden White]], [[Mario Kopić]], and [[Alun Munslow]] are some of the authors who have been influenced by deconstruction.

Derrida delivered a eulogy at Levinas' funeral, later published as ''Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas'', an appreciation and exploration of Levinas's moral philosophy. Derrida used [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]'s interpretation of Lévinas' notion of femininity and transformed his own earlier reading of this subject respectively.<ref>B. L. Ettinger in conversation with Emmanuel Lévinas, "Que dirait Eurydice?" / "What would Eurydice Say?" (1991-93). Reprinted to coincide with Kabinet exhibition at Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. Paris: BLE Atelier, 1997. This is a reprint of Le féminin est cette différence inouïe (Livre d'artiste, 1994, and it includes the text of Time is the Breath of the Spirit, MOMA, Oxford, 1993.) Reprinted in Athena: Philosophical Studies. Vol. 2, 2006.</ref>

Derrida continued to produce readings of literature, writing extensively on [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Paul Celan]], and others.

In 1991 he published ''The Other Heading'', in which he discussed the concept of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] (as in [[cultural identity]], [[European identity]], and [[national identity]]), in the name of which in Europe have been unleashed "the worst violences," "the crimes of xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, religious or nationalist fanaticism."<ref>''The Other Heading'', pp. 5–6</ref>

At the 1997 [[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle|Cerisy Conference]], Derrida delivered a ten-hour address on the subject of "the autobiographical animal" entitled [[The Animal That Therefore I Am (More To Follow)]]. Engaging with questions surrounding the ontology of nonhuman animals, the ethics of animal slaughter and the difference between humans and other animals, the address has been seen as initiating a late "animal turn" in Derrida's philosophy, although Derrida himself has said that his interest in animals is present in his earliest writings.<ref>Derrida (2008), 15</ref>

===''The Work of Mourning'' (1981–2001)===
Beginning with "The Deaths of Roland Barthes" in 1981, Derrida produced a series of texts on mourning and memory occasioned by the loss of his friends and colleagues, many of them new engagements with their work. ''Memoires for Paul de Man'', a book-length lecture series presented first at Yale and then at Irvine as Derrida's Wellek Lecture, followed in 1986, with a revision in 1989 that included "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War". Ultimately, fourteen essays were collected into ''The Work of Mourning'' (2001), which was expanded in the 2003 French edition, ''Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde'' (literally, "Unique each time, the end of the world"), to include essays dedicated to [[Gérard Granel]] and Maurice Blanchot.

===2002===
In October 2002, at the theatrical opening of the film ''[[Derrida (film)|Derrida]]'', he said that, in many ways, he felt more and more close to [[Guy Debord]]'s work, and that this closeness appears in Derrida's texts. Derrida mentioned, in particular, "everything I say about the media, technology, the spectacle, and the 'criticism of the show', so to speak, and the markets – the becoming-a-spectacle of everything, and the exploitation of the spectacle."<ref name="Derrida02Q&A">Derrida (2002) Q&A session at Film Forum</ref> Among the places in which Derrida mentions the ''[[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]]'', is a 1997 interview about the notion of the intellectual.<ref name="Derrida 97 Intellectuels p39">{{Cite journal|last = Derrida|orig-year = 1997|title = Les Intellectuels|year = 2005|pages = 39–40|language = fr}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Prose|section|date=March 2018}}
Derrida engaged with many political issues, movements, and debates:
* Although Derrida participated in the rallies of the [[May 1968 protests]], and organized the first general assembly at the ''École Normale Superieure'', he said "I was on my guard, even worried in the face of a certain cult of spontaneity, a fusionist, anti-unionist euphoria, in the face of the enthusiasm of a finally "freed" speech, of restored "transparence," and so forth."<ref name="Derrida91MagLitEwald">Derrida (1991) ''"A 'Madness' Must Watch Over Thinking"'', pp. 347–9.</ref> During [[May '68]], he met frequently with [[Maurice Blanchot]].<ref>Bennington (1991), p. 332</ref>
* He registered his objections to the [[Vietnam War]] in delivering "The Ends of Man" in the United States.
* In 1977, he was among the intellectuals, with Foucault and Althusser, who signed the [[French petition against age of consent laws|petition against age of consent laws]].
* In 1981 Derrida, on the prompting of [[Roger Scruton]] and others, founded the French Jan Hus association with structuralist historian [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]]. Its purpose was to aid dissident or persecuted Czech intellectuals. Derrida became vice-president.<ref name="Powell06p151">Powell (2006), p. 151</ref>
* In late 1981 he was arrested by the [[Czechoslovakia]]n government upon leading a conference in [[Prague]] that lacked government authorization, and charged with the "production and trafficking of drugs", which he claimed were planted as he visited Kafka's grave. He was released (or "expelled", as the Czechoslovakian government put it) after the interventions of the [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] government, and the assistance of Michel Foucault, returning to Paris on January 1, 1982.<ref>Jacques Derrida, "'To Do Justice to Freud': The History of Madness in the Age of Psychoanalysis," ''Resistances of Psychoanalysis'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998) pp. 70–1.</ref>
* He registered his concerns against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in 1984.<ref>Derrida, Jacques. "No Apocalypse, Not Now (full speed ahead, seven missiles, seven missives)". Diacritics, 1984</ref>
* He was active in cultural activities against the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid government of South Africa]] and on behalf of [[Nelson Mandela]] beginning in 1983.
* He met with [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] intellectuals during a 1988 visit to [[Jerusalem]].
* He protested against the death penalty, dedicating his seminar in his last years to the production of a non-[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument for its abolition, and was active in the campaign to free [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]].
* Derrida was not known to have participated in any conventional electoral [[political party]] until 1995, when he joined a committee in support of [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] candidacy, although he expressed misgivings about such organizations going back to [[French Communist Party|Communist]] organizational efforts while he was a student at ENS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* In the [[2002 French presidential election]] he refused to vote in the run-off between far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and center-right [[Jacques Chirac]], citing a lack of acceptable choices.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXmrAAAAQBAJ&q=derrida%20and%20the%202002%20presidential%20election&pg=PT437|title=Derrida: A Biography|last=Peeters|first=Benoit|date=2013-08-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780745663029|language=en}}</ref>
* While supportive of the American government in the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the terrorist attacks of 9/11]], he opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (see ''Rogues'' and his contribution to ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror'' with [[Giovanna Borradori]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]]).

Beyond these explicit political interventions, however, Derrida was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself, within and beyond philosophy. Derrida insisted that a distinct political undertone had pervaded his texts from the very beginning of his career. Nevertheless, the attempt to understand the political implications of notions of responsibility, [[reason of state]], the other, decision, [[sovereignty]], Europe, friendship, difference, faith, and so on, became much more marked from the early 1990s on. By 2000, theorizing "democracy to come," and thinking the limitations of existing democracies, had become important concerns.

==Influences on Derrida==
Crucial readings in his adolescence were [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' and ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', [[André Gide]]'s journal, ''[[La porte étroite]]'', ''[[Les nourritures terrestres]]'' and ''[[The Immoralist]]'';<ref name="TeenBooks"/> and the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref name="TeenBooks">Derrida (1989) ''This Strange Institution Called Literature'', pp. 35, 38–9</ref> The phrase ''Families, I hate you!'' in particular, which inspired Derrida as an adolescent, is a famous verse from Gide's ''Les nourritures terrestres'', book IV.<ref>Gide's ''Les nourritures terrestres'', book IV: «Familles, je vous hais! Foyers clos; portes refermées; possessions jalouses du bonheur.»</ref> In a 1991 interview Derrida commented on a similar verse, also from book IV of the same Gide work: "I hated the homes, the families, all the places where man thinks he'll find rest" (''Je haïssais les foyers, les familles, tous lieux où l'homme pense trouver un repos'').<ref>1991 Interview with [[Francois Ewald]] ''Wahn muß übers Denken wachen'' published in: Werner Kolk (Translator). Literataz. 1992, p. 1-2. (German), as quoted in http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3891m6db#page-1</ref>

Other influences upon Derrida are [[Martin Heidegger]],<ref name="67RonseP8"/><ref name="LetterJap"/> [[Plato]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[J.

His book, ''Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas'', reveals his mentorship by this philosopher and Talmudic scholar who practiced the phenomenological encounter with the Other in the form of the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|Face]], which commanded human response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Hugh|date=Spring 2007|title=Tracing Responsibility: Levinas between Merleau-Ponty and Derrida|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49244472|journal=Journal of French Philosophy|volume=17|pages=88–89|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> The use of deconstruction to read Jewish texts –&nbsp;like [[the Talmud]] – is relatively rare but has recently been attempted.<ref>Dal Bo (2019)</ref>

==Peers and contemporaries==
Derrida's philosophical friends, allies, students  and the heirs of Derrida's thought include [[Paul de Man]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Sarah Kofman]], [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Alexander García Düttmann]], Joseph Cohen, [[Geoffrey Bennington]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], Raphael Zagury-Orly, [[Jacques Ehrmann]], [[Avital Ronell]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], [[Samuel Weber]] and [[Catherine Malabou]].

===Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe===
[[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]] were among Derrida's first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right. Despite their considerable differences of subject, and often also of a method, they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida, from the early 1970s.

Derrida wrote on both of them, including a long book on Nancy: ''Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy'' (''On Touching—Jean-Luc Nancy'', 2005).

===Paul de Man===
{{Main|Paul de Man}}

Derrida's most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man, which began with their meeting at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and continued until de Man's death in 1983. De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction, and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers.

Shortly after de Man's death, Derrida wrote the book ''Memoires: pour Paul de Man'' and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' called "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War". The memoir became cause for controversy, because shortly before Derrida published his piece, it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US, de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the [[History of Belgium#World War II|German occupation of Belgium]], including several that were explicitly [[antisemitic]].

Critics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Man's writing. Some critics have found Derrida's treatment of this issue surprising, given that, for example, Derrida also spoke out against antisemitism and, in the 1960s, broke with the Heidegger disciple [[Jean Beaufret]] over Beaufret's instances of antisemitism, about which Derrida (and, after him, [[Maurice Blanchot]]) expressed shock.

===Michel Foucault===
Derrida's criticism of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] appears in the essay ''Cogito and the History of Madness'' (from ''Writing and Difference''). It was first given as a lecture on March 4, 1963, at a conference at [[Jean Wahl|Wahl]]'s ''[[Collège philosophique]]'', which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two men that was never fully mended.<ref name="Powell06p34-5">Powell (2006) pp. 34–5</ref>

In an appendix added to the 1972 edition of his ''History of Madness'', Foucault disputed Derrida's interpretation of his work, and accused Derrida of practicing "a historically well-determined little pedagogy [...] which teaches the student that there is nothing outside the text [...]. A pedagogy which inversely gives to the voice of the masters that infinite sovereignty that allows it indefinitely to re-say the text."<ref>Foucault, Michel, ''History of Madness'', ed. Jean Khalfa, trans. Jonathan Murphy and Jean Khalfa (London: Routledge, 2006), p. xxiv,573.</ref> According to historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]], Foucault may have written ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' partly under the stimulus of Derrida's criticism.<ref name="GinzburgNihilism">Carlo Ginzburg [1976], ''Il formaggio e i vermi'', translated in 1980 as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IUREWq_o3MC The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller]'', trans. Anne Tedeschi (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), xviii. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4387-7}}</ref> Carlo Ginzburg briefly labeled Derrida's criticism in ''Cogito and the History of Madness'', as "facile, nihilistic objections," without giving further argumentation.<ref name="GinzburgNihilism"/>

===Derrida's translators===
[[Geoffrey Bennington]], [[Avital Ronell]] and [[Samuel Weber]] belong to a group of Derrida translators. Many of Derrida's translators are esteemed thinkers in their own right. Derrida often worked in a collaborative arrangement, allowing his prolific output to be translated into English in a timely fashion.

Having started as a student of de Man, [[Gayatri Spivak]] took on the translation of ''Of Grammatology'' early in her career and has since revised it into a second edition. [[Barbara Johnson]]'s translation of Derrida's ''Dissemination'' was published by The Athlone Press in 1981. Alan Bass was responsible for several early translations; Bennington and [[Peggy Kamuf]] have continued to produce translations of his work for nearly twenty years. In recent years, a number of translations have appeared by Michael Naas (also a Derrida scholar) and Pascale-Anne Brault.

Bennington, Brault, Kamuf, Naas, Elizabeth Rottenberg, and [[David Wills (writer)|David Wills]] are currently engaged in translating Derrida's previously unpublished seminars, which span from 1959 to 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://derridaseminars.org/team.html |title=Derrida Seminar Translation Project |publisher=Derridaseminars.org |access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref>  Volumes I and II of ''The Beast and the Sovereign'' (presenting Derrida's seminars from December 12, 2001 to March 27, 2002 and from December 11, 2002 to March 26, 2003), as well as ''The Death Penalty, Volume I'' (covering December 8, 1999 to March 22, 2000), have appeared in English translation.  Further volumes currently projected for the series include ''Heidegger: The Question of Being and History'' (1964-1965), ''Death Penalty, Volume II'' (2000–2001), ''Perjury and Pardon, Volume I'' (1997–1998), and ''Perjury and Pardon, Volume II'' (1998–1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://derridaseminars.org/volumes.html |title=Derrida Seminar Translation Project |publisher=Derridaseminars.org |access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref>

With Bennington, Derrida undertook the challenge published as ''Jacques Derrida'', an arrangement in which Bennington attempted to provide a systematic explication of Derrida's work (called the "Derridabase") using the top two-thirds of every page, while Derrida was given the finished copy of every Bennington chapter and the bottom third of every page in which to show how deconstruction exceeded Bennington's account (this was called the "Circumfession"). Derrida seems to have viewed Bennington in particular as a kind of rabbinical explicator, noting at the end of the "Applied Derrida" conference, held at the University of Luton in 1995 that: "everything has been said and, as usual, Geoff Bennington has said everything before I have even opened my mouth. I have the challenge of trying to be unpredictable after him, which is impossible... so I'll try to pretend to be unpredictable after Geoff. Once again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/Derrida/applied.html |title=Lovely Luton |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu |access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref>

===Marshall McLuhan===
Derrida was familiar with the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], and since his early 1967 writings (''Of Grammatology'', ''Speech and Phenomena''), he speaks of language as a "medium,"<ref>''Speech and Phenomena'', Introduction</ref> of phonetic writing as "the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, technical, and economic adventure of the West."<ref>''Of Grammatology'', Part I.1</ref>

He expressed his disagreement with McLuhan in regard to what Derrida called McLuhan's ideology about the end of writing.<ref name="Poster2010">Poster (2010), pp. 3–4, 12–13</ref> In a 1982 interview, he said:

{{quote|I think that there is an ideology in McLuhan's discourse that I don't agree with because he's an optimist as to the possibility of restoring an oral community which would get rid of the writing machines and so on. I think that's a very traditional myth which goes back to... let's say Plato, Rousseau... And instead of thinking that we are living at the end of writing, I think that in another sense we are living in the extension – the overwhelming extension – of writing. At least in the new sense... I don't mean the alphabetic writing down, but in the new sense of those writing machines that we're using now (e.g. the tape recorder). And this is writing too.<ref name="Brennan82">Derrida [1982] [http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/PhilTexts/Derrida/Excuse.htm ''Excuse me, but I never said exactly so: Yet Another Derridean Interview''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413130756/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/PhilTexts/Derrida/Excuse.htm |date=April 13, 2016 }}, with Paul Brennan, ''On the Beach'' (Glebe NSW, Australia). No.1/1983: p. 42</ref>}}

And in his 1972 essay ''Signature Event Context'' he said:

{{quote|As writing, communication, if one insists upon maintaining the word, is not the means of transport of sense, the exchange of intentions and meanings, the discourse and "communication of consciousnesses." We are not witnessing an end of writing which, to follow McLuhan's ideological representation, would restore a transparency or immediacy of social relations; but indeed a more and more powerful historical unfolding of a general writing of which the system of speech, consciousness, meaning, presence, truth, etc., would only be an effect, to be analyzed as such. It is this questioned effect that I have elsewhere called ''logocentrism''.<ref>Derrida 1972 ''Signature Event Context''</ref>}}

===Architectural thinkers===
Derrida had a direct impact on the theories and practices of influential architects [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Bernard Tschumi]] towards the end of the twentieth century. Derrida impacted a project that was theorized by Eisenman in ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman''.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Chora-Works-Jacques-Derrida-Eisenman/dp/1885254407 ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman'']</ref> This design was architecturally conceived by Tschumi for the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, which included a sieve, or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the ''[[khôra]]''. Moreover, Derrida's commentaries on Plato's notion of ''khôra'' (χώρα) as set in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (48e4) received later reflections in the philosophical works and architectural writings of the philosopher-architect [[Nader El-Bizri]] within the domain of [[phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]].

Derrida used "χώρα" to name a radical otherness that "gives place" for being. El-Bizri built on this by more narrowly taking ''khôra'' to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings.<ref>([[Nader El-Bizri]], 2004, 2011)</ref>  El-Bizri's reflections on "''khôra''" are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on ''dwelling'' and on ''being and space'' in [[Heidegger]]'s thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in [[architectural theory]] (and its strands in phenomenological thinking),<ref>(Nader El-Bizri, 2018)</ref> and in history of philosophy and science, with a focus on geometry and optics.<ref>(Nader El-Bizri, 2001, 2004, 2011, 2015)</ref> This also describes El-Bizri's take on "econtology" as an extension of Heidegger's consideration of the question of being (''Seinsfrage'') by way of the fourfold (''Das Geviert'') of earth-sky-mortals-divinities (''Erde und Himmel, Sterblichen und Göttlichen''); and as also impacted by his own meditations on Derrida's take on "χώρα".  Ecology is hence co-entangled with ontology, whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness, and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinking<ref>Nader El-Bizri, "Being at Home Among Things: [[Heidegger]]'s Reflections on Dwelling", ''Environment, Space, Place'' Vol. 3 (2011), pp.&nbsp;47–71; Nader El-Bizri, "On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural [[Phenomenology (architecture)|Phenomenology]]", ''Studia UBB. Philosophia'', Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5–30; Nader El-Bizri, "Phenomenology of Place and Space in our Epoch: Thinking along Heideggerian Pathways", in ''The Phenomenology of Real and Virtual Places'', ed. E. Champion (London : Routledge, 2018), pp.&nbsp;123–143.</ref>
Derrida argued that the [[subjectile]] is like Plato's ''khôra'', Greek for space, receptacle or site. Plato proposes that ''khôra'' rests between the sensible and the intelligible, through which everything passes but in which nothing is retained. For example, an image needs to be held by something, just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida, ''khôra'' defies attempts at naming or the either/or logic,  which he "deconstructed".

===Criticism from analytic philosophers===
Though Derrida addressed the [[American Philosophical Association]] on at least one occasion in 1988,<ref>{{Cite journal|first = Newton|last = Garver|year = 1991|title = Derrida's language-games|volume = 10|pages = 187–98|doi = 10.1007/BF00141339|issue = 2|journal = Topoi|s2cid = 143791006}}</ref> and was highly regarded by some contemporary philosophers like [[Richard Rorty]], [[Alexander Nehamas]],<ref>"Truth and Consequences: How to Understand Jacques Derrida," The New Republic 197:14 (October 5, 1987).</ref> and [[Stanley Cavell]], his work has been regarded by other analytic philosophers, such as [[John Searle]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]],<ref name="DUlisse">J.E.

Some [[analytic philosopher]]s have in fact claimed, since at least the 1980s, that Derrida's work is "not philosophy." One of the main arguments they gave was alleging that Derrida's influence had not been on US philosophy departments but on literature and other [[humanities]] disciplines.<ref name="Lamont87" /><ref name="Hansson"/>

In his 1989 ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'', [[Richard Rorty]] argues that Derrida (especially in his book, ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]'', one section of which is an experiment in fiction) purposefully uses words that cannot be defined (e.g., ''[[différance]]''), and uses previously definable words in contexts diverse enough to make understanding impossible, so that the reader will never be able to contextualize Derrida's literary self. Rorty, however, argues that this intentional obfuscation is philosophically grounded. In garbling his message Derrida is attempting to escape the naïve, positive metaphysical projects of his predecessors.<ref name= a>Rorty, Richard. ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''.

[[Roger Scruton]] wrote in 2004, "He's difficult to summarise because it's nonsense. He argues that the meaning of a sign is never revealed in the sign but deferred indefinitely and that a sign only means something by virtue of its difference from something else. For Derrida, there is no such thing as meaning – it always eludes us and therefore anything goes."<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/12/philosophy|title=Deconstructing Jacques|date=12 October 2004|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

On Derrida's scholarship and writing style, [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote "I found the scholarship appalling, based on pathetic misreading; and the argument, such as it was, failed to come close to the kinds of standards I've been familiar with since virtually childhood. Well, maybe I missed something: could be, but suspicions remain, as noted."<ref>{{cite web | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | title = Postmodernism? | website = ZCommunications | url = http://zcomm.org/znetarticle/postmodernism-by-noam-chomsky/ | access-date = 27 September 2014 | date=August 2012 }}</ref>

[[Paul R.

Three quarrels (or disputes) in particular went out of academic circles and received international mass media coverage: the 1972–88 quarrel with John Searle, the analytic philosophers' pressures on Cambridge University not to award Derrida an honorary degree, and a dispute with Richard Wolin and the NYRB.

====Searle–Derrida debate<!--linked from 'John Searle'-->====
{{main|Searle–Derrida debate}}
{{see also|Limited Inc}}
In the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points.<ref name=limitedinc>Derrida, Jacques. ''Limited, Inc.'' Northwestern University Press, 1988. p. 29: "...I have read some of his [Searle's] work (more, in any case, than he seems to have read of mine)"</ref>{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}<!--Footnote provided only sources half the claim.--> Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's [[deconstruction]]ist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection ''[[Limited Inc]]''. Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by dedicating any attention to it. Consequently, some critics<ref>Maclean, Ian. 2004. "''un dialogue de sourds?'' Some implications of the Austin–Searle–Derrida debate", in ''Jacques Derrida: critical thought''. Ian Maclachlan (ed.) Ashgate Publishing, 2004</ref> have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others<ref name="Alfino">{{Cite journal | jstor=40237667| title=Another Look at the Derrida-Searle Debate| journal=Philosophy & Rhetoric| volume=24| issue=2| pages=143–152| last1=Alfino| first1=Mark| year=1991}}</ref> have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that "It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was "the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe".<ref>[[Simon Glendinning]]. 2001. ''Arguing with Derrida''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 18</ref> Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between [[Analytical philosophy|analytical]] and [[continental philosophy]].

The debate began in 1972, when, in his paper  "Signature Event Context", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the [[illocutionary act]]. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes "force", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a "structure of absence" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by "iterability" (the constraints on what can be said, given by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on [[intentionality]] in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or "parasitic" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, "Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry.<ref>Gregor Campbell. 1993. "John R. Searle" in Irene Rima Makaryk (ed). Encyclopedia of contemporary literary theory: approaches, scholars, terms. University of Toronto Press, 1993</ref><ref>John Searle, "Reiterating the Différences: A Reply to Derrida", Glyph 2 (Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977).</ref> Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus.<ref name="Alfino" /> (This caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with [[wikt:phenomenological|phenomenological]] perspectives on intentionality.<ref name="Hobson">Marian Hobson. 1998. Jacques Derrida: opening lines. Psychology Press. pp. 95-97</ref>) Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austin's [[type–token distinction]] and his failure to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to [[performativity]]. Some critics<ref name="Hobson"/> have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.

The substance of Searle's criticism of Derrida in relation to topics in the [[philosophy of language]]—referenced in Derrida's ''Signature Event Context''—was that Derrida had no apparent familiarity with contemporary philosophy of language nor of contemporary linguistics in Anglo-Saxon countries.  Searle explains, "When Derrida writes about the philosophy of language he refers typically to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], not to mention [[Plato]]. And his idea of a "modern linguist" is [[Émile Benveniste|Benveniste]] or even [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]."<ref name="Searle 1994">{{cite journal | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = Literary Theory and Its Discontents | journal = Journal of Humanistic Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 637–67 | year = 1994 | jstor = 469470 | doi=10.2307/469470}}</ref>  Searle describes Derrida's philosophical knowledge as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|pre-Wittgensteinian]]—that is to say, disconnected from analytic tradition—and consequently, in his perspective, naive and misguided, concerned with issues long-since resolved or otherwise found to be ''non''-issues.<ref name="Searle 1994"/>

Searle also wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that he was surprised by "the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Searle | first = John R. | title = The Word Turned Upside Down | journal = The New York Review of Books | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/the-word-turned-upside-down/ | date = 27 October 1983 | access-date = 21 August 2013 | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20121013010523/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/the-word-turned-upside-down/ | archive-date=October 13, 2012}}</ref>

Derrida, in his response to Searle ({{nowrap|"a b c ..."}} in ''Limited Inc''), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, he suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a ''société à responsabilité limitée'' (a "[[limited liability company]]") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to "normality" in the analytical tradition to be problematic from which they were only paradigmatic examples.<ref name="Alfino" /><ref name="Afterwordsp133"/><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1988.tb00701.x|title = Iterability and Meaning: The Searle-Derrida Debate| journal=Metaphilosophy| volume=19| pages=53–64|year = 1988|last1 = Farrell|first1 = Frank B.}}</ref>

{{quote|In the description of the structure called "normal," "normative," "central," "ideal," this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic. It cannot be, and hence ought not to be, and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty. In the analysis of so-called normal cases, one neither can nor ought, in all theoretical rigor, to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally, or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method, since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensable about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general.}}

He continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between "nonfiction or standard discourse" and "fiction," defined as its "parasite", "for part of the most original essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place-and in so doing to 'de-essentialize' itself as it were".<ref name="Afterwordsp133">Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.'' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p. 133</ref> 
He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:<ref name="Afterwordsp133" />
{{quote|what is "nonfiction standard discourse," what must it be and what does this name evoke, once its fictionality or its fictionalization, its transgressive "parasitism," is always possible (and moreover by virtue of the very same words, the same phrases, the same grammar, etc.)?  This question is all the more indispensable since the rules, and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of "nonfiction standard discourse" and its fictional "parasites," are not things found in nature, but laws, symbolic inventions, or conventions, institutions that, in their very normality as well as in their normativity, entail something of the fictional.}}

In the debate, Derrida praises Austin's work but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls "infelicities" from the "normal" operation of language. One "infelicity," for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is "sincere" or "merely citational" (and therefore possibly ironic, etc.). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily "citational," due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible "intention". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nakassis|first=Constantine V.|date=March 2013|title=Citation and Citationality|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/670165|journal=Signs and Society|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=51–77|doi=10.1086/670165|s2cid=145462436|issn=2326-4489}}</ref> All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.

In 1994, Searle argued that the ideas upon which deconstruction is founded are essentially a consequence of a series of conceptual confusions made by Derrida as a result of his outdated knowledge or are merely banalities.  He insisted that Derrida's conception of ''iterability'' and its alleged corrupting effect on meaning stems from Derrida's ignorance of the [[type–token distinction]] that exists in current [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]].  As Searle explains, "Most importantly, from the fact that different tokens of a sentence type can be uttered on different occasions with different intentions, that is, different speaker meanings, nothing of any significance follows about the original speaker meaning of the original utterance token."<ref name="Searle 1994"/>

In 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in ''The Construction of Social Reality''. He called Derrida's conclusion "preposterous" and stated that "Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..."<ref>Searle ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (1995) pp. 157–160.</ref> Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase "''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''" ("there is no outside-text"), which appears in Derrida's ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.<ref>Tr. by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]. Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore, 1976, 158–59</ref>

According to Searle, the consistent pattern of Derrida's rhetoric is: 
<br />(a) announce a preposterous thesis, e.g. "there is no outside-text" (''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''); 
<br />(b) when challenged on ''(a)'' respond that you have been misunderstood and revise the claim in ''(a)'' such that it becomes a truism, e.g. "'{{lang|fr|il n'y a pas de hors-texte}}{{'}} means nothing else: there is nothing outside contexts";<ref name="Derrida LI">{{cite book| last1 =  Derrida| first1 = Jacques| title = Limited Inc.| edition = 1st| year = 1988| publisher = Northwestern University Press| location = Illinois| isbn = 978-0810107885| chapter = Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion| page = 136| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC| quote = The phrase which for some has become a sort of slogan, in general so badly understood, of deconstruction ("there is no outside-text" [il n'y a pas de hors-texte]), means nothing else: there is nothing outside context. In this form, which says exactly the same thing, the formula would doubtless have been less shocking. I am not certain that it would have provided more to think about.}}</ref> 
<br />(c) when the reformulation from ''(b)'' is acknowledged then proceed as if the ''original'' formulation from ''(a)'' was accepted.  The revised idea—for example that ''everything exists in some context''—is a banality but a charade ensues as if the original claim—''nothing exists outside of text'' [''sic'']—had been established.

====Cambridge honorary doctorate====
In 1992 some academics at [[Cambridge University]], mostly not from the philosophy faculty, proposed that Derrida be awarded an honorary doctorate. This was opposed by, among others, the university's Professor of Philosophy [[David Hugh Mellor|Hugh Mellor]]. Eighteen other philosophers from US, Austrian, Australian, French, Polish, Italian, German, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, and British institutions, including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], and [[René Thom]], then sent a letter to Cambridge claiming that Derrida's work "does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour"<!-- original spelling --> and describing Derrida's philosophy as being composed of "tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the [[Dada]]ists". The letter concluded that:

{{quote|... where coherent assertions are being made at all, these are either false or trivial.

Derrida suggested in an interview that part of the reason for the attacks on his work was that it questioned and modified "the rules of the dominant discourse, it tries to politicize and democratize education and the university scene".  To answer a question about the "exceptional violence", the compulsive "ferocity", and the "exaggeration" of the "attacks", he would say that these critics organize and practice in his case "a sort of obsessive personality cult which philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate".<ref name="Derrida 1995pp409-413">{{cite book| last1 = Derrida| first1 = Jacques| title = Points . .: Interviews, 1974-1994| edition = 1st| year = 1995| publisher = Stanford University Press| location =  New York| isbn = 978-0810103979 | chapter = "Honoris Causa: 'This is also very funny'"| pages = 409–413 | chapter-url = http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/derrida/interviews.html#cambridge| quote = If it were only a question of "my" work, of the particular or isolated research of one individual, this wouldn't happen.

====Dispute with Richard Wolin and the ''NYRB''====
[[Richard Wolin]] has argued since 1991 that Derrida's work, as well as that of Derrida's major inspirations (e.g., Bataille, Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Nietzsche), leads to a corrosive [[nihilism]]. For example, Wolin argues that the "deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism".<ref name="Wolin93Preface">Richard Wolin, Preface to the MIT press edition: Note on a missing text. In R. Wolin (ed.) ''The Heidegger Controversy: A Critical Reader''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 1993, p. xiii. {{ISBN|0-262-73101-0}}</ref>

In 1991, when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of ''The Heidegger Controversy'', Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation, which was "demonstrably execrable" and "weak, simplistic, and compulsively aggressive". As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given, Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints. Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions. Later editions of ''The Heidegger Controversy'' by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview. The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolin's book by the Heideggerian scholar [[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] that appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', in which Sheehan characterised Derrida's protests as an imposition of censorship. It was followed by an exchange of letters.<ref name="NYRBLetters">[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2658 NYBooks.com: 2658] and  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2591 NYBooks.com: 2591]</ref> Derrida in turn responded to Sheehan and Wolin, in "The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)", which was published in the book ''[[Points...]]''.<ref name="DerridaOnNYRB">Derrida, "The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)", published in the book ''[[Points...]]'' (1995; see the footnote about {{ISBN|0-226-14314-7}}, [[Jacques Derrida bibliography|here]]) (see also the [1992] French version ''[[Points de suspension: entretiens]]'' ({{ISBN|0-8047-2488-1}}) [[Jacques Derrida bibliography|there]]).</ref>

Twenty-four academics, belonging to different schools and groups – often in disagreement with each other and with deconstruction – signed a letter addressed to ''The New York Review of Books'', in which they expressed their indignation for the magazine's behaviour as well as that of Sheenan and Wolin.<ref name="PointsP434">''Points'', p. 434</ref>
