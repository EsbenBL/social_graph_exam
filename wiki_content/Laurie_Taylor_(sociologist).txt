'''Laurence John Taylor''' (born 1 August 1936) is an English [[sociology|sociologist]] and radio presenter, originally from [[Liverpool]].

==Biography==
After attending [[Roman Catholic]] schools including [[St Mary's College, Crosby]], [[Merseyside]], then a direct grant grammar and now an independent school, Taylor trained as an actor at [[Rose Bruford College]], [[Sidcup]], associated with [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]] in [[Stratford, London]]. He was also a teacher at the Forest Hill comprehensive school for boys.

After earning degrees in sociology and psychology, as a mature student, at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] and the [[University of Leicester]], he joined the department of sociology at the [[University of York]], becoming a professor at that institution. He is retired from York.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.york.ac.uk/media/sociology/conferences/past-events-45-years/List%20of%20Delegates.pdf|title=Listed as former Head of Dept of Sociology at York}}</ref>

Taylor is sometimes thought to be the model for Howard Kirk in [[Malcolm Bradbury]]'s novel ''[[The History Man]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1044800.stm|work=BBC News|title=The 'History Man' on Sir Malcolm Bradbury|date=28 November 2000|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> although Bradbury and Taylor had not met at the time the book was written. Taylor was then a member of the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)#International Socialists (1962-1977)|International Socialists]].<ref>Laurie Taylor [http://newhumanist.org.uk/1786/motley-crew "Motley crew"], ''New Humanist'', 7 May 2008</ref>

Taylor is divorced from his third wife (whom he married in December 1988 in Camden), radio producer Cathie Mahoney who works on ''[[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]]'' on BBC Radio 4. He was previously married to journalist Anna Coote, a former deputy editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', who has also been associated with various public organisations. He is now married to Sally Feldman, journalist and former editor of Radio Four's ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' and currently a [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Humanist officiant|celebrant]].

Taylor's son, [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Matthew]], is Chief Executive of the [[NHS Confederation]].

==Career==
Taylor has a particular interest in [[criminology]]. He was one of the founder members of the [[National Deviancy Conference]].<ref>van Swaaningen, R. (1997) ''Critical Criminology: Visions from Europe'', London: SAGE pg.78</ref> As a popular author writing on the media and fame, he has published widely in criminology. Perhaps his best-known early work was the book co-written with [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]: ''Escape Attempts: The Theory and Practice of Resistance to Everyday Life''. The book arose from research into the wellbeing of long-term prisoners. He has collaborated with bank robber turned author, [[John McVicar]], on research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-laurie-taylor-and-john-mcvicar-1462755.html|title = How We Met: Laurie Taylor and John McVicar|date = 23 October 2011}}</ref>

Taylor has had an extensive broadcasting career on [[BBC Radio 4]]. For many years he was a regular participant on [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]]'s fiercely competitive conversation programme ''[[Stop The Week]]'', later presented ''The Radio Programme'' and took on ''[[The Afternoon Shift]]'', a re-branding of the ill-fated ''[[Anderson Country]]''. His media associates have included [[Tom Baker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462127/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Baker, Tom (1936-) Biography|website=Screenonline.org.uk|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref> and [[Victor Lewis-Smith]].  In 1991 he appeared in the documentary ''Flesh and Blood: The Story of the Krays''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5782122/|title = Flesh and Blood: The story of the Krays}}</ref>

Since 1998, Taylor has regularly presented the discussion programme ''[[Thinking Allowed]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]], a series mainly devoted to the social sciences. In addition, he is known for his long-running  and mainly humorous column in the ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]''<ref name=thesbio>{{cite web|title=THES: Laurie Taylor|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/search/laurie%20taylor|work=Times Higher Education Supplement|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> as well as writing for the ''[[New Humanist]]'' and being a distinguished supporter of [[Humanists UK]].
