'''Mahbub ul Haq''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|محبوب الحق}}}}; 24 February 1934 – 16 July 1998) was a [[Pakistan]]i [[economist]], [[politician]]  and [[international development]] theorist who served as [[Finance Minister of Pakistan]] from 10 April 1985 until 28 January 1986, and again from June to December 1988.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Mahbub ul Haq|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/obituary/1998/07/23/mahbub-ul-haq|access-date=2020-05-16|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

After graduating in economics from [[Government College Lahore]], he won a scholarship to [[Cambridge University]] obtaining a second degree. Subsequently, he received his [[PhDs|PhD]] from [[Yale University]] and conducted [[postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral research]] at the [[Harvard Kennedy School]]. He returned to Pakistan to serve as the [[Chief Economist]] of the [[Planning Commission (Pakistan)|Planning Commission]] throughout the 1960s. In 1970 after the fall of Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] he moved to Washington, DC to serve at the World Bank Director of Policy Planning until 1982, where he played a major role in reorienting its approach to assisting development in low income countries.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Inaugural Mahbub ul Haq-Amartya Sen Lecture, UNIGE {{!}} Human Development Reports|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/inaugural-mahbub-ul-haq-amartya-sen-lecture-unige|website = hdr.undp.org|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Amartya Sen - Biographical|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|website = www.nobelprize.org|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref>

He returned to Pakistan in 1982 and in 1985 became the country's Finance Minister, overseeing a period of [[economic liberalisation]]. In 1989 he moved back to U.S. where he served as the Special Adviser to the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]] Administrator [[William Henry Draper III|William Henry Draper]]. At the UNDP, Haq led the establishment of the [[Human Development Report]] and the widely respected [[Human Development Index|HDI]], which measures development by well-being, rather than by income alone. He returned to Pakistan in 1996 to establish the Human Development Center in Islamabad.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Honouring Mahbubul Haq - The Express Tribune|url = http://tribune.com.pk/story/1051667/honouring-mahbubul-haq/|website = The Express Tribune|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}</ref>

Haq is considered to have had a profound effect on [[Global Development|global development]]. Haq's 1995 book ''Reflections on Human Development'' is said to have opened new avenues to policy proposals for [[Human Development Index|human development paradigms]], such as the [[United Nations Global Compact|2000 Global Compact]].<ref name="haq1">Mahbub ul Haq (1996) Reflections on Human Development.

== Early life and education ==
Mahbub ul Haq was born in [[Gurdaspur]]<ref>Baru, Sanjaya (1988) Mahbub ul Haq and Human Development: A Tribute, ''Economic and Political Weekly'', Vol. 33, No. 35 (Aug. 29 - Sep. 4), pp. 2275-2279 (5 pages)</ref> in pre-[[Partition of India|independence]] [[British Punjab|Punjab province]], now in the Republic of India, on 24 February 1934.<ref name="The Independent">{{cite web|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Obituary: Mahbub ul Haq|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-mahbub-ul-haq-1169323.html|work=Amartya Sen, Tam Dalyell|publisher=The Independent|access-date=10 August 2012 |author2=Tam Dalyell|date=3 August 1998}}</ref> He belonged to an "[[Urdu-speaking people|Urdu-speaking family]]." His teenage years saw religious violence and forced migration associated with the [[Partition of India|independence]] of Pakistan and India in August 1947.<ref name="The Independent"/> He and his family narrowly escaped from being killed in one of the refugee trains heading to Pakistan. The nature of the religious violence left a lasting impression on Mahbub ul Haq.<ref name="The Independent"/> After reaching [[Lahore]], Haq was given government-sponsored housing and decided to continue his education.

In 1953 Haq graduated with a degree in economics from [[Government College Lahore]].<ref name="The Independent"/> He earned a scholarship to attend [[Cambridge University]] where he earned another BA in the same discipline.<ref name="The Independent"/> At Cambridge, Haq gained his BA alongside [[Amartya Sen]], with whom he formed a close, lifelong friendship.<ref name="The Independent"/> After renewing his scholarship, Haq went to United States for his doctoral studies at [[Yale University]] and earned a PhD in Economics. Later, Haq carried out post-doctoral work at [[Harvard University]] in 1960–61.<ref name="The Independent"/>

==Career==

{{Rquote|right|an early proponent of economic liberalization who in later years argued that poor countries failed to prosper because they neglected the basic development of their people |[[New York Times]]|<ref name=NYT>BARBARA CROSSETTE. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/world/mahbub-ul-haq-64-analyst-and-critic-of-global-poverty.html Mahbub ul Haq, 64, Analyst And Critic of Global Poverty]". ''The New York Times''. July 17, 1998.</ref> }}
Upon returning to Pakistan in 1957 at the age of 23, Haq joined the [[Planning Commission (Pakistan)|Planning Commission]] as Assistant Chief while it prepared its first [[Five-Year Plans of Pakistan|Five-Year Plan]].<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite web|last=Crossette|first=Barbara|title=Mahbub ul Haq, 64, Analyst And Critic of Global Poverty|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/world/mahbub-ul-haq-64-analyst-and-critic-of-global-poverty.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=10 August 2012|page=2|date=17 July 1998}}</ref>
Influenced by the dominant economic thought in American academia, Haq advocated capitalism as the economic base of the national economy and helped guide the government to apply free-market principles to boost the economy. This approach was wholeheartedly embraced by the military government of General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] after it came to power in October 1958. By the 1960s as Chief Economist of the Planning Commission Haq was delivering speeches all over the country in support these economic policies.

While the international community was applauding Pakistan as a model of development, Haq developed concerns that all was not well with the distribution of the benefits of growth. Rapid economic development made Haq's team doubt the long-term viability of such a pattern of growth, and he increasingly supported heavier taxation of the asset owning classes. In a widely reported speech to the [[Applied Economics Research Centre]] at the [[University of Karachi]] in April 1968, Haq alleged that "22 industrial family groups had come to dominate the economic and financial life-cycle of Pakistan and that they controlled about two-thirds of industrial assets, 80% of banking and 79% of insurance assets in the industrial domain."<ref name="Human Development Center">{{cite web|title=System is to blame for the 22 wealthy families |url=http://www.mhhdc.org/html/system_blame.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722001847/http://www.mhhdc.org/html/system_blame.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 July 2013 |work=Human Development Center, Originally published on London Times |publisher=Human Development Center |access-date=6 September 2012 |page=1 |date=22 March 1973 }}</ref> The list included Dawood family of [[Dawood Group]], Saigols of [[Saigol Group]], Adamjees of [[Adamjee Group]], Colony, Fancy, Valika, Jalil, Bawany, Crescent, Wazir Ali, Gandhara, Ispahani, [[House of Habib]], Khyber, Nishat Group, Beco, [[Gul Ahmed Group]], Arag, Hafiz, Karim, Milwala and Dada.<ref>[http://m.paycheck.pk/main/salary/celebrity-income/richest-families-in-pakistan/the-22-families/ The 22 Families]</ref><ref name="Human Development Center"/>

These revelations played a major role in mobilising millions in a [[1968 movement in Pakistan|massive grassroots protest movement]] that led to Field Marshal Ayub Khan's overthrow in March 1969. Following Ayub's fall, Haq accepted an invitation from [[Robert McNamara]], president of the [[World Bank]] to serve as his Director of Policy Planning. During his tenure (1970–82), Haq influenced the Bank's [[Human development (humanity)|development]] [[philosophy]] and [[lending]] policies, steering more attention towards [[poverty alleviation]] programmes and increased allocations for small farm production, [[nutrition]], [[education]], [[water supply]] and other [[social sector]]s. He wrote a study<ref name="haq2">Mahbub ul Haq (1976) The Poverty Curtain: Choices for the Third World. [[Columbia University Press]]. 247 pages. {{ISBN|0-231-04062-8}}</ref> that served as a precursor to the [[basic needs]] and [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] approaches of the 1980s.

While working at the World Bank, Haq was invited by Prime Minister [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] to join the Ministry of Finance, but ultimately refused as he had strong opposing views on Bhutto's [[Nationalization in Pakistan|program of nationalization]].<ref name="Oxford University Press, 2008">{{cite book|last1=Ponzio|first1=Richard|title=Pioneering the human development revolution: an intellectual biography of Mahbub Ul Haq|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2008|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9780195695137|pages=256–260|author2=Khadija Haq |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S83rAAAAMAAJ |access-date=26 February 2014}}</ref> In 1973 Bhutto again asked Mahbub to return to Pakistan and join his administration in devising a strategy that would lift a large number of Pakistanis out of poverty and [[stagflation]], but their major differences persuaded Haq not to return.<ref name="Oxford University Press, 2008"/>

In 1982 Haq returned at the request of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]]'s military government, where he assumed directorship of the Planning Commission. In 1983 Haq was appointed Minister of Planning and Development. According to Parvez Hasan 'under Mahbub's direction, the Planning Commission became once again a lively place and began to exert powerful influence on social sector issues, including education and [[family planning]], much neglected in earlier Zia years.

In 1985 President Zia oversaw a partial return to democracy with so-called [[1985 Pakistani general election|'non-party' general elections]], and Haq was sworn in as [[Minister of Finance (Pakistan)|Minister Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs]] in the [[Pakistan Muslim League|PML]] government of [[Mohammed Khan Junejo]]. Haq's is credited with significant [[tax reform]]s, [[deregulation]] of the [[economy]], increased emphasis on human development and several initiatives for poverty alleviation.<ref>[http://www.un.org.pk/hdc/Tribute%20Page.htm A Tribute to Dr Haq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124044503/http://www.un.org.pk/hdc/Tribute%20Page.htm |date=24 January 2008 }} at Human Development Centre website</ref> Despite this major acceleration in [[social spending]] Haq was forced to resign in January 1986 due to protests at his reforms. He was reappointed as Finance Minister in the caretaker administration established by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq after he dismissed the Junejo government in May 1988. Haq's term ended when the PPP government of [[Benazir Bhutto]] was sworn in following the [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections of November 1988]].

In 1989, he was appointed as Special Advisor to the [[UNDP]] Administrator [[William Henry Draper III|William Draper]] in New York City  to produce the first [[Human Development Report]].<ref>UNDP (1990) [http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_1990_en.pdf Human Development Report 1990: Concept and Measurement of Human Development]. Oxford University press. {{ISBN|0-19-506480-1}}</ref> In this capacity, Haq initiated the concept of [[Human development (humanity)|Human Development]] and the [[Human Development Report]] as its Project Director. He  led a team of international scholars including [[Amartya Sen]], [[Paul Streeten]], [[Inge Kaul]], Frances Stewart, and [[Richard Jolly]] to prepare annual Human Development Reports.

In 1996, Haq founded the Human Development Center in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]] — a policy research institute committed to organizing professional [[research]], [[policy studies]] and seminars in the area of human development, with a special focus on [[South Asia]]. In acknowledgement of his contributions, the Human Development Centre, Islamabad was officially renamed following his death as the Mahbub ul Haq Human Development Centre on 13 December 1998, with Mrs. Khadija Haq as president.

==Death==
Haq died on 16 July 1998 in [[New York City]] at the age of 64, leaving behind his wife Khadija Haq, son Farhan and daughter Toneema.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
