He is the IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government and Chair of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), and 2010 Professor of [[Collège de France]]. From 2013–2017, he was President of the [[British Academy]] and was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 2014 <ref>https://www.amacad.org/person/nicholas-h-stern</ref>.

== Career and research ==
=== 1970–2007 ===
He was a lecturer at [[University of Oxford]] from 1970–1977 <ref name=scopus>{{Scopus|7103384515}}</ref><ref name=AtkinsonStern1974>{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=A.

He taught from 1986 to 1993 at the [[London School of Economics]], becoming the Sir [[John Hicks]] Professor of Economics. From 1994 until 1999 he was the Chief Economist and Special Counsellor to the President of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]. His research focused on [[economic development]] and growth, and he also wrote books on [[Kenya]] and the [[Green Revolution in India]]. Since 1999, he has been a member of the International Advisory Council of the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE). From 1999 until 2000 Stern was Chairman of the consultancy London Economics founded by [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]].

He was the [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] and Senior Vice-President of the World Bank from 2000 to 2003. Stern was then recruited by [[Gordon Brown]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], to work for the British government where, in 2003, he became second permanent secretary at [[HM Treasury]], initially with responsibility for public finances, and head of the [[Government Economic Service]]. Having also been Director of Policy and Research for the [[Commission for Africa]], he was, in July 2005, appointed to conduct reviews on the economics of [[climate change]] and also of development, which led to the publication of the [[Stern Review]]. At the time, he ceased to be a second permanent secretary at the Treasury though he retained the rank until retirement in 2007; the review team he headed was based in the [[Cabinet Office]]. It was reported that Stern's time at the Treasury was marked by tensions with his boss, Gordon Brown:<ref>{{cite news

|author=Hurst, G.
|access-date=3 August 2009

<blockquote>... several [[Whitehall]] sources told ''[[The Times]]'' that Mr Brown did not like some of the advice he received from Sir Nicholas, including some "home truths" about long-term trends in the economy and he never broke into the chancellor's tight-knit inner circle. ... He subsequently lacked a real role and spent most of his time working on major international reports on global warming and alleviating poverty in Africa. His doom-laden report on the risks of failing to address [[climate change]], published in October, caused tensions within the Government by triggering a debate on environmental taxes and leading to calls for big policy changes.</blockquote>

=== The Stern Review (2005–2006) ===
The ''[[Stern Review]] Report on the Economics of Climate Change'' was produced by a team led by Stern at HM Treasury, and was released in October 2006. In the review, [[climate change]] is described as an economic [[externality]], which is a type of market failure. Stern has subsequently referred to the climate change externality as the largest ever market failure:

<blockquote>Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen. The evidence on the seriousness of the risks from inaction or delayed action is now overwhelming ... The problem of climate change involves a fundamental failure of markets: those who damage others by emitting greenhouse gases generally do not pay<ref>{{cite news|author=Alison Benjamin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/nov/29/climatechange.carbonemissions |title=Stern: Climate change a 'market failure' |newspaper=Guardian |date= 29 November 2007|access-date=29 October 2013 |location=London}}</ref></blockquote>

Regulation, [[carbon tax]]es and [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]], along with pollution permits and property rights, are recommended to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. It is argued that the world economy can lower its greenhouse gas emissions at a significant but manageable cost. The review concludes that immediate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are necessary to reduce the worst [[Climate risk|risks of climate change]]. The review's conclusions were widely reported in the press. Stern's relatively large cost estimates of 'business-as-usual' climate change damages received particular attention.<ref>{{Cite news

Stern's approach to [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Discount rates|discounting]] has been debated amongst economists. The discount rate allows economic effects occurring at different times to be compared. Stern used a discount rate in his calculation of the effects of "business-as-usual" climate change damages. A high discount rate reduces the calculated benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using too low a discount rate wastes resources because it will result in too much investment in cutting emissions (Arrow ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;130).<ref>{{cite book |date            = 1996b

Another criticism of the Stern Review is that it is a political rather than an analytical document. Writing in the [[Daily Telegraph]] newspaper, columnist [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] compared the Stern Review to the UK Government's "[[dodgy dossier]]" on Iraqi [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref>{{cite news

In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the [[Global Apollo Programme]], which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make [[Renewable energy|carbon-free]] [[Base load power plant|baseload electricity]] less costly than [[Fossil fuel power station|electricity from coal]] by the year 2025.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change|access-date=2 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|issue=2 June 2015|publisher=[[Guardian News Media]]}}</ref>

After the successful [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris (mid-December 2015), Stern appeared optimistic, saying, "If we get this right, it will be more powerful than the [[industrial revolution]].
