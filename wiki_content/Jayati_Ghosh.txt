==Criticisms of the government==
Ghosh has consistently maintained a pro-student stance. In February 2016, she alleged the [[Premiership of Narendra Modi|NDA]] government of shutting down student protests against the capital punishment sentence to [[Afzal Guru]]. In a lecture enumerating the "anti-national policies of the NDA", she spoke about the importance of student protests and discussion, and the current government's aversion to the demand for transparency and accountability. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/Afzal-Guru-row-constructed-conspiracy-by-state-JNU-prof-Jayati-Ghosh/articleshow/51279551.cms|title=Afzal Guru row 'constructed conspiracy' by state: JNU prof Jayati Ghosh|last=Mar 6|first=PTI {{!}} Updated|last2=2016|website=Bangalore Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-03-10|last3=Ist|first3=19:27}}</ref>

In October 2019, Ghosh expressed her belief that the relay of policymakers who were fixed to political dogmas that discouraged more public spending was dangerous to the economy and destabilizing to society. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economists-intellectual-isolation-social-disaster-by-jayati-ghosh-2019-10|title=Our Shrinking Economic Toolkits {{!}} by Jayati Ghosh|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|date=2019-10-10|website=Project Syndicate|language=en|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref>

In her co-authored book, ''Demonetisation Decoded: A critique of India’s monetary experiment,'' she criticizes the monetary decision taken by the Modi government as an ineffective and wasteful exercise. 

In February of 2020, Ghosh criticized the [[Narendra Modi|Modi]]-led government for misrepresenting data in the 2020 Budget which was presented a month earlier than usual. Claiming that the government did not have data post December 2019, she declared [[Nirmala Sitharaman]]'s pre-budget speech as ineffectual and inaccurate. She also emphasized the lack of attention given to the need for creation of employment in the new budget, stating that there were cuts in almost every employment-intensive sector. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/every-single-number-is-a-lie-jayati-ghosh/article30720952.ece|title=Budget 2020 {{!}} Every single number is a lie, says Jayati Ghosh|date=2020-02-02|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-03-10|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> By withholding information that by constitutional law should be freely available to the public, she said, the Modi government was able to play caste politics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/every-single-number-is-a-lie-jayati-ghosh/article30720952.ece|title=Budget 2020 {{!}} Every single number is a lie, says Jayati Ghosh|date=2020-02-02|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-03-10|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>
