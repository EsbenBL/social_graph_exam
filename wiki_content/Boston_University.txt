===Predecessor institutions and University Charter===
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}
Boston University traces its roots to the establishment of the Newbury Biblical Institute in [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury, Vermont]] in 1839,<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Boston University {{!}} university, Boston, Massachusetts, United States|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Boston-University|access-date=April 19, 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> and was chartered with the name "Boston University" by the [[Massachusetts Legislature]] in 1869. The University organized formal Centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969.<ref name="history">[http://www.bu.edu/info/about/ Boston University |Visitor Center | About the University |History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216154448/http://www.bu.edu/info/about/ |date=February 16, 2006 }}, retrieved May 6, 2006</ref> One or the other, or both dates may appear on various official seals used by different schools of the university.

On April 24–25, 1839 a group of [[Methodist]] ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school. Set up in Newbury, [[Vermont]], the school was named the "Newbury Biblical Institute".

In 1847, the Congregational Society in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], invited the Institute to relocate to Concord and offered a disused [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational church]] building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by New Hampshire designated the school the "Methodist General Biblical Institute", but it was commonly called the "Concord Biblical Institute".

With the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased {{convert|30|acre|m2}} on Aspinwall Hill in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], as a possible relocation site. The institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood of Boston, and received a Massachusetts Charter as the "Boston Theological Seminary".

In 1869, three trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by the name of "Boston University".<ref name="Buckley1898"/> These trustees were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises, and they became the founders of Boston University. They were Isaac Rich (1801–1872), Lee Claflin (1791–1871), and Jacob Sleeper (1802–1889), for whom Boston University's three [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]] dormitories were later named. Lee Claflin's son, [[William Claflin|William]], was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on May 26, 1869, after it was passed by the Legislature.

As reported by Kathleen Kilgore in her book ''Transformations, A History of Boston University'' (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]), the founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:

:No instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission ... on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.

Every department of the new university was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.

===Early years (1870–1900)===

[[File:688 Boylston St.jpg|thumbnail|right|688 Boylston Street, the early home of the College of Liberal Arts, the precursor to the College of Arts & Sciences]]
The Boston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the [[Boston University School of Theology|BU School of Theology]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/sth/welcome/about-sth/history/|title=history » School of Theology|publisher=Boston University|language=en|access-date=October 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016230033/https://www.bu.edu/sth/welcome/about-sth/history/|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On January 13, 1872, [[Isaac Rich]] died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston, which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university as of that time. By December, however, the [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the University, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were [[bankrupt]]. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

As a result, the University was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill, and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of University ownership in this area. Following the fire, Boston University established its new facilities in buildings scattered throughout [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], and later expanded into the [[Boylston Street]] and [[Copley Square]] area, before building its Charles River Campus in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

After receiving a year's salary advance to allow him to pursue his research in 1875, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], then a professor at the school, invented the telephone in a Boston University laboratory.<ref name="Kilgore">{{cite book |last1=Kilgore|first1=Kathleen|title=Transformations: A History of Boston University|date=1991|publisher=Boston University Press |location=Boston}}</ref> In 1876, [[Borden Parker Bowne]] was appointed professor of philosophy. Bowne, an important figure in the history of American religious thought, was an American Christian philosopher and theologian in the [[Methodist]] tradition.

[[File:Helen magill.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Helen Magill White]], the first woman to receive a PhD from an American university]]
The university continued its tradition of openness in this period. In 1877, Boston University became the first American university to award a PhD to a woman, when classics scholar [[Helen Magill White]] earned hers with a thesis on "The Greek Drama".<ref name="Kilgore"/><ref name=":3" /> Then in 1878 Anna Oliver became the first woman to receive a degree in theology in the United States, but the [[Methodist Church]] would not ordain her.<ref name="Kilgore"/> [[Lelia J.

Seeking to unify a geographically scattered school and enable it to participate in the development of the city, school president Lemuel Murlin arranged that the school buy the present campus along the [[Charles River]]. Between 1920 and 1928, the school bought the {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land that had been reclaimed from the river by the Riverfront Improvement Association. Plans for a riverside quadrangle with a [[Alexander Graham Bell tower|Gothic Revival administrative tower]] modeled on the "Old Boston Stump" in [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], England were scaled back in the late 1920s when the State Metropolitan District Commission used [[eminent domain]] to seize riverfront land for [[Storrow Drive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/betweenwars.html |title=Between World Wars |publisher=Boston University |access-date=April 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212022404/http://www.bu.edu/visit/about/history/betweenwars.html |archive-date=December 12, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Murlin was never able to build the new campus, but his successor, [[Daniel L. Marsh]], led a series of fundraising campaigns (interrupted by both the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]) that helped Marsh to achieve his dream and to gradually fill in the University's new campus.<ref>Healea, Christopher Daryl, "The Builder and Maker of the Greater University: A History of Daniel L.

[[File:Boston University (8609103615).jpg|thumbnail|upright|[[Josep Lluís Sert|Sert]]'s buildings expanded the campus in the 1960s]]
In 1951, [[Harold C. Case]] became the school's fifth president and under his direction the character of the campus changed significantly, as he sought to change the school into a national research university. The campus tripled in size to {{convert|45|acre|m2}}, and added 68 new buildings before Case retired in 1967. The first large dorms, Claflin, Rich and Sleeper Halls in [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]] were built, and in 1965 construction began on 700 [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], later named [[Warren Towers]], designed to house 1800 students. Between 1961 and 1966, the [[Boston University School of Law|BU Law Tower]], the [[George Sherman Union]], and the [[Mugar Memorial Library]] were constructed in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style, a departure from the school's traditional architecture. The [[Boston University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[Boston University College of Communication|College of Communication]] were housed in a former stable building and auto-show room, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailyfreepress.com/media/storage/paper87/news/2006/10/17/News/Activism.Dorm.Construction.Pervade.Campus.In.1950s60s-2371894.shtml|work=The Daily Free Press|author=Alex Taylor |title=Activism, dorm construction pervade campus in 1950s–60s |access-date=April 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401215744/http://media.www.dailyfreepress.com/media/storage/paper87/news/2006/10/17/News/Activism.Dorm.Construction.Pervade.Campus.In.1950s60s-2371894.shtml|archive-date=April 1, 2007}}</ref> Besides his efforts to expand the university into a rival for Greater Boston's more prestigious academic institutions, such as [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (both in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] across the Charles River from the BU campus), Case involved himself in the start of the student/societal upheavals that came to characterize the 1960s.

When a mini-squabble over editorial policy at [[college radio]] [[WBUR-FM]] – whose offices were under a tall radio antenna mast in front of the School of Public Relations and Communications (later College of Communications) – started growing in the spring of 1964, Case persuaded university trustees that the university should take over the widely-heard radio station (now a major outlet for [[National Public Radio]] and still a BU-owned broadcast facility). The trustees approved the firing of student managers and clamped down on programming and editorial policy, which had been led by Jim Thistle, later a major force in Boston's broadcast news milieu. The on-campus political dispute between Case's conservative administration and the suddenly active and mostly liberal student body led to other disputes over BU student print publications, such as the ''B.U. News'' and the ''Scarlet'', a fraternity association newspaper.

The Presidency of [[John Silber]] also saw much expansion of the campus and programs. In the late 1970s, the [[Lahey Clinic]] vacated its building at 605 Commonwealth Avenue and moved to [[Burlington, Massachusetts]]. The vacated building was purchased by BU to house the [[Boston University School of Education|School of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahey.org/About/LaheyHistory.asp|publisher=The Lahey Clinic|title=Lahey History|access-date=December 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423195345/http://www.lahey.org/About/LaheyHistory.asp|archive-date=April 23, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> After arriving from the University of Texas in 1971, Silber set out to remake the university into a global center for research by recruiting star faculty.

In addition to recruiting new scholars, Silber expanded the physical campus, constructing the [[Boston University Photonics Center|Photonics Center]] for the study of light, a new building for the School of Management, and the Life Science and Engineering Building for interdisciplinary research, among other projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2005/04-29/lse.html|title=Life Science and Engineering building: "cathedral to science"|publisher=Boston University|access-date=July 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922152400/http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2005/04-29/lse.html|archive-date=September 22, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Campus expansion continued in the 2000s with the construction of new dormitories and the [[Agganis Arena]].

=== History of student and faculty activism on campus ===
To protest the poor condition of Boston University's African-American curriculum, on April 25, 1968 (three weeks after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]]), African-American students conducted a [[sit-in]] and locked BU President [[Arland F. Christ-Janer|Dr. Arland F. Christ-Janer]] out of his office for 12 hours.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Waters|first=Bertram|date=May 5, 1968|title=Science Medicine Education: 'Reason' Won' at Sit-in, Says B.U.

No disciplinary action was taken against the students who only opened the chains after their demands were met. "There was no surprise, or feeling of victory on the students’ parts," said Dr. Christ-Janer in response to the sit-in. "They had confidence in their demands, and I had a confidence in them. The university, black and white alike, was the winner."<ref name=":0" />

The late twentieth century saw a culmination in student activism at Boston University during the presidency of [[John Silber|John R. Silber]]. In 1972, student protests rose against the university administration’s endorsement of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] recruitment on campus which faced significant opposition from the [[Students for a Democratic Society|Student Democratic Society]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Rosenbloom|first=Joseph|date=March 28, 1972|title=33 protesters arrested at BU career office|page=1|work=Boston Globe (1960-1988); Boston, Mass.|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|type=Historical Newspapers|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/375333303|access-date=September 29, 2020|id={{ProQuest|375333303}}|via=ProQuest}}</ref> On March 27, 1972, 50 police officers in "riot gear" defused a demonstration of 150 protesters at 195 Bay State Road, the BU Placement Office, where Marine recruiters were holding student interviews. A few protesters were arrested while some suffered minor injuries, including a student and two officers. Contrary to student claims of a peaceful protest, Silber said, “Civilization doesn’t abdicate in face of barbarism. Those students or nonstudents who deliberately seek violent confrontation and refuse all efforts at peaceful resolution of issues must expect society to use its police power in its own defense." In response to Silber's decision of a forceful police intervention, the Faculty State conducted a vote on Silber's resignation which could not pass due to a "vote of 140-25 with 32 abstentions."<ref name=":2" /> As a result of this failed motion, Peter P. Gabriel resigned his position as the dean of [[Questrom School of Business|Boston University’s School of Management]] in protest of Silber’s presidency and his "counterproductive" leadership.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McCain|first=Nina|date=May 6, 1976|title=BU dean resigns to protest trustees' approval of Silber|work=Boston Globe (1960-1988); Boston, Mass.|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|type=Historical Newspapers|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/657914676|access-date=September 29, 2020|id={{ProQuest|657914676}}|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Silber’s support of military recruitment on campus, which he pushed to make the university eligible for Federal grants,<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Cullen|first=John|date=March 17, 1978|title=Tuition protest turns ugly, students trap 50 at BU|page=1|work=Boston Globe (1960-1988); Boston, Mass.|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|type=Historical Newspapers|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/757677881|access-date=September 29, 2020|id={{ProQuest|757677881}}|via=ProQuest}}</ref> caused other demonstrations.

On March 16, 1978, about 900 Boston University students gathered at the [[George Sherman Union]] to protest against the $400 rise in tuition and $150 rise in housing charges declared by the trustees on March 7.<ref name=":1" /> The protest interrupted a board of trustees conference. While John Silber and [[Arthur GB Metcalf|Arthur G.B. Metcalf]], the chairman of the board of trustees, were negotiating with student government representatives to discuss the matter further on a separate occasion, the protesters marched into the building from two entrances, effectively trapping 40 trustees and 10 university administrators in the building for over thirty minutes. Twenty officers from the [[Boston University Police Department]] had to disperse the crowd from the stairwells. The protest resulted in the arrest of 19 year old Joshua Grossman, while another student and two BUPD officers were taken to hospitals.<ref name=":1" />

On April 5, 1979, several hundred faculty members, as well as clerical workers and librarians, [[1979 Boston University strike|went on strike]]. The faculty members were seeking a labor contract while the clerical workers and librarians were seeking union recognition. The strike ended by mid-April under terms favorable to the employees.

On November 27, 1979, the Committee to Defend Iranian Students- composed of Iranian students, Youths Against Foreign Fascism and the Revolutionary Communist Party, held a demonstration at the George Sherman Union against the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|deposed Shah of Iran]] and the deportation of Iranian students from the US. "To the Iranian people, that man (the shah) is Adolf Hitler," students protested. "The Shah Must Face the Wrath of the People." This was met with chants of "God Bless America" from the opposing group. Twenty policemen broke up the confronting parties though no arrests were made.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rivas|first=Maggie|date=November 28, 1979|title=Iran Rallies at BU Clash: UMass-Amherst Asks Iranians to Interviews|page=9|work=Boston Globe (1960-1988); Boston, Mass.|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|type=Historical Newspapers|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/747170454|access-date=September 29, 2020|id={{ProQuest|747170454}}|via=ProQuest}}</ref>

=== The 21st century ===

[[Robert A. Brown]]'s presidency, which started in 2005, has sought to further the consolidation of campus infrastructure that was commenced by earlier administrations. During his tenure, Brown has strengthened the core missions of undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, interdisciplinary work, and research and scholarship across all 17 schools and colleges.

In 2012, the University was invited to join the [[Association of American Universities]], comprising 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. BU, one of four universities invited to join the group since 2000, became the 62nd member. In the Boston area, Harvard, MIT, and Brandeis are also members.<ref name="AAU">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/bu-joins-association-of-american-universities/|title=BU Joins Association of American Universities|work=BU Today|access-date=April 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822222146/http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/bu-joins-association-of-american-universities/|archive-date=August 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelderman |first1=Eric |title=Boston U.

That same year, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was launched, its first comprehensive campaign, emphasizing financial aid, faculty support, research, and facility improvements. In 2016, the campaign goal was reached. The Board of Trustees voted to raise the goal to $1.5 billion and extend through 2019.

==Campus==
[[File:Boston at sunset.jpg|thumbnail|right|Boston University's East Campus along [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]]]]

===Boston campuses and facilities===
[[File:Bu beach.jpg|thumb|The "BU Beach" is a linear strip of land sandwiched between the main BU campus and busy [[Storrow Drive]], and is used as an outdoors space to relax and sunbathe in good weather.]]
The University's main Charles River Campus follows [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]] and the [[Green Line (MBTA)#B Line|Green Line]], beginning near [[Kenmore Square]] and continuing for over a mile and a half to its end near the border of Boston's [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] neighborhood. The [[Boston University Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]] into [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] represents the dividing line between Main Campus, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]], home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex.

The main campus buildings of BU are separated from the [[Charles River Esplanade]] parkland and the [[Paul Dudley White]] Bike Path along the banks of the nearby Charles River, by heavily trafficked [[Storrow Drive]], a high-speed [[limited-access road|limited-access]] major roadway connecting downtown Boston to its western suburbs. The separation occurred in the late 1920s, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seized land by [[eminent domain]] for the construction of the new roadway along the riverbank. A narrow strip of grassy lawn between BU academic buildings lining Commonwealth Avenue and the torrent of traffic on Storrow Drive has been humorously dubbed "BU Beach", because it is a favorite hangout for [[sunbathing]] in good weather. The lounging students are protected from traffic incursions by a raised earthen [[berm]], which also muffles the traffic noise to a dull roar. To protect pedestrians from vehicular collisions, Storrow Drive is enclosed by fencing, with [[pedestrian bridge]]s allowing safe crossings at Silber Way and at Marsh Chapel. An additional crossing is possible at the BU Bridge, which also allows street traffic to cross from the Boston side to the Cambridge side of the Charles River.

As a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel, and the School of Theology buildings are the university's most recognizable, and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in [[collegiate gothic]] style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston [[brownstone]], especially at [[Bay State Road]] and South Campus, where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories, but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices.

From the 1960s–1980s many contemporary buildings were constructed, including the Mugar Library, BU Law School, and [[Warren Towers]], all of which were built in the [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] style of architecture. The [[Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering]], constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as [[Structural Expressionism]]. [[Morse Auditorium]], adjacent, stands in stark architectural contrast, as it was originally constructed as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. The most recent architectural additions to BU's campus are the [[Boston University Photonics Center|Photonics Center]], Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|FitRec Center]] and [[Agganis Arena]]), and the [[Boston University School of Management|Questrom School of Business]]. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone. Boston University converted the old Nickelodeon Cinemas complex into College of Engineering labs and offices.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nickelodeon Cinemas in Boston, MA - Cinema Treasures|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7688|access-date=February 10, 2021|website=cinematreasures.org}}</ref> In 2016, the university sold the building that housed the [[Huntington Theatre Company]] and constructed the Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre and College of Fine Arts Production Center to consolidate the theater program on campus.<ref>{{Cite web|title=$10 million gift from Trustee names new CFA theatre – The Daily Free Press|url=https://dailyfreepress.com/2017/03/16/10-million-gift-from-trustee-names-new-cfa-theatre/|access-date=February 10, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=September 24, 2019|title=Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre and the College of Fine Arts Production Center / Elkus Manfredi Architects|url=https://www.archdaily.com/924938/joan-and-edgar-booth-theatre-and-the-college-of-fine-arts-production-center-elkus-manfredi-architects|access-date=February 10, 2021|website=ArchDaily|language=en-US}}</ref>

Boston University's housing system is the nation's 10th largest among four-year colleges. BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76 percent of the undergraduate population lives on campus. Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan with several combinations of meals and dining points which can be used as cash in on-campus facilities.<ref name="diningplanrequired">[http://www.bu.edu/housing/dining/plans/index.html Boston University | Office of Housing | Dining Plans and Convenience Points|Dining Plans], retrieved May 6, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212021154/http://www.bu.edu/housing/dining/plans/index.html |date=December 12, 2009 }}</ref>

Housing at BU is an unusually diverse melange, ranging from individual 19th-century [[brownstone]] [[townhouse]]s and apartment buildings acquired by the school to large-scale high-rises built in the 1960s and 2000s.

The large dormitories include the 1,800-student [[Warren Towers]], the largest on campus, as well as West Campus and [[Towers (Boston University)|The Towers]]. The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BU's townhouses, often called "brownstones". South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.

Boston University's newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 33 Harry Agganis Way, "StuVi2" unofficially, and is part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The north-facing, 26-story building is apartment style while the south-facing, 19-story building is in an 8-bedroom dormitory-style suite pattern. In total, the building houses 960 residents.

Aside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.

Boston University also provides [[Boston University Housing System#Specialty housing|specialty houses]] or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.

All large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and validate their school identification before entering.

Kilachand Hall, formerly [[Shelton Hall (Boston University)|Shelton Hall]], is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. O'Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers' Corridor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/kilachand-honors-college-students-get-their-own-home/ |title=Kilachand Honors College Students Get Their Own Home |first=Robin |last=Berghaus |website=BU Today |access-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125131055/http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/kilachand-honors-college-students-get-their-own-home/ |archive-date=January 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====John Hancock Student Village====
[[File:Student Village II at Boston University.jpg|thumb|Student Village II with Student Village I in the background, as viewed from Nickerson Field]]
{{Main|John Hancock Student Village}}
The Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering {{convert|10|acre|m2}} between Buick Street and [[Nickerson Field]], ground formerly occupied by a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|Armory]], which had been used by the University for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its [[demolition]] and the start of construction. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to "StuVi" by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, [[John Hancock Insurance]] announced its sponsorship of the multimillion-dollar project.

The [[Agganis Arena]], named after [[Harry Agganis]], was opened to concerts and [[ice hockey|hockey]] games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for [[Boston University Terriers#Terrier Hockey|Terrier hockey]] games, replacing the smaller [[Walter Brown Arena]]. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center]], was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body. Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.

====Guest and visitor policies====
Prior to September 2007, Boston University had a restrictive visitor policy, which limited the ability of students from different dormitories to visit each other at night. This changed when a new policy approved by Brown took effect.<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=44920&template=4 "President Approves New Guest Policy"], ''BU Today'' May 7, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213114351/http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=44920&template=4 |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> The new policy allows for students living on campus to swipe into any on-campus dormitory between the hours of 7&nbsp;am and 2&nbsp;am using their Terrier cards. Student residents can also sign in guests with photo identification at any time, day or night.

The ''Times'' discovered that administrators have suggested to faculty members deflated ideal grade distributions. Although an article in the official publication ''BU Today'' asserted that "the GPAs of BU undergrads and the percentage of As and Bs have both risen over the last two decades", ''The New York Times'' has found BU grades have been rising more slowly with respect to many other schools.

In 2014, the average GPA of a BU undergraduate was 3.16, compared to the averages of 3.35 for [[Boston College]] (2007), 3.48 for [[Amherst College]] (2006), 3.52 for [[New York University]] (2015), and 3.65 for [[Harvard University]] (2015).<ref name=Rojstaczer>{{cite web|date=April 7, 2017|author=Rojstaczer, Stuart|url=http://gradeinflation.com/Boston.html|title=Grade Inflation Across the U.S.|work=Boston University|publisher=gradeinflation.com|access-date=May 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430022147/http://www.gradeinflation.com/Boston.html|archive-date=April 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

About 81 percent of all grades earned in either the A or B range (75% in the B range). The article went on to note that although the university attempted to curb [[grade inflation]] and inconsistency in the late 1990s, both the percentage of As and GPAs have been rising since. They attributed the grade inflation that has occurred not to teachers' grading policies, but to the increasing quality of each incoming class which leads to more top grades.<ref name=BUTodayGradeDeflation>{{Cite news|first=Chris |last=Berdik |url=http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=40427&template=7 |title=Grade Deflation or Not? |work=BU Today |date=September 14, 2006 |access-date=October 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014223059/http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=4&id=40427&template=7 |archive-date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref>

===Special academic programs===

====General Education: the BU Hub====
BU Hub, the University-wide undergraduate general education curriculum, requires course work in the core capacities of: philosophical, aesthetic, and historical interpretation; scientific and social inquiry; quantitative reasoning; diversity, civic engagement, and global citizenship; written, oral, and multimedia communication; and an intellectual toolkit that includes critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bu.edu/today/2016/university-wide-general-education-program-proposed/|title=University-Wide General Education Program Proposed|work=BU Today|access-date=April 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170209/https://www.bu.edu/today/2016/university-wide-general-education-program-proposed/|archive-date=April 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Kilachand Honors College====
The University Honors College matriculated its first class in 2010. In 2011, it was renamed Arvind and Chandan Nandlal Kilachand Honors College following a $25 million donation from Rajen Kilachand; the largest donation in the history of the University. The Kilachand Honors College is a university-wide community of faculty and students dedicated to preserving, renewing, and rethinking classic ideals of liberal education: love of learning, intellectual curiosity, self-discovery, empathy, clarity of thought and expression. It rests on three pillars: an integrated, four-year curriculum; an extensive series of co-curricular events that include site-visits to leading cultural institutions as well as talks and readings by leading figures in the arts, sciences, and professions; and, finally, a "living and learning" community that offers students the personal atmosphere of a small liberal arts college and fosters responsibility and citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/khc/about/ |title=What is Kilachand Honors College? » Kilachand Honors College &#124; Boston University |publisher=Boston University |access-date=April 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327192008/http://www.bu.edu/khc/about/ |archive-date=March 27, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Trustee Scholars Program ====

Around 20 freshmen from every Boston University graduating class are part of the Trustee Scholars Program. These students are recipients of the Trustee Scholarship, known to be the most prestigious merit-based, full-tuition scholarship for undergraduates. Although not an academic program per se, students "become part of a unique campus community that offers many intellectual, cultural, and social opportunities",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boston University Admissions |title=Trustee Scholarship |url=http://www.bu.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/scholarships-financial-aid/first-year-merit/trustee/ |website=Boston University |access-date=February 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209232230/http://www.bu.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/scholarships-financial-aid/first-year-merit/trustee/ |archive-date=February 9, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> such as special lectures by distinguished professors and scholars.

==Student life==

===Student publications===
Although officially and entirely independent from the university, ''[[Daily Free Press|The Daily Free Press]]'' (often referred to as ''The FreeP''), is the campus student newspaper and the fourth largest daily newspaper in Boston. Since 1970, it has provided students with campus news, city and state news, sports coverage, editorials, arts and entertainment, and special feature stories. ''The Daily Free Press'' is published every regular instruction day of the University year and is available in BU dorms, classroom buildings, and commercial locations frequented by students.

The literary magazine ''[[Clarion (magazine)|Clarion]]'' has been printed since 1998. The first issue, titled "?", was published by the group Students for Literary Awareness with the sponsorship of the Department of English; subsequent issues were issued by the BU Literary Society, and most recently, by the BU BookLab. ''Burn Magazine'' is a younger literary magazine, affiliated with ''Clarion'', but publishing the work of student authors only.

''[[Boink]]'' was launched in February 2005 by a group of undergrads led by Alecia Oleyourryk, who was then a senior at the College of Communications. The magazine featured BU students posing nude, as well as articles on sexuality.

===ROTC===
The [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) at BU traces its origins back to August 16, 1919 when the US War Department stood up the Students' Army Training Corps at Boston University, the predecessor to the current Army ROTC program.<ref name="rotc">{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/dme/ |title=Boston University – Division of Military Education |publisher=Boston University |access-date=October 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701235516/http://www.bu.edu/dme/ |archive-date=July 1, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Today, BU is one of twenty five colleges and universities in the country to host all three ROTC programs – Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Boston University disbanded its football team in 1997. The university used the nearly $3 million from its football program to build the multimillion-dollar John Hancock Student Village and athletic complex. The university also increased funding to women's athletic programs. "By implementing the total plan, we can achieve a much more balanced set of sports programs for both men and women, which is consistent with the philosophy underlying Title IX", said former BU athletic director Gary Strickler.<ref>Hanson, Gayle M.B. & Berg, Stacie Zoe.
