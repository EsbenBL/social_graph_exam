Between his numerous projects, Svenonius has released more than 22 full-length albums and over 20 singles, [[Extended play|EPs]], and [[Split album|splits]].  A published author and online talk show host, Svenonius' projects share a tongue-in-cheek, [[Far-left politics|radical left]] political ideology.

His first band, Nation of Ulysses, which released its first record in 1990, was highly influential in the punk scene but dissolved in 1992.  After a short-lived side-project called [[Cupid Car Club]], Svenonius formed the Make-Up in 1995, who combined garage rock, soul, and [[liberation theology]] to make a new genre they dubbed "Gospel Yeh-Yeh".<ref name="Make-Up biography">{{cite web

==Musical projects==

===Nation of Ulysses===
{{Main|Nation of Ulysses}}
Svenonius' first musical group was [[Nation of Ulysses]].  The band formed in spring 1988, initially composed of four members, Svenonius on [[singing|vocals]] and [[trumpet]], Steve Kroner on [[guitar]], Steve Gamboa on [[bass guitar]], and [[James Canty]] on [[Drum kit|drums]], and known simply as "Ulysses".  In late 1989, Tim Green joined the band as a second guitarist and the band was renamed to "Nation of Ulysses".<ref name="Membership Profiles">{{cite web

He criticized "traditional rock-and-roll" groups as a "corrupt medium."  The contest was reportedly a "nationwide search for the most perfect boyfriend material a girl could ask for", and Svenonius was among 150 entries.

Nation of Ulysses was known for their extremely physical performances,{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} during which Svenonius recalls many injuries,{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} including breaking his arm, his leg, and his skull on numerous occasions. Audience members were also hurt during some performances.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

The group disbanded in the fall <!--Northern or Southern Hemisphere autumn? Use month(s)-->of 1992 having failed to complete their third album (the finished tracks were later released as ''[[The Embassy Tapes]]'' in 2000).  In a later interview, Svenonius explained the reason for the split: "Nation of Ulysses broke up because the epoch changed with the advent of [[digital audio|digital music]] and the [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] explosion. We were faced with what's now known as [[indie rock]], a sort of vacuous form.  We had to determine our next move and this [the forming of [[Make-Up (American band)|The Make-Up]]] is it".<ref name="Steady Diet">{{cite web

As the Make-Up's frontman and mouthpiece, Ian Svenonius often contextualized the band's music in terms of larger socio-political themes, typically describing the band and its gospel attitude in [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] terms, in opposition of what he saw as the [[Capitalism|capitalist]], [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], [[machismo]] paradigm of [[rock and roll]].<ref name="In Film">{{cite video

The Make-Up dissolved in 2000, reportedly "due to the large number of counter-gang copy groups which had appropriated their look and sound and applied it to a vacuous and [[counter-revolutionary]] forms".<ref name="DC PDF" />  Between projects, Svenonius released a [[David Candy#Play Power|solo album]] under the pseudonym [[David Candy]].<ref name="Ashlock" />

===Weird War===
{{Main|Weird War}}

After the Make-Up disbanded, Svenonius formed the group [[Weird War]] in 2001, joined by Make-Up members [[Michelle Mae]] and [[Alex Minoff]].  While the current lineup appears on the group's first release ''I'll Never Forget What's His Name,'' the group's first full-length, [[Weird War (album)|eponymous release]] featured [[Neil Hagerty]] and Jessica Espeleta on guitars, and Steve McCarty on drums.<ref name="WW AMG">{{cite web

These collaborators soon left to pursue other projects, and the band briefly changed its name to The Scene Creamers, with Svenonius on vocals, Michelle Mae on bass, Alex Minoff on guitar, and Blake Brunner on drums.  In this incarnation, the band released ''I Suck on that Emotion'', through [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]].  After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French [[graffiti artist]] collective of the same name, the band reverted to the name Weird War.<ref name="Holliy">{{cite web

Weird War claims that they are "the sole answer to the hype-based careerism, empty formalism and vacuity which has infected what was once a genuinely creative underground rock 'n' roll scene".<ref name="Holliy" />

===Chain and the Gang===
Svenonius' musical project, Chain and The Gang, released the albums ''[[Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!]]'', "[[Music's Not For Everyone]]", "[[In Cool Blood]]" on K Records, and "[[Minimum Rock 'n' Roll]]" on Radical Elite Records. Some of the musicians featured on these records are [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]], Brett Lyman (Bad Thoughts/M'Ladys's Records), Fiona Campbell (Vivian Girls/Coasting), Sarah Pedal, Katie Alice Greer ([[Priests (band)|Priests]]), Faustine Hudson (The Curious Mystery), Brian Weber ([[Dub Narcotic Sound System]]), Veronica Ortuño ([[Finally Punk/Carrots]]), Nicolaas Zwart (Desolation Wilderness), Karl Blau, Chris Sutton (Hornet Leg, [[The Gossip]]), Sixx (The Vibrarians), Arrington de Dionyso, Aaron Hartman, Benjamin Hartman (Old Time Relijun), Anna Nasty ([[Olivia Neutron-John]]), and Francy Graham.

=== Sassiest Boy in America ===
In 1990 [[Sassy (magazine)|Sassy magazine]] conducted a search for the Sassiest Boy in America. Over 150 entries were received with the eventual winner being Ian Svenonius. In the story highlighting his selection Sassy founding editor [[Jane Pratt]] states "He's going to be a big deal. I'm sure he will be and we're going to be so proud that we were the first ones to discover him." Though Svenonius was too old to qualify for the title under the rules of the contest, this was not discovered until after he had already won.

=== ''The Psychic Soviet'' ===

The "Instructions" that preface the book state that it "should clear up much of the confusion regarding events of the last millennium – artistic, geo-political, philosophical, et al." and encourages the reader to "refer to the book in case of ethical quandaries, arguments, and social feuds".<ref name="Illuminated by the Light" /><ref name="Jetset">{{cite web

==Controversy==
===Sexual Misconduct===
In July 2020, Svenonius posted a statement<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDCMqjKgmV0/}}</ref> (now-deleted) on his Instagram page admitting to a history of being “completely inappropriate to women.” He elaborated: “I want to use this forum to say that I support people speaking out for the eradication of abusive predatory modes and also that I am absolutely one of the guilty parties.... That, through my narcissism, egotism, and thoughtlessness, I have acted the creep. That I have made people I cared about and respected feel terrible, have been completely inappropriate to women.... To anyone I have made feel bad or uncomfortable, I sincerely apologize and throw myself at your mercy. I always believed that I was a revolutionary and now my revolutionary act is self-immolation.” <ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/ian-svenonius-publishes-and-deletes-post-about-being-completely-inappropriate-to-women/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/ian-svenonius-i-have-been-completely-inappropriate-to-women/}}</ref>

In response, his record label [[Merge Records]] stated: "Merge Records has severed ties with Ian Svenonius moving forward, and we are pulling his catalog from our webstore, physical distributors, and streaming/download services. The information and allegations surrounding Ian’s post last Friday have been illuminating and disheartening. We see and stand with all those who have come forward and all those who haven’t, and we will continue working and listening to do our part in making the music community one that is safer and more inclusive for everyone."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/mergerecords/status/1288528028650348545}}</ref>
