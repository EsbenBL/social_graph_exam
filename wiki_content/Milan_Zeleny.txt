In Zeleny's book, ''Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management and Systems,'' World Scientific, 2005 (reprint 2008), he summarizes knowledge as purposeful coordination of action and its implications for the global economics and management. Zeleny also indicates how the sector evolution from agriculture, industry, services and government leads to self-service and disintermediation, the first manifestations of the [[transformation in economics]], which refers to the long-term movement from globalization to the relocalization of economic activities and mass customization of global market.

According to [[h-index|Hirsch Citation and Publication Index]], Zeleny was the most cited Czech economist as of 2005.{{citation needed|date = October 2016}}<ref name="Hirsch">{{cite journal | url=http://www.vse.cz/polek/download.php?jnl=polek&pdf=638.pdf | title=Hirsch index and rankings of czech economists | last=Macháček | first=Martin | journal=Politická Ekonomie | year=2008| volume=56 | issue=2 | pages=229–241 | doi=10.18267/j.polek.638 | doi-access=free }}</ref> Since 1992, Zeleny constantly appears in the listings of ''Who's Who in Science and Engineering'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Who is Who|url=https://cgi.marquiswhoswho.com/OnDemand/Default.aspx?last_name=Zeleny&first_name=Milan}}</ref> ''Who's Who in America'' (also ''in the East'', ''in the World'' and ''of Professionals'').

== Personal life ==
Zeleny was born on January 22, 1942, in a small village of Klucké Chvalovice<ref>{{cite web|title=geoview.info|url=http://cz.geoview.info/klucke_chvalovice,3073560}}</ref>  in eastern Bohemia. He came from the literary family of Vácslav and Vladivoj Zelený. His father, Josef Zelený, founded one of the first organizational consulting firms in the 1930s and 1940s in Prague ("ZET-organizace"). After the communist takeover in 1948, his father became a coal miner (in Kladno) and his uncle worked in the uranium mines of Jáchymov. After studies at the [[University of Economics, Prague]] (1959–1964), military service in Prague, and a few years at the Czech Academy of Sciences, he left the communist Czechoslovakia in 1967 to expand his education for Ph.D. in Operations Research and Business Economics at the [[University of Rochester]], where he also received his M.S. in Systems Management in 1970.

In 2012, he declared his intention to run for presidency of the [[Czech Republic]], but then withdrew from the presidential election race.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/o-prezidentsky-urad-se-bude-uchazet-nejmene-devet-kandidatu-20121104.html | title=O prezidentský úřad se bude ucházet nejméně devět kandidátů| newspaper=Deník.cz| date=2012-11-04}}</ref> He has been a resident of [[Tenafly, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff.
