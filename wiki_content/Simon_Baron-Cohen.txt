He is the director of the university's [[Autism Research Centre]] and a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. In 1985, Baron-Cohen formulated the [[mind-blindness]] theory of [[autism]], the evidence for which he collated and published in 1995. In 1997, he formulated the [[Extreme male brain|fetal sex steroid theory of autism]], the key test of which was published in 2015.

He has also made major contributions to the fields of [[Sex differences in psychology#Psychological traits|typical cognitive sex differences]], autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism [[neuroimaging]], autism and technical ability, and [[synaesthesia]]. Baron-Cohen was [[knighted]] in the [[2021 New Year Honours]] for services to autistic people.

==Autism research==
In 1997 Baron-Cohen developed the "[[empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory]]" which states that humans may be classified on the basis of their scores along two dimensions (empathizing and systemizing). The E-S theory argues that typical females on average score higher on empathizing relative to systemizing (they are more likely to have a brain of type E), and typical males on average score higher on systemizing relative to empathizing (they are more likely to have a brain of type S). Autistic people are predicted to score as an extreme of the typical male (they are more likely to have a brain of type S or extreme type S).<ref name="Greenberg_2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg DM, Warrier V, Allison C, Baron-Cohen S | title = Testing the Empathizing-Systemizing theory of sex differences and the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism in half a million people | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 48 | pages = 12152–12157 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30420503 | pmc = 6275492 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1811032115 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Scientific American 2012">{{cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-geeky-couples-more-likely-to-have-kids-with-autism/ |url-access=subscription |author=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=Are geeky couples more likely to have kids with autism? |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=9 November 2012 |access-date=14 April 2018}} [https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/publications/download.php?id=20821 Pdf].

Baron-Cohen's "assortative mating theory" that if individuals with a "systemizing" focus or "type S" brain are [[Assortative mating|selecting each other as mates]], they are more likely to have children with autism.<ref name="Time" /><ref name="Scientific American 2012" />  This has been supported in a population study in Eindhoven, where autism rates are twice as high in that city that is an IT hub, compared to other Dutch cities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roelfsema MT, Hoekstra RA, Allison C, Wheelwright S, Brayne C, Matthews FE, Baron-Cohen S | title = Are autism spectrum conditions more prevalent in an information-technology region?

In 2001 he developed the [[autism-spectrum quotient]] (AQ), a set of fifty questions that can be used to help determine whether or not an adult exhibits symptoms of autism.<ref name="Woodbury-Smith">{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodbury-Smith MR, Robinson J, Wheelwright S, Baron-Cohen S | title = Screening adults for Asperger Syndrome using the AQ: a preliminary study of its diagnostic validity in clinical practice | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–5 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16119474 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3300-7 | s2cid = 13013701 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.653.8639 }}</ref> The AQ has subsequently been used in hundreds of studies including one study of half a million people, showing robust sex differences and higher scores in those who work in [[STEM]].<ref name="pmid26488477">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruzich E, Allison C, Chakrabarti B, Smith P, Musto H, Ring H, Baron-Cohen S | title = Sex and STEM Occupation Predict Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) Scores in Half a Million People | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = e0141229 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26488477 | pmc = 4619566 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0141229 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1041229R | lay-url = http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-of-half-a-million-people-reveals-sex-and-job-predict-how-many-autistic-traits-you-have | lay-source = University of Cambridge | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Greenberg_2018" />

=== Prenatal neuroendocrinology ===
Baron-Cohen's work in E-S theory led him to investigate whether higher levels of prenatal [[testosterone]] explain the increased rate of autism among males.<ref name="Scientific American 2012" /> His prenatal sex steroid theory of autism gained additional support in 2015 and 2019 in finding elevated prenatal androgens estrogens{{Clarify|date=November 2021|reason=what are androgens estrogens?}} are associated with autism.<ref name="Baron-Cohen 1–9">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S, Tsompanidis A, Auyeung B, Nørgaard-Pedersen B, Hougaard DM, Abdallah M, Cohen A, Pohl A | display-authors = 6 | title = Foetal oestrogens and autism | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 2970–2978 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 31358906 | pmc = 7577840 | doi = 10.1038/s41380-019-0454-9 | s2cid = 198982283 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Baron-Cohen_2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S, Auyeung B, Nørgaard-Pedersen B, Hougaard DM, Abdallah MW, Melgaard L, Cohen AS, Chakrabarti B, Ruta L, Lombardo MV | display-authors = 6 | title = Elevated fetal steroidogenic activity in autism | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–76 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 24888361 | pmc = 4184868 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2014.48 }}</ref>

In his 2004 book ''Prenatal Testosterone in Mind'' ([[MIT Press]]) Baron-Cohen put forward the prenatal sex steroid theory of autism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S, Knickmeyer RC, Belmonte MK | title = Sex differences in the brain: implications for explaining autism. | journal = Science | date = November 2005 | volume = 310 | issue = 5749 | pages = 819–23 | doi = 10.1126/science.1115455 | pmid = 16272115 | bibcode = 2005Sci...310..819B | s2cid = 44330420 | url = http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/2710/1/219535_PubSub1971_Belmonte.pdf }}</ref> He proposed this theory to understand why autism is more common in males. Using the Cambridge Child Development Project that he established in 1997, a [[longitudinal study]] studying children of 600 women who had undergone [[amniocentesis]] in [[pregnancy]], he followed these children postnatally. This study demonstrated, for the first time in humans, how normative variation in amniotic prenatal testosterone levels correlates with individual differences in typical postnatal brain and behavioral development. His team discovered that in typical children, amount of eye contact, rate of vocabulary development, quality of social relationships, theory of mind performance, and scores on the [[Empathy quotient|empathy quotient]] are all inversely correlated with prenatal testosterone levels. In contrast, he found that scores on the [[Embedded-figure test|embedded figures test]] (of attention to detail), on the [[Systemizing quotient|systemizing quotient]] (SQ), measures of narrow interests, and number of autistic traits are positively correlated with prenatal testosterone levels.<ref name="pmid21695109">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S, Lombardo MV, Auyeung B, Ashwin E, Chakrabarti B, Knickmeyer R | title = Why are autism spectrum conditions more prevalent in males? | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = e1001081 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21695109 | pmc = 3114757 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001081 }}</ref> Within this study his team conducted the first human neuroimaging studies of brain grey matter regional volumes and brain activity associated with prenatal testosterone.<ref name="pmid22238103">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lombardo MV, Ashwin E, Auyeung B, Chakrabarti B, Taylor K, Hackett G, Bullmore ET, Baron-Cohen S | title = Fetal testosterone influences sexually dimorphic gray matter in the human brain | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 674–80 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22238103 | pmc = 3306238 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4389-11.2012  }}</ref> Other clues for the theory came from Baron-Cohen's postnatal hormonal studies which found that autistic adults have elevated circulating [[androgen]]s in serum<ref name="pmid20877284">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz E, Guest PC, Rahmoune H, Wang L, Levin Y, Ingudomnukul E, Ruta L, Kent L, Spain M, Baron-Cohen S, Bahn S | title = Sex-specific serum biomarker patterns in adults with Asperger's syndrome | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 12 | pages = 1213–20 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 20877284 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2010.102 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and that the autistic brain in women is ‘masculinized’ in both [[Grey matter|grey]] and [[white matter]] brain volume.<ref name="pmid23935125">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lai MC, Lombardo MV, Suckling J, Ruigrok AN, Chakrabarti B, Ecker C, Deoni SC, Craig MC, Murphy DG, Bullmore ET, Baron-Cohen S | collaboration = MRC AIMS Consortium | title = Biological sex affects the neurobiology of autism | journal = Brain : A Journal of Neurology | volume = 136 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 2799–815 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23935125 | pmc = 3754459 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awt216 }}</ref> An independent animal model by Xu et al (2015, Physiology and Behavior, 138, 13-20) showed that elevated prenatal testosterone during pregnancy leads to reduced social interest in the offspring.

So, in 2015, he set up a collaboration with the Danish Biobank which has stored over 20 thousand [[amniotic fluid]] samples which he linked to later diagnosis of autism via the Danish Psychiatric Register. He tested the prenatal androgens and found that children later diagnosed as autistic were exposed to elevated levels of prenatal testosterone, and the Δ4 sex steroid precursors to prenatal testosterone.<ref name="Baron-Cohen_2015" /> In 2019 he tested the same cohort's levels of exposure to prenatal estrogens and again found these were elevated in pregnancies that resulted in autism.<ref name="Baron-Cohen 1–9"/> These novel studies provide evidence of the role of prenatal hormones, interacting with genetic predisposition, in the cause of autism.

=== Developmental social cognitive neuroscience ===
While a member of the Cognitive Development Unit (CDU) in London in 1985, to explain the social-communication deficits in autism, Baron-Cohen and his colleagues professors Frith and [[Alan M. Leslie|Alan Leslie]] formulated the "[[theory of mind]]" (ToM) hypothesis. ToM (also known as "[[Empathy|cognitive empathy]]") is the brain's partially innate mechanism for rapidly making sense of social behavior by effortlessly attributing mental states to others, enabling behavioral prediction and [[social communication]] skills.<ref name="SFARI">{{cite web |url= https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/classic-paper-reviews/2008/1985-paper-on-the-theory-of-mind-commentary-by-rebecca-saxe |title= 1985 paper on the theory of mind | vauthors = Saxe R |date= 9 May 2008 |access-date=28 December 2013 |publisher=[[Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative|SFARI]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229005056/https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/classic-paper-reviews/2008/1985-paper-on-the-theory-of-mind-commentary-by-rebecca-saxe |archive-date=29 December 2013 |df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Baron-Cohen_1985">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S, Leslie AM, Frith U | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = Cognition | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–46 | date = October 1985 | pmid = 2934210 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | author-link2 = Alan M.

===Reception===
{{Further|Empathizing–systemizing theory#Criticism}}
Baron-Cohen has faced criticism by some for his "empathizing-systemizing theory", which states that humans may be classified on the basis of their scores along two dimensions (empathizing and systemizing); and that females tend to score higher on the empathizing dimension and males tend to score higher on the systemizing dimension. Feminist scientists, including [[Cordelia Fine]], neuroscientist, [[Gina Rippon]], and [[Lise Eliot]] have opposed his [[extreme male brain]] theory of autism, calling it "neurotrash" and [[neurosexism]].<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Rippon G |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlBfDwAAQBAJ&q=The+Gendered+Brain:+The+new+neuroscience+that+shatters+the+myth+of+the+female+brain&pg=PT7|title=The Gendered Brain: The new neuroscience that shatters the myth of the female brain|date=2019-02-28|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4735-4897-8|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Guest_2019">{{cite news| vauthors = Guest K |date=2019-03-02|title=The Gendered Brain by Gina Rippon review – exposing a myth|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/02/the-gendered-brain-by-gina-rippon-review|access-date=2020-01-02|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=WOW 2014 {{!}} Fighting The Neurotrash|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RWvDTKbFHg|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Eliot L |date=2019-02-27|title=Neurosexism: the myth that men and women have different brains|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=566|issue=7745|pages=453–454|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00677-x|bibcode=2019Natur.566..453E|doi-access=free}}</ref> Rippon also argues against using "male" and "female" for describing different types of brains, and that brain types do not correspond to genders.<ref name="Guest_2019" /><ref name="Costandi_2019">{{cite web | vauthors = Costandi M |title=Simon Baron-Cohen: Theorizing on the mind in autism |url=https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/profiles/simon-baron-cohen-theorizing-on-the-mind-in-autism/ |website=Spectrum |access-date=11 May 2019 |date=9 May 2011}}</ref>

A book review published in ''Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences'' characterized ''The Essential Difference'' as "very disappointing" with a "superficial notion of intelligence", concluding that Baron-Cohen's major claims about mind-blindness and systemizing–empathizing are "at best, dubious".<ref name="Levy">{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy N |title=Book review: Understanding blindness |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=315–324 |doi=10.1023/B:PHEN.0000049328.20506.a1 |date=September 2004|s2cid=145491944 }}</ref> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, his views on systemising traits had "earned him the ire of some parents of autistic children, who complain that he underestimates their families' suffering".<ref name=Time/> ''Time'' said that while research from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] did not support the [[assortative mating]] theory, a survey finding that autism was twice as high in [[Eindhoven]]  had "breathed new life" into Baron-Cohen's theory.<ref name=Time/> ''Time'' magazine has also criticized the assortative mating theory proposed by Baron-Cohen, claiming that it is largely speculative and based on anecdotal evidence. The theory claims that autism rates are increasing because "systemizers", individuals with more autistic traits, are more likely to marry each other and are more likely to have autistic offspring due to relatively recent societal changes.<ref name="Assortative">{{cite news | vauthors = Melnick M |title=Could the Way We Mate and Marry Boost Rates of Autism?|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/08/19/could-the-way-we-mate-and-marry-boost-rates-of-autism/ |magazine=Time |access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref> James McGrath has criticized the [[autism-spectrum quotient]], writing that the score increases if one indicates interest in mathematics, and decreases if one indicates interest in literature or art. He claims that this leads to the false notion that most autistic people are strong in math.<ref name="Conversation">{{cite web | vauthors = McGrath J |title= Not all autistic people are good at maths and science – despite the stereotypes |url=https://theconversation.com/not-all-autistic-people-are-good-at-maths-and-science-despite-the-stereotypes-114128 |website=The Conversation |access-date=2 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

The developers of the software Baron-Cohen used for a 2009 study which reported that autistic individuals possessed superior [[visual acuity]] said that his results were impossible based on the technology used in the study. Baron-Cohen's team responded to this criticism by re-running the study and retracting the claim.<ref name="BachDakin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bach M, Dakin SC | title = Regarding "Eagle-eyed visual acuity: an experimental investigation of enhanced perception in autism" | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 10 | pages = e19-20; author reply e23-4 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19576570 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.035 | s2cid = 17647820 }}</ref><ref name="CloseEye">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bölte S, Schlitt S, Gapp V, Hainz D, Schirman S, Poustka F, Weber B, Freitag C, Ciaramidaro A, Walter H | display-authors = 6 | title = A close eye on the eagle-eyed visual acuity hypothesis of autism | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 726–33 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21660498 | pmc = 3324676 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-011-1300-3 }}</ref><ref name="Discover">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tavassoli T, Latham K, Bach M, Dakin SC, Baron-Cohen S | title = Psychophysical measures of visual acuity in autism spectrum conditions | journal = Vision Research | volume = 51 | issue = 15 | pages = 1778–80 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21704058 | pmc = 6345362 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2011.06.004 }} Discussed in {{cite news |title=Eagle-Eyed Autism?

Baron-Cohen's supposition that [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein]] displayed autistic traits has been met with scepticism by [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] psychiatrist Glenn Elliot, who writes that attempting to diagnose on the basis of biographical information as extremely unreliable, and that any behavior can have various causes.<ref name="HistoricalFigures">{{cite news | vauthors = Muir H |title=Einstein and Newton showed signs of autism |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3676-einstein-and-newton-showed-signs-of-autism/ |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |date=30 April 2003 |access-date=4 November 2017}}</ref>

Critics also say that because his work has focused on higher-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders, it requires independent replication with broader samples<ref name="Buchen">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buchen L | title = Scientists and autism: When geeks meet | journal = Nature | volume = 479 | issue = 7371 | pages = 25–7 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22051657 | doi = 10.1038/479025a | bibcode = 2011Natur.479...25B | doi-access = free }}</ref> and that his theories are based on subjective perceptions.<ref name="Costandi_2019"/> In response to some of these criticisms, Baron-Cohen agrees that many of his results have not been replicated, and says that he remains "open minded about these hypotheses until there are sufficient data to evaluate them". Still, he says he does not see a problem with introducing theories before definitive evidence has been collected.<ref name="Buchen" />
