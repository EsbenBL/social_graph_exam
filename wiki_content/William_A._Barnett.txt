'''William Arnold Barnett''' (born October 30, 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]], whose current work is in the fields of [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]], and [[nonlinear dynamics]] in socioeconomic contexts, [[econometric]] modeling of consumption and production, and the study of the [[aggregation problem]] and the challenges of [[measurement in economics]].

==Education==
Barnett received his B.S. degree in [[mechanical engineering]] from [[M.I.T.]], his [[M.B.A.]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

==Positions==
Barnett is currently the Oswald Distinguished Professor of [[Macroeconomics]] at the [[University of Kansas]] and Director of the [http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/amfm.php Center for Financial Stability], in New York City.  He is also a Fellow of the [http://ic2.utexas.edu/ IC² Institute] at the University of Texas at Austin and a Fellow of the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise]]. He is the founder and President of the [[Society for Economic Measurement]]. He is also the Director of the [http://icemr.ru/institute-for-nonlinear-dynamical-inference/ Institute for Nonlinear Dynamical Inference] at RUDN University in Moscow.

He was previously Research Economist at the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve|Board of Governors]] of the [[Federal Reserve]] System in [[Washington, D.C.]]; Stuart Centennial Professor of Economics at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin]]; and Professor of Economics at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]].  Prior to becoming an economist, he worked from 1963 to 1969, as an engineer at [[Rocketdyne]] division of  the [[Rockwell International Corporation]] on development of the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2 rocket]] engines during [[Apollo program]].

==Research==
His research is in [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]].  He is Founding President of the [[Society for Economic Measurement (SEM)|Society for Economic Measurement]], Founding Editor of the [[Cambridge University Press]] journal, [[Macroeconomic Dynamics]] and of the [[Emerald Group Publishing]] monograph series, ''International Symposia in Economic Theory and Econometrics'', and originator of the [[Divisia monetary aggregates]] and the "[[Barnett critique]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Empirical Evidence on the Recent Behavior and Usefulness of Simple-Sum and Weighted Measures of the Money Stock|last1 = Chrystal|first1 = Alec|date = 1994|journal = Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review|volume = 76|issue = 2|doi = 10.20955/r.76.73-109|last2 = MacDonald|first2 = Ronald|pages = 73–109|doi-access = free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Belongia|first1=Michael|last2=Ireland|first2=Peter|date=2014|title=The Barnett Critique After Three Decades: A New Keynesian Analysis|url=http://irelandp.com/pubs/barnett.pdf|journal=Journal of Econometrics|volume=5|issue=21|access-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref>

In consumer demand and production modelling, he originated the [[Laurent series]] approach to specification design and the [[seminonparametric]] approach using the [[Müntz–Szász theorem]].  His publications on bifurcation analysis and nonlinear dynamics have shown that robustness of dynamical inferences is compromised, when policy simulations are run only at point estimates of parameters, since confidence regions about those estimates are often crossed by bifurcation boundaries.

He is a Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], a Charter Fellow of the [[Journal of Econometrics]], a Charter Fellow of the [[Society for Economic Measurement (SEM)|Society for Economic Measurement]], a Fellow of the World Innovation Foundation, a Fellow of the IC² Institute, and a Fellow of the Johns Hopkins [[Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise]], and Honorary Professor at [[Henan University]] in Kaifeng, China.  He is ranked among the top 2% of the world's economists in [[RePEc]].

His book with Nobel Laureate, [[Paul A. Samuelson]], ''Inside the Economist's Mind: Conversations with Eminent Economists'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]] Publishing (2007), {{ISBN|1-4051-5917-0}}, has been translated into seven languages.  His ''MIT Press book'', ''Getting It Wrong: How Faulty Monetary Statistics Undermine the Fed, the Financial System, and the Economy'', {{ISBN|9780262516884}}, won the American Publishers Award for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (the [[PROSE Awards]]) for the best book published in economics during 2012.

During January 2017, he was interviewed in depth about his life's work by Apostolos Serletis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/research/Barnett_Interview.pdf|title=An Interview with William A.
