'''Environmental psychology''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that focuses on the transactions between individuals and their surroundings. It examines the way in which the natural environment and our built environments shape us as individuals. Environmental Psychology emphasises how humans change the environment and how the environment changes humans experiences and behaviors.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is environmental psychology? {{!}} APS|url=https://www.psychology.org.au/About-Us/What-we-do/advocacy/Advocacy-social-issues/Environment-climate-change-psychology/Psychology%E2%80%99s-role-in-environmental-issues/What-is-environmental-psychology|access-date=2021-07-30|website=www.psychology.org.au}}</ref> The field defines the term environment broadly, encompassing [[natural environment]]s, [[Social environment|social settings]], [[built environment]]s, learning environments, and informational environments.

Environmental psychology was not fully recognized as its own field until the late 1960s when scientists began to question the tie between human behavior and our natural and built environments. Since its conception, the field has been committed to the development of a discipline that is both [[value (personal and cultural)|value oriented]] and [[problem solving|problem oriented]], prioritizing research aimed at solving complex [[Environmental issue|environmental problems]] in the pursuit of individual [[Quality of life|well-being within a larger society]].<ref name=Proshansky87>Proshansky 1987</ref> When solving problems involving [[Environmental sociology|human-environment interaction]]s, whether global or local, one must have a model of human nature that predicts the environmental conditions under which humans will [[Human behavior|respond well]]. This model can help design, manage, protect and/or restore environments that enhance reasonable behavior, predict the likely outcomes when these conditions are not met, and diagnose problem situations. The field develops such a model of human nature while retaining a broad and inherently multidisciplinary focus. It explores such dissimilar issues as [[Common-pool resource|common property resource management]], [[wayfinding]] in complex settings, the effect of [[environmental stress]] on human performance, the characteristics of [[environmental restoration|restorative environment]]s, human [[information processing]], and the promotion of durable conservation behavior. Lately, alongside the increased focus on climate change in society and the social sciences and the re-emergence of limits-to-growth concerns, there has been increased focus on environmental sustainability issues within the field.<ref>DeYoung 2013</ref>

This multidisciplinary paradigm has not only characterized the dynamic for which environmental psychology is expected to develop, it has also been the catalyst in attracting other schools of knowledge in its pursuit, aside from research psychologists. [[Geographer]]s, [[economist]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[Politician|policy-makers]], [[sociologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, [[educator]]s, and product developers all have discovered and participated in this field.<ref name=Proshansky87 />

Although "environmental psychology" is arguably the best-known and most comprehensive description of the field, it is also known as human Factors science, cognitive [[ergonomics]], [[ecological psychology]], [[ecopsychology]], environment–behavior studies, and person–environment studies. Closely related fields include [[architectural psychology]], [[socio-architecture]], [[behavioral geography]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social ecology (academic field)|social ecology]], and [[environmental design]] research.

==History==
The origins of the field can be traced to the Romantic poets, such as Wordsworth and Coleridge who drew attention to the power of nature and the significance of human interaction with it. Darwin pointed to the role of the environment in shaping evolution. This idea was quickly applied to human interactions with the surroundings. An extreme Victorian acceptance of this were 'environmental determinists' who insisted the physical environment and climate influenced the evolution of racial characteristics. [[Willy Hellpach]] is said to be the first to mention "environmental psychology". One of his books, ''Geopsyche'', discusses topics such as how the sun and the moon affect human activity, the impact of extreme environments, and the effects of color and form (Pol, E., 2006, ''Blueprints for a history of environmental psychology (I): From first birth to American transition''. "Medio Ambiente y Comportamiento Humano", 7(2), 95-113). Among the other major scholars at the roots of environmental psychology were [[Jakob von Uexküll]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Egon Brunswik]], and later [[Gerhard Kaminski]] and [[Carl Friedrich Graumann]].<ref>Allesch 2003</ref>

The end of World War II brought about a demand for guidance on the urgent building programme after the destruction of war. To provide government planning requirements many countries set up research centres that studied how people used space. In the U.K. the Building Research Centre studied space use in houses and later noise levels, heating and lighting requirements. The glass maker Pilkingtons set up a daylight research unit, led by Thomas Markus to provide information on the influence of natural lighting in buildings and guidelines on daylight requirements. Peter Manning developed this further at the Pilkington Research Unit at the University of Liverpool in the 1960s. He studied offices, employing one of the first people to obtain a PhD in environmental psychology, Brian Wells. Markus went on to set up the Building Performance Research Unit at the University of Strathclyde in 1968 employing the psychologist David Canter who had been supervised by Wells and Manning for his PhD with the Pilkington Research Unit. Canter then went on to the University of Surrey to set up Environmental Psychology programme there in 1971 with the Department of Psychology. The head of that Department was Terence Lee who had conducted his PhD on the concept of neighbourhood under the supervision of Sir Frederick Bartlett at the University of Cambridge.

In parallel with these developments people in the US had begun to consider the issues in [[environmental design]]. One of the first areas was the consideration of psychiatric hospitals. Psychiatrists worked with architects to take account of the experience of patients who were mentally ill.  Robert Sommer wrote his book on 'Personal Space' and Edward T Hall commented as an anthropologist on how people related to each other spatially. Amos Rapoport caused considerable interest amongst architects with his book 'House Form and Culture', showing that the form of buildings was not solely functional but had all sorts of cultural influences. This contributed to the emergence in [[architecture]] of 'post-modernism' which took the symbolic qualities of architecture very seriously. These early developments in the 1960s and 1970s were often seen as part of 'architectural psychology'. It was when Harold Proshansky and William Ittelson set up the Environmental Psychology program at the City University of New York on 42nd St New York that the term Environmental Psychology replaces Architectural Psychology as the widely used term for the study of the ways in which people made sense of and interacted with their surroundings. This was institutionalised when Canter established The Journal of Environmental Psychology in 1980 with Kenneth Craik a personality psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley. President Nixon's campaign to deal with depredations of the environment gave impetus to a change of direction in the field from aspects of buildings and making sense of cities to the broader issues of climate change and the impact of people in the global environment.

==Orientations==
{{clarify|this section needs an introductory paragraph, providing an overview of the various orientations to environmental psychology; the same type of suggestion applies to the next two sections, as well|date=July 2014}}

===Problem oriented===
Environmental psychology is a direct study of the relationship between an environment and how that environment affects its inhabitants. Specific aspects of this field work by identifying a problem and through the identification of said problem, discovering a solution. Therefore, it is necessary for environmental psychology to be problem oriented.

One important aspect of a problem-oriented field is that by identifying problems, solutions arise from the research acquired. The solutions can aid in making society function better as a whole and create a wealth of knowledge about the inner workings of societies. Environmental psychologist Harold Proshansky discusses how the field is also "value oriented" because of the field's commitment to bettering society through problem identification.<ref name="ReferenceA">Proshansky 1987, p.1477</ref> Panyang discusses the importance of not only understanding the problem but also the necessity of a solution. Proshansky also points out some of the problems of a problem-oriented approach for environmental psychology. First the problems being identified must be studied under certain specifications: it must be ongoing and occurring in real life, not in a laboratory. Second, the notions about the problems must derive directly from the source – meaning they must come directly from the specific environment where the problem is occurring.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The solutions and understanding of the problems cannot come from an environment that has been constructed and modeled to look like real life. Environmental psychology needs to reflect the actual society not a society built in a laboratory setting. The difficult task of the environmental psychologist is to study problems as they are occurring in everyday life.<ref name=Proshansky1478>Proshansky 1987, p.1478</ref> It is hard to reject all laboratory research because laboratory experiments are where theories may be tested without damaging the actual environment or can serve as models when testing solutions. Proshansky makes this point as well, discussing the difficulty in the overall problem oriented approach. He states that it is important, however, for the environmental psychologist to utilize all aspects of research and analysis of the findings and to take into account both the general and individualized aspects of the problems.<ref name=Proshansky1479>Proshansky 1987, p.1479</ref>

Environmental psychology addresses environmental problems such as density and crowding, [[noise pollution]], [[Poverty|sub-standard living]], and [[urban decay]].<ref name=ReferenceA /> Noise increases environmental stress. Although it has been found that control and predictability are the greatest factors in stressful effects of noise; context, pitch, source and habituation are also important variables [3]. Environmental psychologists have theorized that density and crowding can also have an adverse effect on mood and may cause [[stress-related illness]] or behavior.<ref>Ziafati Bafarasat, A. (2017) [https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000390 Invisible Travels in the Compact City: Is Density the Way Forward?], Journal of Urban Planning and Development, 143(3)</ref> To understand and solve environmental problems, environmental psychologists believe concepts and principles should come directly from the physical settings and problems being looked at.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> For example, factors that reduce feelings of crowding within buildings include:

* Windows – particularly ones that can be opened and ones that provide a view as well as light
* High ceilings
* Doors to divide spaces (Baum and Davies){{full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and provide access control
* Room shape – square rooms feel less crowded than rectangular ones (Dresor){{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* Using partitions to create smaller, personalized spaces within an open plan office or larger work space.
* Providing increases in cognitive control over aspects of the internal environment, such as ventilation, light, privacy, etc.
* Conducting a cognitive appraisal of an environment and feelings of crowding in different settings. For example, one might be comfortable with crowding at a concert but not in school corridors.
* Creating a defensible space (Calhoun){{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

====Personal space and territory====
Having an area of personal territory in a public space, e.g., at the office, is a key feature of many architectural designs. Having such a 'defensible space' can reduce the negative effects of crowding in urban environments. The term, coined by [[John B. Calhoun]] in 1947, is the result of multiple environmental experiments conducted on rats. Originally beginning as an experiment to measure how many rats could be accommodated in a given space, it expanded into determining how rats, given the proper food, shelter and bedding would behave under a [[Confined environment psychology|confined environment]].

Under these circumstances, the males became aggressive, some exclusively homosexual. Others became pansexual and hypersexual, seeking every chance to mount any rat they encountered. As a result, mating behaviors were upset with an increase in infant mortalities. With parents failing to provide proper nests, thoughtlessly ditching their young and even attacking them, infant mortality rose as high as 96% in certain sections. Calhoun published the results as "Population Density and Social Pathology" in a 1962 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Calhoun | first=John B. | date=February 1, 1962 | title=Population density and social pathology | magazine=[[Scientific American]] | volume=206 | issue=2 | pages=139–148 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/population-density-and-social-patho/ | access-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref>

Creating barriers and customizing the space are ways of creating personal space, e.g., using pictures of one's family in an office setting. This increases cognitive control as one sees oneself as having control over the competitors to the personal space and therefore able to control the level of density and crowding in the space.

===Systems oriented===
The systems oriented approach to experimenting is applied to individuals or people that are a part of communities, groups, and organizations. This approach particularly examines group interaction, as opposed to an individual's interaction and it emphasizes on factors of social integration. In the laboratory, experiments focus on cause and effect processes within human nature.<ref name=Proshansky1481>Proshansky 1987, p.1481</ref>

===Interdisciplinary oriented===
Environmental psychology relies on interaction with other disciplines in order to approach problems with multiple perspectives. The first discipline is the category of behavioral sciences, which include: sociology, political science, anthropology, and economics. Environmental psychology also interacts with the interspecializations of the field of psychology, which include: [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]], psychobiology, [[psychoanalysis]],<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | author-link=John Shannon Hendrix | date=April 12, 2013 | title=Architecture and dream construction | journal=Center | volume=17 | issue=Space & Psyche | publisher=Center for American Architecture & Design | isbn=978-0-934951-17-3}}</ref> and social neuroscience. In addition to the more scientific fields of study, environmental psychology also works with the design field which includes: the studies of architecture, interior design, urban planning, industrial and object design, landscape architecture, and preservation.<ref name=Proshansky1482>Proshansky 1987, p.1482</ref>

===Space-over-time orientation===
Space over time orientation highlights the importance of the past. Examining problems with the past in mind creates a better understanding of how past forces, such as social, political, and economic forces, may be of relevance to present and future problems.<ref>Rivlin 1990, p.175</ref> Time and place are also important to consider. It's important to look at time over extended periods. Physical settings change over time; they change with respect to physical properties and they change because individuals using the space change over time.<ref name=Proshansky1485>Proshansky 1987, p.1485</ref> Looking at these spaces over time will help monitor the changes and possibly predict future problems.

There are a variety of tests that can be administered to children in order to determine their temperament. Temperament is split up into three types: "easy", "difficult", and "slow-to-warm-up". Alexander Thomas, Stella Chess, Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn created an infant temperament test in the 1950s and rated them using nine temperament criteria.<ref>Thomas, Chess & Birch, 1968</ref> By finding out a child's temperament at birth, it enables us to know what to expect as the child progresses into adulthood.

==Concepts==

=== Nature restoration ===
From early studies showing that patients with a view of nature from their hospital recovered faster than patients with a window view of a brick wall,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=Roger S.|date=1984-04-27|title=View Through a Window May Influence Recovery from Surgery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.6143402|journal=Science|volume=224|issue=4647|pages=420–421|doi=10.1126/science.6143402|issn=0036-8075}}</ref> how, why, and to which extent nature has mental and physical restorative properties has been a central branch of the field. Although the positive effects of nature have been established, the theoretical underpinning of why it is restorative is still discussed. The most cited theory is the [[Attention restoration theory|Attention Restoration Theory]], which claims nature is a “soft fascination” which restores the ability to direct attention. Secondly, Stress reduction theory<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=Roger S.|last2=Simons|first2=Robert F.|last3=Losito|first3=Barbara D.|last4=Fiorito|first4=Evelyn|last5=Miles|first5=Mark A.|last6=Zelson|first6=Michael|date=September 1991|title=Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0272-4944(05)80184-7|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=201–230|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(05)80184-7|issn=0272-4944}}</ref> claims that because humans have evolved in nature, this type of environment is relaxing, and more adjusted to the senses. Newer theoretical work includes the Conditioned Restoration Theory,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egner|first=Lars Even|last2=Sütterlin|first2=Stefan|last3=Calogiuri|first3=Giovanna|date=2020-09-17|title=Proposing a Framework for the Restorative Effects of Nature through Conditioning: Conditioned Restoration Theory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186792|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=17|issue=18|pages=6792|doi=10.3390/ijerph17186792|issn=1660-4601}}</ref> which suggests a two-step process. The first step involves associating nature with relaxation, and the second step involves retrieving the same relaxation when presented with an associated stimulus.

===Place identity===
{{Main|Place identity}}

For many years Harold Proshansky and his colleagues at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, explored the concept of place identity. Place identity has been traditionally defined as a 'sub-structure of the self-identity of the person consisting of broadly conceived cognitions about the physical world in which the individual lives'.<ref name=Proshanskyet59>Proshansky et al. 1983, p.59</ref> These cognitions define the daily experiences of every human being. Through one's attitudes, feelings, ideas, memories, personal values and preferences toward the range and type of physical settings, they can then understand the environment they live in and their overall experience.

As a person interacts with various places and spaces, they are able to evaluate which properties in different environments fulfill his/her various needs. When a place contains components that satisfy a person biologically, socially, psychologically and/or culturally, it creates the environmental past of a person. Through 'good' or 'bad' experiences with a place, a person is then able to reflect and define their personal values, attitudes, feelings and beliefs about the physical world.

Place identity has been described as the individual's incorporation of place into the larger concept of self; a "potpourri of memories, conceptions, interpretations, ideas, and related feelings about specific physical settings, as well as types of settings".<ref name=Proshanskyet>Proshansky et al. 1983</ref>
Other theorists have been instrumental in the creation of the idea of place identity. Three humanistic geographers, Tuan (1980), Relph (1976) and Buttimer (1980),{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}} share a couple of basic assumptions. As a person lives and creates memories within a place, attachment is built and it is through one's personal connection to a place, that they gain a sense of belonging and purpose, which then gives significance and meaning to their life.

Five central functions of place-identity have been depicted: recognition, meaning, expressive-requirement, mediating change, and anxiety and defense function. Place identity becomes a cognitive "database" against which every physical setting is experienced.<ref name=Proshanskyet /> The activities of a person often overlap with physical settings, which then create a background for the rest of life's interactions and events. The individual is frequently unaware of the array of feelings, values or memories of a singular place and simply becomes more comfortable or uncomfortable with certain broad kinds of physical settings, or prefers specific spaces to others. In the time since the term "place identity" was introduced, the theory has been the model for identity that has dominated environmental psychology.

===Place attachment===
{{Main|Place attachment}}

Many different perceptions of the bond between people and places have been hypothesized and studied. The most widespread terms include place attachment<ref>Low & Altman 1992, Williams et al. 1992</ref> and [[sense of place]].<ref>Cantrill 1998; Hay 1998; Shamai 1991; Steele 1981; Williams & Stewart 1998</ref> One consistent thread woven throughout most recent research on place attachment deals with the importance of the amount of time spent at a certain place (the length of association with a place). While both researchers and writers<ref>Low & Altman 1992; Moore & Graefe 1994; Relph 1976; Tuan 1977</ref> have made the case that time and experience in a place are important for deepening the meanings and emotional ties central to the person-place relationship, little in-depth research has studied these factors and their role in forging this connection.<ref>Smaldone 2006</ref>

Place attachment is defined as one's emotional or affective ties to a place, and is generally thought to be the result of a long-term connection with a certain environment.<ref>Low & Altman 1992</ref> This is different from a simple aesthetic response such as saying a certain place is special because it is beautiful. For example, one can have an emotional response to a beautiful (or ugly) landscape or place, but this response may sometimes be shallow and fleeting. This distinction is one that Schroeder labeled "meaning versus preference". According to Schroeder the definition of "meaning" is "the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape"; whereas "preference" is "the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another".<ref>Schroeder 1991, p. 232</ref> For a deeper and lasting emotional attachment to develop (Or in Schroeder's terms, for it to have meaning) an enduring relationship with a place is usually a critical factor.<ref>Smaldone, 2007</ref> Chigbu carried out a rural study of place-attachment using a qualitative approach to check its impact on a community, Uturu (in Nigeria), and found that it has direct relationship to level of community development.<ref>Chigbu 2013</ref>

===Environmental consciousness===
[[Leanne Rivlin]] theorized that one way to examine an individual's environmental consciousness is to recognize how the physical place is significant, and look at the people/place relationship.

Environmental cognition (involved in human cognition) plays a crucial role in environmental perception.
All different areas of the brain engage with environmentally relevant information. Some believe that the orbitofrontal cortex integrates environmentally relevant information from many distributed areas of the brain. Due to its anterior location within the frontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex may make judgments about the environment, and refine the organism's "understanding" through error analysis, and other processes specific to prefrontal cortex. But to be certain, there is no single brain area dedicated to the organism's interactions with its environment. Rather, all brain areas are dedicated to this task. One area (probably the orbitofrontal cortex) may collate the various pieces of the informational puzzle in order to develop a long term strategy of engagement with the ever-changing "environment". Moreover, the orbitofrontal cortex may show the greatest change in blood oxygenation (BOLD level) when an organism thinks of the broad, and amorphous category referred to as "the environment".<ref>{{cite web|title=Orbitofrontal Cortex|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/organ/orbitofrontal_cortex.htm|publisher=wrongdiagnosis.com|access-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> Research in this area is showing an increase in climate change related emotional experiences that are seen to be inherently adaptive. Engagement with these emotional experiences leads to a greater sense of connection with others and increased capacity to tolerate and reflect on emotions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kieft|first1=J.|last2=Bendell|first2=J|year=2021|title=The responsibility of communicating difficult truths about climate influenced societal disruption and collapse: an introduction to psychological research

Because of the recent concern with the environment, environmental consciousness or awareness has come to be related to the growth and development of understanding and consciousness toward the biophysical environment and its problems.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Behavior settings===
The earliest noteworthy discoveries in the field of environmental psychology can be dated back to [[Roger Barker]] who created the field of ecological psychology. Founding his research station in Oskaloosa, Kansas in 1947, his field observations expanded into the theory that social settings influence behavior. Empirical data gathered in Oskaloosa from 1947 to 1972 helped him develop the concept of the "behavior setting" to help explain the relationship between the individual and the immediate environment. This was further explored in his work with Paul Gump in the book ''Big School, Small School: High School Size and Student Behavior''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} One of the first insightful explanations on why groups tend to be less satisfying for their members as they increase in size, their studies illustrated that large schools had a similar number of behavior settings to that of small schools. This resulted in the students' ability to presume many different roles in small schools (e.g. be in the school band and the school football team) but in larger schools there was a propensity to deliberate over their social choices.

In his book ''Ecological Psychology'' (1968) Barker stresses the importance of the town's behavior and environment as the residents' most ordinary instrument of describing their environment. "The hybrid, eco-behavioral character of behavior settings appear to present Midwest's inhabitants with no difficulty; nouns that combine milieu and standing behavior are common, e.g. oyster supper, basketball game, turkey dinner, golden gavel ceremony, cake walk, back surgery, gift exchange, livestock auction, auto repair."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barker |first1=Roger G.|title=Ecological Psychology: Concepts and Methods for Studying the Environment of Human Behavior|date=1968|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford |isbn=9780804706582|page=[https://archive.org/details/ecologicalpsycho0000bark/page/94 94]|url=https://archive.org/details/ecologicalpsycho0000bark |url-access=registration |access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>

Barker argued that his students should implement T-methods (psychologist as 'transducer': i.e. methods in which they studied man in his 'natural environment') rather than O-methods (psychologist as "operators" i.e. experimental methods). Basically, Barker preferred fieldwork and direct observation rather than controlled experiments. Some of the minute-by-minute observations of Kansan children from morning to night, jotted down by young and maternal graduate students, may be the most intimate and poignant documents in social science. Barker spent his career expanding on what he called ecological psychology, identifying these behavior settings, and publishing accounts such as ''One Boy's Day'' (1952) and ''Midwest and Its Children'' (1955).{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Natural environment research findings ==
Environmental psychology research has observed various concepts relating to humans innate connection to natural environments which begins in early childhood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whitburn|first=Julie|date=2020|title=Children's environmental psychology, behaviour and education and wellbeing: The role of connection to nature|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/8899|language=en-NZ}}</ref> One study shows that fostering children's connectedness to nature will in turn create habitual pro-ecological behaviors in time. Connectedness to nature has show to be a huge contributor in predicting peoples general pro-ecological and pro-social behaviors. Connectedness to nature has also shown to benefit well-being, happiness, and general satisfaction. "Nature-deficit disorder" has recently been coined to explain lack of connectedness to nature due to lack of consciousness identification and nature disconnect.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barrera-Hernández|first1=Laura Fernanda|last2=Sotelo-Castillo|first2=Mirsha Alicia|last3=Echeverría-Castro|first3=Sonia Beatriz|last4=Tapia-Fonllem|first4=César Octavio|date=2020|title=Connectedness to Nature: Its Impact on Sustainable Behaviors and Happiness in Children|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=11|page=276|language=English|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00276|pmid=32174866|issn=1664-1078|pmc=7054437|doi-access=free}}</ref> Further research is required to make definitive claims about the effects of connectedness to nature.

==Applications==

===Impact on the built environment===
Environmental psychologists rejected the laboratory-experimental paradigm because of its simplification and skewed view of the cause-and-effect relationships of human's behaviors and experiences. Environmental psychologists examine how one or more parameters produce an effect while other measures are controlled. It is impossible to manipulate real-world settings in a laboratory.<ref name=Proshansky87>Proshansky 1987</ref>

Environmental psychology is oriented towards influencing the work of design professionals (architects, engineers, interior designers, urban planners, etc.) and thereby improving the human environment.

On a civic scale, efforts towards improving pedestrian landscapes have paid off, to some extent, from the involvement of figures like [[Jane Jacobs]] and [[Copenhagen]]'s [[Jan Gehl]]. One prime figure here is the late writer and researcher [[William H. Whyte]]. His still-refreshing and perceptive "City", based on his accumulated observations of skilled Manhattan pedestrians, provides steps and patterns of use in urban plazas.

The role and impact of architecture on human behavior is debated within the architectural profession. Views range from: supposing that people will adapt to new architectures and city forms; believing that architects cannot predict the impact of buildings on humans and therefore should base decisions on other factors; to those who undertake detailed precedent studies of local building types and how they are used by that society.

Environmental psychology has conquered the whole architectural genre which is concerned with retail stores and any other commercial venues that have the power to manipulate the mood and behavior of customers (e.g. stadiums, casinos, malls, and now airports). From [[Philip Kotler]]'s landmark paper on Atmospherics and [[Alan Hirsch (neurologist)|Alan Hirsch]]'s "Effects of Ambient Odors on Slot-Machine Usage in a Las Vegas Casino", through the creation and management of the [[Gruen transfer]], retail relies heavily on psychology, original research, focus groups, and direct observation. One of William Whyte's students, [[Paco Underhill]], makes a living as a "shopping anthropologist". Most of this advanced research remains a trade secret and proprietary.

Environmental psychology is consulted thoroughly when discussing future city design. Eco-cities and eco-towns have been studied to determine the societal benefits of creating more sustainable and ecological designs. Eco-cities allow for humans to live in synch with nature and develop sustainable living techniques. The development of eco-cities require knowledge in the interactions between "environmental, economic, political, and socio-cultural factors based on ecological principles".<ref name="thesmartcityjournal.com">{{Cite web|title=Eco-innovations in Designing Eco-cities and Eco-towns|url=https://www.thesmartcityjournal.com/en/articles/eco-innovations-eco-cities-eco-towns|access-date=2021-07-30|website=The Smart City Journal|language=en-gb}}</ref>

===Organizations===

* [[Project for Public Spaces]] (PPS) is a nonprofit organization that works to improve public spaces, particularly parks, civic centers, public markets, downtowns, and campuses. The staff of PPS is made up of individuals trained in environmental design, architecture, urban planning, urban geography, urban design, environmental psychology, landscape architecture, arts administration and information management. The organization has collaborated with many major institutions to improve the appearance and functionality of public spaces throughout the United States. In 2005, PPS co-founded The New York City Streets Renaissance, a campaign that worked to develop a new campaign model for transportation reform. This initiative implemented the transformation of excess sidewalk space in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District of Manhattan]] into public space.

==Challenges==
The field saw significant research findings and a fair surge of interest in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has seen challenges of nomenclature, obtaining objective and repeatable results, scope, and the fact that some research rests on underlying assumptions about human perception, which is not fully understood. Being an interdisciplinary field is difficult because it lacks a solid definition and purpose. It is hard for the field to fit into organizational structures.<ref name=Proshansky1476>Proshansky 1987, p.1476</ref> In the words of Guido Francescato, speaking in 2000, environmental psychology encompasses a "somewhat bewildering array of disparate methodologies, conceptual orientations, and interpretations... making it difficult to delineate, with any degree of precision, just what the field is all about and what might it contribute to the construction of society and the unfolding of history."

A grand challenge in the field of environmental psychology today is to understand the impact of human behavior on the climate and climate change. Understanding why some people engage in pro-environment behaviors can help predict the necessary requirements to engage others in making sustainable change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sörqvist|first=Patrik|date=2016|title=Grand Challenges in Environmental Psychology|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=7|page=583|language=English|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00583|pmid=27199818|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4843758|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Environmental psychology has not received nearly enough supporters to be considered an interdisciplinary field within psychology. Harold M. Proshanksy was one of the founders of environmental psychology and was quoted as saying "As I look at the field of environmental psychology today, I am concerned about its future. It has not, since its emergence in the early 1960s grown to the point where it can match the fields of social, personality, learning or cognitive psychology. To be sure, it has increased in membership, in the number of journals devoted to it, and even in the amount of professional organizational support it enjoys, but not enough so that one could look at any major university and find it to be a field of specialization in a department of psychology, or, more importantly, in an interdisciplinary center or institute".<ref>Proshansky 1995 Sammy Sum</ref>

== University courses ==
* [[University of Victoria]] offers general and advanced undergraduate courses in environmental psychology, and graduate courses in Psychology and Nature, as well as Environmental Psychology of the Built Environment. The psychology graduate department also offers individualized masters and PhD programs in Environmental Psychology under the supervision of Dr. [[Robert Gifford (psychologist)|Robert Gifford]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Individualized programs |url=https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/graduate/individualized/index.php |website=University of Victoria's Psychology Department |access-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref>
* [[Antioch University New England]] Graduate School offers graduate programs involving environmental education through a planning approach. With environmental psychology being such a diverse field with many different approaches, students have a variety of programs to choose from.
* [[Arizona State University]] offers a master's in Environmental Resources, which takes more of a planning approach to the field.
* The Environmental Psychology Ph.D program at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]] takes a multidisciplinary approach to examining and changing "the serious problems associated with the urban environment with a view towards affecting public policy" using social science theory and research methods. The GC-CUNY was the first academic institution in the U.S. to grant a PhD in Environmental Psychology. As discussed in detail on the program website, "recent research has addressed the experiences of recently housed homeless people, the privatization of public space, socio-spatial conflicts, children's safety in the public environment, relocation, community based approaches to housing, the design of specialized environments such as museums, zoos, gardens and hospitals, the changing relationships between home, family and work, the environmental experiences of gay men and lesbians, and access to parks and other urban 'green spaces'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enviropsych.org|title=Environmental Psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center|access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref> See also The Center for Human Environments.
* [[Cornell University]]'s department of Design and Environmental Analysis offers undergraduate and graduate (Master of Science in Human Environment Relations, Master of Arts in Design, and Ph.D in Human Behavior and Design) studies in environmental psychology, interior design, sustainable design studies, human factors and ergonomics, and facility planning and management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/che/DEA/index.cfm|title=Design and Environmental Analysis|access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref>
* [[Drexel University]] offers a Master of Science degree in Design Research. Of two degree paths, the Environmental Design and Health path includes study with community practitioners and researchers in design and related fields, including health, community design, and public policy. Research typically includes data collection and engaged research practices of design thinking and participatory design. This area of investigation has potential to create innovative health and educational partnerships, economic opportunities and neighborhood initiatives and relates to the strategic mission of the university to be highly engaged in civic sustainability.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://drexel.edu/westphal/academics/graduate/DSRE/Curriculum/|title=Curriculum - Westphal College of Media Arts & Design|newspaper=Westphal College of Media Arts & Design|access-date=2016-11-08}}</ref>
* [[Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences]] offers a Master in Environmental psychology. The focus is on how people are affected by both physical and virtual environments, as well as how people affect nature. The program offers courses on environmental behaviour, environment and neuroscience, human factors, virtual environments and cognitive design, change management and greening organizations and architecture and estetics. 
* The [[Ohio State University]] City & Regional Planning Program, in the School of Architecture, offers a specialization in environmental psychology (urban design/physical planning and behavior) at both the master's and PhD level. Dissertations have examined such topics as environmental aesthetics, spatial cognition, ethnic enclaves, neighborhood decline, neighborhood satisfaction, restorative and livable places, and behavior change.
* [[Prescott College]] offers a master's program that incorporates a number of the foundations of environmental psychology as well. The sub-fields in which the program provides includes environmental education, environmental studies, ecology, botany, resource policy, and planning. Another description about the program is as follows: "(The program) Includes instruction in contextual theory; statistics; physiological, social, and psychological responses to natural and technological hazards and disease; environmental perception and cognition; loneliness and stress; and psychological aspects of environmental design and planning."{{cite quote|date=July 2014}}
* [[University of California, Irvine]] offers a doctoral specialization in Design & Behavior Research within the Department of Planning, Policy, and Design in the [[School of Social Ecology]], and undergraduate coursework in Environmental Psychology offered jointly by the Departments of Psychology and Social Behavior, Planning, Policy, and Design, and the Program in Public Health.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eee.uci.edu/11s/54150/index.html|title=Welcome to Environmental Psychology|access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref>
* The [[University of Michigan]] offers Master of Science and Master of Arts degrees in its new [http://www.seas.umich.edu/ School for Sustainability and Environment (SEAS)]. The focus is on how people affect and are affected by environments, and includes a pragmatic approach to promoting environmental stewardship behavior, as well as a focus on how "nearby nature" affects people's mental vitality, physical health and well-being. An emerging theme is helping people to remain optimistic while learning to respond well to increasingly difficult biophysical circumstances.
* Another strain of environmental psychology developed out of [[ergonomics]] in the 1960s. The beginning of this movement can be traced back to [[David Canter]]'s work and the founding of the "Performance Research Unit" at the [[University of Strathclyde]] in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1966, which expanded traditional ergonomics to study broader issues relating to the environment and the extent to which human beings were "situated" within it (cf situated cognition). Canter led the field in the UK for years and was the editor of the ''Journal of Environmental Psychology'' for over 20 years, but has recently turned his attention to criminology.
* The [[University of Surrey]] was the first institution that offered an architectural psychology course in the UK starting in 1973. Since then, there have been over 250 graduates from over 25 countries. The [https://www.surrey.ac.uk/environmental-psychology-research-group/research/ Environmental Psychology Research Group]  (EPRG) within the University of Surrey, of which students on the M.Sc in Environmental Psychology are automatically members, has been undertaking research for more than thirty years. EPRG's mission is to gain a better understanding of the environmental and psychological effects of space, no matter the size, with help from social sciences, psychology, and methodologies. There are four categories under which the research projects fall: sustainable development, environmental risk, architectural assessment and environmental design, and environmental education and interpretation. Other universities in the UK now offer courses on the subject, which is an expanding field.
