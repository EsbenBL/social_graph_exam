==Early life==
Christakis' parents are Greek. They had three biological children and then adopted two others, an African-American girl and a Chinese boy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://thepenngazette.com/good-by-design/|title=Good By Design|date=19 April 2019|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> His father was a nuclear physicist turned business consultant and his mother a physical chemist turned psychologist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nicholas-christakis-the-yale-professor-who-stood-up-to-the-mob-pzqqpx3zt|title=Nicholas Christakis — the Yale professor who stood up to the mob|last=Billen|first=Andrew|date=2019-04-03|work=The Times|access-date=2019-05-13|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> He was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1962 when both his parents were [[Yale University]] graduate students. His family returned to Greece when he was three, and [[Greek language|Greek]] became his first language. He returned to the United States with his family at age six and grew up in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/3943-nicholas-christakis|title=Nature, nurture, or network?|website=yalealumnimagazine.com|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>  He graduated from [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)]].<ref name=":1" />

==Education==
Christakis obtained a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in biology from [[Yale University]] in 1984, where he won the [[Russell Henry Chittenden]] Prize. He received an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree from [[Harvard Medical School]] and an [[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] degree from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] in 1989, winning the [[Bowdoin Prize]] on graduation.

In 1991, Christakis completed a residency in Internal Medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]]. He was certified by the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] in 1993. He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in sociology from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1995. While at the University of Pennsylvania as a [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar]], he studied with [[Renee C. Fox]], a distinguished American medical sociologist; other members of his dissertation committee were methodologist Paul Allison and physician Sankey Williams. His dissertation was published as ''Death Foretold'', his first book.<ref name="query.nytimes.com">Gina Kolata, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/28/health/conversation-with-nicholas-christakis-doctor-with-cause-what-s-my-prognosis.html "A Conversation with: Nicholas Christakis; A Doctor with a Cause: 'What's My Prognosis?{{'"}}, ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 28, 2000.</ref> 

==Career==
In 1995, Christakis started as an Assistant Professor with joint appointments in the Departments of Sociology and of Medicine at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 2001, he was awarded tenure in both Sociology and Medicine. He left the University of Chicago to take up a position at Harvard in 2001. Until July 2013, he was a Professor of Medical Sociology in the Department of Health Care Policy and a Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]]; a Professor of Sociology in the Department of Sociology in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]; and an Attending Physician at the Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/christakis.html |title=Nicholas A. Christakis |publisher=Edge |access-date=2015-11-10}}</ref>

In 2013, Christakis moved to Yale University, where he is a Professor of Social and Natural Science in the Department of Sociology, with additional appointments in the Departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Statistics and Data Science; Biomedical Engineering; Medicine; and in the School of Management.  He served as the Sol Goldman Family Professor of Social and Natural Science until 2018, when he was appointed as a [[Sterling Professor]], the highest honor bestowed on Yale faculty.

From 2009 to 2013, Christakis and his wife, [[Erika Christakis]], were Co-Masters of [[Pforzheimer House]], one of [[Harvard]]'s twelve [[Harvard College#House system residential houses|residential houses]].<ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=526535 Bita M. Asad and Ahmed Mabruk, "Christakises To Be Pfoho House Masters," ''The Harvard Crimson,'' February 17, 2009.]</ref> From 2015 to 2016, he served in a similar capacity at [[Silliman College]] at Yale University.<ref>[http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/02/27/christakis-will-be-new-silliman-master/ Emma Platoff and Victor Wang, "Christakis named Silliman master," ''Yale News'', February 27, 2015.]</ref>

===Research===
Christakis uses quantitative methods (e.g., mathematical models, statistical analyses, and experiments). His work focuses on [[network science]] and [[sociobiology|biosocial science]], and it has also involved [[evolutionary biology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[behavior genetics]], [[epidemiology]], [[demography]], and [[sociology]]. He is an author or editor of six books, more than 200 peer-reviewed academic articles, numerous editorials in national and international publications, and at least three patents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5655084A/en|title=Radiological image interpretation apparatus and method}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8713143B2/en|title=Establishing a social network}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080183454A1|title=Disease diagnoses-based disease prediction}}</ref> His laboratory is also active in the development and release of software to conduct experiments and other studies (e.g., Breadboard, Trellis).

The 2017 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] paper on bots<ref name=":2" /> initiated a program of work on "hybrid systems" composed of humans and machines (endowed with AI) that reshape how humans interact not with the machines, but with each other.

In Boston, from 2002 to 2006, Christakis worked as an attending physician on the Palliative Medicine Consult Service at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. In 2006, he moved to [[Mount Auburn Hospital]]. In 2013, he moved to the Department of Medicine at Yale University.

==Writings==
Christakis' first book, ''Death Foretold: Prophecy and Prognosis in Medical Care'', was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1999, and has been translated into Japanese.<ref name="query.nytimes.com" /> The book, based on his disseration, explored the role of prognosis in medical thought and practice, documenting and explaining how physicians are socialized to avoid making prognoses. It argues that the prognoses patients receive, even from the best-trained American doctors, are driven not only by professional norms but also by religious, moral, and even quasi-magical beliefs (such as the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]"). 

His second book, ''Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives'', was co-authored with James Fowler and was published by Little, Brown in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedthebook.com/ |title=Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks |publisher=Connectedthebook.com |access-date=2015-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316036146.htm |title=Connected |publisher=Hachette Book Group |date=2009-09-28 |access-date=2015-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002052636/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316036146.htm |archive-date=2012-10-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was awarded the "Books for a Better Life" Award in 2009 and has been translated into 20 languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookreporter.com/features/awards/books-for-a-better-life-awards-2009|title=Books for a Better Life Awards 2009 {{!}} Bookreporter.com|website=www.bookreporter.com|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> ''Connected'' draws on previously published and unpublished studies and makes several new conclusions about the influence of social networks on human health and behavior. In ''Connected'', Christakis and Fowler put forward their "[[three degrees of influence]]" rule, which theorizes that each person's social influence can stretch to roughly three degrees of separation (to the friend of a friend of a friend) before it fades out.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/magazine/13contagion-t.html?pagewanted=4&_r=1&em Clive Tomson, "Is Happiness Catching,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 14, 2009.</ref><ref name="SIM">{{cite journal|last1=Christakis|first1=Nicholas A.|year=2012|title=Social contagion theory: examining dynamic social networks and human behavior|journal=Statistics in Medicine|volume=32|issue=4|pages=556–577|doi=10.1002/sim.5408|pmid=22711416|pmc=3830455|arxiv=1109.5235}}</ref>

==Free speech advocacy==
While both at [[Harvard University]] and at [[Yale University]], Christakis was involved in the defense of free expression.

At Harvard, in 2012, he and his wife, [[Erika Christakis]], came to the defense of minority students who were using satire to criticize the elite [[final clubs]] at that institution. They suggested that the critics might be "more concerned with ugly words than the underlying problems" and that policing free expression on campus "denies students the opportunity to learn to think for themselves."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/12/04/wither-goes-free-speech-at-harvard/ |title=Whither Goes Free Speech at Harvard?;  |magazine=Time |date=4 December 2012 |publisher=time.com |access-date=2016-07-13|last1=Christakis |first1=Erika |last2=Christakis |first2=Nicholas A. }}</ref> Their argument expressed confidence in the capacity and maturity of Harvard students to discuss contentious issues.

At Yale, in 2015, they were involved in a controversy related to the regulation of Halloween costumes. On October 29, 2015, Christakis' wife [[Erika Christakis]], a Lecturer on Early Childhood Education at the [[Yale Child Study Center]], wrote an e-mail to Yale undergraduates on the role of free expression in universities; she argued, from a developmental perspective, that students might wish to consider whether administrators should provide guidance on Halloween attire or whether students might wish to be allowed to "dress themselves."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefire.org/email-from-erika-christakis-dressing-yourselves-email-to-silliman-college-yale-students-on-halloween-costumes/ | access-date=2016-01-06 | title=Dressing Yourselves| date=2015-10-30 }}</ref> This e-mail was in response to a long earlier e-mail sent to undergraduates by a group of 14 administrators at Yale which suggested students be careful when choosing [[Halloween]] costumes, and which provided links to recommended and non-recommended costumes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The New Intolerance of Student Activism|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/the-new-intolerance-of-student-activism-at-yale/414810/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2015-11-17|last = Friedersdorf|first = Conor|date = 2015-11-09}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=We The Internet|title=Silence U Part 2: What Has Yale Become? {{!}} We the Internet Documentary|date=2017-03-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK4MBzp5YwM|access-date=2017-03-23}}</ref> The e-mail played a role in protests on campus that received national attention in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Yale's Halloween Advice Stokes a Racially Charged Debate|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/nyregion/yale-culturally-insensitive-halloween-costumes-free-speech.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-11-08|access-date = 2015-11-17|issn = 0362-4331|first = Liam|last = Stack}}</ref> Christakis and his wife were criticized by some students for placing "the burden of confrontation, education, and maturity on the offended."<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Problem With Vilifying the Yale Student Activists|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/encouraging-cultural-sensitivity-isnt-censorship/415185/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2015-11-17|last = White|first = Gillian|date = 2015-11-10}}</ref> But other students pointed out that Erika Christakis was defending the rights to free expression of all Yale students and expressing confidence in them and in their capacity to discuss and confront such issues among themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefire.org/yale-students-demand-resignations-from-faculty-members-over-halloween-email/ |title=Yale Students Demand Resignations from Faculty Members Over Halloween Email;  |publisher=fire.org |date= 2015-11-06|access-date=2015-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/the-new-intolerance-of-student-activism-at-yale/414810/ |title=The New Intolerance of Student Activism |website = The Atlantic |last = Friedersdorf|first = Conor |date= 2015-11-09|access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref> Ninety-one Yale faculty members signed a letter supporting the Christakises, and this letter noted that the Christakises themselves distinguished support for freedom of expression from supporting the content of such expression (they had noted that they would find many of the same costumes offensive as some students would).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Fa8lyQ17utjiw1LNkCoE22pvq2uRk_SVHHPmRgvpIA/edit?pli=1#heading=h.53s9msgj6b7 | access-date=2016-01-04 | title=Letter of Support For Erika and Nicholas Christakis}}</ref> Despite Christakis' belief that Yale students could discuss controversial issues (such as costumes) among themselves, and his confidence in their ability to do so, he stepped down from his role at Silliman College eight months later, at the end of the academic year, a step ''[[The Atlantic]]'' later decried (noting "When Yale’s history is written, they should be regarded as collateral damage harmed by people who abstracted away their humanity").<ref name="FriedersdorfEmailYale">{{cite news|last1=Friedersdorf|first1=Conor|title=The Perils of Writing a Provocative Email at Yale|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-peril-of-writing-a-provocative-email-at-yale/484418/|access-date=1 June 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

Christakis has spoken publicly about the events only rarely. In an October 2017 interview with [[Sam Harris]], he discussed parts of the situation he faced, framing the events at Yale in the broader context of what was happening on many campuses during that time period; Harris noted that Christakis had "the imperturbability of a saint."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/facing-the-crowd|title=Facing the Crowd|last=Harris|first=Sam|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref> In March 2019, Christakis told [[Frank Bruni]] that, partly in response to the events, he worked to complete a long-standing book project on the origins of goodness in society (Blueprint).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/nicholas-christakis-yale.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A 'Disgusting' Yale Professor Moves On|last=Bruni|first=Frank|date=2019-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-24|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In April of 2020, Christakis expressed concern that, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and medical schools were seeking to silence faculty and staff who were highlighting problems with the response; he stated that “clamping down on people who are speaking is a kind of idiocy of the highest order."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/why-are-hospitals-censoring-doctors-and-nurses/609766/ |title=Hospitals Must Let Doctors and Nurses Speak Out |last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|date=2020-04-10|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>
