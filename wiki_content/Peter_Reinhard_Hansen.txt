'''Peter Reinhard Hansen''' (born June 15, 1968) is the Henry A. Latané Distinguished Professor of Economics at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. He has previously taught at [[Brown University]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[European University Institute]].

==Biography==
Hansen was born in [[Sorø]], [[Denmark]], where he went to [[Sorø Akademi]]. He studied mathematics and economics at the University of Copenhagen (M.sc. 1995) under the supervision of [[Søren Johansen]] and from 1996 he studied economics [[University of California, San Diego]] (Ph.D. 2000) supervised by [[James D. Hamilton]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Hansen is known {{By whom|date=January 2018}} for his research on [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], [[forecasting]] and [[cointegration]], including the "test for superior predictive ability", which can be used to test whether a benchmark forecast is significantly outperformed by competing forecasts, the [[Model Confidence Set]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3982/ECTA5771|last=Hansen|first=Peter Reinhard|last2=Lunde|first2=Asger|last3=Nason|first3=James M|year=2011|title=The Model Confidence Set|journal=Econometrica|volume=79|pages=453–497}}</ref> He has, in collaboration with [[Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen]], [[Asger Lunde]], and [[Neil Shephard]], developed the [[realized kernel]] estimator that can estimate the [[quadratic variation]] in an environment with noisy high-frequency data, such as financial tick-by-tick data.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} He co-authored the book "Workbook on Cointegration" with [[Søren Johansen]].
