He is currently a faculty member at the Political Science and Public Administration Department of [[Istanbul Medipol University]].

Yayla also wrote articles in the 1980s for the extreme right-wing magazine ''Yeni Forum'', notorious for the donations it received from the U.S. organization the [[National Endowment for Democracy]],<ref>Mumcu, Uğur (1985-03-26).

He currently writes for the pro-government liberal newspaper ''Yeni Yüzyıl''. 

==Life and career==
He was born in 1957 in Kaman, [[Kırşehir]].<ref name=gazi/>

As an undergraduate, he studied economics at [[Ankara University]], going on to earn a master's degree in [[public administration]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in political science (1986).<ref name=gazi/>

In the 1970s he was involved in [[:tr:Yeniden Millî Mücadele Hareketi|Yeniden Milli Mücadele Hareket]]<nowiki/>i (''The War of Independence Anew Movement''), an anti-communist, anti-zionist and anti-imperialist reactionary movement founded by Islamist students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurfikirler.com/darbelerin-golgesinde-hayatlar/ |first=Atilla |last=Yayla |date=2016-09-23 |title=Darbelerin Gölgesinde Hayatlar (Lives in the Shadow of Coups)}}</ref> In the mid-1980s, around 1984-85 according to his statement, he embraced liberal views.<ref>This statement comes from the radio programme Yayla attended in 2011, titled {{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/iktisadiyat/entelekt-el-bak-30-06-2011 |title=Entelektüel Bakış}} At 25:47 he can be heard saying in Turkish ''“Actually, my liberalization was perhaps before that. For example, I was a liberal in the mid-80s, as of 84-85, but I wasn't very keen on using the label.”''</ref> However, Yayla went on during the 1980s to support the military junta in Turkey, writing "Thanks to the 12 September 1980 operation, Turkey has been freed from the blaze of terrorism, which had almost turned into a civil war, and found peace."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/97803944@N08/sets/72157634216607079/with/9086474377/ |first=Atilla |last=Yayla |title=Dünya'da ve Türkiye'de Terör (Terrorism in the World and Turkey)}} ''Yeni Forum'' 6, No. 128 (1 January 1985): 36-37.</ref> He praised the army, writing "... the fact that the Turkish army has established an unprecedented tradition in terms of commitment to democracy is also the guarantee of our democracy's survival", and praised the leader of the military junta, the Chief of the General Staff, [[Kenan Evren]], as "... one of the significant sources of hope for the survival of our democracy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/97803944@N08/sets/72157634221896096/with/9086629885/ |first=Atilla |last=Yayla |title=Seçimlerden Çıkan Sonuçlar (The Results of the Elections)}} ''Yeni Forum'' 5, No. 112 (1 May 1984): 10.</ref><ref name=dfrew>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075914/http://www.iktisadiyat.com/2013/06/25/atilla-yayla-12-eylul-ve-gezi-parki/ |first=Can |last=Madenci |date=2013-06-25 |title=Atilla Yayla, 12 Eylül ve Gezi Parkı (Atilla Yayla, September 12 and Gezi Park)}}</ref><ref>https://odatv.com/atilla-yayla-12-eylulde-neler-yazmisti-2606131200.html</ref> Again, in 2007, Yayla praised Evren for his views on a possible transition to a federal system in Turkey, saying: "No one dares [to express these views] since freedom of speech is not developed enough [in Turkey]. Kenan Evren is in the best position to express these views. He is opening a new era in our thought life, it is a pleasant development."<ref>{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Atilla Yayla: "Kenan Evren Yeni Bir Dönem Açıyor" (Prof. Dr. Atilla Yayla: "Kenan Evren Opens a New Era") |url= https://www.haberler.com/prof-atilla-yayla-kenan-evren-yeni-bir-donem-haberi/zar.php?id=MTI1 }}</ref>

In 1992 Yayla founded the [[Association for Liberal Thinking]] (ALT) with his colleagues and served as its chairperson between 1997 and 2008. He remains an active member of ALT.<ref name=gazi /><ref>{{cite web|title=Atilla Yayla |url=http://www.liberte.com.tr/yazar.php?id=MTI1 |publisher=Liberte Publications |accessdate=8 September 2012 |language=Turkish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028201718/http://www.liberte.com.tr/yazar.php?id=MTI1 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}</ref>

He was a visiting professor at the [[University of Buckingham]].<ref name=birm>{{cite web|url=http://www.buck.ac.uk/news/newsarchive2007/yayla.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070624052256/http://www.buck.ac.uk/news/newsarchive2007/yayla.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-06-24|title=New Visiting Professor in Economics and International Studies|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> He was the winner of the Anthony Fisher Prize in 2000 for his book "Islam, Civil Society and Market Economy".<ref name=birm /> Yayla was awarded the Person of the Year Award by the [[Stockholm Network]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stockholm-network.org/downloads/press/GUWinners.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091009085031/http://www.stockholm-network.org/downloads/press/GUWinners.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-10-09 |title=Golden Umbrella Think Tank Awards |accessdate=2008-04-15 }}</ref>

==Court case==
In 2006, Yayla was charged with insulting the legacy of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] by calling him "that man" in a speech where he argued that the [[one-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] was less democratic than the preceding period of constitutional monarchy under Ottoman Empire and the early and short-lived [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]],<ref name="Times20080125">{{cite news

==Work and views==
In 2008 Yayla was one of the signees of the [[:tr:Özür Diliyorum|Özür Diliyorum]] (''I Apologize'') campaign that caused an enormous reaction in Turkey by the government and the public. The participants implicitly claimed that the Ottoman Empire was responsible for the Armenian Genocide, which Yayla had denied in the 1980s as "an alleged genocide that never happened".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/97803944@N08/sets/72157634217156493/with/9086760917/ |first=Atilla |last=Yayla |title=Uluslararası Terörizmin Sebepleri (The Causes of International Terrorism)}} ''Yeni Forum'' 6, No. 137 (15 May 1985): 16-20.</ref><ref name=dfrew>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075914/http://www.iktisadiyat.com/2013/06/25/atilla-yayla-12-eylul-ve-gezi-parki/ |first=Can |last=Madenci |date=2013-06-25 |title=Atilla Yayla, 12 Eylül ve Gezi Parkı (Atilla Yayla, September 12 and Gezi Park)}}</ref><ref>https://odatv.com/atilla-yayla-12-eylulde-neler-yazmisti-2606131200.html</ref> The declaration read as "My conscience does not accept the insensitivity showed to and the denial of the Great Catastrophe that the Ottoman Armenians were subjected to in 1915. I reject this injustice and for my share, I empathize with the feelings and pain of my Armenian brothers and sisters. I apologize to them."

Yayla supported The [[Democratic initiative#Kurdish initiative|Kurdish Initiative]] project launched by the AKP government in 2009 to improve the human rights of Kurdish citizens of Turkey, and praised the advisory group, [[:tr:Akil İnsanlar Heyeti|Akil İnsanlar Heyeti]] (''The Wise People Commission''), organized by the government to contribute to the solution process. As part of the support, the [[Association for Liberal Thinking]] sent, through the Ministry of Justice, a package of books with liberal themes to the leader of the militant Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK), [[Abdullah Öcalan]], who was arrested in 1999 by the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MİT)]] and has been in prison since then on [[İmralı]] island in the [[Sea of Marmara]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.yenisafak.com/yazarlar/atillayayla/kurtler-ve-liberal-fikirler-54905 |first=Atilla |last=Yayla |date=2014-07-19 |title=Kürtler ve Liberal Fikirler (The Kurds and Liberal Views)}} ''Yeni Şafak'' (in Turkish).</ref>
