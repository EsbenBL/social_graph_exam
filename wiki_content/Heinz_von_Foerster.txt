As a [[polymath]], he wrote nearly two hundred professional papers, gaining renown in fields from [[computer science]] and [[artificial intelligence]] to [[epistemology]], and researched high-speed [[electronics]] and [[electro-optics]] switching devices as a physicist, and in [[biophysics]], the study of [[memory]] and knowledge. He worked on [[cognition]] based on [[neurophysiology]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]] and was called "one of the most consequential thinkers in the history of [[cybernetics]]".<ref name=FUP>{{cite book

==Biography==
Von Foerster was born in 1911 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], as Heinz von Förster. His paternal grandfather was Austrian architect [[:de:Emil von Förster|Emil Ritter von Foerster]]. His maternal grandmother was [[Marie Lang]], an Austrian feminist, [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophist]] and publisher. He studied physics at the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and at the [[University of Breslau]], where in 1944 he received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]]. His relatives included [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[:de:Erwin Lang (Maler)|Erwin Lang]] and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. [[Ludwig Förster]] was his great-grandfather.<ref name=markoff>{{citation |last=Markoff |first=John |title=Heinz von Foerster, a Leading Information Theorist, Dies at 90 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 9, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/obituaries/09FOER.html}}</ref> His [[Jewish]] roots didn't cause him much troubles while he worked in radar laboratories during the [[Nazi era]], as "he hid his ancestry with the help of an employer who chose not to press him for documents on his family."<ref>[[John Markoff]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/us/heinz-von-foerster-90-dies-was-information-theorist.html Heinz von Foerster, 90, Dies; Was Information Theorist]", November 9, 2002, ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

He moved to the US in 1949, and worked at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he was a professor of electrical engineering from 1951–1975. He also was professor of [[biophysics]] (1962–1975) and Director of the [[Biological Computer Laboratory]] (1958–1975). Additionally, in 1956–57 and 1963–64 he was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and also President of the [http://www.wennergren.org/ Wenner-Gren-Foundation] for anthropological research from 1963–1965.<ref name="Constructivism"/>

He knew well and was in conversation with [[John von Neumann]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Gordon Pask]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] and [[Margaret Mead]], among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator.

==Work==
Von Foerster was influenced by the [[Vienna Circle]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He worked in the field of [[cybernetics]] and is known as the inventor of [[second-order cybernetics]].<ref name=FUP/>  He made important contributions to [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]].<ref>Segal, L. ''The Dream of Reality: Heinz Von Foerster's Constructivism'', Springer, 2001. {{ISBN|0-387-95130-X}}</ref> He is also known for his interest in computer music and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].

===The electron tube laboratory===
In 1949, von Foerster started work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded [[Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner]]. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high-frequency electronics<ref>See for example, in ''Review of Scientific Instruments'' '''25''': 640–653, 1954.</ref>

He also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and in 1959 published a model now called the "[[von Foerster equation]]", which is derivable from the principles of constant aging and conservation of mass.

:<math>\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial n}{\partial a}  = - m(a)n, </math>

where: ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''(''t'',''a''), ''t'' stands for time and ''a'' for age. ''m''(''a'') is the death in function of the population age; ''n''(''t'',''a'') is the population density in function of age.

When ''m''(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, we have:<ref name="ref1">Murray, J.D. ''Mathematical Biology: An Introduction''. Third edition. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics. Mathematical Biology. Spring: 2002.</ref>

:<math>\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial n}{\partial a} </math>

It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density.<ref>"Some Remarks on Changing Populations" in ''The Kinetics of Cellular Proliferation'', F. Stohlman, Jr., ed., Grune & Stratton, New York, pp. 382–407 (1959); E. Trucco, ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' '''27''': 285–304 and 449–471, 1965</ref>

It is therefore a [[continuity equation]]; it can be solved using the [[method of characteristics]].<ref name="ref1" /> Another way is by [[similarity solution]]; and a third is a numerical approach such as [[finite differences]].

The gross birth rate is given by the following boundary condition:

:<math> n(t,0)= \int_0^\infty b (a)n(t,a) \, dt ,</math>

The solution is only unique given the initial conditions

:<math> n(0,a)= f(a), \, </math>

which states that the initial population distribution must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation.

===Biological Computer Laboratory===
In 1958, he formed the ''[[Biological Computer Laboratory|Biological Computer Lab]]'', studying similarities in cybernetic systems in [[biology]] and [[electronics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bcl.ece.uiuc.edu/ |title=Biological Computer Laboratory<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510142442/http://bcl.ece.uiuc.edu/ |archive-date=2007-05-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Macy conferences===
He was the youngest member of the core group of the [[Macy conferences]] on Cybernetics and editor of the five volumes of ''Cybernetics'' (1949–1953), a series of conference transcripts that represent important foundational conversations in the field. It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage "[[Cybernetics]]" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called "Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems".

===Doomsday equation===
A 1960 issue of ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula.<ref>{{Cite journal

The formula gave 2.7 billion as the 1960 world population and predicted that population growth would become infinite by Friday, November 13, 2026 – von Foerster's 115th birthday anniversary – a prediction that earned it the name "the Doomsday Equation."

Based on population data obtained from various sources, von Foerster and his students concluded that world population growth over the centuries was faster than an exponential. In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.

Responders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.
