'''Eric Stark Maskin''' (born December 12, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and 2007 [[Nobel laureate]] recognized with [[Leonid Hurwicz]] and [[Roger Myerson]] "for having laid the foundations of [[mechanism design]] theory".<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2007/press.html |title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2007 |date=October 15, 2007 |access-date=2008-08-15 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref> He is the [[Harvard University Professor|Adams University Professor]] and Professor of Economics and Mathematics at [[Harvard University]].

In 1975-76, he was a visiting student at [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], Cambridge University. 

==Career and topics==
In 1976, after earning his doctorate, Maskin became a research fellow at [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], Cambridge University. In the following year, he joined the faculty at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1985 he returned to Harvard as the Louis Berkman Professor of Economics, where he remained until 2000. That year, he moved to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey. In addition to his position at the Princeton Institute, Maskin is the director of the Jerusalem Summer School in Economic Theory at [[The Institute for Advanced Studies at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.as.huji.ac.il/schools/econ23 | title=The 23rd Jerusalem School in Economic Theory - Intertemporal Public Economics &#124; the Institute for Advanced Studies}}</ref> In 2010, he was conferred an honorary doctoral degree in economics from The [[University of Cambodia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uc.edu.kh/ucb/List%20of%20Honorary%20Doctorates%20(2004%20-%202014)/2015-07-22%2006:45:24/1889/|title=Welcome to The University of Cambodia (UC)|website=uc.edu.kh|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> In 2011, Maskin returned to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as the Adams University Professor and professor of economics and mathematics.<ref>Gautam S. Kumar and Julia L. Ryan. [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/25/Maskin-Economics-Princeton Economics Nobel Laureate Eric Maskin Returning to Harvard]. ''Harvard Crimson'', Oct 25 2011</ref>

Maskin has worked in diverse areas of [[economic theory]], such as [[game theory]], the economics of incentives, and contract theory. He is particularly known for his papers on [[mechanism design]]/[[implementation theory]] and [[dynamic game]]s. With Jean Tirole, he advanced the concept of [[Markov perfect equilibrium]]. His research projects include comparing different electoral rules, examining the causes of inequality, and studying coalition formation.

Maskin is a Fellow of the ''[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eric Stark Maskin|url=https://www.amacad.org/person/eric-stark-maskin|access-date=2021-03-24|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Econometric Society]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fellows {{!}} The Econometric Society|url=https://www.econometricsociety.org/society/organization-and-governance/fellows|access-date=2021-03-24|website=www.econometricsociety.org}}</ref> and the ''[[European Economic Association]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fellows {{!}} EEA|url=https://www.eeassoc.org/fellows|access-date=2021-03-24|website=www.eeassoc.org}}</ref> and a Corresponding Fellow of the ''[[British Academy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Professor Eric Maskin FBA|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/eric-maskin-FBA/|access-date=2021-03-24|website=The British Academy|language=en}}</ref> He was president of the ''Econometric Society'' in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Past Presidents {{!}} The Econometric Society|url=https://www.econometricsociety.org/society/organization-and-governance/executive-committee-2021/past-presidents|access-date=2021-03-24|website=www.econometricsociety.org|language=en}}</ref>

In 2014, Maskin was appointed as a visiting professor at [[Covenant University]], Nigeria.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mojeed |last=Alabi| newspaper=[[New Telegraph]] |place=Lagos, Nigeria |url= http://newtelegraphonline.com/nobel-laureate-joins-covenant-varsity/ |title= Nobel laureate joins Covenant varsity |date=16 July 2014| url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140811055122/http://newtelegraphonline.com/nobel-laureate-joins-covenant-varsity |archive-date=11 August 2014}}</ref>

In September 2017, Maskin received the title of [[HEC Paris]] [[Honorary degree|Honoris Causa Professor]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hec.edu/Knowledge/Events/Nobel-Prize-Eric-MASKIN-Conference-on-Improving-French-and-American-presidential-elections|title=Nobel Prize Eric MASKIN Conference on "Improving French and American presidential elections"|last=Paris|first=HEC|work=HEC Paris|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=HEC PARIS HONORIS CAUSA PROFESSOR 2017 REWARDS LIFELONG WORK OF NOBEL LAUREATE ERIC MASKIN |url=https://www.hec.edu/en/news-room/hec-paris-honoris-causa-professor-2017-rewards-lifelong-work-nobel-laureate-eric-maskin |website=HEC Paris |access-date=10 November 2019 |date=Oct 12, 2017}}</ref> He also served on the Social Sciences jury for the [[Infosys Prize]] in 2018.

==Software patents==
Maskin suggested that [[Software patent debate|software patents]] inhibit [[innovation]] rather than stimulate progress. Software, semiconductor, and computer industries have been innovative despite historically weak patent protection, he argued. Innovation in those industries has been sequential and complementary, so competition can increase firms' future profits. In such a dynamic industry, "patent protection may reduce overall innovation and social welfare". A natural experiment occurred in the 1980s when patent protection was extended to software", wrote Maskin with co-author [[James Bessen]]. "Standard arguments would predict that R&D intensity and productivity should have increased among patenting firms. Consistent with our model, however, these increases did not occur". Other evidence supporting this model includes a distinctive pattern of [[cross-licensing]] and a positive relationship between rates of innovation and firm entry.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1756-2171.2009.00081.x| title = Sequential innovation, patents, and imitation| year = 2009| last1 = Bessen | first1 = J. | last2 = Maskin | first2 = E. | journal = The RAND Journal of Economics| volume = 40| issue = 4| pages = 611| url = http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/16447/1/bessen.pdf}}</ref>
