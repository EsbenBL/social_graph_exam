'''James Clyde Mitchell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (usually known as '''J. Clyde Mitchell''') (21 June 1918 [[Pietermaritzburg]] &ndash; 15 November 1995) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[anthropology|anthropologist]].

In 1937 Mitchell helped found the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] group of [[Social Anthropology|social anthropologists]]/sociologists, now a part of the [[University of Zambia]]. He was influenced by [[Max Gluckman]] and conducted important research on social network analysis at the [[University of Manchester]] (see [[Manchester school (anthropology)|Manchester School]]). In the 1940s he carried out field research into social systems and social conditions in [[Central Africa]] (southern [[Malawi]]) interviewing heads of households in villages and urban areas and observing customs. In 1952 he was on the editorial committee of the ''[[Northern Rhodesia Journal]]''.

Mitchell studied [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] and was a founding member of the [[International Network for Social Network Analysis]], contributing to its ''Connections'' magazine.
