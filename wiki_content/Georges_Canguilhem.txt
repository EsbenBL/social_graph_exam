'''Georges Canguilhem''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɛ|m}}; {{IPA-fr|kɑ̃ɡijɛm, kɑ̃ɡilɛm|lang}}; 4 June 1904 – 11 September 1995)<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Phenomenology/O1VsBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Georges+Canguilhem%22+September+1995&pg=PA217&printsec=frontcover|title=Phenomenology: Responses and Developments|page=217|chapter=The Philosophy of the Concept|author=[[Pierre Cassou-Noguès]]|editor=Leonard Lawlor|date=September 3, 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317546900}}</ref> was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[physician]] who specialized in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of science]] (in particular, [[philosophy of biology|biology]]).

==Life and work==
Canguilhem entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1924 as part of a class that included [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Paul Nizan]]. He [[agrégation|aggregated]] in 1927 and then taught in [[lycée]]s throughout France, taking up the study of medicine while teaching in [[Toulouse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

He took up a post at the [[Clermont-Ferrand]] based [[University of Strasbourg]] in 1941, and received his medical doctorate in 1943, in the middle of [[World War II]]. Using the pseudonym "Lafont" Canguilhem became active in the [[French Resistance]], serving as a doctor in [[Auvergne (région)|Auvergne]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

By 1948 he was the French equivalent of department chair in philosophy at Strasbourg as well. Seven years later, he was named a professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and succeeded [[Gaston Bachelard]] as the director of the Institut d'histoire des sciences, a post he occupied until 1971, at which time he undertook an active emeritus career.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

In 1983 he was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal|Sarton Medal]] by the [[History of Science Society]]. In 1987 he received the ''médaille d'or'', awarded by the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS).{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===Philosophy of biology===

Canguilhem's principal work in philosophy of science is presented in two books, ''Le Normal et le pathologique'', first published in 1943 and then expanded in 1968, and ''La Connaissance de la vie'' (1952). ''Le Normal et le pathologique''<ref> [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbnIayLp8_g/ Le Normal et le Pathologique selon Georges CANGUILHEM]</ref> is an extended exploration into the nature and meaning of normality in medicine and biology, the production and institutionalization of medical knowledge. It is still a seminal work in medical anthropology and the history of ideas, and is widely influential in part thanks to Canguilhem's influence on [[Michel Foucault]]. ''La Connaissance de la vie'' is an extended study of the specificity of biology as a science, the historical and conceptual significance of [[vitalism]], and the possibility of conceiving organisms not on the basis of mechanical and technical models that would reduce the organism to a machine,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ostachuk A |title=Life as Normative Activity and Self-realization: Debate surrounding the Concept of Biological Normativity in Goldstein and Canguilhem|journal=História Ciências Saúde-Manguinhos|year=2015|volume=22|number=4|pages=1199–1214|doi=10.1590/S0104-59702015005000009|pmid=25807361|language=Spanish|url=https://www.academia.edu/6216054}}</ref> but rather on the basis of the organism's relation to the milieu in which it lives,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ostachuk A |title=The Organism and its ''Umwelt'': a Counterpoint between the Theories of Uexküll, Goldstein and Canguilhem|journal=Jakob von Uexküll and Philosophy: Life, Environments, Anthropology|year=2019|location=London|publisher=Routledge|pages=158–171|doi=10.4324/9780429279096-10|s2cid=214225907|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339354252}}</ref> its successful survival in this milieu, and its status as something greater than "the sum of its parts." Canguilhem argued strongly for these positions, criticising 18th and 19th century vitalism (and its politics) but also cautioning against the reduction of biology to a "physical science." He believed such a reduction deprived biology of a proper field of study, ideologically transforming living beings into mechanical structures serving a chemical/physical equilibrium that cannot account for the particularity of organisms or for the complexity of life. He furthered and altered these critiques in a later book, ''Ideology and Rationality in the History of the Life Sciences''.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Canguilhem was originally hostile to the ideas of [[Henri Bergson]] and vitalism but was later influenced by them and developed his own "idiosyncratic brand of vitalism."<ref>Wolfe, Charles; Wong, Andy. (2014). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1022.4150&rep=rep1&type=pdf ''The Return of Vitalism: Canguilhem, Bergson and the Project of Biophilosophy'']. In Miguel de Beistegui; Giuseppe Bianco; Marjorie Gracieuse. ''The Care of Life: Transdisciplinary Perspectives in Bioethics and Biopolitics''. Rowman & Littlefield International. pp. 63-75. {{ISBN|978-1783480371}}</ref>

More than just a great theoretician, Canguilhem was one of the few philosophers of the 20th century to develop an approach that was shaped by a medical education. He helped define a method of studying the [[history of science]] which was practical and rigorous.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} His work focused on the one hand on the concepts of "normal" and "pathological" and, on the other, a critical history of the formation of concepts such as "reflex" in the history of science.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Canguilhem was also a mentor to several French scholars, most notably [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], for whom he served as a sponsor in the presentation of ''Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique'' (''History of Madness'') for the ''Doctorat d'État'' and whose work he followed throughout the latter's life.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

=== Institutional role ===
As Inspector General and then President of the Jury d'Agrégation in philosophy, Canguilhem had a tremendous and direct influence over philosophical instruction in France in the latter half of the twentieth century and was known to more than a generation of French academic philosophers as a demanding and exacting evaluator who, as [[Louis Althusser]] remarked, believed he could correct the philosophical understanding of teachers by bawling them out. This belief did not prevent him from being regarded with considerable affection by the generation of intellectuals that came to the fore in the 1960s, including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Althusser once wrote to his English translator that "''my debt to Canguilhem is incalculable''" (italics in the original, from ''Economy and Society'' 27, page 171). Likewise, Foucault, in his introduction to Canguilhem's ''The Normal and the Pathological'', wrote:

<blockquote>Take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser, Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], [[Robert Castel|Castel]], [[Jean-Claude Passeron|Passeron]] and what marks them so strongly within [[sociology]]; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the [[May 1968 in France|movement of '68]], it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.</blockquote>

Derrida recalled that Canguilhem advised him early in his career that he would have to distinguish himself as a serious scholar before he could exhibit professionally the particular philosophical sense of humour for which he is at turns famous and notorious, advice which Derrida seemed to have taken in earnest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

After years of neglect, a great deal of Canguilhem's writings have been translated into English. Among them are his celebrated works ''The Normal and the Pathological'' and ''Knowledge of Life'' as well as two collections of essays, titled ''A Vital Rationalist'' and ''Writings on Medicine.''{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}
