'''Morgan's Canon''', also known as '''Lloyd Morgan's Canon''', '''Morgan's Canon of Interpretation''' or the '''principle or law of parsimony''', is a fundamental precept of [[comparative psychology|comparative (animal) psychology]], coined by 19th-century British psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Robert | name-list-style = vanc |date=1984|title=The principle of parsimony and some applications in psychology|journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior|volume=5|issue=2|pages=119–130|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266883461|issn=0271-0137|jstor=43853318}}</ref> In its developed form it states that:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Conwy Lloyd| name-list-style = vanc |title=An Introduction to Comparative Psychology|date=1903|publisher=W.

<blockquote>In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.</blockquote>

Morgan's explanation illustrates the supposed fallacy in [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] approaches to animal behaviour. He believed that people should only equate the actions of animals to human states, such as emotions, intents, or conscious awareness, if a less advanced description of the behaviour cannot be posed. Alternatively, animal behaviours can be justified as complex when the animal's initiative involves procedures beyond instinctual practice (i.e. the animal [[Animal consciousness|is consciously aware]] of their own natural behaviours).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Marian Stamp | name-list-style = vanc |date=October 2006|title=Through animal eyes: What behaviour tells us|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=100|issue=1–2|pages=4–10|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2006.04.010|issn=0168-1591}}</ref> This explanation can be used to understand the context under which the canon was studied, as well as its praises and criticisms. Several real world applications involving mating, competition and cognition exemplify Morgan's preference to simplify animal behaviour as it relates to these processes.

==Context==
Morgan's canon was derived after questioning previous interpretations of animal behaviour, specifically the anecdotal approach of [[George Romanes]] that he deemed excessively [[anthropomorphic]]. Its prestige is partly credited to Morgan's behavioural descriptions, where those initially interpreted as using higher mental processes could be better explained by simple trial-and-error learning (what is now called [[operant conditioning]]). One famous observation involves Morgan's terrier Tony, who, after many attempts, had successfully opened a garden gate. Though the final result could easily be seen as an [[insight]]ful act, Lloyd Morgan had watched and recorded the approximations leading to the dog's gradual [[procedural learning]], and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

==Evaluation==

The widespread study of [[animal cognition]] has required a disciplined use of Lloyd Morgan's canon.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Modern Role of Morgan's Canon in Comparative Psychology |last=Karin-D'Arcy | first = M. Rosalyn | name-list-style = vanc |date=2005-12-31|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1034738815}}</ref> D.A. Dewsbury called Morgan's Canon "perhaps, the most quoted statement in the history of [[comparative psychology]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Dewsbury|first=Donald A. | name-list-style = vanc |date=1984|title=Comparative psychology in the twentieth century.|doi=10.1037/10875-000|isbn=0-87933-108-9}}</ref> [[Frans de Waal]] reiterated that it is "perhaps the most quoted statement in all of [[psychology]]" in his book ''[[The Ape and the Sushi Master]].'' One section points to a statement that Morgan later added: "there is nothing really wrong with complex interpretations if an animal species has provided independent signs of high intelligence".<ref>{{cite book|title=The ape and the sushi master : cultural relfections by a primatologist|last= de Waal | first = Frans | name-list-style = vanc  |date=2002 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0141003901 |oclc=59389229 }}</ref> It has played a critical role in the growth of the prestige of [[behaviourism]] in twentieth century academic psychology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Steward|first=Helen| name-list-style = vanc |date=2018-06-21|title=Morgan's Canon|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780199375967.003.0018}}</ref> Morgan’s contribution remains a significant framework of animal cognition and is revered as a valued understanding of behavioural execution.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhnert M, Hilbert C | title = "Other minds than ours": a controversial discussion on the limits and possibilities of comparative psychology in the light of C.

With that being said, the canon has gathered substantial criticism. Many modern researchers such as Tobias Starzak suggest that it lacks operationally defined behaviour hierarchies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Starzak|first=Tobias| name-list-style = vanc |date=May 2017 |title=Interpretations without justification: a general argument against Morgan's Canon |journal=Synthese  |volume=194 |issue=5 |pages=1681–1701 |doi=10.1007/s11229-016-1013-4 }}</ref> There is additional concern that the restriction of advanced cognitive explanations dismisses the spectrum of behavioural awareness and opportunity.

==Applications in animal populations==

=== Mating displays ===
[[File:Penguins Edinburgh Zoo 2004 SMC.jpg|thumb|320x320px|King penguins on the Kerguelen Islands are known for their homosexual display behaviours.]]
Most varieties of animals produce displays for [[Courtship display|reproductive or courtship purposes]]. Mating behaviour is often thought to be intentional due to the discriminatory nature of mate selection; that is, pursuit of potential partners anticipates a deliberate choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nolan|first=Paul M.|last2=Stephen Dobson|first2=F.|last3=Nicolaus|first3=Marion|last4=Karels|first4=Tim J.|last5=McGraw|first5=Kevin J.|last6=Jouventin|first6=Pierr | name-list-style = vanc |date= April 2010 |title=Mutual Mate Choice for Colorful Traits in King Penguins |journal=Ethology |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=635–644 |language=en |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01775.x |url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bf5190a99ada8f9a066467cbca4fc9cf88d6a777 }}</ref> Mating processes are frequently disputed under the [[Nature versus nurture|nature-nurture debate]]. However, mating procedures may vary across circumstances. [[Homosexual behavior in animals|Homosexual]] mating displays such as those noticed in an observation of [[King penguin|king penguins]] on the [[Kerguelen Islands]] appear identical to those used to attract opposite sex individuals.<ref name=":02">{{cite journal|last=Pincemy|first=Gwénaëlle|last2=Dobson|first2=F. Stephen|last3=Jouventin|first3=Pierre| name-list-style = vanc |date=2010-10-08|title=Homosexual Mating Displays in Penguins|journal=Ethology|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1210–1216|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01835.x|issn=0179-1613}}</ref> The ability of penguins to differentiate between members of the same and opposite sex has been debated within animal behaviour literature, some claiming the phenomenon to be irregular while others considered it more systemic.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Weimerskirch H, Stahl JC, Jouventin P |date=1992 |title=The breeding biology and population dynamics of King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonica on the Crozet Islands |journal=Ibis |language=en |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=107–117 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb08387.x }}</ref> Nonetheless, environmental conditions such as [[Sex ratio|sex ratios]] may demonstrate individual differences within the population. As the Kerguelen Island population showed no conscious discernment between individuals, instead choosing mates at random,<ref name=":02" /> Morgan's canon possibly presumes that their displays are genetically hardwired and show no evidence of [[Mate choice|discrimination]] between sexes.

=== Competition and external signals ===
[[Competition]] among organisms (usually males) results from unwavering disputes over territory (for mating or general residence), food, or potential mating partners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=Robert W.|last2=Arnott|first2=Gareth| name-list-style = vanc |date= November 2012 |title=Understanding how animals fight with Lloyd Morgan's canon|journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=84|issue=5|pages=1095–1102|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.08.035}}</ref> Individuals may compete using visual signals, as is seen in various [[butterfly]] species. Two different combative signals have been recorded: one uses an [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] display that results in surrender of at least one male contestant, the second requires an encounter with an immature [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]].<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takeuchi T | title = Agonistic display or courtship behavior? A review of contests over mating opportunity in butterflies | journal = Journal of Ethology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28127115 | pmc = 5215026 | doi = 10.1007/s10164-016-0487-3 }}</ref> The latter does not exclude rivals from approaching the same cocoon, but fights can occur in the event that a female is hatched. Similar instances in other species are supported by [[game theory]] principles.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gadagkar|first=Raghavendra| name-list-style = vanc |date= November 2005 |title=The logic of animal conflict |journal=Resonance |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=5 |doi=10.1007/bf02837640 }}</ref> However, competition between butterflies is a rare occurrence<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peixoto|first=Paulo E.

One study used Morgan's canon to identify a third process; the possibility that battles emerge from a mistaken attempt to court other competitors.<ref name=":1" /> Since butterflies cannot cause severe injury to opponents nor accurately identify another's sex, the distinction of a mate from a competitor is sometimes nonexistent.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takeuchi T, Imafuku M | title = Territorial behavior of a green hairstreak Chrysozephyrus smaragdinus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae): site tenacity and wars of attrition | journal = Zoological Science | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 989–94 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16219979 | doi = 10.2108/zsj.22.989 | hdl = 2433/57198 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> Results of several studies conclude that air combat is ideally exclusive to territorial males.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Likewise, Morgan's canon justifies misguided combat as long as recorded instances of sex differentiation are limited.
