'''Jean-Paul Fitoussi''' (born 19 August 1942) is a [[France|French]] [[economist]] and [[sociologist]] of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] descent.<ref>{{Citation |last=Velupillai |first=Kumaraswamy |chapter=The consummate macroeconomist: Jean-Paul Fitoussi |title=Macroeconomic Theory and Economic Policy: Essays in Honour of Jean-Paul Fitoussi |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32336-9 |pages=10–30 }}.</ref> Born in [[La Goulette]], [[Tunisia]], Fitoussi earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] ''cum laude'' in [[Law and Economics]] from the [[University of Strasbourg]]. From 1979 until 1983, he was a professor at the [[European University Institute]] in [[Florence]], and a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1984. He currently is a professor of economics at the ''[[Sciences Po|Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]'', where he has taught since 1982. He is also Professor Emeritus at [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli|LUISS "Guido Carli" University]], in Rome. From 1989 to 2010 he served as President of the {{ill|Observatoire Français des Conjonctures Economiques|fr}}, an institute dedicated to economic research and forecasting. He has published numerous articles, books and essays. He is considered to be one of the intellectual leaders of neo-keynesianism of these past 40 years, but claims to have a "very heterodox" vision.<ref>http://econ.sciences-po.fr/sciences-po-celebrates-jean%E2%80%90paul-fitoussi-june-21st</ref>

In 2012 was published his book ''Macroeconomic Theory And Economic Policy: Essays in Honour of Jean-Paul Fitoussi''. Edited by [[Vela Velupillai]], it contained contributions from Nobel Prize winning economists [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Jean Tirole]] & [[Robert Solow]] as well as [[Olivier Blanchard]] & [[Edmond Malinvaud]].
In 2014 was published ''Fruitful Economics, Papers in honor of and by Jean-Paul Fitoussi''. The book is divided in 5 chapters, written respectively by Kenneth Arrow, [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Edmund Phelps]], Robert Solow, and [[Amartya Sen]], all of whom worked with Jean Paul Fitoussi at different points in their lives.

From 2000 to 2009 he was an expert at the European Parliament, Commission of Monetary and Economic Affairs. He is also a member of the "Centre for Capitalism and Society" at [[Columbia University]], and a member of the Economic Commission of the Nation since 1997. From 2008 to 2009, he was a member of the UN Commission on the Reform of the International Monetary and Financial System and Coordinator of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress.

In 2013, Sciences Po, a leading French University, set up a day in celebration of Dr. Fitoussi's career, uniting him with economists Joseph Stiglitz, Edmund Phelps, Kenneth Arrow, Robert Solow and Amartya Sen, to debate on the major "fitoussian" issues: European integration, inequality, well‐being and environmental sustainability, and the European democratic deficit. The event was concluded by speeches from then French Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Laurent Fabius]] and by French President [[Francois Hollande]].<ref>http://econ.sciences-po.fr/sciences-po-celebrates-jean%E2%80%90paul-fitoussi-june-21st</ref>

Fitoussi has received the "Association Français de Sciences Économiques Prix" (French Association for Economic Sciences Award), and the "Rossi Award" from the "Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques" (Academy of Moral and Political Sciences). He has been also awarded with various honours including the Honorary Deanship of the Faculty of Economics in Strasbourg University, Honoris Causa degree at the [[Buenos Aires University]], and in his own country with the decorations of "Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Mérite" (Knight of the National Order of Merit) and "Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur" (Knight of the Legion of Honour). He is also Officer of the "Order of Prince Henry of [[Portugal]]".<ref>http://www.ofce.sciences-po.fr/fitoussi/cv2-uk.html</ref>
