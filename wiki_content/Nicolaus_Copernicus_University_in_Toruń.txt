'''Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń''' or '''NCU''' ({{lang-pl|Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu}}, '''UMK''') is located in [[Toruń]], [[Poland]]. It is named after [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who was born in Toruń in 1473.<ref>[http://www.umk.pl/en/university/history/  Nicolaus Copernicus University history, homepage.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403135630/http://www.umk.pl/en/university/history/ |date=2012-04-03 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

===The beginnings of higher education in Toruń===
The first institution of higher education in Torun, the Toruń Academic Gymnasium was founded in 1568 on Piekary street. It was one of the first universities in northern Poland. The Academic Gymnasium was the precursor to scientific and cultural life (including the first museum created in 1594) in the region. Thanks to the efforts of Heinrich Stroband, city mayor in 1594, academics in Toruń received good working conditions for teaching and research. Among his professors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were meritorious scholars of Polish and Prussian history, authors of textbooks and papers from various disciplines of humanities, and associates scientific journals.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The establishment of the university in a modern form began in the nineteenth century. During the [[partitions of Poland]] the Prussian government planned to create a University of Theology, which was to include faculties of law and economics, unfortunately this project did not materialise.

In the interwar period the city authorities of Toruń again sought to establish a university. Soon after the annexation of Pomerania to the reborn Poland in 1920, a new phase of efforts to develop the university began. Even before 1920 the [[Supreme People's Council (Prussian Poland)|Supreme People's Council]] had considered the proposal to establish higher educational institutions in the Polish territories annexed by Prussia at the University of Gdansk and in Toruń. However, political developments and the uncertain future of Pomerania prompted the council's leadership to accept the December 1918 resolution of the [[Sejm]] to overlook Toruń as a location for a new university and instead go ahead with the development of a university in [[Poznań]].

In 1920, the first declaration requesting the establishment of a university was put forward in November by the National Workers Party whose members chose Toruń-born [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] to be the patron of the university. For this purpose a number of educational societies, such as the [[Baltic Institute]] (later transferred to Gdynia, and then to [[Gdańsk]]) amongst others, were established in the town.

Finally in 1938 it was decided to set up the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń as a subsidiary of Poznań's [[Adam Mickiewicz University]]; work was to start at the beginning of 1940. This program, however, was interrupted by World War II. It was not until 1947, (two years after the creation of the Nicolaus Copernicus University) that prof. Karol Gorski revealed that before the outbreak of World War II there was an approved plan to open Poznań University long-distance division in Toruń in 1940, to teach the humanities and theology.
