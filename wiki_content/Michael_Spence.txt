Together with [[George Akerlof|George A. Akerlof]] and [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], Spence is a co-recipient of the 2001 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], "for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information."

==Career==
Spence is noted for his job-market [[Signaling (economics)|signaling]] model, which inspired research into this branch of [[contract theory]]. In this model, employees signal their respective skills to employers by acquiring a certain degree of education, which is costly to them. Employers will pay higher wages to more educated employees, because they know that the proportion of employees with high abilities is higher among the educated ones, as it is less costly for them to acquire education than it is for employees with low abilities. For the model to work, it is not even necessary for education to have any intrinsic value if it can convey information about the sender (employee) to the recipient (employer) and if the signal is costly.

Spence received his middle and high school education at the [[University of Toronto Schools]] of the [[University of Toronto]]. He later came back to [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]] to serve as a member of the Rotman Dean’s Advisory Board.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-07|title=Rotman School of Management|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YTbriIXb0WsJ:www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/rogermartin/board.htm+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca|access-date=2021-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307175930/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YTbriIXb0WsJ:www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/rogermartin/board.htm+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca|archive-date=2021-03-07}}</ref>
