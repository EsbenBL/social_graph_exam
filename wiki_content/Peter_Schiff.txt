==Personal life==
Schiff was born to a middle-class [[Jewish]] family<ref name=AmerConserv>[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/dr-doom-runs-for-senate The American Conservative: "Dr. Doom Runs for Senate" By Michael Brendan Dougherty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105738/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/dr-doom-runs-for-senate/ |date=April 2, 2015 }} October 1, 2009</ref> in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. His father, [[Irwin Schiff|Irwin]], the son of Jewish immigrants from [[Poland]], served in the [[US Army]] during [[World War II]]. Irwin was a prominent figure in the US [[tax protester]] movement. He died in federal prison in October 2015 while he was serving a sentence of at least 13 years for [[tax evasion]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/25/business/antitax-advocate-receives-13-years.html|title=Anti-Tax Advocate Receives 13 Years|date=February 25, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927000324/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/25/business/antitax-advocate-receives-13-years.html|archive-date=September 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="PSBUS">{{Cite press release|url=http://schiffforsenate.com/?q=news/peter-schiff-announces-bid-us-senate|title=Peter Schiff Announces Bid for US Senate|date=September 17, 2009|publisher=Peter Schiff for Senate 2010|access-date=November 17, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626111724/http://schiffforsenate.com/?q=news%2Fpeter-schiff-announces-bid-us-senate|archive-date=June 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

His parents divorced when he was young, and he moved around the country with his mother and his brother, Andrew, from [[Connecticut]] to [[Manhattan]] to [[Florida]] and finally [[Southern California]].<ref name=AmerConserv /> He credits his father for introducing him to the [[Austrian School]] of economic thought.<ref name=swanson>{{Cite web|last=Swanson|first=Tim|title=Interview with Peter Schiff|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|date=April 21, 2008|url=http://mises.org/blog/interview-peter-schiff|access-date=April 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626233232/https://mises.org/blog/interview-peter-schiff|archive-date=June 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

On October 20, 2015, four days after the death of his father, Schiff accused the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] of inhumanely treating his father and not allowing the usual humanitarian release.<ref name="TAX PROTESTER IRWIN SCHIFF DIES IN PRISON AT 87">{{cite journal|title=TAX PROTESTER IRWIN SCHIFF DIES IN PRISON AT 87|author=Gattoni-Celli, Luca|journal=Tax Notes Today|date=October 2015|issue=2015 TNT 202–4}}</ref>

==Business career==
Schiff began his career as a stockbroker at a [[Shearson#Shearson Lehman Brothers|Shearson Lehman Brothers]] brokerage in the early 1990s.<ref name=official>[http://www.europac.net/members/peter_schiff Europac.net – Peter Schiff] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806105628/http://www.europac.net/members/peter_schiff |date=August 6, 2011 }}.

In 1996, Schiff and a partner acquired an inactive [[broker-dealer|brokerage]] firm, renamed it Euro Pacific Capital, and began operating it from a small office in [[Los Angeles]],<ref name=okeefecnn>{{Cite news|last=O'Keefe|first=Brian|title=Oh, he saw it coming|newspaper=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=January 23, 2009|url=https://money.cnn.com/2009/01/20/magazines/fortune/okeefe_schiff.fortune/index.htm|access-date=April 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413100457/http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/20/magazines/fortune/okeefe_schiff.fortune/index.htm|archive-date=April 13, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> relocating the firm to [[Darien, Connecticut]], in 2005,<ref name=lapin>http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/08/06/1774568.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201233508/http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/08/06/1774568.htm |date=February 1, 2014 }} "Prophet of Doom?

===Investigation===

In October 2020, a joint collaboration by the Australian newspaper ''The Age'', the Australian version of ''60 Minutes'' and ''The New York Times'' reported that a team of international investigators were scrutinizing Euro Pacific Bank.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/puerto-rico-euro-pacific-investigation.html|title=Chasing Illicit Money, Global Officials Circle a Puerto Rican Firm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2020|last1=Goldstein|first1=Matthew|last2=Cave|first2=Damien}}</ref> On October 18, 2020, the ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' Australia episode "Offshore bank at the centre of enormous worldwide tax evasion investigation" said that tax authorities in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, America, and the Netherlands believed Euro Pacific Bank was facilitating tax evasion and serious organized crime.<ref>{{Citation|title=Offshore bank at the centre of enormous worldwide tax evasion investigation {{!}} 60 Minutes Australia|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S333his4q0o|language=en|access-date=2021-09-25}}</ref> ''The Age'' reported that Euro Pacific Bank became the target of Operation Atlantis, the world's largest tax evasion probe. Asked why the US Internal Revenue Service visited him on January 24, Schiff refused to elaborate, saying, “I've already answered the question that we're not involved in any illegal activity,” and adding the bank “turns down far more accounts than we approve because our compliance is so rigorous". The Age reported that "Schiff threatened to sue the publication, ripped off his microphone and stormed out of his own living room."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Grieve|first=Charlotte|last2=McKenzie|first2=Nick|last3=Tozer|first3=Joel|date=October 18, 2020|title=The day the international tax authorities came knocking|work=The Age|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/the-day-the-international-tax-authorities-came-knocking-20201015-p565lz.html}}</ref>

==Economic and public policy views==
===Financial crisis forecast===
In an August 2006 interview, Schiff said, "The United States is like the ''[[Titanic]]'' and I am here with the lifeboat trying to get people to leave the ship.... I see a real financial crisis coming for the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europac.net/press_release/expansion_continues|title=Expansion Continues - Euro Pacific Capital|work=europac.net|access-date=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202210014/http://www.europac.net/press_release/expansion_continues|archive-date=December 2, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> On December 31, 2006, in a telecast debate on [[Fox News]], Schiff forecast that "what's going to happen in 2007 is that real estate prices," which had peaked in December 2005,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Reinhart|first1=Carmen M.|author-link1=Carmen Reinhart|last2=Rogoff|first2=Kenneth S.|author-link2=Kenneth Rogoff|year=2009|title=This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly|location=New Jersey|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-14216-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/thistimeisdiffer00rein_0/page/160 &#91;https://books.google.com/?id=ak5fLB24ircC&pg=PA160 160&#93; (see table 10.8)]|url=https://archive.org/details/thistimeisdiffer00rein_0/page/160}}</ref> "are going to come crashing back down to Earth."

In his 2007 book ''[[Crash Proof]]'', Schiff wrote that US economic policies were fundamentally unsound.<ref name=crashproof/> Since then, he has stated many times that without a change in US government economic policy, there will be hyperinflation<ref name=crashproof>{{Cite book|last1=Schiff|first1=Peter D.|last2=Downes|first2=John|title=Crash Proof: How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|date=February 2007|location=[[New Jersey]]|url=https://archive.org/details/crashproofhowtop00schi|isbn=978-0-470-04360-8}}</ref><ref name="Crash Proof 2.0 2009">{{Cite book|last=Schiff|first=Peter|title=Crash Proof 2.0|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-47453-2|pages=316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_pclvjkkTwC&pg=PA316}}</ref> and that the imbalance between the number of goods the US consumed and what it produced would eventually lead to problems for the [[US economy]]. As a remedy, he favored increased personal savings and production to stimulate economic growth.<ref>Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 7</ref> Schiff cited the US's low personal savings rate as one of the causes of its transformation from the world's largest creditor nation in the 1970s to the largest debtor nation in 2000.<ref>Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 76</ref> He attributed the low savings rate to what he asserts are high [[inflation]] and artificially low interest rates set by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref>Crash Proof 2.0, pg. 39</ref>

In 2008 and 2010 appearances on Fox News and financial news network [[CNBC]], Schiff mentioned factors such as speculation and "the absence of lending standards"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wallison|first=PeterJ.|url=http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.29047/pub_detail.asp|title=What Got Us Here?|publisher=Aei.org|date=December 9, 2008|access-date=May 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418152548/http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.29047/pub_detail.asp|archive-date=April 18, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=This American Life |url=http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html |title=NPR – The Giant Pool of Money |publisher=Pri.org |date=May 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415153017/http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html |archive-date=April 15, 2010 }}</ref> as factors that had contributed to the [[United States housing bubble#Subprime mortgage industry collapse|housing crisis]], which began in 2007.

On December 13, 2007, in an interview on the [[Bloomberg TV]] show "Open Exchange," Schiff added that he felt that the crisis would extend to the [[credit card]] lending industry, and he called consumer credit "a cancer on the free-market economy." Schiff said that interest rates would rise, that the dollar would "collapse," and that all classes of dollar-denominated assets would fall in value relative to non-US assets. He predicted "a huge crisis" and "the blow-up of credit card finance" in 2008, with the result that consumer credit card spending limits would be "slashed" by card issuers. He added that Americans would no longer be able to make purchases using their credit card lines. This prediction went unrealized.  Referring to the housing market, Schiff went on to criticize the policy of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] to "vilify and threaten the lenders" for reckless borrowing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5786330387747098530 |title=Peter Schiff's accurate forecast of credit card market trouble |access-date=May 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629083542/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5786330387747098530 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>

In a March 2009 speech, Schiff said that it would be impossible for the [[US public debt]] to [[China]] to be repaid unless the US dollar's value is substantially diluted through inflation. In September 2009, with gold below $1,000 per ounce, Schiff said that he foresaw gold at over $5000 per ounce in the future, and that the stock market rally which began that year was a "rally in a bear market."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-peter-schiff-us-stock-rally-and-dollar-doomed-gold-going-to-5000-2009-9|title=Peter Schiff: U.S. Stock Rally And Dollar Doomed, Gold Going To $5,000|publisher=Business Insider, Inc.|work=Business Insider|date=September 25, 2009|access-date=March 6, 2014|author=Blodget, Henry|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117052519/http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-peter-schiff-us-stock-rally-and-dollar-doomed-gold-going-to-5000-2009-9|archive-date=November 17, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Taxation===
In March 2011, Schiff stated that a national [[sales tax]] should replace both personal and corporate [[income taxes]], as he believes that the latter discourages work as opposed to a [[consumption tax]].  Schiff's second choice is a [[flat tax]] rate, which would abolish all deductions including the very popular [[Home mortgage interest deduction#United States|home mortgage tax deduction]], as Schiff believes that the state should not subsidize buying homes as opposed to renting.<ref name="Peter Gorenstein">{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/peter-schiff-us-should-abolish-corporate-and-personal-income-taxes-2011-3|title=PETER SCHIFF: The US Should Abolish Corporate And Personal Income Taxes|author=Peter Gorenstein|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=March 28, 2011|access-date=September 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501035913/http://www.businessinsider.com/peter-schiff-us-should-abolish-corporate-and-personal-income-taxes-2011-3|archive-date=May 1, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Medicare===
In August 2012, Schiff criticized [[Paul Ryan]]'s ''[[Path to Prosperity]]'' by saying that it is "too little, too late." Referring to Ryan's plan to reform [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], Schiff said, "Why would we want to preserve it? It's a [[Ponzi scheme]]... What we really need is real Medicare cuts today for people who are already on the system."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/1784922130001/schiff-ryan-budget-doesnt-go-far-enough/#sp=show-clips|title=Schiff: Ryan Budget Doesn't Go Far Enough|publisher=[[Fox Business Network]]|date=August 14, 2012|access-date=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831170339/http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/1784922130001/schiff-ryan-budget-doesnt-go-far-enough#sp=show-clips|archive-date=August 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Bitcoin===
Peter Schiff is a vocal [[Bitcoin]] bear. At times he has remarked that he sees Bitcoin as resembling the [[tulip mania]] bubble.<ref name="CNBC LLC">{{Cite news|author1=Alex Rosenberg|title=Bitcoin is tulip mania 2.0 – not gold 2.0: Schiff|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101192216|access-date=December 12, 2014|work=CNBC Futures Now|publisher=CNBC LLC|date=November 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902111626/https://www.cnbc.com/id/101192216|archive-date=September 2, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

On Sunday, Jan 19, 2020, Schiff claimed that his Bitcoin wallet got 'corrupted' and that he had therefore lost all the bitcoin he ever owned, through no fault of his own. "My wallet got corrupted somehow and my password is no longer valid. So now not only is my Bitcoin intrinsically worthless; it has no market value either. I knew owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad."<ref>{{Cite tweet|title=I just lost all the #Bitcoin I have ever owned.

Schiff's views have been criticized several times by economist [[Paul Krugman]], who defines [[inflation]] very differently from Schiff, focusing on CPI increases, rather than monetary and asset price inflation, which Schiff believes eventually lead to increases in consumer prices after an indefinite waiting period. In October 2010, Krugman wrote, "I keep being told that Peter Schiff has been right about everything; so, how's that hyperinflation thing going?"<ref name=krugman>{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/math-models-and-mystification|title=Math, Models, and Mystification|author=Paul Krugman|work=NYTimes.com|date=October 4, 2010|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927000246/https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/math-models-and-mystification/|archive-date=September 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2011, Krugman quoted Peter Schiff's statement from December 2009: "I know inflation is going to get worse in 2010. Whether it's going to run out of control or it's going to take until 2011 or 2012, but I know we're going to have a major currency crisis coming soon. It's going to dwarf the financial crisis and it's going to send consumer prices absolutely ballistic, as well as interest rates and unemployment." Krugman noted that inflation had instead remained low and concluded that Schiff's type of economic "model is all wrong" since it predicts that a tripling of the [[monetary base]], such as had just occurred, must lead to "dire effects on the price level."<ref name=krugman2>{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/inflation-predictions/|title=Inflation Predictions|author=Paul Krugman|author-link=Paul Krugman|date=December 15, 2011|work=The Conscience of a Liberal|publisher=NYTimes.com|access-date=April 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424145112/http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/inflation-predictions/|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2012, Schiff stated that a [[US debt crisis]] and high consumer price inflation had been delayed merely by government policy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blodget|first=Henry|title=Peter Schiff: The Debt-And-Inflation Crisis Is Taking Longer Than I Thought, But We're Still In Trouble|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/peter-schiff-debt-inflation-crisis-taking-longer-thought-170901661.html|work=Daily Ticker|publisher=Yahoo Finance|access-date=September 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520000051/http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/peter-schiff-debt-inflation-crisis-taking-longer-thought-170901661.html|archive-date=May 20, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2012 and again in November 2014, Krugman repeated his criticisms of Schiff's predictions of eventual high consumer price inflation and rising interest rates in America.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/varieties-of-error|title=Varieties of Error|author=Paul Krugman|work=NYTimes.com|date=November 29, 2012|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912184922/https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/varieties-of-error/|archive-date=September 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/the-wisdom-of-peter-schiff|title=The Wisdom of Peter Schiff|author=Paul Krugman|work=NYTimes.com|date=November 22, 2014|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926191019/https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/the-wisdom-of-peter-schiff/|archive-date=September 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2008, Schiff said he supported the reduction of government economic regulation and was concerned that the Obama administration might instead increase such regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europac.net/externalframeset.asp?from=home&id=14566|title=The Reagan Counterrevolution - Euro Pacific Capital|work=europac.net|access-date=November 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512102612/http://www.europac.net/externalframeset.asp?from=home&id=14566|archive-date=May 12, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Schiff said that the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] provided an opportunity to transition from borrowing and spending to saving and producing. He was critical of the US government's efforts to "ease the pain" with economic stimulus packages and bailout, as he believes that replacing "legitimate savings with a printing press" would result in asset price inflation, eventual consumer price inflation, and if left unchecked, potentially hyperinflation.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=5 November 2008|url=http://www.europac.net/media/PeterSchiff_11-05-2008.mp3|series=Wall Street Unspun|airdate=2008-11-05}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{Non-primary source needed|date=September 2021}}

For example, in 2009, Schiff predicted a "protracted period of economic decline accompanied by rapid increases in consumer prices." Schiff's critics pointed out that although asset price inflation has been significant, consumer price inflation rates remained very low in the five years that followed despite his predictions.<ref>{{cite magazine|last =Vinik|first =Danny|title =Inflation Paranoia Will Never Die, No Matter What the Evidence Says|newspaper =[[The New Republic]]|date =November 20, 2014|url =https://newrepublic.com/article/120354/peter-schiff-my-inflation-prediction-was-correct-stats-are-lying|access-date =June 23, 2015|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150921213611/http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120354/peter-schiff-my-inflation-prediction-was-correct-stats-are-lying|archive-date =September 21, 2015|url-status =live}}</ref>

When the Fed ended the [[Quantitative easing|Quantitative Easing]] program in October 2014, the general opinion was the Fed would conduct multiple rate hikes in the year 2015. In contrast, Schiff predicted that the market could not withstand even a minor interest rate increase, thus the Fed announcing a higher rate would be very unlikely. However, he did open up the possibility of a few basis point rate hike but anticipated that it would have major impact on the equity market and would lead the US into recession, therefore the Fed would be forced to reverse its policy and resume the QE program.<ref>{{cite news|last =Schiff|first =Peter|title =CNBC Futures Now|date =Jul 16, 2015|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_bghdJx87A/|access-date =February 27, 2016}}</ref>{{Non-primary source needed|date=September 2021}}
