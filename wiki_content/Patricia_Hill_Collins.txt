'''Patricia Hill Collins''' (born 1948) is an American academic specializing in race, class, and gender. She is a Distinguished University Professor of Sociology Emerita at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].<ref name="umds-profile">{{cite web|title=Patricia Hill Collins: Distinguished University Professor|url=http://www.socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Collins/Patricia%20Hill|publisher=University of Maryland Department of Sociology|access-date=9 November 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> She is also the former head of the Department of [[African-American Studies]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]], and a past President of the [[American Sociological Association]]. Collins was the 100th president of the ASA and the first African-American woman to hold this position.<ref name="higginbotham" />

Collins's work primarily concerns issues involving [[Race (human categorization)|race]], gender, and social inequality within the African-American community. She gained national attention for her book ''[[Black Feminist Thought]]'', originally published in 1990.<ref name="bft">Collins, Patricia. 2000.

==Early life and career==
Collins was born on May 1, 1948 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Her parents were Albert Hill, a factory worker and [[Second World War]] veteran, and Eunice Hill, a secretary. Her parents met in [[Washington, DC]]. Patricia has no siblings.

Collins attended Philadelphia public schools<ref name="higginbotham" />—and even at a young age, Collins had the realization of her lived reality— where she attended a school that catered to mostly white middle class students that was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. During the 1950s and 1960s, when Patricia was going to school, most schools in northern cities like Philadelphia were channels for social mobility. Although they were well funded, they were not particularly easy to navigate, especially for African-Americans and people of color like Patricia. However, Patricia was part of a cohort of working-youth who had educational opportunities long denied to their parents. She attended Pennell Elementary School and later [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]] (aka Girls' High), which was founded in 1848 as the nation's first public high school for women only. Collins had the unique experience of attending Girls' High during the 1960s process of desegregation of schools, which contributed to her growing interest in [[sociology]], [[feminism]], and [[activism]] for African-Americans and civil rights.

Collins went on to pursue an undergraduate career at [[Brandeis University]] in 1965 as a sociology major, graduating cum laude with honors with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969. She proceeded to earn a Master of Arts degree in Teaching (MAT) in Social Science Education from [[Harvard University]] in 1970.<ref name="higginbotham">{{cite journal|last1=Higginbotham|first1=Elizabeth|title=A New Perspective with Patricia Hill Collins|journal=Footnotes|date=September 2008|volume=36|issue=7|publisher=[[American Sociological Association]]|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/septoct08/collins.html|access-date=9 November 2015}}</ref> From 1970 to 1976, she was a teacher and curriculum specialist at St. Joseph Community School in [[Roxbury, Boston]], among two others.<ref name="higginbotham" /> She went on to become the Director of the Africana Center at [[Tufts University]] from 1976 to 1980.  

She completed her doctorate in sociology at Brandeis in 1984. While earning her PhD, Collins worked as an assistant professor at the [[University of Cincinnati]] beginning in 1982. She taught in the Department of Africana Studies for over two decades and retired in 2005 as the Charles Phelps Taft Distinguished Professor of Sociology.

In 1986, Collins published her first major article in the sociological journal ''Social Problems''. Titled "Learning From the Outsider Within: The Sociological Significance of Black Feminist Thought", the article put Collins on the map as a sociologist as well as an social theorist. The article, published four years prior to her first book, focuses on how African-American women have made creative use of their marginalized placement, or "outsider within" status, and benefited from this different way of thinking, a way of thinking that provides an important angle of vision on power.

In 1990, Collins published her first book, ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment''. A revised 10th-anniversary edition of the book was published in 2000, and subsequently translated into Korean in 2009, French in 2016, and Portuguese in 2019.

In 2005, Collins joined the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s department of sociology as a Distinguished University Professor. Working closely with graduate students on issues such as [[critical race theory]], intersectionality, and [[feminist theory]], she maintains an active research agenda and continues to write books and articles in relation to social, racial, and gender issues. Her current work has transcended the borders of the United States, in keeping with the recognition within sociological globalized social system. Collins is focused on understanding, in her own words, "How African American male and female youth's experiences with social issues of education, unemployment, popular culture and political activism articulate with global phenomena, specifically, complex social inequalities, global capitalist development, transnationalism, and political activism."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sociology.about.com/od/Profiles/fl/Patricia-Hill-Collins-Part-2.htm|title=Patricia Hill Collins, Part 2|last=Cole|first=Nicki|date=October 7, 2016|website=About Education|access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>

==Books==
In 1990, Collins published ''[[Black Feminist Thought|Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment]]'', which looked at the title topic through such figures as [[Angela Davis]], [[Alice Walker]] and [[Audre Lorde]]. The analysis incorporated a wide range of sources, including fiction, poetry, music and oral history. This book is the first book to incorporate the literature of and by African-American women. Collins's work concluded with three central claims:
*Oppressions of race, class, gender, sexuality and nation are intersecting, mutually constructing systems of power. Collins utilizes the term ''[[intersectionality]]'', coined by [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]], to refer to this simultaneous overlapping of multiple forms of oppression as a matrix of domination.
*Because black women have unique histories at the intersections of systems of power, they have created world views out of a need for self-definition and to work on behalf of social justice. Black women's specific experiences with intersecting systems of oppression provide a window into these same processes for other individuals and social groups.

In ''Black Feminist Thought'', Collins posits how [[Black feminist]] studies made of Black women's works highlight two very important themes. One being "how Black women's paid work is organized within intersecting oppressions of race, class, and gender."<ref name="bft" />{{rp|45}} Although these women no longer work in domestic work in private homes, they continue to work at low-paying jobs in the growing service sector.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Black Sexual Politics: African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism|journal=Contemporary Sociology}}</ref> Moreover, she continues, the theme that "concerns how Black women's unpaid family labor is simultaneously confining and empowering" for them is also extremely important.<ref name="bft" />{{rp|46}} Collins emphasizes this point because she points out that Black women see the unpaid work of their household as a method of resistance to oppression rather than solely as a method of manipulation by men.<ref name="bft" />{{rp|46}}

In an interview with [https://globaldialogue.isa-sociology.org/volume-1-issue-3/ ''Global Dialogue''] magazine in 2017, Collins reiterated the unique forces against black women that she laid out in ''Black Feminist Thought'' by emphasizing the stereotypes that they face: "In Black Feminist Thought, I examine how African-American women confront four main stereotypes: (1) the mule, the woman who works like an animal without complaint; (2) the jezebel, the highly sexualized woman who is often depicted as a prostitute; (3) the mammy, the Black woman domestic worker whose loyalty to her employer is beyond reproach; and (4) the Black lady, the educated Black woman who has given up family life in exchange for a career".<ref>Kunushevci, Labinot. “The Representation of African-American Women: An Interview with Patricia Hill Collins.” Global Dialogue, 17 Nov. 2017, http://globaldialogue.isa-sociology.org/the-representation-of-african-american-women-an-interview-with-patricia-hill-collins/. </ref> 

In a separate interview with Oklahoma's [[KGOU]] radio station in 2017, Collins' spoke on her careful process while writing the book: "I think it was very difficult for me to come to voice around the types of work that I do because there was no space for this work,” Collins says. “We had to create the space to write black feminist thought, to talk about race, class, gender, to talk about intersectionality. And that was all part of the process of being seen as legitimate, being listened to, being clear, being respected"<ref>“Doctor Patricia Hill Collins Works To Expand The Platform For Black Women's Voices.” KGOU, NPR, 13 Feb. 2017. </ref>

Published in 1992, ''Race, Class and Gender: An Anthology'' was a collaboration with Margaret Andersen, in which Collins edited a compilation of essays on race, class and gender. The book is widely recognized for shaping the field of race, class and gender studies, as well as its related concept of intersectionality. The essays cover a variety of topics, from historical trends and their lasting effects today, to the current media portrayal of minority groups. The tenth edition was published in 2020.<ref>Andersen, Margaret L., and Patricia Hill Collins (2012): ''Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology''. Belmont, California: Wadsworth Cengage Learning.</ref>

Collins published a third book ''Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice'' in 1998. ''Fighting Words'' focused on how Black women's knowledge examines social injustices both within Black communities, as well as wider society. Expanding on the idea of "outsiders within" from her previous book, she examines how outsiders resist the majority's perspective, while simultaneously pushing for and creating new insight on the social injustices that exist.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice|journal=Social Forces|doi=10.2307/3005807|jstor=3005807}}</ref> Collins also notes how acknowledging the social theories of oppressed groups are important because their different experiences have created new angles of looking at human rights and injustice.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice / The American Dream in Black and White: The Clarence Thomas Hearings|journal=NWSA Journal}}</ref> This has not always been the case because, as she points out, "elites possess the power to legitimate the knowledge that they define as theory as being universal, normative, and ideal".<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|title=Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice|year=1998|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=344}}</ref> '

Collins's next book was ''[[Black Sexual Politics|Black Sexual Politics: African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism]]'', published in 2004. This work argued that racism and heterosexism were intertwined in multiple areas of life, for example, how ideals of beauty work to oppress African-Americans males and females, whether homo-, bi- or heterosexual. Collins asserts that people must examine the intersection of race, class, gender, and sexuality that looking at each issue separately leads to missing a large part of the problem. Her argument for resisting the creation of such narrow gender roles requires action on individual and community levels, and recognizing success in areas other than those typically respected by Americans, such as money or beauty. Collins also contends that the oppression of African Americans cannot be successfully resisted without analyzing how intersecting oppressions influence their own group, such as the treatment of women or LGBTQ people. ''Black Sexual Politics'' won the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award from the American Sociological Association.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|title=Black Sexual Politics: African-Americans, Gender, and New Racism|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-415-95150-0}}</ref>

In 2006 she published ''[[From Black Power to Hip Hop|From Black Power to Hip Hop: Racism, Nationalism, and Feminism]],'' which examines the relationship between [[black nationalism]], feminism and women in the hip-hop generation. The book is a compilation of multiple essays by her, written over multiple years, compiled into one cohesive examination of the current situation of African Americans. Collins examines contemporary structural racism, which she calls "new racism," and explores how old ideas about what racism is prevents society from recognizing and fixing the wrongdoings that persist. The author explores a range of examples, from American national identity, to motherhood, to feminine portrayal in hip-hop. Following the Civil Rights Movement, she argues, there was a "shift from color-conscious racism that relied on strict racial segregation to a seemingly colorblind racism that promised equal opportunities yet provided no lasting avenues for African American advancement".<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|title=From Black Power to Hip Hop: Racism, Nationalism and Feminism|year=2006|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA}}</ref>

In 2009, Collins published ''Another Kind of Public Education: Race, Schools, the Media and Democratic Possibilities,'' in which she encourages the public to be more aware of and prevent the institutional discrimination that African-American children are experiencing today in the public education system. Collins explains that teachers have a great deal of power to be the facilitators of either discriminatory attitudes or tolerant attitudes; they are the "frontline actors negotiating the social issues of our time." Claiming that the education system is greatly influenced by the media, Collins examines racism as a system of power preventing education and democracy to reach its full potential.<ref name=":1">Collins, Patricia Hill, and Simmons College (2009). ''Another Kind of Public Education: Race, Schools, the Media and Democratic Possibilities''. Boston: Beacon Press.</ref>

Collins co-edited with John Solomos ''The Handbook of Race and Ethnic Studies'' (2010), a book on critical race theory. In 2012, she published ''On Intellectual Activism'', a collection of personal essays and interviews where she explains how ideas play an important part in bringing about social change. 

In 2016 and revised in 2020, Collins also published the book ''Intersectionality,'' with co-author Sirma Bilge, which discusses, in depth, the intertwined nature of social categorizations such as race, class and gender, sexuality and nation, and how these ideas create a complex web of discrimination and disadvantage in society. Taking a global perspective, topics covered include the history of intersectionality, critical education, human rights, violence, global social protest, identity politics, and women of color feminism in the United States and Brazil.

==Career honors==
Collins is recognized as a social theorist, drawing from many intellectual traditions. She reconceptualizes the ideas of race, class, gender, sexuality and nationalism as interlocking systems of oppression. Her more than 40 articles and essays have been published in a wide range of fields, including philosophy, history, psychology, and most notably sociology.

==Participation in American Sociological Association==
In 2009, Patricia Hill Collins became the 100th President of the ASA (American Sociology Association) and the first African-American Woman in the position. Her work with the ASA began far earlier, however, one she was named an ASA Minority Fellow in the 1980’s. She spent two years as chair of the Minority Fellowship program from 1985-1988 and chair of the ASA Task Force from 1989-1993. This background with the association as well as an extensive catalog of books and academic articles positioned her perfectly to reach the association’s highest position. 

Her 2009 presidential address, "The New Politics of Community", arrived as an article in the American Sociological Review and asserts that community is an dynamic political construct that, containing a plethora of different and contradicting agendas, can be used to evaluate issues of race, sex, and gender. 
In her address, Collins describes how community can be used for social examination for a number of reasons
*The commonality of the “language of community”, which, interchangeable with word like neighbourhood, establishes community as a part of group identity <ref>Hill Collins, Patricia. “The New Politics of Community.” American Sociological Review, vol. 75, no. 1, Feb. 2010, pp. 10, doi:10.1177/0003122410363293.</ref>
*Communities are “malleable” and easy to research <ref>Hill Collins, Patricia. “The New Politics of Community.” American Sociological Review, vol. 75, no. 1, Feb. 2010, pp. 11, doi:10.1177/0003122410363293.</ref>
*Communities can hold many differing agendas and thus “reflect diverse and conflicting social practices” <ref>Hill Collins, Patricia. “The New Politics of Community.” American Sociological Review, vol. 75, no. 1, Feb. 2010, pp. 11, doi:10.1177/0003122410363293.</ref>
*“the construct of community catalyzes strong, deep feelings that can move people to action,” <ref>Hill Collins, Patricia. “The New Politics of Community.” American Sociological Review, vol. 75, no. 1, Feb. 2010, pp. 12, doi:10.1177/0003122410363293.</ref>
*“the construct of community is central to how people organize and experience social inequalities”.<ref>Hill Collins, Patricia. “The New Politics of Community.” American Sociological Review, vol. 75, no. 1, Feb. 2010, pp. 12, doi:10.1177/0003122410363293.</ref>

==Academic Responses==
Collins' influential books on intersectionality and community have led way to many references and responses in sociological spheres. Notably, Professor Shannon Sullivan of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte penned "Community as a Political and Temporal Construct: A Response to Patricia Hill Collins" in ''The Pluralist''. In the article, Sullivan connected the four aspects of a politically constructed community as laid out by Collins with Philosophy Professor Alfred Frankowski. While Sullivan finds Collins' "hope that a political understanding of community could enable genuine change that is not part of a changing-same pattern" <ref>Sullivan, Shannon. “Community as a Political and Temporal Construct: A Response to Patricia Hill Collins.” The Pluralist, vol. 15, no. 1, [University of Illinois Press, Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy], 2020, pp. 83–89, https://doi.org/10.5406/pluralist.15.1.0083.
</ref> to be admirable, she contrasts this with Frankowski's assertion that the memorialization of Anti-Black violence is necessary for white-dominated communities to keep racist agendas in the past.<ref>Sullivan, Shannon. “Community as a Political and Temporal Construct: A Response to Patricia Hill Collins.” The Pluralist, vol. 15, no. 1, [University of Illinois Press, Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy], 2020, pp. 83–89, https://doi.org/10.5406/pluralist.15.1.0083.
</ref> Sullivan ultimately finds that Frankowski's pragmatist philosophy is needed for White America to successfully evaluate the communities in which echo chambers fuel racial ignorance.

==References in Other Academic Spheres==
Patricia Hill Collins’ work has not only been referenced and referred to heavily in sociological circles, but her assertions on intersectionality and the black female experience have also been cited in literary analysis. In 2020, Parvin Ghasemi and Samira Heidari of the Molana Institute of Higher Education in Iran published “Patricia Hill Collins’ Black Feminine Identity in Toni Morrison’s [[Beloved (novel)|''Beloved'']]” in the [[Journal of African American Studies]]. The article describes how ''Beloved’s'' main character, a mother and former slave in the post-slavery south, epitomizes and subsequently shatters Collins’ proposed matrix of domination: “In line with Collin’s philosophy, Morrison’s novel presents a reaction to matrix of domination. In fact, the multiplicity of experience that Collin refers to can be found in the novel through the fact that readers see simultaneously the experience of being a marginalized, a murderer, a mother, a people of color, a traumatic woman, and a former slave. All these aspects help the collective experience of race disentangle itself from the structural oppression and discrimination. Though Seth is a traumatic figure, this portrayal helps to expose the true picture of a discriminatory society that produces such failing characters.” <ref>Ghasemi, Parvin, and Samira Heidari. “Patricia Hill Collins’ Black Feminine Identity in Toni Morrison’s Beloved.” Journal of African American Studies, vol. 24, no. 4, Dec. 2020, p. 586.

==Legacy==
While race and its accompanying social hierarchies have remained fundamental facets of sociological study, intersectional analysis and the study of collective, oppressed identities are largely attributed to Patricia Hill Collins. Professor Gurminder Bhambra's 2015 essay "Black Thought Matters: Patricia Hill Collins and the long tradition of African American sociology", Bhambra describes how Collins not only nurtured existing schools of African American sociology but pushed the field into a new direction. On Collins' 1990 book ''Black Feminine Thought'', Bhambra wrote: "It has been both a scholarly beacon for researchers working through shared ideas and experiences, and an intellectual grounding from which further critical work has been enabled and more voices brought into conversation. Its influence ranges across disciplinary and geographical boundaries and dismantles conventional hierarchies in the process"<ref>Bhambra, Gurminder K. “Black Thought Matters: Patricia Hill Collins and the Long Tradition of African American Sociology.” Ethnic & Racial Studies, vol. 38, no. 13, Oct. 2015, pp. 2315–2321.
