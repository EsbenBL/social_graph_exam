In 1995, Ceci was part of an 11-member [[American Psychological Association]] task force led by [[Ulric Neisser]] which published "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]," a report written in response to ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

Ceci introduced in 1990 his "Bio-Ecological Theory of Intelligence", which holds that the level of mental activities or IQ are dependent on context. For example, he says traditional conceptions of intelligence ignore the role of society in shaping intelligence and underestimate the intelligence of non-Western societies.<ref name="Ceci1990">{{cite book|author=Stephen J.
