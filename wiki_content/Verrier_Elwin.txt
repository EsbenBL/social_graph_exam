==Early life and education==
Harry Verrier Holman Elwin was born on 29 August 1902 in Dover. He is the son of [[Edmund Henry Elwin]], Bishop of [[Sierra Leone]]. He was educated at [[Dean Close School]] and [[Merton College, Oxford]],<ref name=MCreg /> where he received his degrees of BA First Class in English Language and Literature, [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]], and DSc. He also remained the [[Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union#List of OICCU Presidents|President]] of [[Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union]] (OICCU) in 1925. He had a brilliant career{{Peacock term|date=September 2020}} at Oxford, where he took a Double First in English and in Theology, before being ordained a priest in the Church of England. He came to India in 1927, to join a small sect, the Christa Seva Sangh of Poona, which hoped to 'indigenise' Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

==Career==
In 1926, he was appointed Vice-Principal of [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]] and in the following year he became a lecturer at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. He went to India in 1927 as a [[missionary]]. Over the years,he was influenced by the philosophies of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. He quickly threw in his lot with the Congress,winning Gandhi's affection and becoming a camp follower and occasional cheerleader to the popular movement against British rule. Seeking fuller immersion in the toil, the sufferings, the poverty of India, he resolved to make his home among the Gonds. He first joined Christian Service Society in Pune. The first time he visited the central India, now the states of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], and parts of eastern [[Maharashtra]], was with an Indian from Pune, Shamrao Hivale. For the first time, he visited a remote village in the forests of  Mandla district. Hivale and he were to spend some twenty years in Central India, living with and fighting for tribal rights. Their studies on the tribes are some of the earliest anthropological studies in the country. In January 1954, Elwin became the first foreigner to be accepted as an Indian citizen. In the same year, he was appointed anthropological adviser to the Indian Government, with the special reference to the hill tribes of the north east. Moving to Shillong, he served for a decade as a leading missionary of what he liked to call 'Mr Nehru's Gospel for tribes'. He died in 1964, a greatly esteemed public figure in his adopted land, the recipient of the Padma Bhushan and countless other medals and rewards. He participated in the [[Indian independence movement]],and in 1930 Gandhi said he regarded Elwin as a son.<ref name="Mandelbaum">{{cite journal|last=Mandelbaum|first=David|title=Verrier Elwin (1902–1964)|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1965|volume=67|issue=2|pages=448–452|doi=10.1525/aa.1965.67.2.02a00140|doi-access=free}}</ref>

He came out with numerous works on various tribal groups in India, the best acclaimed being those on Maria and Baigas.

After India attained independence in 1947, he was asked by Nehru to find solutions to the problems that emerged among the tribal peoples living in the far northeastern corner of India, the [[North East Frontier Agency]] (NEFA). He was also a Fellow of the [[Indian National Science Academy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Science Academy|first=Indian National |author-link=Indian National Science Academy|title=Biographical memoirs of fellows of the Indian National Science Academy, Volume 20|year=1995|page=101}}</ref> Elwin entered into an agreement which prohibited the entry of [[Sadhu|Sadhus]] into Nagaland with Nehru.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Only Nagaland safe from sadhus in India|url=http://indianculture.gov.in/archives/only-nagaland-safe-sadhus-india|access-date=2021-02-24|website=INDIAN CULTURE|language=en}}</ref>

The historian [[Ramachandra Guha]]'s biography ''Savaging the Civilized: Verrier Elwin, His Tribals, and India'' (1999) brought renewed attention in India to Elwin's life and career.

==On Ghotul==
Verrier Elwin wrote – "The message of the [[ghotul]] – that youth must be served, that freedom and happiness are more to be treasured than any material gain, that friendliness and sympathy, hospitality and unity are of the first importance, and above all that human love – and its physical expression – is beautiful, clean and precious, is typically Indian."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgnet.in/FT/ghotul |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030033420/http://www.cgnet.in/FT/ghotul |archive-date=30 October 2007 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Elwin married a Raj [[Gond people|Gond]] tribal girl called Kosi who was a student at his school at Raythwar (Raithwar) in [[Dindori district]] in Madhya Pradesh on 4 April 1940. They had one son, Jawaharlal (Kumar), born in 1941. Elwin had an ex-parte divorce in 1949, at the [[Calcutta High Court]], writing in his autobiography, "I cannot even now look back on this period of my life without a deep sense of pain and failure" <ref>''The Tribal World of Verrier Elwin. An autobiography'', [[Oxford University Press]], Bombay, 1964, p. 138.</ref> In 2006, Kosi was still living in a hut in Raythwar, their son Kumar having died.
