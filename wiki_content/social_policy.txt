'''Social policy''' is a plan or action of [[government]] or institutional agencies which aim to improve or reform [[society]].  

Some professionals and universities consider social policy a subset of [[public policy]],<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Malcolm Wiener Center|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/socpol/about.html|publisher=Presidents and Fellows of Harvard|access-date=21 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225021708/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/socpol/about.html|archive-date=25 December 2008|date=15 February 2006}}</ref> while other practitioners characterize social policy and public policy to be two separate, competing approaches for the same [[public interest]] (similar to [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] in healthcare), with social policy deemed more holistic than public policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Penn SP2 Mission Statement|url=https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/about/mission-statement/|publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy & Practice|access-date=26 April 2021}}</ref>  Whichever of these persuasions a university adheres to, social policy begins with the study of the [[welfare state]] and [[social services]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spicker|first1=Paul|title=An introduction to Social Policy|url=http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/publicpolicy/introduction/index.htm?CFID=75213086&CFTOKEN=94736152&jsessionid=50314442b009e7f430b746b7574792426401TR|website=www2.rgu.ac.uk|access-date=21 May 2015}}</ref>  It consists of [[guidelines]], [[principles]], [[legislation]] and associated activities that affect the living conditions conducive to [[human welfare]], such as a person's [[quality of life]].

The study of social policy can either be a stand alone degree in social policy such as the [[University of York]], [[Oxford University]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], or a specialization as part of a public policy degree program such as at [[McGill University]], [[Balsillie School of International Affairs]], [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies|Harris School of Public Policy]], and the [[Hertie School|Hertie School of Governance]]. In the Global South, social policy is offered along with public policy degree programmes, as at the [[Institute of Public Policy, National Law School of India University, Bangalore |Institute of Public Policy, National Law School of India University, Bangalore]], combined with development policy. 

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
{{See also| Welfare State|Welfare}}

Social policy was first conceived in the [[1940s]] by [[Richard Titmuss]] within the field of social administration in Britain.  Titmuss's essay on the "Social Division of Welfare" (1955) laid the development for social policy to gradually absorb social administration.  Titmuss was an [[essayist]] whose work concerned the failure of the market; the inadequacy of selective social services; and the superiority of [[collectivism]] and universal approaches.  While some scholars describe social policy as an [[interdisciplinary]] field of practice, scholars like [[Fiona Williams]] and Pete Alcock believe social policy is a [[academic discipline|discipline]] unto itself.   

Some of the earliest examples of direct intervention by government in human welfare date back to [[Ancient Rome]]'s ''[[Cura Annonae]]'' (grain dole) founded in 123 BC, and [[Umar ibn al-KhattƒÅb]]'s rule as the second [[caliph]] of Islam in the 6th century: he used ''[[zakat]]'' collections and also other governmental resources to establish pensions, income support, child benefits, and various stipends for people of the non-Muslim community{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.  The enactment of [[English Poor Laws]] helped curb [[poverty]] and recidivism: these laws influenced the justices of Berkshire to implement the [[Speenhamland system]], which was the first [[social program]] in the modern sense of that word.  In the modern West, proponents of scientific social planning such as the sociologist [[Auguste Comte]], and social researchers, such as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], contributed to the emergence of social policymaking in the first industrialised countries following the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Surveys of poverty exposing the brutal conditions in the urban [[slum]] conurbations of [[Victorian Britain]] supplied the pressure leading to changes such as the [[decline and abolition of the poor law system]] and [[Liberal welfare reforms]]. Other significant examples in the development of social policy are the [[Otto von Bismarck#Social legislation|Bismarckian welfare state]] in 19th century [[Germany]], [[Social Security (United States)#History|social security policies in the United States]] introduced under the rubric of the [[New Deal]] between 1933 and 1935, and both the [[Beveridge Report]] and the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] in Britain.  Thus, two major models of [[social insurance]] arose in practice:  Bismarkian welfare from Germany and Beveridgean welfare from Britain.

Social policy in the 21st century is complex and in each state it is subject to [[Local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]], as well as [[Supranational union|supranational]] political influence. For example, membership of the [[European Union]] is conditional on member states' adherence to the [[Law of the European Union#Social chapter|Social Chapter]] of European Union law {{clarify span|text=and other [[international laws]].|date=May 2015}}<!-- Which "other international laws"? -->

Social policy aims to improve human welfare and to meet [[human need]]s for education, health, housing and economic security. Important areas of social policy are [[wellbeing]] and welfare, poverty reduction, [[social security]], [[justice]], [[unemployment insurance]], [[living conditions]], [[animal rights]], [[pensions]], [[health care]], [[social housing]], family policy, [[social care]], [[child protection]], [[social exclusion]], [[education policy]], [[crime]] and [[criminal justice]], [[urban development]], and [[Contract labour|labor]] issues.

==United States social policy==

The United States was a pioneer in generous social spending (relative to comparable countries), as it provided substantial social spending for Civil War veterans and their families.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674717664|title=Protecting Soldiers and Mothers|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|date=1992|website=Harvard University Press|language=en|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> However, the United States would go on to lag behind other advanced industrial democracies in social spending.

Religious, racial, ideological, scientific and philosophical movements and ideas have historically influenced American social policy, for example, [[John Calvin]] and his idea of [[pre-destination]] and the [[Protestant]] Values of hard work and [[individualism]]. Moreover, [[Social Darwinism]] helped mold America's ideas of [[capitalism]] and the ''[[survival of the fittest]]'' mentality. The Catholic Church's social teaching has also been considerably influential to the development of social policy.

United States politicians who have favored increasing government observance of social policy often do not frame their proposals around typical notions of welfare or benefits; instead, in cases like ''[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'' and ''[[Medicaid]]'', President [[Lyndon Johnson]] presented a package called the [[Great Society]] that framed a larger vision around [[poverty]] and [[quality of life]]. [[Insurance]] has been a growing policy topic, and a recent example of [[health care law]] as social policy is the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] formed by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], on March 23, 2010.

Moreover, former president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s ground breaking [[New Deal]] is a paragon example of Social Policy that focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through public spending on projects, rather than on cash payment. The programs were in response to the [[Great Depression]] affecting the United States in the [[1930s]].

An American [[education policy]] proposal from a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president is the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. This Act took effect on January 8, 2002, and was put in place to raise standards in education so different individuals can have better educational outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act requires every state to [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|assess students on basic skills]] to receive federal funding. However, this Act did not create a national standard since each state develops their own set of standards and assessments. Critics of most all social policies point toward a depiction of a [[welfare state]] on the make of a Hobbesian [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].
