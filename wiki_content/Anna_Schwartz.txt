'''Anna Jacobson Schwartz''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ʃ|w|ɔːr|t|s|}}; November 11, 1915 – June 21, 2012) was an American [[economist]] who worked at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] in New York City and a writer for ''[[The New York Times]]''. [[Paul Krugman]] has said that Schwartz is "one of the world's greatest [[Monetary economics|monetary]] scholars."[[Anna Schwartz#cite note-1|<sup>[1]</sup>]]

Schwartz collaborated with Nobel laureate [[Milton Friedman]] on [[A Monetary History of the United States|''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960'']], which was published in 1963.[[Anna Schwartz#cite note-2|<sup>[2]</sup>]] This book placed the blame for the [[Great Depression]] at the door of the [[Federal Reserve System]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|author3=National Bureau of Economic Research|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&pg=PP1 |year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13794-0 |page=247|chapter=B.

Schwartz was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2013.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/anna-jacobson-schwartz/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Anna Jacobson Schwartz]</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Schwartz was born Anna Jacobson on November 11, 1915, in New York City to Pauline (''[[née]]'' Shainmark) and Hillel Jacobson.<ref name="JWA">{{cite web|last=Lipsey|first=Robert|title=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schwartz-anna-jacobson|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|access-date=28 August 2013}}</ref> She graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Barnard College]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Anna Jacobson Schwartz {{!}} American economist|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anna-Jacobson-Schwartz|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=5 July 2017|language=en}}</ref> at 18 and gained her master's degree in economics from [[Columbia University]] in 1935, at 19. She started her career as a professional economist one year later.

In 1936, she married Isaac Schwartz, a financial officer and fellow Columbia University graduate, with whom she raised four children. Her first published paper was in the ''[[The Review of Economics and Statistics|Review of Economics and Statistics]]'' (1940), in which she, along with Arthur Gayer and Isaiah Finkelstein, wrote ''British Share Prices, 1811–1850''. She earned her [[Ph.D.]] from Columbia in 1964.<ref name="JWA"/>

==National Bureau of Economic Research==
After briefly working for the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]](1936) and the Columbia University Social Science Research Council (1936–41); in 1941, she joined the staff of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. She worked in the New York City office of that organization for the rest of her life. When she joined the National Bureau, it was engaged in the study of [[business cycle]]s.In 1981 her role as the staff director of the U.S. Gold Commission brought her public recognition. Even after a broken hip and stroke in 2009, Schwartz remained an astute and thorough researcher. She was named a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association (1993) and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (2007).

Though she held teaching positions for only a short part of her career, she developed younger scholars by her willingness to work with them and to share her approach (a scrupulous examination of the past) to understand history better and to draw lessons for the present.

== ''Growth and Fluctuations in the British Economy'' ==
In collaboration with Arthur Gayer and [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], she produced the monumental ''Growth and Fluctuations in the British Economy, 1790–1850: An Historical, Statistical, and Theoretical Study of Britain's Economic Development''. It appeared in two volumes in 1953, having been delayed by the [[Second World War]] for a decade after it was completed. It is still highly regarded among economic scholars of the period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The growth and fluctuation of the British economy, 1790-1850 : an historical, statistical, and theoretical study of Britain's economic development|last=1903-1951|first=Gayer, Arthur D. (Arthur David)|date=1975|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|others=Schwartz, Anna J. (Anna Jacobson), 1915-2012,, Rostow, W. W. (Walt Whitman), 1916-2003|isbn=978-0064923446|location=New York|oclc=2066523}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1975.

Gayer had died before the book's first appearance, but two other authors wrote a new introduction, which reviewed literature on the subject that had published since the original publication date. They admitted that there had developed what they called an "amicable divergence of view" about the interpretation of some of the facts that were set out in the book. In particular, Schwartz indicated that she had, in the light of recent theoretical and empirical research, revised her view of the importance of [[monetary policy]] and her interpretation of [[interest rate]] movements.

==Research with Friedman==
Years before her first book was reprinted, another economist had joined what might be called the Schwartz team of co-authors. Prompted by [[Arthur F. Burns]], then at [[Columbia University]] and the [[National Bureau of Economic Research|National Bureau]] who would subsequently be Chairman of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]], she and [[Milton Friedman]] teamed up to examine the role of money in the [[business cycle]]. Their first publication was ''[[A Monetary History of the United States|A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960]]'', which hypothesized that changes in [[monetary policy]] have had large effects on the [[economic system|economy]], and it laid a large portion of the blame for the [[Great Depression]] at the door of the [[Federal Reserve System]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Anna Schwartz|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/finance-obituaries/9507099/Anna-Schwartz.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=5 July 2017|language=en|date=2012-08-29}}</ref>

The book was published in 1963, along with the equally famous article, "Money and Business Cycles", which as with her first paper was published in the ''Review of Economics and Statistics''. They also wrote the books ''Monetary Statistics of the United States'' (1970) and ''Monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom: Their Relation to Income, Prices, and Interest Rates, 1867–1975'' (1982).<ref>{{cite web|title=NBER Working Papers and Publications by Anna J. Schwartz|url=https://www.nber.org/authors/anna_schwartz|website=www.nber.org|access-date=5 July 2017}}</ref>

The [[Great Depression|Depression]]-related chapter of ''A Monetary History'' was titled "[[Great Contraction|The Great Contraction]]" and was republished as a separate book in 1965. Some editions include an appendix<ref>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|author3=National Bureau of Economic Research|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&pg=PP1 |year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13794-0 |page=247|chapter=B. Bernanke's speech to M. Friedman}}</ref> in which the authors got an endorsement from an unlikely source at an event in their honor when [[Ben Bernanke]] made this statement:

<blockquote>"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."<ref>Ben Bernanke (November 8, 2002), [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm FederalReserve.gov: Conference to Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|author3=National Bureau of Economic Research|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13794-0 |page=247|chapter=B. Bernanke's speech to M. Friedman}}</ref></blockquote>

==Financial regulation==
She changed her opinion on [[financial regulation]]. Economists, bankers, and policymakers have long been concerned with the stability of the financial system. In a series of studies in the 1970s and 1980s, Schwartz emphasized that price level stability is essential for [[financial system]] stability.

Drawing on evidence from over two centuries, she demonstrated that business failures do not have major consequences for the economy if their effects are prevented from spreading through the financial system. Individual institutions should also be allowed to fail, not supported with taxpayers' money. In 1981, she gained public recognition for her role as staff director of the U.S. Gold Commission.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anna Jacobson Schwartz {{!}} American economist|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anna-Jacobson-Schwartz|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=6 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

== Other areas of work ==
There have been other areas of her work including the international transmission of [[inflation]] and of [[business cycles]], the role of government in [[monetary policy]], measuring the output of banks, and the behavior of [[interest rates]], on [[deflation]], on [[Monetary system|monetary standards]]. In an interview with Barrons in 2008, Schwartz said interventions such as injecting liquidity into markets and reacting to the credit crisis with ad hoc programs were not the answer. She has also done work outside of the United States. Some years ago the Department of Banking and Finance at [[City University, London|City University]], London, England, started a research project on the monetary history of the United Kingdom. For many years, she was an adviser to that project. She commented on papers, suggested lines of approach, came and spoke to students and at academic conferences where the work was discussed.

==Later work==
From 2002 to 2003, she served as president of the International Atlantic Economic Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaes.org/about/presidents.htm |title=List of Presidents of the IAES |access-date=2010-01-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621191356/http://www.iaes.org/about/presidents.htm |archive-date=June 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}. Accessed January 31, 2010.</ref> She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2007.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=July 25, 2014}}</ref> After 2007, she concentrated her efforts on researching U.S. official [[currency intervention|intervention in the foreign exchange market]] using Federal Reserve data from 1962.

She continued commenting on economic affairs until the financial crisis of the first decade of the 21st century, and criticized the government's response to it, such as [[Ben Bernanke]]'s support for bailouts and persistently-low interest rates.<ref>{{cite news |author=Brian M.

==Death==
She died on June 21, 2012, in her home in [[Manhattan]], New York, aged 96. Her husband Isaac predeceased her in 1999; they had been married for over 60 years. She was survived by four children (Jonathan, Joel, Naomi Pasachoff and Paula Berggren) as well as seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jr|first1=Robert D.
