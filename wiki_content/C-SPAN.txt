'''Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network''' ('''C-SPAN'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|ˌ|s|p|æ|n}}) is an American cable and satellite television network that was created in 1979 by the cable television industry as a nonprofit public service. It televises many proceedings of the United States federal government, as well as other public affairs programming. The C-SPAN network includes the television channels C-SPAN (focusing on the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]), C-SPAN2 (focusing on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]), and C-SPAN3 (airing other government hearings and related programming), the radio station [[WCSP-FM]], and a group of websites which provide [[streaming media]] and archives of C-SPAN programs. C-SPAN's television channels are available to approximately 100 million cable and satellite households within the United States, while WCSP-FM is broadcast on FM radio in [[Washington, D.C.]] and is available throughout the U.S. on [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio|SiriusXM]] via Internet streaming, and globally through apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.

The network televises U.S. political events, particularly live and "gavel-to-gavel" coverage of the U.S. Congress. C-SPAN also televises occasional proceedings of the [[Australian Parliament|Australian]], [[British Parliament|British]] (including the weekly [[Prime Minister's Questions]]), and [[Canadian Parliament]]s, as well as other major events worldwide. Its coverage of political and policy events is unmoderated, providing the audience with unfiltered information about politics and government. Non-political coverage includes historical programming, programs dedicated to non-fiction books, and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy. C-SPAN is a private, nonprofit organization funded by its cable and satellite affiliates, and it does not have advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations, or websites, nor does it solicit donations or pledges. The network operates independently, and neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of its programming content.

==History==
[[File:Brian_Lamb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brian Lamb]] (here in 2012) founded C-SPAN in 1979]]

===Development===
[[Brian Lamb]], C-SPAN's [[chairman]] and former [[chief executive officer]], conceived C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C., bureau chief of the cable industry trade magazine ''Cablevision''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Peer Participation and Software: What Mozilla Has to Teach Government |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=2010 |first=David R. |last=Booth |page=[https://archive.org/details/peerproductionso0000boot/page/81 81] |isbn=978-0-262-51461-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/peerproductionso0000boot/page/81 }}</ref> It was a time of rapid growth in the number of cable television channels available in the United States.<ref name=Barnhart/> Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], other public affairs events, and policy discussions.<ref name=NewsCheck>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/04/20/41591/cspan-the-other-washington-monument |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205063150/http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/04/20/41591/cspan-the-other-washington-monument |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 5, 2013 |title=C-SPAN: The Other Washington Monument |date=April 20, 2010 |work=tvnewscheck.com |publisher=News Check Media |access-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Legislative Television As Political Advertising: A Public Choice Approach |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |first=Franklin G. |last=Mixon |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-595-27086-6 |page=2}}</ref> Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network.

The purpose was to help viewers maintain a thorough view of politics and especially presidential campaigns. This was unlike television newscasts, which "[do] not really inform us about what the candidates mean to do with the power they ask of us."

C-SPAN was launched on March 19, 1979,<ref>{{cite news |title=Lamb opened government with C-SPAN |newspaper=[[Journal & Courier]] |location=Lafayette, Indiana |page=6A |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4R2X-FHC0-TWWX-S08V&csi=256482&oc=00240&perma=true |date=November 3, 2007 |access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> in time for the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives, beginning with a speech by then-[[Tennessee]] representative [[Al Gore]].<ref name=TWP/><ref>{{cite book |title=The C-SPAN Revolution |first=Stephen E. |last=Frantzich |author2=John Sullivan |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1996 |page=23 |isbn=0-8061-2870-4}}</ref> Upon its debut, only 3.5&nbsp;million homes were wired for C-SPAN,<ref name=Marcus>{{cite news |title=Confessions of a C-SPAN Junkie |author=[[Ruth Marcus (journalist)|Ruth Marcus]] |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A31 |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4BYF-XSH0-TW87-N26J&csi=8075&oc=00240&perma=true |date=March 18, 2004 |access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> and the network had just three employees.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite news |title=Power Player of the Week Brian Lamb |author=[[Chris Wallace]] |newspaper=[[Fox News Network]] |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4D3J-4CJ0-00MM-P4FJ&csi=174179&oc=00240&perma=true |date=August 15, 2004 |access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> For the first few years of its existence C-SPAN leased satellite time from the [[USA Network]] (originally known as Madison Square Garden Sports Network) and had approximately 9 hours of daily programming. On February 1, 1982 C-SPAN launched its own transponder and expanded its schedule to 16 hours a day. The arrangement with the USA Network was discontinued two months later.<ref>{{cite news |title=C -SPAN goes on  campaign trail |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/82-OCR/1982-01-25-BC-OCR-Page-0099.pdf |access-date=8 August 2021 |work=Broadcasting Magazine |date=January 25, 1982 |page=99}}</ref> C-SPAN began full-time operations on September 13, 1982.<ref>{{cite news |title=24 -hour milestone |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/82-OCR/1982-08-02-BC-OCR-Page-0008.pdf |access-date=12 August 2021 |work=Broadcasting Magazine |date=August 2, 1982 |page=8}}</ref> After C-SPAN was created and began broadcasting proceedings of the House of Representatives, the Senate wanted the same. After two years of discussion, Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]] introduced a resolution to allow cameras into the Senate, but it went nowhere. By 1986, Senator [[William L. Armstrong]] convinced his colleagues to allow cameras onto the Senate floor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Life and Career of William Armstrong {{!}} C-SPAN.org|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?14519-1/life-career-william-armstrong|access-date=June 25, 2020|website=www.c-span.org|language=en-us}}</ref>

The second C-SPAN channel, C-SPAN2, followed on June 2, 1986 when the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] permitted itself to be televised.

This needed to be done because—as the sit-in was done out of formal session and while the House was in official recess—the existing House cameras could not be utilized for coverage of the event by rule.

===Expansion and technology===
Since the late 1990s, C-SPAN has significantly expanded its online presence. In January 1997, C-SPAN began real-time streaming of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 on its website, the first time that Congress had been live streamed online.<ref name=Milestones/> To cover the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican]] conventions and the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|presidential debates]] of 2008, C-SPAN created two standalone websites: the Convention Hub and the Debate Hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2008/09/26/don%E2%80%99t-like-twitter%E2%80%99s-election-site-c-span-has-a-way-cooler-alternative-really/ |title=Don't like Twitter's Election Site?

C-SPAN began promoting audience interaction early in its history, by the regular incorporation of viewer telephone calls in its programming. It has since expanded into social media. In March 2009,<ref name=Milestones/> viewers began submitting questions live via [[Twitter]] to guests on C-SPAN's morning call-in show ''[[Washington Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/21/profiles-in-twittering-c_n_206431.html

In 2010, C-SPAN began a transition to [[high-definition television|high definition]] telecasts, planned to take place over an 18-month period.<ref name="NewsCheck"/> The network provided C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 in high definition on June 1, 2010, and C-SPAN3 in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/452819-IN_BRIEF.php |title=Cable Show Draws News of HD Channel Launches |date=May 18, 2010 |work=multichannel.com |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |access-date=December 3, 2010}}</ref>

As part of the network's 40th anniversary, C-SPAN instituted the second logo change in the network's history on March 18, 2019.

==Programming==

===Senate and House of Representatives===
The C-SPAN network's core programming is live coverage of the U.S. House and Senate, with the C-SPAN channel emphasizing the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action.<ref name="TWP"/> C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides uninterrupted live coverage of the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=Hodges/> With coverage of the House and Senate, viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress.<ref name=Newswire/> Important debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf conflict]] during 1991, and the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|House impeachment vote and Senate trial]] of President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998 and 1999 as well as the [[First impeachment of Donald Trump|impeachment proceedings of President Trump in 2019 and 2020]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=C-SPAN's Impeachment Coverage {{!}} C-SPAN.org|url=https://www.c-span.org/impeachment/|access-date=July 4, 2020|website=www.c-span.org}}</ref><ref name=Ragsdale/> When the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming and recordings of previous events.<ref name=Newswire>{{cite press release |title=C-SPAN2 to be Added to PRIMESTAR's Channel Lineup |publisher=C-SPAN |date=December 4, 1996}}</ref>

===Public affairs===
The public affairs coverage on the C-SPAN networks other than the House and Senate floor debates is wide-ranging. C-SPAN is considered a useful source of information for journalists, lobbyists, educators and government officials as well as casual viewers interested in politics, due to its unedited coverage of political events.<ref name=Wallace/> C-SPAN has been described by media observers as a "window into the world of Washington politics" and it characterizes its own mission as being "to provide public access to the political process".<ref name=Harrington/><ref name=AboutC-SPAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/About/About-C-SPAN/ | title=About C-SPAN |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN | access-date=January 25, 2011}}</ref> The networks cover U.S. political campaigns, including the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] in their entirety.

With its public affairs programming, C-SPAN intends to offer different viewpoints by allowing time for multiple opinions to be discussed on a given topic. For example, in 2004 C-SPAN intended to televise a speech by [[Holocaust]] [[historian]] [[Deborah Lipstadt]] adjacent to a speech by [[Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]], who had [[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt]] for [[libel]] in the [[United Kingdom]] four years earlier; C-SPAN was criticized for its use of the word "balance" to describe the plan to cover both Lipstadt and Irving.<ref>{{cite web |title=C-SPAN's David Irving contretemps |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/individuals/david_irving/irving_update_20050413.htm |date=April 13, 2005 |work=adl.org |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |access-date=July 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801105915/http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/individuals/david_irving/irving_update_20050413.htm |archive-date=August 1, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=Cohen05>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN's Balance of the Absurd |first=Richard|last=Cohen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35346-2005Mar14.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 15, 2005 |access-date=June 11, 2013}}</ref> When Lipstadt ended media access to her speech, C-SPAN canceled coverage of both.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lipstadt/Irving Libel Trial |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Lipst |work=c-spanvideo.org |publisher=C-SPAN |access-date=March 22, 2011}}</ref>

The network strives for [[Objectivity (journalism)|neutrality]] and a lack of [[bias]]; in all programming when on-camera hosts are present their role is simply to facilitate and explain proceedings to the viewer.<ref name=Barnhart/> Due to this policy, C-SPAN hosts do not state their names on television.<ref name="Wallace"/>

===Special programming===
C-SPAN has occasionally produced [[spin-off (media)|spinoff]] programs from ''Booknotes'' focusing on specific topics. In 1994, ''Booknotes'' collaborated with Lincoln scholar [[Harold Holzer]] to produce [[The Lincoln–Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|re-creations]] of the seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858|Lincoln–Douglas debates]].<ref name=Rust>{{cite news |title=Americans Speak Up on Talk TV |first=Michael|last=Rust |newspaper=[[Insight on the News]] |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-20204516/americans-speak-up-on-talk-tv |date=February 9, 1998 |access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> Several years later, [[The Alexis de Tocqueville Tour: Exploring Democracy in America|a similar series]] retraced the journey of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] described in ''[[Democracy in America]]''.<ref name=Prial>{{cite news |title=After Many Million Pages, 'Booknotes' Ends Its Run |author=Frank J.

During 2008 and 2009, as part of programming specially commissioned for the 200th anniversary of the birth of [[Abraham Lincoln]], C-SPAN produced a series titled ''Lincoln 200 Years'', which featured episodes on a variety of topics relating to the life of Lincoln including his career, his homes and his opinions of slavery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/lincoln200years/video/?title=cspan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715180934/http://legacy.c-span.org/lincoln200years/video/?title=cspan |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |title=Lincoln 200 Years |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN |access-date=February 23, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Run up to Lincoln's Thursday 200th Birthday celebration: C-SPAN Lincoln specials |author=[[Lynn Sweet]] |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/02/run_up_to_lincolns_thursday_20.html |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=February 6, 2009 |access-date=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017005049/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/02/run_up_to_lincolns_thursday_20.html |archive-date=October 17, 2011 }}</ref>

===Radio broadcasts===
In addition to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WCSP-FM]] (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C. area with all three cable network feeds airing via [[HD Radio]] subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio.<ref name="Babington"/> Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via [[application software|apps]] for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices.<ref name=C-SPANRadio>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/C-SPAN-Radio/How-to-Listen-to-C-SPAN-Radio/ |title=How to Listen to C-SPAN Radio |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN |access-date=June 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104200941/http://www.c-span.org/C-SPAN-Radio/How-to-Listen-to-C-SPAN-Radio/ |archive-date=January 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=Relax>{{cite news |title=The most popular iPhone news applications |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=March 23, 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/the-most-popular-iphone-news-applications-1927640.html |access-date=October 11, 2010 |archive-date=September 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925044710/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/the-most-popular-iphone-news-applications-1927640.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it does offer some audio simulcasts of programs such as ''Washington Journal''.<ref name=Kaltenbach>{{cite news |title=New station features processes of government; Radio: WCSP-FM (90.1) serves up large doses of public policy as it's happening, but more selectively than C-SPAN. |first=Chris|last=Kaltenbach |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-02-22/features/1998053072_1_c-span-spence-public-policy |date=February 22, 1998 |access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> Unique programming on the radio station includes [[oral history|oral histories]], and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments.

Prior to the initiation of the C-SPAN Video Library, websites such as [[Metavid]] and voterwatch.org hosted House and Senate video records, however C-SPAN contested Metavid's usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage. The result was Metavid's removal of portions of the archive produced with C-SPAN's cameras, while preserving its archive of government-produced content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki/index.php/Democratizing_the_Archive:_An_Open_Interface_for_Mediation#Motivations_for_Metavid_and_its_Contested_Legality |title=Democratizing the Archive: An Open Interface for Mediation |publisher=Metavid |access-date=October 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605053154/http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki/index.php/Democratizing_the_Archive%3A_An_Open_Interface_for_Mediation |archive-date=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House and Senate proceedings.

In 2008, C-SPAN's online political coverage was expanded just prior to the elections, with the introduction of three special pages on the C-SPAN website: the C-SPAN Convention Hubs and C-SPAN Debate Hub, which offered video of major events as well as discussion from weblogs and social media about the major party conventions and candidate debates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nms.com/pressroom/entry/c-span-engages-new-media-strategies-for-innovative-online-convention-covera/ |title=C-SPAN Engages New Media Strategies for Innovative Online Convention Coverage |date=August 12, 2008 |work=nms.com |publisher=[[New Media Strategies]] |access-date=December 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810070530/http://nms.com/pressroom/entry/c-span-engages-new-media-strategies-for-innovative-online-convention-covera/ |archive-date=August 10, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gadgetreviews/exclusive-c-span-launches-gadget-fueled-debate-hub-as-social-political-destination/381 |title=EXCLUSIVE: C-SPAN Launches Gadget-Fueled 'Debate Hub' as Social, Political Destination |first=Andrew|last=Nusca |date=September 25, 2008 |work=zdnet.com |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |access-date=December 3, 2010}}</ref> C-SPAN brought back the Convention Hub for the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]].<ref name=Fitzpatrick13>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN's Online Hub Provides Raw Convention Coverage |first=Alex|last=Fitzpatrick |url=http://mashable.com/2012/08/23/cspan-convention-hub/ |newspaper=[[Mashable]] |date=August 23, 2012 |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref>

On July 29, 2014, C-SPAN announced that it would begin [[TV Everywhere|restricting access to the live feeds]] of the main channel, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer, citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to its reliance on carriage fees from cable and satellite providers. However, it will continue to allow all government meetings, hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C-SPAN Video Library without requiring an authenticated login by a provider; live audio feeds of all three channels are also available for free through the network's [[mobile app]]. The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates, citing the fact that C-SPAN was designed as a public service.<ref>{{cite news|title=C-SPAN to require TV subscription for some programs|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/07/29/cspan-live-streaming-subsctription/13315733/|first=Adam|last=Ganucheau|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 29, 2014|access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=C-SPAN limiting access to its online channels|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/213714-c-span-limiting-access-to-its-online-channels|first=Julian|last=Hattem|date=July 29, 2014|access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref> As of December 2019, C-SPAN has begun advertising on its online videos, with YouTube-style advertisements that can be skipped after 5 seconds.<ref>{{cite news|title=C-SPAN reworks its monetization model|url=https://www.nexttv.com/features/c-span-reworks-its-monetization-model/|first=John|last=Eggerton|newspaper=[[Multichannel News]]|date=October 19, 2020|access-date=December 9, 2020}}</ref>
