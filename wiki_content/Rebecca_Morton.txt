Morton held positions as professor in multiple universities. She started as visiting assistant professor in the College of Business Administration at [[Tulane University]] 1983-1984, followed by a position as assistant professor in the Department of Economics and Finance 1984–1985 at the [[University of New Orleans]]. She worked in the Department of Economics and Finance at [[Nicholls State University]] from 1985 to 1991, becoming tenured as associate professor in 1990.  In 1991 Morton moved officially into political science as an assistant professor at [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M university]] in the Political Science department until 1993, when she started a position as associate professor in the Political Science department at the [[University of Iowa]] until 2000. From 2001 to 2020, she held a full professor position in the Department of Politics at [[New York University]]. She had a joint appointment between [[New York University]] New York and [[New York University Abu Dhabi]].<ref name=":0" />

Morton founded the Winter Experimental Social Science Institute (WESSI)<ref name="Dhabi">{{Cite web|url=https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/centers-labs-and-projects/social-science-experimental-laboratory/winter-institute.html|title=Winter Institute|last=Dhabi|first=NYU Abu|website=New York University Abu Dhabi|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> and has founded and directed the Social Sciences Experimental Laboratory (SSEL)<ref name="nyuad.nyu.edu">{{Cite web|url=https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/centers-labs-and-projects/social-science-experimental-laboratory/researchers.html|title=Researchers|last=Dhabi|first=NYU Abu|website=New York University Abu Dhabi|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> at New York University Abu Dhabi.

== Research ==
Morton's research contributed in three main areas in political science: (1) [[American politics (political science)|American Politics]], (2) Political Economy, and (3) [[Experimental political science|Experimental Political Science]] Methodology. In [[American politics (political science)|American Politics]], Morton's work advanced understanding on how institutions and procedures affect voting outcomes. In her book, ''Learning by Voting: Sequence in Presidential Primaries and Other Elections'' (University of Michigan Press, 2001) and article "Information Asymmetries and Simultaneous versus Sequential Voting" (1999), co-authored with Kenneth Williams, they explore the effects of voting sequentially (such as presidential primaries in the United States or elections with mail-in and absentee voting) on the amount of information available to voters and the candidates that voters select.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Learning by Voting|url=https://www.press.umich.edu/16679/learning_by_voting|journal=University of Michigan Press}}</ref> In her 2007 work with Marco Battaglini and Thomas Palfrey, "Efficiency, Equity, and Timing of Voting Mechanisms",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Battaglini|first=Marco|last2=Morton|first2=Rebecca|last3=Palfrey|first3=Thomas|date=2007|title=Efficiency, Equity, and Timing of Voting Mechanisms|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=101|issue=3|pages=409–424|jstor=27644457|doi=10.1017/S0003055407070281|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/79665/1/sswp1262.pdf}}</ref> they compare how different voting rules – simultaneous and sequential voting – affect information aggregation and the distribution of the costs of voting among voters. Morton's work also explores how different institutions of [[Primary election|primaries]] (closed vs. open) affect the selection of ideologically extreme candidates in "Primary Election Systems and Representation" (1998) with Elizabeth Gerber<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gerber|first=Elisabeth R.|last2=Morton|first2=Rebecca B.|date=1998|title=Primary Election Systems and Representation|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization|volume=14|issue=2|pages=304–324|jstor=765107|doi=10.1093/jleo/14.2.304}}</ref>  and how [[multimember district]] elections with different voting rules – straight and [[cumulative voting]] – affect the representation of minority candidates "Minority Representation in Multimember Districts" (1998) with Elizabeth Gerber and Thomas Reitz<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gerber|first=Elisabeth R.|last2=Morton|first2=Rebecca B.|last3=Rietz|first3=Thomas A.|date=March 1998|title=Minority Representation in Multimember Districts|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=92|issue=1|pages=127–144|doi=10.2307/2585933|issn=0003-0554|jstor=2585933}}</ref> and "Majority Requirements and Minority Representation" also coauthored with Reitz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/annam63&div=35&g_sent=1&casa_token=|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>

Morton proposed the group-based theory of turnout to explain the "paradox of not voting", which refers to the fact that people turn out to vote even though the when expected benefit does not seem to outweigh the costs of engaging in the activity, given that an individual's vote has close to zero chances of affecting electoral outcomes. In a series of publications,&nbsp;she argues that positive turnout may be partially explained by incorporating the role of groups into the voter's calculation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=R. B.|date=June 1987|title=A group majority voting model of public good provision|journal=Social Choice and Welfare|volume=4|issue=2|pages=117–131|doi=10.1007/bf00450994|issn=0176-1714}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filer|first=John E.|last2=Kenny|first2=Lawrence W.|last3=Morton|first3=Rebecca B.|date=1993|title=Redistribution, Income, and Voting|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=1|pages=63–87|doi=10.2307/2111524|jstor=2111524}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filer|first=John E.|last2=Kenny|first2=Lawrence W.|last3=Morton|first3=Rebecca B.|date=October 1991|title=Voting Laws, Educational Policies, and Minority Turnout|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=34|issue=2, Part 1|pages=371–393|doi=10.1086/467229|issn=0022-2186}}</ref> Her theory posits that when the expected benefit of voting is calculated at the group level – with the voter being a member of the group – the rational individual has an incentive to turn out and vote.

In the area of Political Economy, Morton was also a pioneer&nbsp;in advocating for empirical tests of the formal models in political economy. She made a noteworthy effort to bridge the gap between the formal mathematical models of voting and empirical methods, mainly through laboratory experiments, as stated in the Introductory Chapter of the Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ES5PUvvShF8C&pg=PR5&dq=Druckman+et+al+2011#v=onepage&q=Druckman%20et%20al%202011&f=false|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|last=Druckman|first=James N.|last2=Green|first2=Donald P.|last3=Kuklinski|first3=James H.|last4=Lupia|first4=Arthur|date=2011-06-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521192125}}</ref> In her book, ''Methods and Models: A Guide to the Empirical Analysis of Formal Models in Political Science'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), Morton provides a detailed and thoughtful guideline for scholars who engage in empirical analysis with formal models.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/methods-and-models/43ACA5319B519CDC78EF639744D5F01A|title=Methods and Models|last=Morton|first=Rebecca B.|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511612473|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511612473}}</ref> Morton's research used laboratory experiments to test various formal models of voting rules on electoral outcomes.

Morton's substantive expertise in the application of experimental methods in political science revolved around using experiments to analyze the effect of electoral systems and voting, writing a coauthored chapter entitled "Electoral Systems and Strategic Voting (Laboratory Election Experiments)"&nbsp;in the Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/research-methods-politics/cambridge-handbook-experimental-political-science?format=PB&isbn=9780521174558|title=Cambridge handbook experimental political science {{!}} Research methods in politics|website=Cambridge University Press|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> Morton was considered to be one of an initial cohort of political scientists to advocate for the expansion of the use of experiments from the life sciences to political science, contributing the Chapter "Experimentation in Political Science" (2008) to the Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morton|first=Rebecca B.|last2=Williams|first2=Kenneth C.|date=2008-08-21|title=Experimentation in Political Science|volume=1|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199286546.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199286546-e-14|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199286546.001.0001|isbn=9780199286546}}</ref> &nbsp;
