'''Eugene M. Kulischer''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Михайлович Кулишер}}; 1881–1956) was a [[Russian-American]] [[sociologist]]; an authority on [[demography]], migration and manpower; and an expert on Russia. He also coined the phrase "[[displaced persons]]s"<ref>A. J. Jaffe (April 1962), “Notes on the Population Theory of Eurgene M. Kulischer”. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2:187-206.</ref> and was among the first to seek to document the number of persons lost in the [[Holocaust]] and the subsequent migrations of millions of Europeans after [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Kiev]] in 1881, he died in [[Washington, DC]], on April 2, 1956. Like his father, Michael Kulischer, a noted Russian historian, he insisted that no migration occurs in isolation.  Along with his brother Alexander, he worked on ''Kriegs-und Wanderzüge, Weltgeschichte als Völkerbewegung'' (War and Migration; World History as Peoples' Movements), (Berlin-Leipzig, Walter de Gruyter, 1932) and ''Europe on the Move: War and Population Changes, 1917-1947'', which were intended to show that migrations and wars go hand-in-hand.

In a way, Kulischer was himself an example of a displaced person. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] (1917), he fled Russia for [[Germany]] in 1920.  Following the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]], he fled Germany for [[Denmark]]. In 1936 he went to [[Paris]]. In 1941, he "crossed clandestinely the demarcation line between the occupied and the unoccupied parts of [[France]]" and went to the [[United States]]. His brother Alexander, "when crossing the demarcation line, was arrested by Pétain's [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and died in a [[concentration camp]]".<ref>Eugene M. Kulischer (1948), ''Europe on the Move: War and Population Changes, 1917-1947''. Columbia University Press</ref>

==Work==
In the [[United States]], he “served successively as consultant or staff member of the [[International Labor Office]], the [[Office of Strategic Services]], the [[Bureau of the Census]], the [[Department of the Army]], and the [[Library of Congress]]. His major works include ''The Displacement of Population in Europe'' (Montreal, 1943), and ''Europe on the Move'' (New York, 1948)".<ref>Obituary (April 1956), "Eugene M. Kulischer." ''Population Index,'' Vol. 22:100</ref> Ay the heart of his work is a simple axiom: individual short-distance movements have a combined action that creates great population shifts.<ref>Europe on the Move, 1948</ref> An expansion of that concept is his oft-quoted dictum:
<blockquote>
"The migratory movement is at once perpetual, partial, and universal.  It never ceases, it affects every people, but at a given moment it sets in motion only a small number of each population; hence the illusion of immobility. In fact, there is never a moment of immobility for any people, because no migration remains isolated".<ref>Europe on the Move, p. 9</ref>
</blockquote>

With that paragraph, he created a bridge linking the migration of individuals and the demographic fact of great migrations. He and his brother, along with millions of others, tried to put [[Europe]] as far behind them as they could on the eve of World War II. All of them had their own reasons.  Some left because of their ethnicity, others because of their religion. Some left because of their politics, others because they feared the upheaval that they knew to loom on the horizon.

For Kulischer and his brother, their reasons for moving were simple. They were [[Jewish]] and forecast the outcome of [[World War II]] based on demographic trends. They reasoned that the Soviets and the Germans were on a collision course and that the Germans would lose.<ref>Europe on the Move, p. vi</ref>

"Man's history," Kulischer remarked, "is the story of his wanderings".<ref>Europe on the Move, p. 8</ref> From the standpoint of the [[sociology of knowledge]], he added, “Most scholars are rooted in their environment. They differ in their ability to outgrow it”.<ref>Jaffe, quoted on page 193</ref> Combining those two statements applied for him and many of his peers who lived as exiles abroad and grew as they moved, such the [[Austrian Social Scientists in Exile 1933-1945]].<ref>Müller, Reinhard and Christian Fleck (2000), [http://agso.uni-graz.at/soz/oes/oes_e.htm "Österreichische Soziologinnen und Soziologen im Exil 1933 bis 1945"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520044308/http://agso.uni-graz.at/soz/oes/oes_e.htm |date=2006-05-20}}, University of Graz.</ref>

As Jackson and Howe recently observed in evaluating the migrations' impact:
<blockquote>
E. M. Kulischer once reminded his readers that in A.D. 900 Berlin had no Germans, Moscow had no Russians, Budapest had no Hungarians, Madrid was a Moorish settlement, and Constantinople had hardly any Turks. He added that the Normans had not yet settled in Great Britain and before the sixteenth century there were no Europeans living in North or South America, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa.
