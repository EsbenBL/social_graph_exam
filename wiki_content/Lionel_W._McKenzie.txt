'''Lionel Wilfred McKenzie''' (January 26, 1919 – October 12, 2010<ref name="obit">{{cite news|title=Pioneering Economist Lionel McKenzie, 91|url=http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3700|access-date=15 October 2010|newspaper=University of Rochester|date=13 October 2010}}</ref>) was an American economist. He was the Wilson Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Rochester]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Economics Department Faculty |url=http://www.econ.rochester.edu/Faculty/Mckenzie.html |work=rochester.edu |publisher=University of Rochester |access-date=15 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003184236/http://www.econ.rochester.edu/Faculty/Mckenzie.html |archive-date= 3 October 2010 }}</ref> He was born in [[Montezuma, Georgia]]. He completed undergraduate studies at [[Duke University]] in 1939 and subsequently moved to [[Oxford]] that year as a [[Rhodes Scholar]]. McKenzie worked with the [[Cowles Commission]] while it was in Chicago and served as an assistant professor at Duke from 1948–1957. Having received his Ph.D. at [[Princeton University]] in 1956, McKenzie moved to Rochester where he was responsible for the establishment of the graduate program in economics.

McKenzie has been the recipient of numerous professional awards, including the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1973, election to the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1978, the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1995 and honorary doctorates from [[Keio University]] in 1998 and [[Kyoto University]] in 2004. The latter three reflect the success of his many Japanese students. McKenzie has been referred to as "the father of the mathematical economists in Japan".

==Work==
His research focused on [[general equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] and capital theory. Although most widely known as a co-creator of the [[Arrow–Debreu–McKenzie model]], he also published a book and numerous research papers, including:

* "On Equilibrium in Graham's Model of World Trade and Other Competitive Systems", ''Econometrica'', 1954.
* "Demand Theory Without a Utility Index", ''The Review of Economic Studies'', 1957.
* "On the Existence of General Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy", ''Econometrica'', 1959.
* {{cite journal|title=Turnpike Theory|journal=Econometrica|volume=44|issue=5|jstor=1911532|pages=841–865|issn=00129682|doi=10.2307/1911532|year=1976|last1=McKenzie|first1=Lionel W.}}, 1976
* "The Classical Theorem on Existence of Competitive Equilibrium", ''Econometrica'', 1981.
* "Turnpike Theory, Discounted Utility, and the von Neumann Facet" ''Journal of Economic Theory'', 1983.{{doi|10.1016/0022-0531(83)90111-4}}
* "General Equilibrium", ''The [[New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', 1987, v. 2, pp.&nbsp;498–512.
* "[[Turnpike theory|Turnpike Theory]]", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', 1987, v. 4, pp.&nbsp;712–20.
* ''Classical General Equilibrium Theory'', The MIT Press, 2002.

The 1954 paper provided the first proof of the existence of a [[general equilibrium]], using [[Kakutani's fixed point theorem]]. Another proof, by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]], was published in the next issue of the same journal.

The 1957 paper appears to include the first derivation of [[Shephard's lemma]] in the context of consumer theory.

In 2014, Till Düppe and [[E. Roy Weintraub]] published a book arguing that McKenzie was unfairly excluded from the Nobel Prizes which both Arrow and Debreu won for work on general equilibrium theory.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Till |last1=Düppe |first2=E.
