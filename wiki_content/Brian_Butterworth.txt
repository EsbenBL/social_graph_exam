'''Brian Lewis Butterworth''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 3 January 1944) is emeritus professor of [[cognitive neuropsychology]] in the [[UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience|Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience]] at [[University College London]].<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychlangsci/staff/emeritistaff Emeritus Staff] – UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, accessed 30 October 2012</ref> His research has ranged from [[speech error]]s and [[Filled pause|pauses]], [[short-term memory]] deficits, [[dyslexia]], [[Reading (process)|reading]] both in [[alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] and Chinese, and [[Mathematical psychology|mathematics]] and [[dyscalculia]]. His book ''The Mathematical Brain''<ref>Butterworth, B. (1999).  ''The Mathematical Brain''.  London: Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-333-76610-1}}</ref> has been translated into four languages. He was Editor-in-Chief of ''[[Linguistics (journal)|Linguistics]]'' (1978–1983) and a founding editor of the journals ''Language and Cognitive Processes'' and ''Mathematical Cognition''. He is a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].

In 1984 he diagnosed President [[Ronald Reagan]] on the basis of speech errors in his [[1984 United States presidential election|presidential re-election]] speeches in an article in the [[Sunday Times]] as having [[Alzheimer's disease]] ten years before this was formally identified.<ref>''The Sunday Times'', 4 November 1984</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Subitizing experiment==
[[Subitizing]] concerns the ability to instantly identify the number of items without [[counting]]. Collections of four or below are usually subitised with collections of larger numbers being counted. Brian Butterworth designed an experiment that ran as an interactive exhibit at the [[At-Bristol|Explore-At-Bristol]] [[science museum]] to find whether subitising differed between women and men. Participants were asked to estimate as fast as they could between one and 10 dots and press the answer on a [[touch screen]]. How long they took—their [[reaction time]]—was measured. Over 18,000 people took part—the largest number ever to take part in a [[Cognitive science of mathematics|mathematical cognition]] experiment.<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3098340.stm BBC:Women beat men in maths test]</ref> He announced his finding that women were better than men at subitising at the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s 2003 annual [[science festival]].<ref name="BBC"/> He also found that people were six per cent faster on calculating the number of dots if they were presented on the left side of the screen (and so right sided [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralised]] in the brain) but only if there were five or more and so counted.<ref name="BBC"/><ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4154-women-faster-at-instant-counting.html New Scientist 11 September 2003]</ref>
