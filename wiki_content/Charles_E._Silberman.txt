'''Charles Eliot Silberman''' (January 31, 1925 &ndash; February 5, 2011)<ref name="Fox">{{cite web|author=Margalit Fox|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/us/14silberman.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries|title=Charles E. Silberman, Who Wrote About Racism in the U.S., Dies at 86|work=New York Times|date=13 February 2011}}</ref> was an American journalist and author.

Silberman was born in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. After service in the Pacific during [[World War II]], he gained a B.A. in Economics from [[Columbia University]] in 1946 and also undertook graduate studies at Columbia. Subsequently, he taught at Columbia and [[City College of New York]] before joining ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in 1953 where he remained until the early 1970s.<ref name="Fox"/>

He was the author of ''Criminal Violence, Criminal Justice'' (1978), a study of crime and the [[United States|American]] [[criminal justice system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/subjects/CriminalViolenceCriminalJusticeBook|website=Harper's magazine|title=Charles E. Silberman}}</ref>

Silberman used econometric methods to measure the effectiveness in terms of criminal [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]] of two factors: the degree of punishment; and the probability of apprehension. A simple "expected loss" model would predict that deterrent effect would depend only on the result of multiplying the penalty by the probability of it occurring. Silberman concluded that contrary to this model, the likelihood of punishment had a greater effect in most situations. Silberman also stated, "Crime does more than expose the weakness in [[sociology|social relationships]]; it undermines the [[society|social order]] itself, by destroying the assumptions on which it is based."

Silberman's book ''Crisis in the Classroom: The Remaking of American Education'' is regarded as one of the leading investigations into and critiques of the performance of the American educational system and has been praised for its scope and insight.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rodney P.
