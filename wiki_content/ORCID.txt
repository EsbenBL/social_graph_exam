The '''ORCID''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|k|ɪ|d|audio=ORCID pronunciation - 2019-11-17 - Andy Mabbett.ogg}}; '''Open Researcher and Contributor ID''') is a nonproprietary [[alphanumeric]] code to uniquely identify authors and contributors of [[scholarly communication]]<ref> Sources:

This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the [[scientific literature]] or publications in the [[humanities]] can be hard to recognize as most [[personal name]]s are not unique, they can change ([[Maiden and married names|such as with marriage]]), have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different [[writing system]]s. It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to tax ID numbers, that are created for content-related entities on digital networks by [[digital object identifier]]s (DOIs).<ref>[http://www.crossref.org/01company/orcid.html Crossref & ORCID].</ref>

==Uses==
ORCID aims to provide a persistent code for humans,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossref.org/community/orcid/|title=ORCID auto-update|first=Isaac|last=Farley|website=Crossref}}</ref> to address the problem that a particular author's contributions to scholarly communication can be hard to recognize as most personal names are not unique and thus multiple persons of the same name could contribute to the same scholarly field, even from the same institutional department. Further, names can change ([[Maiden and married names|such as with marriage]]); there are cultural differences in [[Personal name#Name order|name ordering conventions]]; journals make inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations, [[Suffix (name)|name suffixes]], and middle initials; and employ different [[writing system]]s.

The ORCID organization, ORCID Inc., offers registered users to maintain "a constantly updated ‘digital curriculum vitae’ providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list,"<ref name="Nature09">Editorial (2009).

ORCID iDs are a subset of the [[International Standard Name Identifier]] (ISNI),<ref name="ISNI-ORCID">{{cite web|url=http://www.isni.org/isni_and_orcid |title=ISNI and ORCID |publisher=ISNI |access-date=29 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304210352/http://www.isni.org/isni_and_orcid |archive-date=4 March 2013 }}</ref> under the auspices of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (as ISO 27729), and the two organizations are cooperating.

Both ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers,<ref name="ORCID.ISNI" /> using the digits 0–9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens.<ref name="Asakura" /> The final character, which may also be a letter "X" representing the value "10" (for example, [[Stephen Hawking]]'s ORCID iD is <nowiki>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X</nowiki><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X|title=Stephen Hawking (0000-0002-9079-593X) - ORCID {{!}} Connecting Research and Researchers|last=ORCID|website=orcid.org|language=en|access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>), is a MOD 11-2 [[check digit]] conforming to the [[ISO 7064|ISO/IEC 7064:2003]] standard.

=== National implementations ===
	 
In several countries, consortia, including government bodies as partners, are operating at a national level to implement ORCID.
