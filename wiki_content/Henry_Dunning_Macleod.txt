He was employed in Scotland on the work of poor-law reform, and devoted himself to the study of economics. In 1856 he published his ''Theory and Practice of Banking'',<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|title=The Theory and Practice of Banking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sm87AAAAcAAJ|year=1855|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|volume=Volume 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|volume=Volume 2|title=The Theory and Practice of Banking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkYuAAAAYAAJ|year=1866|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, & Dyer}}</ref> in 1858 ''Elements of Political Economy'',<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|title=The Elements of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqNCAAAAcAAJ|year=1858|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts}}</ref> and in 1859 ''A Dictionary of Political Economy''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|title=A Dictionary of Political Economy: Biographical, Bibliographical, Historical, and Practical|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIRIAAAAYAAJ|year=1863|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green}}</ref> In 1873 his ''Principles of Economical Philosophy''<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning|last=Macleod|title=The Principles of Economical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SToVAAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume 1|year=1872|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|title=The Principles of Economical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJpAAAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume 2 |year=1879|publisher=Longmans, Green}}</ref> appeared, and in 1889 his ''The Theory of Credit''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|title=The Theory of Credit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgYaAAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume 1|year=1889|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning|last= Macleod|title=The Theory of Credit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_IwqAAAAYAAJ|volume=Volume 2, Part 1|year=1890|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Dunning |last=Macleod|title=The Theory of Credit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiIXAQAAIAAJ|volume=Volume 2, Part 2|year=1891|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company}}</ref> Between 1868 and 1870 he was employed by the government in digesting and codifying the law of [[bills of exchange]].

Macleod's principal contribution to the study of economics consists in his work on the theory of [[Credit (finance)|credit]], to which he was the first to give due prominence. A major feature of his work was to create a theory of money starting from a theory of credit instead of the usual reverse path. In ''The Theory of Credit'' he says: "Money and Credit are essentially of the same nature: Money being only the highest and most general form of Credit" (p.&nbsp;82).  Macleod's Credit Theory of Money influenced [[Alfred Mitchell-Innes]] and later work of the modern [[Chartalist]]s. [[John R. Commons]] considered Macleod's work to be the foundation of [[Institutional economics]].<ref name="isbn0-88738-797-7">{{cite book |author=Commons, John Rogers |title=Institutional Economics: Its Place in Political Economy |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wFHlGU70ZAC&pg=PA399 |pages=399 |isbn=0-88738-797-7 }}</ref>

In his magnum opus, ''History of Economic Analysis'', [[Joseph Schumpeter]] tells us: "The English leaders from Thornton to Mill did explore the credit structure, and in doing so made discoveries that constitute their chief contributions to monetary analysis but could not be adequately stated in terms of the monetary theory of credit. But they failed to go through with the theoretical implications of these discoveries, that is, to build up a systematic credit theory of money..." Then, he adds a footnote: "We might see the outlines of such a theory in the works of Macleod. But they remained so completely outside of the pale of recognized economics..." (Page 718). Then, in page 1,115 Schumpeter concludes: "Henry Dunning Macleod [...] was an economist of many merits who somehow failed to achieve recognition, or even to be taken quite seriously, owing to his inability to put his many good ideas in a professionally acceptable form."

It was Macleod who coined in 1858 the term "[[Gresham's law]]".

For a judicious discussion of the value of Macleod's writings, see an article on "The Revolt against Orthodox Economics" in the ''Quarterly Review'' for October 1901 (no. 388).<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Revolt against Orthodox Economics |journal= The Quarterly Review  |date= October 1901 |issue= 388 |url=https://archive.org/stream/quarterlyreview10murrgoog#page/n356/mode/2up |pages=345–371 |publisher= Leonard Scott Publication Company and John Murray|place= New York and London|access-date=17 July 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}</ref>
