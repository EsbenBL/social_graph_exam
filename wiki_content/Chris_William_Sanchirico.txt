[http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/reviews/Myerson.pdf Review], ''[[Constitutional Political Economy]]'', 14, 71–77, 2003 ("mathematical modes of reasoning...are still exotic in law, and commonplace in economics.").</ref> He has published extensively in preeminent journals in the fields of tax law and policy, [[evidence]], [[Procedural law|procedure]], [[law and economics]], [[public economics]], [[game theory]], and mathematical economics.<ref>[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2205 Author Page for Chris William Sanchirico :: SSRN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has presented his work widely at law schools, economics departments, business schools, and statistics departments.
