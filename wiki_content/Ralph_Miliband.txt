'''Ralph Miliband''' (born '''Adolphe Miliband'''; 7 January 1924 – 21 May 1994) was a British [[sociologist]]. He has been described as "one of the best known academic [[Marxism|Marxists]] of his generation", in this manner being compared with [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Perry Anderson]].<ref name="Blackledge">{{cite magazine|last=Blackledge|first=Paul|date=4 January 2011|title=Labourism and socialism: Ralph Miliband's Marxism|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=700&issue=129|magazine=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]|publisher=[[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]|issue=129|issn=1754-4653|access-date=13 November 2013|archive-date=3 November 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103210727/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=700&issue=129}}</ref>

Miliband was born in Belgium to working-class [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] immigrants. He fled to Britain in 1940 with his father, to avoid persecution when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium. Learning to speak English and enrolling at the [[London School of Economics]], he became involved in [[left-wing politics]] and made a personal commitment to the cause of socialism at the grave of [[Karl Marx]]. After serving in the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[Second World War]], he settled in London in 1946 and naturalised as a British subject in 1948.

By the 1960s, he was a prominent member of the [[New Left]] movement in Britain, which was critical of established socialist governments in the [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe (the [[Eastern Bloc]]). He published several books on [[Marxist theory]] and the [[criticism of capitalism]], such as ''Parliamentary Socialism'' (1961), ''The State in Capitalist Society'' (1969), and ''Marxism and Politics'' (1977).

Both of his sons, [[David Miliband|David]] and [[Ed Miliband]], went on to become senior members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] following their father's death. David was the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2007 to 2010, whilst Ed became [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|Energy and Climate Change Secretary]] and was later elected [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|party leader]], serving between 2010 and 2015.

==Life and career==
===Early life: 1924–1940===
Miliband's parents had grown up in the impoverished Jewish quarter of [[Warsaw]], Poland. Samuel Miliband had been a member of the socialist [[Jewish Labour Bund]] in Warsaw.<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB|title=Miliband, Ralph [formerly Adolphe] (1924–1994)|author=Michael Newman| doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/55138 | year = 2004 }}</ref>

In 1922, they were among the Polish Jews who migrated westward, to [[Brussels]] in Belgium, after the [[First World War]].<ref name="Ali">{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Tariq|author-link=Tariq Ali|date=24 May 1994|title=Obituary: Professor Ralph Miliband|access-date=1 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-ralph-miliband-1438110.html|url-status=live|archive-date=4 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004042424/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-ralph-miliband-1438110.html}}</ref> It was here that Miliband's parents first met, and they married in 1923.<ref name="ODNB"/> His father, Samuel (1895–1966), was a skilled craftsman who made leather goods, and his mother, Renia (or Renée, née Steinlauf 1901–1975), travelled around selling women's hats.<ref name="ODNB"/> She was embarrassed by having to work in this profession, hiding it from her neighbours, but required the extra income due to the economic troubles of the [[Great Depression]] during the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Renia spoke Polish fluently, but her husband had only had a very basic education and, as such, probably only spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], but he taught himself French by reading newspapers.<ref name="McSmith">{{cite news|last=McSmith|first=Andy|author-link=Andy McSmith|date=7 September 2010|title=Ralph Miliband: The father of a new generation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ralph-miliband-the-father-of-a-new-generation-2072092.html|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=14 November 2013|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215454/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ralph-miliband-the-father-of-a-new-generation-2072092.html}}</ref> Their son, Adolphe, was born in Brussels on 7 January 1924.

He grew up in the working-class community of [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]], and in 1939, aged 15, he became a member of [[Hashomer Hatzair]] ("Young Guard"), a socialist-[[Zionist]] youth group.<ref name="ODNB"/> In May 1940, following the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the armies of [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium, and the Miliband family, being Jewish, decided to flee the country from the [[antisemitic]] Nazi authorities. They missed the train to Paris and, although Adolphe&nbsp;– who was then sixteen&nbsp;– wanted to walk to the border, the family recognised that his younger sister Anna Hélène, who was only twelve, was too young for such a trek. It was decided that Renia and Anna Hélène would stay in Brussels, while Sam and Ralph would go ahead and make the journey to Paris. However, along the way Sam decided to change the plan and went with his son to [[Ostend]], where they caught the last boat to Britain. They arrived there on 19 May 1940.<ref name="McSmith"/>

===Early years in Britain: 1940–1959===
In London, Miliband abandoned the name Adolphe due to its connection with Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and instead began calling himself Ralph. He and his father gained work in the [[Chiswick]] area removing furniture from houses bombed in [[the Blitz]] and, after six weeks, were able to send news to Renia and Anne-Marie that they were in London. Discovering that the Jews of Belgium were being rounded up by the Nazis, to be sent to extermination camps in [[the Holocaust]], Renia and Anne-Marie managed to escape to a rural farm, where they were hidden by a French family until after the end of the war, when they were reunited with Sam and Ralph.<ref name="McSmith"/> However, several of Miliband's relatives and his best friend, Maurice Tan, were killed in the Holocaust.<ref name="ODNB"/>

To his dismay, the teenage Miliband came across antisemitism in London. In a diary entry made shortly after he arrived in Britain, he wrote:

<blockquote>The Englishman is a rabid nationalist. They are perhaps the most nationalist people in the world ... When you hear the English talk of this war you sometimes almost want them to lose it to show them how things are. They have the greatest contempt for the continent in general and for the French in particular. They didn't like the French before the defeat ... Since the defeat, they have the greatest contempt for the French Army ... England first. This slogan is taken for granted by the English people as a whole. To lose their [[British Empire|empire]] would be the worst possible humiliation.<ref name="Simkin">{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/HISmiliband.htm|title=Ralph Miliband: Biography|last=Simkin|first=John|publisher=Spartacus Educational|access-date=10 July 2011|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003025859/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/HISmiliband.htm}}</ref></blockquote>

Learning to speak English, Ralph gained a place at [[Acton Technical College]] (now [[Brunel University]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/history|title=History|publisher=Brunel University London|access-date=2 October 2013|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004112914/http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/history}}</ref> in west London with the help of the [[League of Nations]]' [[Organisation of the League of Nations#Commission for Refugees|Commission for Refugees]] in January 1941. After completing his course there, he gained the help of the [[Belgian government in exile]] to study at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He had become interested in [[Marxism]] and [[revolutionary socialism]], and visited the grave of Marxism's founder [[Karl Marx]] in [[Highgate Cemetery]] in north London, to swear an oath to "the workers' cause".<ref name="Blackledge"/> Meanwhile, with the constant [[The Blitz|aerial bombing of London]] by the [[Luftwaffe]], the LSE was evacuated to the premises of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]]. [[Harold Laski]], the historian and socialist theorist, was a dominant figure in the LSE at this time. Miliband studied under Laski, and was considerably influenced by him politically.<ref name="McSmith"/>

Miliband volunteered to be sent to Belgium to assist the [[Belgian Resistance|resistance movement]], and passed his medical in January 1942, but as a Polish national he was not allowed to join until the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish authorities]] gave consent. He asked Laski for help in joining the services, and shortly afterwards [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A. V. Alexander]], [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]], wrote advising him to "go and see a vice-admiral at the Admiralty, who would fix it up". Miliband joined the [[Royal Navy]] in June 1943.<ref name="Simkin"/> He served for three years in the [[Free Belgian Forces#Royal Navy Section Belge|Belgian Section of the Royal Navy]], achieving the rank of [[chief petty officer]].<ref name="Ali"/> He served on several warships as a German speaking radio intelligence officer in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]], tasked with intercepting German radio communications.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Telobit">{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=1 October 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/10347055/Professor-Ralph-Miliband.html|title=Obituary: Professor Ralph Miliband|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|orig-year=First published 7 June 1994|access-date=1 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001120307/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/10347055/Professor-Ralph-Miliband.html|archive-date=1 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> His initial exhilaration soon wore off as months passed without seeing action, then in June 1944 he took part in supporting the [[Normandy landings]] which he wrote was "the biggest operation in history" and he "would not miss it for anything". He saw further action at the [[Toulon]] landings.<ref name="Simkin"/>

After the war, Miliband resumed his studies at the LSE in 1946, and graduated with a first-class degree in 1947.<ref name="ODNB"/> He began a doctorate on ''Popular Thought in the French Revolution, 1789–1794'' in 1947, but did not complete his thesis until 1956.<ref name="ODNB"/> After obtaining a [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] research scholarship to continue his studies at the LSE, Miliband taught at the Roosevelt College (now [[Roosevelt University]]) in Chicago. He became a [[naturalised]] [[British subject]] on 28 September 1948.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38454|page=5949|date=12 November 1948}}</ref> In 1949 he was offered an assistant lectureship in [[political science]] at the LSE.<ref name="ODNB"/>

===New Left: 1960–1994===
Miliband joined the Labour Party in 1951, and was a reluctant [[Bevanite]] in the early 1950s. He joined the British [[New Left]], alongside the likes of [[E.&nbsp;P. Thompson]] and [[John Saville]], at the ''[[New Reasoner]]'' in 1958, which became the ''[[New Left Review]]'' in 1960.

Miliband published his first book, ''Parliamentary Socialism'', in 1961, which examined the role that the Labour Party played in British politics and society from a Marxist position, finding it wanting for a lack of radicalism.<ref name="Telobit"/> Paul Blackledge would later claim that it was "arguably Miliband's finest work".<ref name="Blackledge"/> He ended his membership of the Labour Party in the mid-1960s, and subsequently remained independent of formal political affiliation.<ref name="Ali"/> He began arguing that socialists in Britain had to start working towards building a viable alternative that would be genuinely revolutionary socialist in its positions.<ref name="Blackledge"/>

He also set up the ''[[Socialist Register]]'' with Saville in 1964 and was influenced by the American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]], of whom he had been a friend. He published ''The State in Capitalist Society'' in 1969, a study in Marxist [[political sociology]], rejecting the idea that pluralism spread political power, and maintaining that power in Western democracies was concentrated in the hands of a dominant class.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Miliband was passionately opposed to [[American involvement in the Vietnam War]]. In 1967 he wrote in the ''Socialist Register'' that "the US has over&nbsp;... a period of years been engaged&nbsp;... in the wholesale slaughter of men, women and children, the maiming of many more" and that the United States' "catalogue of horrors" against the Vietnamese people was being done "in the name of an enormous lie". In the same article, he attacked [[Harold Wilson]] for his defence of the United States' action in Vietnam, describing it as being the "most shameful chapter in the [[history of the Labour Party]]". He went on to say that the US government "made no secret of the political and diplomatic importance it attached to the unwavering support of a British Labour Government".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Miliband|first=Ralph|year=1967|title=Vietnam and Western Socialism|magazine=[[The Socialist Register]]|volume=4|issue=1|pages=11–25|url=http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5367/2267|publisher=Merlin Press|location=London|issn=0081-0606|access-date=7 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104062925/http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5367/2267|archive-date=4 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

He left the LSE in 1972, having found himself torn by the controversies which had beleaguered the institution over the preceding few years, particularly the LSE's responses to student protests in the late 1960s. He took up the post of Professor of Politics at the [[University of Leeds]]. The time at Leeds was an unhappy period for Miliband. He suffered a heart attack soon after the move, and did not enjoy the administrative responsibilities as a head of department.<ref name="ODNB"/> He resigned in 1978, and subsequently chose to assume several posts in Canada and the USA.<ref name="ODNB"/> He took a Professorship at [[Brandeis University]] in 1977, and also lectured at other universities in North America, including [[York University]] in Toronto and the [[City University of New York]],<ref name="Telobit"/> although he remained based in London.<ref name="Telobit"/> He published ''Marxism and Politics'' in 1977, and ''Capitalist Democracy in Britain'' in 1982. By now Miliband was active in the [[Socialist Society]] with friends such as [[Tariq Ali]] and [[Hilary Wainwright]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Callaghan|editor2-first=Steven|editor2-last=Fielding|editor3-first=Steve|editor3-last=Ludlam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENdCyoa8J4wC&pg=PA67|title=Interpreting the Labour Party: Approaches to Labour Politics and History|location=Manchester|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2003|page=67|isbn=9780719067198}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Taylor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/01/ralph-miliband-friends-dismiss-tory-press|title=Ralph Miliband friends dismiss Daily Mail's 'utterly grotesque' profile|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 October 2013|access-date=1 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001204510/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/01/ralph-miliband-friends-dismiss-tory-press|url-status=live|archive-date=1 October 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ralph married Polish-born [[Marion Kozak]] in September 1961.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beckett|first=Andy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/28/schools.labour|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 February 2004|title=In the house of the rising sons|access-date=15 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002143415/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/28/schools.labour|archive-date=2 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was the daughter of a steel manufacturer, David Kozak, with a Polish Jewish heritage, and also one of his former students at the LSE. They made a home in [[Primrose Hill]], and later in Bolton Gardens, South Kensington, and had two sons, David in 1965 and Edward in 1969.

===David and Ed Miliband===
His two sons both became Labour Party politicians, and in 2007 they became the first siblings to serve together as [[UK Cabinet|cabinet ministers]] since 1938. His elder son, [[David Miliband|David]], was Labour MP for [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]] from 2001 to 2013. From 2005 to 2010 he served in the cabinet, latterly (from 2007) as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. His younger son, [[Ed Miliband|Ed]], was elected a Labour MP for the [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]] seat in 2005. From 2007 to 2008 he served as Minister for the Third Sector in the Cabinet Office and drafted Labour's manifesto for the 2010 general election. In October 2008 Ed was promoted to the position of Secretary of the newly formed Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). On 25 September 2010,<ref name=labourleadership>{{cite news|date=15 May 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8684063.stm|title=Ed Miliband to take on brother David in leader battle|work=BBC News|access-date=15 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516203639/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8684063.stm|archive-date=16 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> he became the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|20th leader of the Labour Party]]<ref name="labourleadership"/> after a [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|leadership contest]] in which David had also run. David would step down from politics in 2013, but Ed would later serve as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] under [[Shadow Cabinet of Keir Starmer|Keir Starmer's leadership]], after a stint as a backbencher in the aftermath of the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 General Election]] and during the leadership of [[Jeremy Corbyn]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-04-06|title=Labour: Ed Miliband returns to Labour shadow cabinet|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52187354|access-date=2021-01-25}}</ref>

The journalist [[Andy McSmith]] of ''[[The Independent]]'', in comparing the lives of Ralph, David and Ed, said that the elder figure had a "nobility and a drama" that was lacking in his sons' "steady, pragmatic political careers".<ref name="McSmith"/> On 27 September 2013, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' published an article disputing Ralph Miliband's patriotism with the headline "The man who hated Britain". Three days later after negotiations the paper published a response by Ed Miliband describing his father's life, and saying the ''Daily Mail''{{'s}} article was character assassination. At the same time as publishing this response, the newspaper reiterated its assertion and published an editorial refusing to apologise.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Siddique |first1=Haroon |title=Ralph Miliband row: what the Mail said and how Ed Miliband responded |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/01/ralph-miliband-what-daily-mail-said |access-date=23 October 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=1 October 2013}}</ref> The Labour leader's office responded that Miliband "wanted the Daily Mail to treat his late father's reputation fairly. Rather than acknowledge it has smeared his father, the newspaper has repeated its original claim. This simply diminishes the Daily Mail further.
