==Career==
Komlos received a [[PhD]] in [[history]] (1978) and a second [[PhD]] in economics (1990) from the [[University of Chicago]], where he was influenced by the economic historian [[Robert Fogel]] to research the economic history of human physical stature. Komlos named this new discipline "anthropometric history" in 1989. He was a fellow at the Carolina Population Center of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] from 1984 to 1986. Komlos also taught at such institutions as [[Harvard University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[University of Vienna]], and the [[Vienna University of Economics]]. He was professor of economics and of economic history at the University of Munich for eighteen years before his retirement. He is also the founding editor of ''[[Economics and Human Biology]]'' in 2003. Komlos was elected a Fellow of the [[Cliometric Society]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cliometrics.org/fellows/2013.htm |title=2013 Fellows |website=The Cliometric Society: 2013 Fellows |accessdate=21 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211053404/http://cliometrics.org/fellows/2013.htm |archive-date=11 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Komlos also blogs for PBS on current economic affairs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/john-komlos |title=PBS Newshour |website=PBS |accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref> and more recently has written an economics textbook.<ref>{{cite book|title= What Every Economics Student Needs to Know |isbn = 978-0765639233|last1 = Komlos|first1 = John|year = 2014}}</ref>
