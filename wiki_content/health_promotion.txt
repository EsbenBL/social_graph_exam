{{Short description|Process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health}}
'''Health promotion''' is, as stated in the 1986 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]], the "process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health."<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf |title=Health Promotion Glossary |publisher=World Health Organization |place=Geneva |page=1}}</ref> 

== Scope ==
The [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s 1986 [https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/129532/Ottawa_Charter.pdf Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion] and then the 2005 [https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/6gchp/hpr_050829_%20BCHP.pdf?ua=1 Bangkok Charter for Health Promotion in a Globalized World] defines health promotion as "the process of enabling people to increase control over their [[health]] and its determinants, and thereby improve their health".<ref name="WHO2005BangkokPDF">Participants at the 1st Global Conference on Health Promotion in Ottawa, Canada, Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 1986. Accessed 2021 Sept 15.</ref>

Health promotion involves [[public policy]] that addresses [[Social determinants of health|health determinants]] such as income, housing, food security, employment, and quality working conditions. More recent work has used the term [[Health in All Policies]] to refer to the actions that incorporate health into all public policies. Health promotion is aligned with [[health equity]] and can be a focus of [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) dedicated to social justice or human rights. [[Health literacy]] can be developed in schools, while aspects of health promotion such as [[breastfeeding promotion]] can depend on laws and rules of public spaces. One of the Ottawa Charter Health Promotion Action items is infusing prevention into all sectors of society, to that end, it is seen in [[preventive healthcare]] rather than a treatment and curative care focused [[medical model]].

There is a tendency among some [[public health]] officials, governments, and the medical industrial complex to reduce health promotion to just developing personal skills, also known as [[health education]] and [[social marketing]] focused on changing behavioral risk factors.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Bunton R, Macdonald G |title=Health promotion: disciplines, diversity, and developments |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-23569-3 |edition=2nd}}</ref> However, recent evidence suggests that attitudes about public health policies are less about personal abilities or health messaging than about individuals' philosophical beliefs about morality, politics, and science.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Byrd|first1=Nick|last2=Białek|first2=Michał|date=2021|title=Your Health vs. My Liberty: Philosophical beliefs dominated reflection and identifiable victim effects when predicting public health recommendation compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=212|pages=104649|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104649|pmid=33756152|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==History==
This first publication of health promotion is from the 1974 [[Lalonde report]] from the Government of [[Canada]],<ref name=Minkler1989>{{cite journal |author=Minkler M |title=Health education, health promotion and the open society: an historical perspective |journal=Health Educ Q |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=17–30 |date=Spring 1989 |pmid=2649456 |doi=10.1177/109019818901600105 |s2cid=10410928 }}</ref> which contained a health promotion strategy "aimed at informing, influencing and assisting both individuals and organizations so that they will accept more responsibility and be more active in matters affecting mental and physical health".<ref>Lalonde M.

At least two publications led to a "broad empowerment/environmental" definition of health promotion in the mid-1980s:<ref name=Minkler1989/>
* In the year 1984 the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Regional Office for Europe defined health promotion as "the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health".<ref name="WHO1984">{{cite journal|date=May 1986|title=A discussion document on the concept and principles of health promotion|journal=Health Promot|volume=1|issue=1|pages=73–6|doi=10.1093/heapro/1.1.73|pmid=10286854}}</ref> In addition to methods to change lifestyles, the WHO Regional Office advocated "legislation, fiscal measures, organisational change, community development and spontaneous local activities against health hazards" as health promotion methods.<ref name=WHO1984/>
* In 1986, Jake Epp, [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfare]], released ''Achieving health for all: a framework for health promotion'' which also came to be known as the "Epp report".<ref name=Minkler1989/><ref name="Epp">{{cite journal|author=Epp J|year=1986|title=Achieving health for all.

** "is not just the responsibility of the health sector, but goes beyond healthy life-styles to well-being"
** "aims at making... [political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioural and biological factors] favourable through advocacy for health"
** "focuses on achieving [[health equity|equity in health]]"
** "demands coordinated action by all concerned: by governments, by health and other social organizations."

The "American" definition of health promotion, first promulgated by the ''American Journal of Health Promotion'' in the late 1980s, focuses more on the delivery of services with a bio-behavioral approach rather than environmental support using a settings approach. Later the power on the environment over behavior was incorporated. The [https://academic.oup.com/heapro/advance-article/doi/10.1093/heapro/daaa157/6211341 Health Promotion Glossary 2021] reinforces the international 1986 definition.

The WHO, in collaboration with other organizations, has subsequently co-sponsored international conferences including the 2015 [https://www.healthpromotingcampuses.org/okanagan-charter Okanagan Charter on Health Promotion Universities and Colleges].

== Settings-Based Approach ==
The WHO's settings approach to health promotion, [https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/healthy-settings/en/ Healthy Settings], looks at the settings as individual systems that link community participation, equity, empowerment, and partnership to actions that promote health. According to the WHO, a setting is "the place or social context in which people engage in daily activities in which environmental, organizational, and personal factors interact to affect health and wellbeing."<ref>{{Cite web|title=WHO {{!}} The WHO Health Promotion Glossary|url=https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/HPG/en/|access-date=2020-08-11|website=WHO}}</ref> There are 11 recognized settings in this approach: cities, villages, municipalities and communities, schools, workplaces, markets, homes, islands, hospitals, prisons, and universities.

=== Health Promoting Hospitals ===
Health promotion in the hospital setting aims to increase health gain by supporting the health of patients, staff, and the community. This is achieved by integrating health promotion concepts, strategies, and values into the culture and organizational structure of the hospital. Specifically, this means setting up a management structure, involving medical and non-medical staff in health promotion communication, devising action plans for health promotion policies and projects, and measuring and measuring health outcomes and impact for staff, patients, and the community.

The [[International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals and Health Services]] is the official, international network for the promotion and dissemination of principles, standards, and recommendations for health promotion in the hospital and health services settings.

===Workplace Setting===
{{Main|Workplace health promotion}}

The process of health promotion works in all settings and sectors where people live, work, play and love. A common setting is the workplace. The focus of health on the work site is that of prevention and the intervention that reduces the health risks of the employee. The U.S. Public Health Service recently{{When|date=October 2021}} issued a report titled "Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General" which provides a comprehensive review of the available scientific evidence about the relationship between physical activity and an individual's health status. The report shows that over 60% of Americans are not regularly active and that 25% are not active at all. There is very strong evidence linking physical activity to numerous health improvements. Health promotion can be performed in various locations. Among the settings that have received special attention are the community, [[health care provider|health care facilities]], schools, and worksites.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Tones K, Tilford S |title=Health promotion: effectiveness, efficiency and equity |publisher=Nelson Thornes |location=Cheltenham UK |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7487-4527-2 |edition=3rd}}</ref> Worksite health promotion, also known by terms such as "workplace health promotion", has been defined as "the combined efforts of employers, employees and society to improve the health and well-being of people at work".<ref>European Network for Workplace Health Promotion.

Worksite health promotion programs (also called "workplace health promotion programs", "worksite wellness programs", or "workplace wellness programs") include exercise, [[nutrition]], smoking cessation and stress management.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "Regular physical activity is one of the most effective disease prevention behaviors."<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - Workplace Health - Implementation - Physical Activity|url = https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/implementation/topics/physical-activity.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-27|first = Centers for Disease Control and|last = Prevention|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017051030/http://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/implementation/topics/physical-activity.html|archive-date = 2015-10-17}}</ref> Physical activity programs reduce feelings of anxiety and depression, reduce obesity (especially when combined with an improved diet), reduce risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes; and finally improve stamina, strength, and energy.

==== Health Promotion for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Citizens ====
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island citizens in Australia in the last couple of centuries have had poor health. The reason behind the poor health conditions is due to major events in the history of Australia. There is an increasing advancement in the promotion of health for Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal citizens, but this cannot be achieved without the co-operation of non-indigenous Australians. For this health promotion to be a success, the citizens of Australia need to put the history between non-indigenous and indigenous citizens behind them and co-operate as equals.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ped.sagepub.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/content/4/3/22.full.pdf|title = Global Health Promotion|last = Angus|first = S|date = 1997|journal = Promoting the Health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island People: Issues for the Future|doi = 10.1177/102538239700400313|pmid = 9438303|access-date = 7 April 2015|volume=4|issue = 3|pages=22–24|s2cid = 36433775}}</ref>

==== Health Promotion Research in Ireland ====
The Health Promotion Research Centre (HPRC) at the [[NUI Galway|National University of Ireland Galway]] was established in 1990 with support from the [[Department of Health (Ireland)|Department of Health]] to conduct health promotion related research on issues relevant to health promotion in an Irish context. The Centre is unique in that it is the only designated research centre in Ireland dedicated to health promotion. It produces high quality research of national and international significance that supports the development of best practice and policy in the promotion of health. The Centre is a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Health Promotion Research, has an active multidisciplinary research programme, and collaborates with regional, national and international agencies on the development and evaluation of health promotion interventions and strategies.

Objectives of the HPRC include:
* The generation and dissemination of health promotion research that is of national and international relevance.
* The translation of research that will lead to the development of healthy public policy and evidence-informed practice.

Health promotion in New Zealand has become an established approach in addressing public problems since the 1980s, through increasing use of intersectoral action, the use of public policy and mass media as promotional strategies, and the increasing control Maori have taken over the provision and purchase of health promotion services.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Health promotion development in Australia and New Zealand|last1 = Wise|first1 = Marilyn|date = 2000|journal = Health Promotion International|doi = 10.1093/heapro/15.3.237|last2 = Signal|first2 = Louise|volume = 15|issue = 3|pages = 237–248|doi-access = free}}</ref> An example of health promotional initiatives is the action put in place to reduce [[childhood obesity]] in primary schools.

Many health promotion initiatives in Sweden focus on health equity and thus focus on groups in society that have seen to be experiencing poorer health status. For example, a Swedish study suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents in disadvantaged communities, should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence the intervention activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Holmberg|first1=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents' experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|pages=1487759|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|pmid=29972679|pmc=6032021}}</ref>

Recent work in the UK ''(Delphi consultation exercise due to be published late 2009 by Royal Society of Public Health and the National Social Marketing Centre)'' on the relationship between health promotion and social marketing has highlighted and reinforced the potential integrative nature of the approaches. While an independent review (NCC 'It's Our Health!' 2006) identified that some social marketing has in the past adopted a narrow or limited approach, the UK has increasingly taken a lead in the discussion and developed a much more integrative and strategic approach.<ref>Strategic Social Marketing in 'Social Marketing and Public Health' 2009 Oxford Press</ref> This development adopts a holistic approach, integrating the learning from effective health promotion approaches with relevant learning from social marketing and other disciplines. A key finding from the Delphi consultation was the need to avoid unnecessary and arbitrary 'methods wars' and instead focus on the issue of 'utility'  and harnessing the potential of learning from multiple disciplines and sources. Such an approach is arguably how health promotion has developed over the years pulling in learning from different sectors and disciplines to enhance and develop.
