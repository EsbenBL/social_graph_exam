==Biography==

===Early years===

Albert Schäffle was born at [[Nürtingen]] in [[Württemberg]] on 24 February 1831. In 1848 he became a student at the [[University of Tübingen]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|volume=24|page=312|wstitle=Schäffle, Albert Eberhard Friedrich}}</ref>

===Career===

He had studied for the ministry, but started out in journalism as his career.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Schäffle, Albert Eberhard Friedrich}}</ref> From 1850 to 1860 he was attached to the editorial staff of the ''Schwäbische Merkur'' in [[Stuttgart]], and in the latter year accepted a call to the chair of political economy at the University of Tübingen.<ref name="EB1911" />

From 1862 to 1864 Schäffle was a member of the Württemberg diet, and in 1868 he received a mandate to the German ''Zollparlament.'' During this year he was appointed professor of political science at the [[University of Vienna]].<ref name="EB1911" />

In 1871 Schäffle resigned his professorship to join the cabinet of Count [[Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart]] as minister of commerce for [[Austria]]. The government fell in that same year, however, and Schäffle took up residence in Stuttgart, where he devoted himself entirely to literary work.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Schäffle's ''magnum opus,'' a treatise called ''Bau und Leben des sozialen Körpers'' (Construction and Life of the Social Body) was published in four volumes from 1875 to 1878. The work was a grandiose attempt to create a unified system combining the natural and social sciences.<ref name=Mann>Fritz Karl Mann, "Albert Eberhard Friedrich Schäffle", in Edwin R. A. Seilgman (ed.), ''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences: Volume 13.'' New York: Macmillan, 1937; pp. 562–563.</ref> Schäffle attempted to show a unity between human social behavior and the biological processes observed by natural science, while retaining a spiritual aspect in the tradition of German [[philosophical idealism|idealist philosophy]].<ref name=Mann />

In a second edition of this work, published in two volumes in 1896, Schäffle emphasized the state-interventionist implications of his work, describing the economy of the "rational social state" in fine detail.<ref name=Mann />

In his ''Quintessence of Socialism'' (1875) and ''The Impossibility of Social Democracy'' (1885) Schäffle developed a critique of socialism which focused on the problem of incentives in large-scale collectives. His conclusion was that classical socialism and democracy were incompatible. Schäffle thus foreshadowed some of the criticisms of socialism by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Freidrich Hayek]].

From 1892 to 1901 Schäffle was the sole editor of the ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft.''<ref name="EB1911" />

===Death and legacy===

Albert Schäffle died at Stuttgart on 25 December 1903.
