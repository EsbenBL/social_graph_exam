'''Thomas Sowell''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|l}}; born June 30, 1930) is an American [[economist]], [[social theorist]], and senior [[fellow]] at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]].

Born in [[North Carolina]], Sowell grew up in [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Due to financial issues and deteriorated home conditions, he dropped out of [[Stuyvesant High School]]<ref name="courage"/> and later served in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] during the [[Korean War]]. Upon returning to the United States, Sowell enrolled at [[Harvard University]], graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-sowell/|title=Thomas Sowell|work=Hoover Institution}}</ref> in 1958. He received a master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1959, and earned his [[doctorate]] in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1968.

Sowell has served on the faculties of several universities, including [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He has also worked at [[think tank]]s such as the [[Urban Institute]]. Since 1980, he has worked at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]], where he served as the [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]] Senior Fellow on Public Policy. Sowell writes from a [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian–conservative]] perspective. Sowell has written more than thirty books, and his work has been widely anthologized. He is a [[National Humanities Medal]] recipient for innovative scholarship which incorporated history, economics and political science.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Sowell was born in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. His father died shortly before he was born, leaving behind Sowell's mother, a [[maid|housemaid]] who already had four children. A [[Great aunt|great-aunt]] and her two grown daughters adopted Sowell and raised him.<ref name="courage" /> In his [[autobiography]], ''A Personal Odyssey,'' Sowell wrote that his childhood encounters with [[white people]] were so limited that he did not know [[blond]] was a hair color.<ref name="TS:APO6" /> When Sowell was nine, his family moved from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], to [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], for greater opportunities, joining in the [[Great Migration (African American)|large-scale trend]] of African-American migration from the [[Southern United States|American South]] to the [[Northern United States|North]].

He qualified for [[Stuyvesant High School]], a prestigious academic high school in New York City; he was the first in his family to study beyond the sixth grade. However, he was forced to drop out at age 17 because of financial difficulties and problems in his home.<ref name="courage" /> Sowell held a number of positions, including one at a [[machine shop]] and another as a [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery man]] for [[Western Union]];<ref name="TS:APO47" /> he tried out for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1948.<ref name="nordlinger20110221" /> He was [[Conscription|drafted]] into the military in 1951, during the [[Korean War]], and was assigned to the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]. Because of his experience in [[photography]], Sowell became a Marine Corps photographer.<ref name="courage" />

=== Higher education and early career ===
After his honorable [[Military discharge|discharge]], Sowell worked a [[Civil service (United States)|civil service]] job in [[Washington, DC]], and attended night classes at [[Howard University]], a [[historically black college]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|date=2000|title=A Personal Odyssey from Howard to Harvard and Beyond|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2679117|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=30|pages=122–128|doi=10.2307/2679117|jstor=2679117|issn=1077-3711}}</ref> His high scores on the [[College Board]] exams and recommendations by two professors helped him gain admission to [[Harvard University]], where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1958 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]].<ref name="courage" /><ref name="CV" /> He earned a [[master's degree]] from [[Columbia University]] the following year.<ref name="CV" />

Sowell has said that he was a [[Marxist]] "during the decade of my 20s"; accordingly, one of his earliest professional publications was a [[Sympathy|sympathetic]] examination of [[Marxism]] thought vs. [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] practice.<ref name="TS:1963" /> However, his experience working as a federal government [[Internship|intern]] during the summer of 1960 caused him to reject [[Marxian economics]] theory in favor of [[free market]] economics. During his work, Sowell discovered an association between the rise of mandated [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wages]] for workers in the [[Sugar industry of the United States|sugar industry]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the rise of [[unemployment]] in that industry. Studying the patterns led Sowell to theorize that the government employees who administered the minimum wage law cared more about their own jobs than the plight of the poor.<ref name="Salon6" />

Sowell received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1968.<ref name="CV" /> His dissertation was titled "[[Say's Law]] and the [[General glut|General Glut]] Controversy".<ref name="TS:Glut" /> Sowell had initially chosen [[Columbia University]] to study under [[George Stigler]], who would later receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]]. When he learned that Stigler had moved to the University of Chicago, he followed him there.

=== Career ===
From 1965 to 1969, Sowell was an [[assistant professor]] of economics at [[Cornell University]]. Writing 30 years later about the 1969 takeover by black Cornell students of [[Willard Straight Hall]], Sowell characterized the students as "[[hoodlum]]s" with "serious academic problems [who were] [[Affirmative action in the United States|admitted under lower academic standards]]", and noted "it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four years that I taught at Cornell and lived in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]."<ref name="sowell19990503" />

Sowell has taught economics at Howard University, [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], Cornell, [[Brandeis University]], [[Amherst College]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Since 1980, he has been a [[Senior fellow|Senior Fellow]] of the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]], where he holds a fellowship named after [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]], his mentor.<ref name="CV" /><ref name="Hoover bio" /> In addition, Sowell appeared several times on [[William F. Buckley Jr.]]'s show ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'', during which he discussed the economics of race and [[privatization]].

In 1987, Sowell testified in favor of federal appeals court judge [[Robert Bork]] during the hearings for [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|Bork's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court]]. In his testimony, Sowell said that Bork was "the most highly qualified nominee of this generation" and that what he viewed as [[judicial activism]], a concept that Bork opposed as a self-described [[originalist]] and [[textualist]], "has not been beneficial to minorities."<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=Legal Establishment Divided Over Bork Nomination|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/26/us/the-bork-hearings-legal-establishment-divided-over-bork-nomination.html |access-date=November 18, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 26, 1987}} [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Day9Pa Video of Sowell's testimony at C-SPAN]</ref>

In a review of Sowell's 1987 book, ''[[A Conflict of Visions]]'', Larry D. Nachman in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine described Sowell as a leading representative of the [[Chicago school of economics]].<ref>Nachman, Larry D. March 1987. "'[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/a-conflict-of-visions-by-thomas-sowell/ A Conflict of Visions', by Thomas Sowell]." ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]''.</ref>

=== Personal life ===
Previously married to Alma Jean Parr from 1964 to 1975, Sowell married Mary Ash in 1981.<ref>Sowell, ''A Personal Odyssey'', pp.&nbsp;162–163, 253, 278.</ref> He has two children, John and Lorraine.<ref name="video" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas Sowell Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Thomas Sowell|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Thomas_Sowell.aspx|access-date=2015-10-20|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Sowell, Thomas, 1930–|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/sowell_thomas_1930|access-date=2015-10-20|website=search.credoreference.com}}</ref>

In 2007, Sowell commented that modern television [[talk show]]s did not match the quality of [[David Susskind]]'s ''[[The David Susskind Show|Open End]]'' or ''The University of Chicago Roundtable'' and that ''[[Meet the Press]]'' moderated by [[Tim Russert]] was unlike the shows moderated by [[Lawrence Spivak]] or [[Bill Monroe (journalist)|Bill Monroe]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=20 March 2007|title=Talk shows|url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell032007.php3|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> Sowell is also known for his disdain of [[self-promotion]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biography – Thomas Sowell|language=en-US|work=Thomas Sowell|url=http://contemporarythinkers.org/thomas-sowell/biography/|access-date=2017-09-08}}</ref>

== Writings and thought ==
Themes of Sowell's writing range from [[social policy]] on [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]], [[ethnic group]]s, [[Education in the United States|education]], and [[decision-making]], to [[Classical economics|classical]] and [[Marxian economics]], to the problems of children perceived as having disabilities.

Sowell had a nationally syndicated column distributed by [[Creators Syndicate]] that was published in ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Times]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'', and other major newspapers, as well as online on websites such as ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', ''[[Townhall]]'', ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'', and the ''[[Jewish World Review]]''.<ref>{{cite web|date=2009-11-06|title=Thomas Sowell|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell.html|access-date=2011-05-30|work=Jewish World Review}}</ref> Sowell commented on current issues, which include [[Liberal media bias in the United States|liberal media bias]];<ref>{{cite web|date=2004-03-12|title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041012.shtml|access-date=2010-03-12|publisher=Town hall}}{{Better source needed|date=April 2021}}</ref> [[judicial activism]] (while defending [[originalism]]);<ref>{{cite web|title=Judicial Activism Reconsidered|url=http://www.tsowell.com/judicial.htm|access-date=2010-03-12|work=T Sowell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=2011-02-08| title=Thomas Sowell| url=https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2011/02/08/the-judicial-activism-ploy-n1311988|access-date=2021-04-23|publisher=Townhall}}</ref> [[intact dilation and extraction]] (commonly known as, and described in [[Law of the United States|U.S. federal law]] as, ''partial-birth abortion'');<ref name="TS:PT" /> [[minimum wage]]; [[universal health care]]; the tension between government policies, programs, and protections and familial [[autonomy]]; [[affirmative action]]; government [[bureaucracy]];<ref>{{cite web|title=International Book Award|url=http://www.getabstract.com/pages/0/web/BookAward.jsp|access-date=July 22, 2011|publisher=Get Abstract}}</ref> [[gun control]];<ref name="guncontrol" /> [[Militant|militancy]] in [[U.S. foreign policy]]; the [[war on drugs]], and [[multiculturalism]].<ref name="MultiCult" /> According to ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'', Sowell was the most [[Citation impact|cited]] black economist between 1991 and 1995, and second most cited between 1971 and 1990.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1997|title=The Most Highly Cited Black Economists|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2962681|journal=[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]|issue=15|pages=35–37|doi=10.2307/2962681|jstor=2962681|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

On December 27, 2016, Sowell announced the end of his syndicated column, writing that, at age 86, "the question is not why I am quitting, but why I kept at it so long," and cited a desire to focus on his photography hobby.<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 27, 2016|title=Farewell|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/12/27/farewell_132647.html|access-date=December 27, 2016|work=Real clear politics}}</ref>

A documentary detailing his career entitled "Thomas Sowell: Common Sense in a Senseless World" was released on January 25, 2021, by the [[Free To Choose Network|Free to Choose Network]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-09|title=Coming in 2021: "Thomas Sowell: Common Sense in a Senseless World"|url=https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/coming-in-2021-thomas-sowell-common-sense-in-a-senseless-world/|access-date=2021-01-04|website=American Enterprise Institute - AEI|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Network|first=Free To Choose|title=Thomas Sowell: Common Sense in a Senseless World|url=https://freetochoosenetwork.org/programs/thomas_sowell/|access-date=2021-01-04|website=freetochoosenetwork.org|language=en}}</ref>

=== Economic and political ideology ===
While often described as a [[Black conservatism in the United States|black conservative]], he prefers not to be labeled, having stated, "I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that '[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]]' would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement on a number of things."<ref name="Salon1" /> Sowell primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a [[Unregulated market|free market]] approach to [[capitalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Sowell|url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell010036.php3|access-date=2010-03-12|website=Jewish World Review}}</ref> Sowell opposes the [[Federal Reserve]], arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing [[Depression (economics)|economic depressions]] and limiting [[inflation]].<ref name="TS:Fed" /> Sowell described his serious study of [[Karl Marx]] in his autobiography; he opposes [[Marxism]], providing a [[critique]] in his book ''Marxism: Philosophy and Economics'' (1985).

Sowell has also written a trilogy of books on [[Economic ideology|ideologies]] and [[Political economy|political positions]], including ''[[A Conflict of Visions]]'', in which he speaks on the origins of political strife; ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]'', in which he compares the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]/[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]/[[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] worldviews; and ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'', in which, as in many of his other writings, he outlines his thesis of the need for [[intellectual]]s, [[politician]]s, and leaders to fix and perfect the world in [[utopia]]n and ultimately, he posits, disastrous fashions. Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'', building on his earlier work, in which he discusses what he argues to be the blind [[hubris]] and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas.

His book ''[[Knowledge and Decisions]]'', a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a "landmark work," selected for this prize "because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government." In announcing the award, the centre acclaimed Sowell, whose "contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/95113281/knowledge-and-decisions|title=Knowledge and Decisions by Thomas Sowell, 1996 |language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> [[Friedrich Hayek]] wrote: "In a wholly original manner [Sowell] succeeds in translating abstract and theoretical argument into highly concrete and realistic discussion of the central problems of contemporary economic policy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|author-link=Friedrich Hayek|date=December 1981|title=The Best Book on General Economics in Many a Year|url=https://reason.com/1981/12/01/the-best-book-on-general-econo/|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|publisher=[[Reason Foundation]]|volume=13|pages=47–49}}</ref>

Sowell also favors [[drug decriminalization|decriminalization of all drugs]],<ref name="TS:Essay" /> and occasionally writes on the subject of [[gun control]]; for example:<ref name="guncontrol" /> "One can [[Cherry picking|cherry-pick]] the factual studies, or cite some studies that have subsequently been discredited, but the great bulk of the studies show that gun control laws do not in fact control guns. On net balance, they do not save lives, but cost lives."

=== Race and ethnicity ===
Sowell argues that [[Institutional racism|systemic racism]] is an untested, questionable hypothesis that is a piece of [[propaganda]] pushed on the American people. Sowell has said that "it really has no meaning that can be specified and tested in the way that one tests hypotheses" and "it's one of many words that I don't think even the people who use it have any clear idea what they're saying". He has argued that it is a propaganda tactic akin to those used by [[Joseph Goebbels]] because it comes with an attitude that it must be "repeated long enough and loud enough" until it is believed and people "cave in" to it.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chasmar|first=Jessica|date=13 July 2020|title=Thomas Sowell: Joe Biden win could signal 'point of no return for this country'|work=The Washington Times|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/13/thomas-sowell-joe-biden-win-could-signal-point-of-/}}</ref><ref name="Creitz" />

In several of his works—including ''The Economics and Politics of Race'' (1983), ''Ethnic America'' (1981), ''[[Affirmative Action Around the World]]'' (2004), and other books—Sowell challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies. He claims that many problems identified with blacks in modern society are not unique, neither in terms of American ethnic groups, nor in terms of a rural [[proletariat]] struggling with disruption as it became [[Urbanization|urbanized]], as discussed in his ''[[Black Rednecks and White Liberals]]'' (2005).

Sowell also writes on racial topics, typically critical of [[affirmative action]] and [[Racial quota|race-based quotas]].<ref>{{cite web|date=2000-08-10|title=Thomas Sowell: "Blacks and Bootstraps."|url=https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2000/08/10/blacks-and-bootstraps-n1212037|access-date=2010-04-06|work=Columnists|publisher=Townhall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2003-04-22|title=Thomas Sowell: "Quote 'Logic'"|url=https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2003/04/22/quota-logic-n1276797|access-date=2021-04-23|work=Columnists|publisher=Town hall}}</ref> He takes strong issue with the notion of [[Federal government of the United States|government]] as a helper or savior of [[Minority group|minorities]], arguing that the historical record shows quite the opposite. In ''Affirmative Action Around the World'',<ref name="hoover1" /> Sowell holds that affirmative action affects more groups than is commonly understood, though its impacts occur through different mechanisms, and has long since ceased to favor blacks.  {{quote|One of the few policies that can be said to harm virtually every group in a different way.… Obviously, whites and Asians lose out when you have preferential admission for black students or Hispanic students—but blacks and Hispanics lose out because what typically happens is the students who have all the credentials to succeed in college are admitted to colleges where the standards are so much higher that they fail.<ref>{{cite web|last= Miller |first= Andrew |title= Thomas Sowell: Idea of 'systemic racism' a lie that has 'no meaning' and is reminiscent of Nazi propaganda |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sowell-systemic-racism-is-a-lie-that-has-no-meaning-and-reminiscent-of-nazi-propaganda|work= Washington Examiner|access-date= 6 May 2021|date= 2020-07-13}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

In ''Intellectuals and Race'' (2013), Sowell argues that [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, [[ethnic group]]s. He notes that the roughly 15-point [[Black-white IQ gap|gap in contemporary black–white IQ scores]] is similar to that between the national average and the scores of certain [[White ethnic|ethnic white groups]] in years past, in periods when the nation was absorbing new immigrants.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sowell |first1=Thomas |title=Intellectuals and race |date=2013 |publisher=Blackstone Audio |location=Ashland, OR |isbn=978-1482923537}}</ref>

=== Late-talking and the Einstein syndrome ===
Sowell wrote ''The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late'', a follow-up to his ''Late-Talking Children'', discussing a condition he termed the ''[[Einstein syndrome]]''. This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently [[misdiagnose]]d with [[autism]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and [[Steven Pinker]], among others, in this overview of a poorly understood [[Development of the human body|developmental]] trait. It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures who developed prominent careers, such as [[physicist]]s [[Albert Einstein]],<ref>Wolff, Barbara, and Hananya Goodman. "[http://www.albert-einstein.org/article_handicap.html The Legend of the Dull-Witted Child Who Grew Up to Be a Genius]." ''[[Albert Einstein Archives|The Albert Einstein Archives]]''. IS: [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].</ref> [[Edward Teller]], and [[Richard Feynman]]; [[mathematician]] [[Julia Robinson]]; and [[musician]]s [[Arthur Rubinstein]] and [[Clara Schumann]]. He makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly ([[asynchronous development]]) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the [[brain]]. This may temporarily "rob resources" from neighboring functions such as [[language development]]. As such, Sowell disagrees with [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s speculation that Einstein may have had [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref name="Einstein" />

=== Politics ===
In a ''Townhall'' editorial, titled "The Bush Legacy", Sowell assessed President [[George W. Bush]] as "a mixed bag" but "an honorable man."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|date=16 January 2009|title=The Bush Legacy|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2009/01/16/the_bush_legacy|work=Town hall}}</ref> Sowell was strongly critical of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[presidential nominee]] [[Donald Trump]], and officially endorsed [[Ted Cruz]] in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican presidential primaries]] in a February article.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Tragedy and Choices|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/02/16/tragedy_and_choices__129669.html|work=Real Clear Politics}}</ref> However, he indicated that he would vote in the [[general election]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], due to fears about the appointments Clinton would possibly make to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

In 2020, Sowell wrote that if the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic presidential nominee]] [[Joe Biden]] won the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], it could signal a point of no return for the United States, a tipping point akin to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]]. In an interview in July 2020, he stated that "the [[Roman Empire]] overcame many problems in its long history but eventually it reached a point where it could no longer continue on, and much of that was from within, not just the [[barbarian]]s attacking from outside." Sowell wrote that if Biden became President, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] would have a huge amount of control over the country and if this happened, they could twin with the "radical left" and ideas such as [[defunding the police]] could come to fruition.<ref name="Creitz" /><ref>{{Cite news|title=Thomas Sowell: It's the 'Point of No Return' If Biden Gets Elected|work=grabien|url=https://grabien.com/story.php?id=297155}}</ref>

==== Donald Trump ====
Two weeks before the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], Sowell urged voters to vote for [[Donald Trump]] over [[Hillary Clinton]]. In 2018, when asked on his thoughts of [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump's presidency]], Sowell replied "I think he's better than the previous president."<ref>Malagisi, Christopher, host. 23 April 2018. "[https://www.conservativebookclub.com/31010/podcasts/podcast-episode-5-interview-legendary-thomas-sowell-new-book-legacy-thinks-trump-future-america Interview with the Legendary Thomas Sowell: His New Book, His Legacy, and What He Thinks of Trump and the Future of America]" (podcast). Ep. 5 in ''The Conservative Book Club Podcast''. US: The Conservative Book Club.</ref>

In March 2019, Sowell commented on the public's response to [[mainstream media]]'s allegations that Trump is a racist: "What's tragic is that there's so many people out there who simply respond to words rather than ask themselves 'Is what this person says true? How can I check it?' And so on."<ref>"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUvQxcVYQlY Sowell: Politicians using race as their ticket to whatever racket they're running]." ''[[The Ingraham Angle]]''. [[Fox News]]. March 6, 2019. via [[YouTube]].</ref> A month later, Sowell again defended Trump against media charges of racism, stating: "I've seen no hard evidence. And, unfortunately, we're living in a time where no one expects hard evidence. You just repeat some familiar words and people will react pretty much the way [[Pavlov's Dog|Pavlov's dog]] was conditioned to react to certain sounds."<ref>Sowell, Thomas. March 22, 2019. "[https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/03/22/thomas_sowell_no_hard_evidence_that_trump_is_a_racist.html No Hard Evidence Trump is a racist]." ''[[Fox & Friends]]''. – via [[RealClearPolitics]].</ref>

=== Education ===
Sowell has written about education throughout his career. He has argued for the need for reform of the school system in the United States. In his latest book, ''[[Charter Schools and Their Enemies]]'' (2020), Sowell compares the educational outcomes of school children educated at [[Charter schools in the United States|charter schools]] with those at conventional public schools. In his research, Sowell first explains the need and his methodology for choosing comparable students—both ethnically and socioeconomically—before listing his findings. He presents the case that charter schools on the whole do significantly better in terms of educational outcomes than conventional schools.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter|date=6 July 2020|title=Williams: Charter schools and their enemies|url=https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/williams-charter-schools-and-their-enemies|access-date=2 September 2020|website=[[Toronto Sun]]}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2020-07-09|title=The Collapsing Case against Charter Schools|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/07/27/the-collapsing-case-against-charter-schools/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=National Review|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Carden|first=Art|title=Charters Close The Achievement Gap, Says Thomas Sowell|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/artcarden/2020/07/03/charters-close-the-achievement-gap-says-thomas-sowell/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

Sowell also writes about the importance of education for young people. He argues that many schools are failing children in their educations. This is for numerous reasons among which he argues are that indoctrination has taken the place of proper education, teaching unions have been making unfair money out of schools and that many schools have become monopolies for educational bureaucracies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Williamson|first=Kevin D.|date=9 July 2020|title=The Collapsing Case against Charter Schools|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/07/27/the-collapsing-case-against-charter-schools/|access-date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

In his book ''Education: Assumptions Versus History'' (1986), Sowell analyzes the state of education in US schools and universities. In particular, he examines the experiences of blacks and other ethnic groups in the American education system and identifies the factors and patterns behind both success and failure.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Education: Assumptions Versus History|url=https://contemporarythinkers.org/thomas-sowell/book/3996-2/|access-date=4 November 2020|website=Contemporary Thinkers}}</ref>

Conversely, James B. Stewart of Penn State wrote a critical review of ''Black Rednecks and White Liberals'', calling it "the latest salvo in Thomas Sowell's continuing crusade to represent allegedly dysfunctional value orientations and behavioral characteristics of African Americans as the principal reasons for persistent economic and social disparities."  Other academics such as [[Hampton University]] economist Bernadette Chachere, [[Harvard University]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[William Julius Wilson]], [[social scientist]] Richard Coughlin, and [[Stanford Law School|Stanford law]] professor [[Richard Thompson Ford]] have been critical of some of his work in book reviews. Criticisms include failure to take into account discrimination against [[Women in the workforce|women at work]] in ''Rhetoric or Reality?''; the lack of a coherent [[methodology]] in ''Race and Culture: A World View'';  caricaturing and then attacking opposing theories in ''Intellectuals and Race''.;<ref name="link.springer.com" /><ref name="Wilson 1984" /><ref name="Ford" /><ref>{{Cite journal | title=Book Reviews: Comparative Politics.
