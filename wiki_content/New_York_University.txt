[[Albert Gallatin]], [[Secretary of Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], declared his intention to establish "in this immense and fast-growing city ... a system of rational and practical education fitting and graciously opened to all."<ref name="About NYU" /> A three-day-long "literary and scientific convention" held in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] in 1830 and attended by over 100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a new university. These New Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who would be admitted based upon merit rather than birthright or social class.

On April 18, 1831, the institution that would become NYU was established with the support of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's [[merchant]]s, [[banker]]s, and [[trader (finance)|trader]]s.<ref name="NYU and the City">{{cite book |last1=Frusciano |first1=Thomas |name-list-style=amp |last2=Pettit |first2=Marilyn |title=New York University and the City: An Illustrated History |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1997 }}</ref> Albert Gallatin was elected as its first president.<ref name="NYU in Retrospect">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/ |title=A Window Into the Past: NYU in Retrospect |last1=Friss |first1=Evan |website=NYU Archives |publisher=New York University |access-date=August 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719014440/http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/ |archive-date=July 19, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 21, 1831, the new institution received its [[charter]] and was incorporated as the University of the City of New York by the [[New York State Legislature]]; older documents often refer to it by that name. The university has been popularly known as New York University since its inception and was officially renamed New York University in 1896.<ref name="NYU in Retrospect" /> In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four-story Clinton Hall, situated near [[New York City Hall|City Hall]].<ref name="NYU in Retrospect" /> In 1835, the [[NYU School of Law|School of Law]], NYU's first professional school, was established. Although the impetus to found a new school was partly a reaction by [[evangelical]] [[Presbyterian]]s to what they perceived as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalianism]] of [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]],<ref name=gotham>{{cite gotham}} pp. 531–532</ref> NYU was created [[non-denominational]], unlike many American colleges at the time.<ref name="NYU in Retrospect" /> [[American Chemical Society]] was founded in 1876 at NYU.

[[File:Nyuuniheights.jpg|thumb|left|The University Heights campus, now home to [[Bronx Community College]]]]
Soon after its founding, it became one of the nation's largest universities, with an enrollment of 9,300 in 1917.<ref>{{cite enc-nyc}}, pp 848–49</ref> The university purchased a campus at [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] in [[the Bronx]] because of overcrowding on the old campus. NYU also had a desire to follow New York City's development further uptown. NYU's move to the Bronx occurred in 1894, spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor [[Henry Mitchell MacCracken]].<ref name="NYU in Retrospect" /> The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor was.

In 2009, the university responded to a series of interviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that showed a pattern of labor abuses at its fledgling [[New York University Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]] location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested.<ref name=Kaminer>{{cite news|last=Kaminer|first=Ariel|title=Workers at N.Y.U.'s Abu Dhabi Site Faced Harsh Conditions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/nyregion/workers-at-nyus-abu-dhabi-site-face-harsh-conditions.html|access-date=May 20, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519234118/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/nyregion/workers-at-nyus-abu-dhabi-site-face-harsh-conditions.html|archive-date=May 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station.

===University logo===
The university logo, the upheld [[torch]], is derived from the [[Statue of Liberty]], signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].

===Cultural setting===
[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the "academic" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name="nyuandvillage"/>

In the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name="nyuandvillage"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name="nyuandvillage"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home - Grey Gallery|work=Grey Gallery|access-date=March 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225120726/http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|archive-date=December 25, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/|title=Home - Grey Gallery|work=Grey Gallery|access-date=March 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318163541/http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/|archive-date=March 18, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Washington Square campus===
[[File:NYC_-_Washington_Square_Park_-_Arch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Washington Square Park]], with its gateway [[Washington Square Arch|arch]], is surrounded largely by NYU buildings and plays an integral role in the university's campus life.]]Since the late 1970s, the central part of NYU has been its [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] campus in the heart of [[Greenwich Village]]. The [[Washington Square Arch]] is an unofficial symbol of NYU. Until 2007, NYU had held its commencement ceremonies in Washington Square Park, but moved the ceremonies to [[Yankee Stadium]] in 2008 because of renovations to Washington Square.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commencement ceremony |publisher=New York University |url=http://www.nyu.edu/commencement/ceremony.html |access-date=April 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411032533/http://www.nyu.edu/commencement/ceremony.html |archive-date=April 11, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Silver Center|Silver Center for Arts and Science]], home to the [[New York University College of Arts & Science|College of Arts & Science]] and the [[New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science|Graduate School of Arts & Science]], is one of the main academic buildings on the Washington Square campus.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Silver Center|url=https://meet.nyu.edu/locations/silver-center/|access-date=2021-08-24|website=MEET NYU|language=en-US}}</ref> It is located on Washington Square East, between Washington Place and [[Waverly Place]], and many individual departments of the two schools it houses are located in its vicinity. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt Hall, the main building for the [[New York University School of Law|School of Law]], is located near the southwest corner of Washington Square between [[Macdougal Street]] and [[Sullivan Street]] on [[4th Street (Manhattan)|Washington Square South]]. The Kimmel Center for University Life is also on Washington Square South, and is the primary hub for student life at the university, providing event and meeting space for student organizations and other gatherings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kimmel Center|url=https://www.nyu.edu/life/campus-resources/kimmel-center.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Located closer to the eastern edge of the campus along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] are the main buildings for the [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts|Tisch School of the Arts]] and the [[Gallatin School of Individualized Study]], as well as the main office for [[NYU Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] and NYU's Bookstore and [[Student health|Student Health]] Center.

Undergraduate [[New York University residence halls|residence halls]] in the immediate surroundings of Washington Square include Goddard Hall, Lipton Hall, and Weinstein Hall, while those that are slightly farther but still nearby include Brittany Hall and Rubin Hall.

In the 1990s, NYU became a "two square" university by building a second community around [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], in close proximity to Washington Square. NYU's Union Square community primarily consists of the priority residence halls of Carlyle Court, [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]] Residence Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Tower, Thirteenth Street Hall, University Hall, Third North Residence Hall, and Founders Hall.<ref name="Campus Map" />

On its Washington Square campus, NYU operates theaters and performance facilities that are often used by the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] as well as the university's [[music conservatory]], which is within the [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]]. External productions are also occasionally held in NYU's facilities. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the [[Skirball Center for Performing Arts]] (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington Square South, and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center. Notably, the Skirball Center has hosted important speeches on foreign policy by [[John Kerry]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Speech at New York University | website = GlobalSecurity.org | date = April 20, 2004 | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/09/iraq-040920-kerry01.htm | access-date = July 15, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711231213/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/09/iraq-040920-kerry01.htm | archive-date = July 11, 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref> and [[Al Gore]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Former Vice President Al Gore Remarks to MoveOn.org | website = MoveOn.org | date = August 7, 2003 | url = http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html | access-date = July 15, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715151552/http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html | archive-date = July 15, 2007 }}</ref> The Skirball Center is the largest performing arts facility south of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]].<ref>{{cite web| title = The Skirball Center for the Performing Arts | publisher = NYU Office for University Development and Alumni Relations | url = http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel/perf_arts.shtml | access-date = July 15, 2007 |archive-date=February 20, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220041238/http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel/perf_arts.shtml }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for University Life, NYU | publisher = Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates LLC – Architects | url = http://www.krjda.com/text/projectDetail.cfm?id=100 | access-date = July 15, 2007 |archive-date=February 22, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222230807/http://www.krjda.com/text/projectDetail.cfm?id=100 }}</ref>

NYU also has international houses meant to foster the study of particular cultures and languages on its Washington Square campus, including the Deutsches Haus, [[La Maison Française (New York University)|La Maison Française]], [[Casa Italiana Zerilli Marimò]], the Glucksman Ireland House, the [[King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] Center, the [[Hagop Kevorkian]] Center, an Africa House, and a China House.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Centers, Institutes, and International Houses|url=http://as.nyu.edu/page/research#ih|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030054058/http://as.nyu.edu/page/research#ih|archive-date=October 30, 2013|access-date=October 31, 2013|website=NYU Arts & Science|publisher=New York University, Arts and Science}}</ref> Most of these international houses are located on [[Washington Mews]], a private street north of Washington Square Park.

The closest [[New York City Subway]] stations servicing the Washington Square campus are [[Eighth Street–New York University station|Eighth Street–New York University]] and [[West Fourth Street–Washington Square station|West Fourth Street–Washington Square]]. In addition, NYU runs its own shuttle service, University Transportation Services, linking the Washington Square campus to other university locations and major transit hubs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=University Transportation|url=https://www.nyu.edu/life/travel-and-transportation/university-transportation.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

MetroTech Commons, the 3.5-acre (14,000 m<sup>2</sup>) [[List of privately owned public spaces in New York City|privately owned public space]] at the heart of the MetroTech complex, functions as a quad for students at the Brooklyn campus in much the same way that Washington Square Park does for students at the main campus, hosting events including concerts, health fairs, chess tournaments and holiday celebrations. Bounded by Lawrence and Duffield Streets, the square is frequently adorned by modern art exhibits. Two pieces called ''Alligator'' and ''Visionary'' are part of the Commons' permanent public art collection by the well-known sculptor [[Tom Otterness]].

The Brooklyn campus is home to NYU's Game Center Open Library, which is the largest collection of games held by any university in the world,<ref name="animationcareerreview.com"/> as well as the NYU MakerSpace and Design Lab, which allows all NYU students who undergo training sessions to access advanced [[3D printing]], [[prototyping]], [[CNC machining]], and [[stress testing]] devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/about/|title=What is MakerSpace?|website=makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu}}</ref>

Uniquely, many of NYU's residence halls are converted [[apartment]] complexes or old hotels. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens, lavatories, living rooms and common areas.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Turley | first = Meredith | title = New York University: Off the Record | publisher = [[College Prowler]] | date = July 1, 2006 | isbn = 978-1-4274-0102-1 | page = 161}}</ref> The university operates its own transit system to transport its students by [[bus]] to its campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/public.safety/transportation/routes.html |title=Routes and Schedules |website=Department of Public Safety |publisher=New York University |access-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102200712/http://www.nyu.edu/public.safety/transportation/routes.html |archive-date=November 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> A few of the residence halls are considered to be among the nicest in the nation, being furnished with granite counter-tops, stainless-steel appliances, in-hall gyms, wood flooring, marble bathroom fixtures, large floor lounges, floor to ceiling windows and extensive views of lower and midtown Manhattan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/nyregion/thecity/28gram.html|title=Dazed, Confused and Living Large|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 27, 2008|last1=Beyer|first1=Gregory}}</ref>

Undergraduate students are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU and are split into two categories, FYRE (First-Year Residential Experience) and TRUE (The Residential Upperclassmen Experience).

===Sustainability===

NYU has made the greening of its campus a large priority. For example, NYU has been the largest university purchaser of wind energy in the U.S. since 2009.<ref name="Sustainability Fast Facts">{{cite web | title =NYU Sustainability Fast Facts | publisher =New York University | url =http://www.nyu.edu/sustainability/about.sustainability/fast.facts.html | access-date =June 8, 2009 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090412133811/http://www.nyu.edu/sustainability/about.sustainability/fast.facts.html | archive-date =April 12, 2009 | url-status =live }}</ref>
With this switch to renewable power, NYU is achieving benefits equivalent to removing 12,000 cars from the road or planting 72,000 trees. In May 2008, the NYU Sustainability Task Force awarded $150,000 in grants to 23 projects that would focus research and efforts toward energy, food, landscape, outreach, procurement, transportation and waste.<ref name="At New York University, green is the new violet">{{cite news | title = At New York University, green is the new violet | newspaper = The Villager | url = http://www.nyu.edu/sustainability/about.sustainability/fast.facts.html | access-date = June 8, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090412133811/http://www.nyu.edu/sustainability/about.sustainability/fast.facts.html | archive-date = April 12, 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref>

==== Campus traditions ====
NYU has traditions which have persisted across campuses. Since the beginning of the 20th century initiation ceremonies have welcomed incoming NYU freshmen. At the Bronx University Heights Campus, seniors used to grab unsuspecting freshmen, take them to a horse-watering trough, and then dunk them head-first into what was known colloquially as "the Fountain of Knowledge". This underground initiation took place until the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Friss | first = Evan | title = Chronicles: A Look at NYU's Past | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | newspaper = NYU Today | date = September 13, 2004 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/18/01/Stories/chronicles-18-01.html | access-date = July 17, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812235317/http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/18/01/Stories/chronicles-18-01.html | archive-date = August 12, 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref> Today freshmen take part in university-sponsored activities during what is called "Welcome Week".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/life/events-traditions/welcome-week.html |title=Welcome Week |website=New York University |publisher=New York University |access-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102200851/http://www.nyu.edu/life/events-traditions/welcome-week.html |archive-date=November 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, throughout the year the university traditionally holds Apple Fest (an apple-themed country fest that began at the University Heights campus), the Violet Ball (a dance in the atrium of Bobst Library), Strawberry Fest (featuring New York City's longest [[Shortcake|Strawberry Shortcake]]), and the semi-annual [[midnight breakfast]] where Student Affairs administrators serve free breakfast to students before [[final examination|finals]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inlikeme.com/new-york-university/ |title=New York University |website=In Like Me |publisher=InlikeMe and Phrazorp LLC |access-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102210314/http://inlikeme.com/new-york-university/ |archive-date=November 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== A cappella groups ====
NYU is home to a number of student-run a cappella groups, several of which compete regularly at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). Most notable of these groups is The NYU N'Harmonics, who won the ICCA title in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 12, 2015|title=Results|url=https://varsityvocals.com/results-page/|access-date=October 7, 2020|website=Varsity Vocals|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked The NYU N'Harmonics at #6 among all ICCA-competing groups.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The A Cappella Archive - Rankings & Records|url=https://sites.google.com/view/the-a-cappella-archive/varsity-vocals/rankings-records|access-date=October 7, 2020|website=sites.google.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Greek life===
Some of the first [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] in the country were formed at NYU.<ref name="psiupsilon"/><ref name="alphaepsilonpi"/> [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] first formed on the NYU campus in 1837 when [[Psi Upsilon]] chartered its Delta Chapter.<ref name="psiupsilon">{{cite web| title = Psi Upsilon History | year = 2006 | publisher = Psi Upsilon Fraternity | url = http://www.psiu.org/fr/history.html | access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070414185849/http://www.psiu.org/fr/history.html |archive-date = April 14, 2007}}</ref> The first fraternities at NYU were social ones. With their athletic, professional, intellectual, and service activities, later groups sought to attract students who also formed other groups. Since then, Greek letter organizations have proliferated to include 25 social fraternities and sororities. {{as of|2014}}, approximately 13% of NYU undergraduate students are members of fraternities or sororities.<ref>{{cite web | title = New York University: Campus Life | work = US News & World Report | year = 2014 | access-date = March 20, 2014 | url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/new-york-university-2785 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140220200404/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/new-york-university-2785 | archive-date = February 20, 2014 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Four governing boards oversee Greek life at the university. The Interfraternity Council (IFC) has jurisdiction over all twelve recognized fraternities on campus. Eight sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Panhellenic Council (PhC), which features seven national sororities (ΔΦΕ, ΑΕΦ, ΑΣΤ, ΠΒΦ, ΚΚΓ, ΖΤΑ, ΔΓ) and two local sororities (ΑΦΖ and ΘΦΒ). Five multicultural organizations maintain membership in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), including two fraternities and three sororities. All three of the aforementioned boards are managed under the auspices of the Inter-Greek Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyu-igc.weebly.com/who-we-are.html |title=Who We Are |website=Inter-Greek Council |publisher=New York University Inter-Greek Council |access-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103120720/http://nyu-igc.weebly.com/who-we-are.html |archive-date=November 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Secret societies ===
During the University Heights era, an apparent rift evolved with some organizations distancing themselves from students from the downtown schools. The exclusive [[Philomathean Society at New York University|Philomathean Society]] operated from 1832 to 1888 (formally giving way in 1907 and reconstituted into the [[Andiron Club]]). Included among the Andiron's regulations was "Rule No.11: Have no relations save the most casual and informal kind with the downtown schools."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/eadapp/transform?source=archives/andiron.xml&style=archives/archives.xsl|title=Guide to the Andiron Club of New York City|publisher=New York University Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817042434/http://dlib.nyu.edu/eadapp/transform?source=archives%2Fandiron.xml&style=archives%2Farchives.xsl|archive-date=August 17, 2007|access-date=July 17, 2007}}</ref> [[The Eucleian Society]], rival to the Philomathean Society, was founded in 1832. The [[Knights of the Lamp]] was a social organization founded in 1914 at the School of Commerce.

In addition, NYU's first [[yearbook]] was formed by fraternities and "secret societies" at the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/test/175/pages/year.htm|title=175 Facts About NYU|publisher=New York University Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012185430/http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/test/175/pages/year.htm|archive-date=October 12, 2007|access-date=July 15, 2007}}</ref> There have been several attempts to restart old societies by both former and incoming undergraduate classes.

=== ROTC ===
NYU does not have an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students may participate in the [[U.S. Army ROTC]] program through NYC Army ROTC, headquartered at [[Fordham University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/frequently-asked-questions.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|author=NYU Web Communications|work=nyu.edu|access-date=April 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155321/http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/frequently-asked-questions.html|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

NYU's sports teams are referred to as the [[NYU Violets]], the colors being the trademarked hue "NYU Violet" and white.

Many of NYU's varsity teams play their games at various facilities and fields throughout Manhattan because of the scarcity of space for playing fields near campus. NYU is currently in the process of building a new billion dollar flagship athletic facility known as [https://www.nyu.edu/about/university-initiatives/academic-space-projects/181-mercer-street.html 181 Mercer Street].
