As coordinator of the [[African Climate Policy Centre]], Denton played a key role advocating for the impactful and decisive goals that African nations should strive for going into the COP 21 meetings for the development of the UN Paris Agreement. In the interest of Africa’s particular vulnerability to the effects of global warming, she outlined that an assertive and responsible approach should be adopted by all countries, regardless of the varying contribution to climate change. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.climdev-africa.org/content/denton-outlines-climate-agreement-africa-should-seek-paris|title=Denton outlines the climate agreement Africa should seek in Paris {{!}} ClimDev-Africa|website=www.climdev-africa.org|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>
