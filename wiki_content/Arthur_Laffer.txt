'''Arthur Betz Laffer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|f|ər}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/laffer+curve |title=Laffer curve &#124; Define Laffer curve at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref> born August 14, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[Economics|economist]] and author who first gained prominence during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] as a member of Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board (1981–89). Laffer is best known for the [[Laffer curve]], an illustration of the concept that there exists some tax rate between 0% and 100% that will result in maximum tax revenue for government. In certain circumstances, this would allow governments to cut taxes, and simultaneously increase revenue and economic growth.

==Laffer curve==
{{Main|Laffer curve}}
Although he does not claim to have invented the [[Laffer curve]] concept (Laffer, 2004), it was popularized with policy-makers following an afternoon meeting with Nixon/Ford Administration officials [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polyconomics.com/gallery/Napkin003.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503200219/http://www.polyconomics.com/gallery/Napkin003.jpg |archive-date=May 3, 2011 |title= To Donald Rumsfeld |publisher=Polyconomics.com |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>  The term "Laffer curve" was coined by [[Jude Wanniski]], who was also present. The basic concept was not new; Laffer himself says he learned it from [[Ibn Khaldun]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/the-laffer-curve-past-present-and-future |title=The Laffer Curve: Past, Present, and Future |publisher=Heritage.org |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

The [[Laffer curve]] is an [[economic theory]] that shows the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments. The Laffer Curve shows that there is a certain point between 0% and 100% where tax revenues are maximized. The curve suggests that starting from zero, an increase in tax rates will increase the government's tax revenue; after a certain point, however, continuing to increase tax rates will cause a decrease in tax revenue.<ref name="auto1"/> This decrease in tax revenue can be explained by decreased incentives for work, production, etc.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp|title=Laffer Curve|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> Laffer's postulate was that the tax rate that maximizes revenue was at a much lower level than previously believed: so low that current tax rates were above the level where revenue is maximized. While many [[economist]]s believe that government spending to stimulate demand for products should be the solution for a poorly performing economy, Laffer argues that heavy taxes and regulation impede production, and therefore, government revenue.<ref name=":2" />

Numerous leading economists have rejected the view that a tax rate cut of current federal [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. income taxes]] can lead to increased tax revenue. When asked in a 2012 [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business|University of Chicago business school]] survey whether a "cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut", none of the economists surveyed agreed and 71% disagreed.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Popp Berman |first1=Elizabeth |title=Trump is giving Arthur Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In his textbook, Mankiw states, "there was little evidence for Laffer's view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels."<ref name="mankiw">{{cite book | title=Principles of Economics | publisher=Cengage | author=Mankiw, Greg | author-link=Greg Mankiw | year=2014 | pages=164–165}}</ref> Under the direction of conservative economist [[Douglas Holtz-Eakin]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]] conducted a 2005 study on the fiscal effects of a 10% cut in federal income tax rates, finding that it resulted in a significant net revenue loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/business/23leonhardt.html|title=Weighing a McCain Economist|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=April 23, 2008|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref><ref>Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates, Congressional Budget Office, December 1, 2005:https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/109th-congress-2005-2006/reports/12-01-10percenttaxcut.pdf</ref> Economist [[John Quiggin]] distinguishes between the Laffer curve and Laffer's analysis of tax rates, writing that the Laffer curve was "correct but unoriginal" and that Laffer's analysis that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve "was original but incorrect."<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Quiggin|first=John|title=Zombie Economics|date=2012-05-21|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4208-7|pages=142|doi=10.2307/j.ctt7rg7m}}</ref>

Laffer was an economic adviser to Kansas Governor [[Sam Brownback]], who in 2012 zeroed out state tax liability for approximately 330,000 of the top wage earners in the state, called the [[Kansas experiment]], contending it would be a "shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy."<ref>Topeka Capital Journal, 2013</ref><ref name=Gale>{{cite web|author=Willaim G.
