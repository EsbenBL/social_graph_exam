Earliest discoveries of human occupation in North Carolina date back to 10,000 years ago, found at the [[Hardaway Site]]. North Carolina was inhabited by [[Carolina Algonquian language|Carolina Algonquian]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] speaking tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. North Carolina was established as a [[Crown colony|royal colony]] in 1729 and was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. North Carolina is named in honor of King [[Charles&nbsp;I of England]] who first formed the English colony, ''Carolus'' being Latin for "Charles". The [[Halifax Resolves]] resolution adopted by North Carolina on April 12, 1776, was the first formal call for independence from Great Britain among the American Colonies during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/mocr/halifax-resolves.htm#:~:text=The%20Fourth%20Provincial%20Congress,Resolves%20on%20April%2012%2C%201776.

On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the [[Constitution of the United States|United States constitution]]. In the run-up to the [[American Civil War]], North Carolina declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on May 20, 1861, becoming the tenth of eleven states to join the [[Confederate States of America]]. Following the Civil War, the state was restored to the Union on July 4, 1868.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of the Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Richter, William L.

North Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. The [[Hardaway Site]] saw major periods of occupation dating to 10,000 years BCE. Before 200 AD, the people were building [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[platform mounds]], which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the [[South Appalachian Mississippian culture]], established by 1000 AD in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and mountain region, continued to build this style of mounds. In contrast to some of the larger centers of the classic Mississippian culture (as noted below), in what became known as the western Carolinas, northeastern Georgia and southeastern Tennessee, most of the larger towns had only one central platform mound. The smaller settlements had none but developed close to the more prominent towns. This area became known as the homelands of the historic Cherokee people, who are believed to have migrated over time from the [[Great Lakes]] area.

In the 500–700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], which had numerous mounds for different purposes, a highly stratified society, and was located in present-day southwestern Illinois near the Mississippi River. The Native polities of the Mississippian culture fell apart and reformed as new groups, such as the [[Catawba people|Catawba]], due to a series of destabilizing events known as the "Mississippian shatter zone". As described by anthropologist Robbie Ethridge, the Mississippian shatter zone was an area of great instability, in what is now the American South, caused by the instability of Mississippian chiefdoms, high mortality from new Eurasian diseases, construction of a global capitalistic economy based on trading of Native American slaves, and the emergence of Native "militaristic slaving societies".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/873985135|title=Colonial Genocide in Indigenous North America|others=Woolford, Andrew John, 1971-, Benvenuto, Jeff, 1984-, Hinton, Alexander Laban.|date=October 31, 2014|isbn=978-0-8223-5763-6|location=Durham|oclc=873985135|access-date=September 18, 2020|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220154131/https://www.worldcat.org/title/colonial-genocide-in-indigenous-north-america/oclc/873985135|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] of the Piedmont.

In the late 16th century, the first Spanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland recorded meeting  [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near what later developed as [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567, Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to reach silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built [[Fort San Juan (Joara)|Fort San Juan]] and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further. His forces built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the Spanish soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera, and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara, have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards>{{cite web |url=http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~arch/berrysitepress/amerarchspring2008.pdf |author=Richards, Constance E. |title=Contact and Conflict |website=American Archaeology |date=Spring 2008 |page=14 |access-date=June 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624110618/http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~arch/berrysitepress/amerarchspring2008.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |access-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archive-date=July 24, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book

The fate of the "[[Roanoke Colony|Lost Colony]]" of [[Roanoke Island]] remains one of the most widely debated mysteries of American history. [[Virginia Dare]], the first English child to be born in North America, was born on Roanoke Island on August 18, 1587; [[Dare County, North Carolina|Dare County]] is named for her.

As early as 1650, settlers from the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia colony]] had moved into the area of [[Albemarle Sound]]. By 1663, King [[Charles&nbsp;II of England]] granted a charter to start a new colony on the North American continent; this would generally establish North Carolina's borders. He named it ''Carolina'' in honor of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles{{nbs}}I]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/NC/HISTORY/HISTORY.HTM |title=North Carolina State Library—North Carolina History |publisher=Statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us |access-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205021230/http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/NC/HISTORY/HISTORY.HTM |archive-date=February 5, 2009 }}</ref> By 1665, a second charter was issued to attempt to resolve territorial questions. In 1710, owing to disputes over governance, the Carolina colony began to split into North Carolina and [[South Carolina]]. The latter became a crown colony in 1729.

Later in the 1700s, a series of [[smallpox]] epidemics swept the South, causing high fatalities among the Native Americans, who had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the new disease (it had become [[endemic]] over centuries in Europe).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/nc_encyclopedia/cherokee.html |title=Cherokee Indians |publisher=Uncpress.unc.edu |date=November 16, 1919 |access-date=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726163819/http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/nc_encyclopedia/cherokee.html |archive-date=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to the historian Russell Thornton, "The 1738 epidemic was said to have killed one-half of the [[Cherokee]], with other tribes of the area suffering equally."<ref>Russell Thornton (1990) ''[https://archive.org/details/americanindianho00thor_0 American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History since 1492] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108232606/https://books.google.com/books?id=9iQYSQ9y60MC#v=onepage |date=January 8, 2016 }}'', University of Oklahoma Press. p.79. {{ISBN|0-8061-2220-X}}</ref>

After the Spanish in the 16th century, the first permanent European settlers of North Carolina were English colonists who migrated south from [[Virginia]]. The latter had grown rapidly and land was less available. [[Nathaniel Batts]] was documented as one of the first of these Virginian migrants. He settled south of the [[Chowan River]] and east of the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] in 1655.<ref>Fenn and Wood, ''Natives and Newcomers'', pp. 24–25.</ref> By 1663, this northeastern area of the [[Province of Carolina]], known as the [[Albemarle Settlements]], was undergoing full-scale English settlement.<ref>Powell, ''North Carolina Through Four Centuries'', p. 105.</ref> During the same period, the English monarch Charles{{nbs}}II gave the province to the [[Lords Proprietors]], a group of noblemen who had helped restore him to the throne in 1660. The new [[Province of Carolina]] was named in honor and memory of his father, Charles{{nbs}}I (Latin: ''Carolus''). A large revolt happened in the state in 1711, known as [[Cary's Rebellion]]. In 1712, North Carolina became a separate colony. Except for the [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]] holdings, it became a royal colony seventeen years later.<ref name="autogenerated1">Lefler and Newsome, (1973).</ref>

In June 1718, the pirate [[Blackbeard]] ran his flagship, the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', aground at Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, in present-day [[Carteret County, North Carolina|Carteret County]]. After the grounding her crew and supplies were transferred to smaller ships. In November 1718, after appealing to the governor of North Carolina, who promised safe-haven and a pardon, Blackbeard was killed in an ambush by troops from Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackbeard killed off North Carolina|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/blackbeard-killed-off-north-carolina|website=History.com|date=February 9, 2010|access-date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401125703/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/blackbeard-killed-off-north-carolina|archive-date=April 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1996 Intersal, Inc., a private firm, discovered the remains of a vessel likely to be the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', which was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>D.

North Carolina became one of the English [[Thirteen Colonies]] and with the territory of [[South Carolina]] was originally known as the [[Province of North Carolina]]. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward [[subsistence agriculture]], the colony lacked large cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the North Carolina colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], although there were a small number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. Loyalists in North Carolina were smaller in number than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, and New York.

During colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, followed by [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] becoming the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788, [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the "lost colony" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |access-date=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]], plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>

Differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina, or the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and uplands, affected the political, economic, and social life of the state from the 18th until the 20th century. Eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and the [[Scottish Highlands]]. The [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] upcountry and western mountain region of North Carolina was settled chiefly by [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]], English, and [[Germans|German]] Protestants, the so-called "[[cohee]]". Arriving during the mid- to late 18th century, the Scots-Irish from what is today Northern Ireland were the largest non-English immigrant group before the Revolution; English indentured servants were overwhelmingly the largest immigrant group before the Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |author= Bethune, Lawrence E |title= Scots to Colonial North Carolina Before 1775 |website= Lawrence E.

The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain.

Most of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status. Most of the [[free people of color|free colored]] families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men. Because the mothers were free, their children were born free. Many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ |title=Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'' |publisher=Freeafricanamericans.com |access-date=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807191511/http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ |archive-date=August 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], planters imported more slaves, and the state's legal delineations between free and slave status tightened, effectively hardening the latter into a racial caste. The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.

On April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries.

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], North Carolina had around 7,800 men join the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; and an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780–81. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.

A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina–South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1,000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1,000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called "Tories" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.

The road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as "The Race to the Dan" or "The Race for the River".<ref name="autogenerated1" />

In the [[Battle of Cowan's Ford]], Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the [[Catawba River]] at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.<ref>Stonestreet, Ottis C.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this "[[Pyrrhic victory]]", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence. On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitution]].

After 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the Coastal Plain region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding "yeoman" farmers of North Carolina. While slaveholding was slightly less concentrated compared to some other Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population out of 992,622 people in total, were enslaved African Americans.<ref name=census>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Browser:Census Data for Year 1860 |date=2004 |access-date=June 26, 2014 |website=University of Virginia Library |url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archive-date=October 11, 2014 }}</ref> They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions of the state.

After the American Revolution, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Mennonite]]s worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for [[manumission]] of their slaves. The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.<ref>John Hope Franklin, ''Free Negroes of North Carolina, 1789–1860'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1941, reprint, 1991.</ref> Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier, along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than 10,000. The western areas of North Carolina were mainly white families of [[European Americans|European]] descent, especially [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the western part of the state. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835, the legislature withdrew their right to vote.

In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a "farmer's railroad", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> On October 25, 1836, construction began on the [[Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historync.org/railroads.htm |title=NC Business History—Railroads |publisher=Historync.org |access-date=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726152211/http://historync.org/railroads.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> to connect the port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] with the state capital of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]. In 1840, the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh was completed, and still stands today.

In 1849, the North Carolina Railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]], and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]].

The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]], which was a futile attempt by Confederate General [[Joseph E.

The first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina, in the [[Battle of Big Bethel]] in June 1861. At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in [[Pickett's Charge|Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge]] and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. During the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield. At [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia in April 1865, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the Civil War. For many years, some North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been "First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox".

=== Reconstruction era through late 19th century ===

{{Main|Reconstruction era}}Following the collapse of the Confederacy in 1865, North Carolina, along with the rest of the former Confederate States, was put under direct control by the [[U.S. military]] and was relieved of its [[Constitution of North Carolina|constitutional government]] and representation within the [[United States Congress]] in what is now referred to as the [[Reconstruction era]]. In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was ratifying the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. Congressional Republicans during Reconstruction, commonly referred to as "[[radical Republicans]]", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century, not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.

The elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]]. In attempt to put the reforms into effect, the new Republican Governor [[William W. Holden]] declared martial law on any county allegedly not complying with law and order using the passage of the [[Shoffner Act]].

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.

Post civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Democrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.

Political tensions ran so high a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'état]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf "Chapter 5"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>

In 1899, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[poll tax]]es and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.

=== Early through mid-20th century ===

[[File:Drinking fountain on the county courthouse lawn, Halifax, North Carolina.jpg|thumb|right|Segregated drinking fountain during the [[Jim Crow]] era, [[Halifax, North Carolina|Halifax]], 1938]]
After the reconstruction era, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The state mainly continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Large towns and cities remained in few numbers. However, a major industrial base emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century, in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of [[Wright Flyer|the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight]], by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.

North Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After [[World War&nbsp;II]], the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont region. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research.

By the late 1960s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.

[[File:Enodeer.jpg|thumb|Deer in the [[Eno River]] as it flows through the Piedmont region of North Carolina]]
[[File:North Carolina Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types of North Carolina]]North Carolina is bordered by [[South Carolina]] on the south, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on the southwest, [[Tennessee]] on the west, [[Virginia]] on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The [[United States Census Bureau]] places North Carolina in the [[South Atlantic States|South Atlantic]] division of the [[Southern United States|southern]] region.<ref name="Census_Regions">{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |title=Census Regions and Divisions of the United States |publisher=United States Census Bureau, Geography Division |access-date=December 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219134403/https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |archive-date=December 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

North Carolina consists of three main geographic regions: the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], occupying the eastern portion of the state; the central [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region, and the Mountain region in the west, which is part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The coastal plain consists of more specifically-defined areas known as the [[Outer Banks]], a string of sandy, narrow [[barrier island]]s separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including [[Albemarle Sound]] and [[Pamlico Sound]], the native home of the [[venus flytrap]], and the inner coastal plain, where [[longleaf pine]] trees are native.

So many ships have been lost off [[Cape Hatteras]] that the area is known as the "[[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]"; more than a thousand ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' (flagship of the pirate [[Blackbeard]]), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.<ref>{{cite web| title=Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge Coming Back to Beaufort| website=Beach Carolina Magazine| date=March 30, 2011| url=http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221030139/http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| archive-date=February 21, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers. The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most populous region, containing the six largest cities in the state by population.<ref>{{cite web |title=People of North Carolina |url=http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/curriculum/socialstudies/elementary/studentsampler/19people#populations |publisher=North Carolina State Board of Education |access-date=August 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808052451/http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/curriculum/socialstudies/elementary/studentsampler/19people#populations |archive-date=August 8, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the [[Sauratown Mountains]], [[Pilot Mountain (North Carolina)|Pilot Mountain]], the [[Uwharrie Mountains]], [[Crowder's Mountain]], [[King's Pinnacle]], the [[Brushy Mountains (North Carolina)|Brushy Mountains]], and the [[South Mountains (North Carolina)|South Mountains]]. The Piedmont ranges from about {{convert|300|ft}} in elevation in the east to about {{convert|1500|ft}} in the west.

The [[Western North Carolina|western section]] of the state is part of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of the larger [[Appalachian Mountain]] range.

{{See also|Climate change in North Carolina}}
[[File:Graveyard Fields 3.jpg|thumb|[[Graveyard Fields]] in the fall]]Elevation above sea level is most responsible for temperature change across the state, with the mountainous regions being coolest year-round. The climate is also influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Gulf Stream]], especially in the coastal plain. These influences tend to cause warmer winter temperatures along the coast, where temperatures only occasionally drop below the freezing point at night. The coastal plain averages around {{convert|1|in|cm|1}} of snow or ice annually, and in many years, there may be no snow or ice at all.<ref name="NC_Climate">{{cite web |url=http://climate.ncsu.edu/climate/ncclimate.html |title=Overview |publisher=State Climate Office of North Carolina |access-date=August 7, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731164921/http://climate.ncsu.edu/climate/ncclimate.html |archive-date=July 31, 2016 }}</ref>

The Atlantic Ocean exerts less influence on the climate of the Piedmont region, which has hotter summers and colder winters than along the coast, though the average daily maximum is still below {{convert|90|°F|0}} in most locations.<ref name="NC_Climate" />

North Carolina experiences severe weather both in summer and in winter, with summer bringing threat of [[tropical storm|hurricanes]], [[tropical cyclone#tropical storm|tropical storms]], heavy rain, and flooding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdot.gov/travel/severeweather/summer.html |title=Severe Weather—Summer Storms |publisher=[[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] |access-date=August 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815123033/https://www.ncdot.gov/travel/severeweather/summer.html |archive-date=August 15, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Destructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include [[Hurricane Fran]], [[Hurricane Florence]], [[Hurricane Floyd]], [[Hurricane Hugo]], and [[Hurricane Hazel]], the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state, as a [[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category{{nbs}}4]] in 1954. [[Hurricane Isabel]] ranks as the most destructive of the 21st century.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}<ref>{{cite book |author=John Hairr |title=The Great Hurricanes of North Carolina |year=2008 |pages=139–150}}</ref>

North Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year, many of them produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain. Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state. The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east. A phenomenon known as "[[cold-air damming]]" often occurs in the northwestern part of the state, which can weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter.<ref>{{cite web|title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|access-date=October 24, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 16, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

North Carolina residents since the colonial era have historically been overwhelmingly [[Protestant]]—first [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], then Baptist and Methodist. In 2010, the Southern Baptist Convention was the single largest Christian denomination, with 4,241 churches and 1,513,000 members. The second largest was the [[United Methodist Church]], with 660,000 members and 1,923 churches. The third was the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], with 428,000 members in 190 [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parishes]]. The fourth largest was the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], with 186,000 members and 710 congregations; this denomination was brought by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled the backcountry in the colonial era.<ref>{{cite web |title=North Carolina: Religious Traditions |date=2010 |access-date=June 10, 2014 |website=State Membership Report |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/37/rcms2010_37_state_adh_2010.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217003206/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/37/rcms2010_37_state_adh_2010.asp |archive-date=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |publisher=Association of Religious Data Archives }}</ref>

In 1845, the Baptists split into regional associations of the Northern United States and Southern U.S., over the issue of slavery. These new associations were the Northern Baptist Convention (today the [[American Baptist Churches USA]]) and [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. By the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina were [[Baptists]]. After [[emancipation]], black Baptists quickly set up their own independent congregations in North Carolina and other states of the South, as they wanted to be free of white supervision.<ref name="brooks">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11|title=The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church|last=Brooks|first=Walter Henderson (1851–1945)|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=7|number=1|date=January 1922|pages=11–22|access-date=May 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830234438/https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live|doi=10.2307/2713578|jstor=2713578|s2cid=149662445}}</ref><ref name="raboteau" /><ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp. 52–53</ref> Black Baptists developed their own state and national associations, such as the [[National Baptist Convention USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]].<ref name="raboteau">Albert J.

[[Methodism|Methodists]] (the second largest group among North Carolinian Protestants) were divided along racial lines in the [[United Methodist Church]] and [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. The Methodist tradition tends to be strong in the northern Piedmont, especially in populous [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford County]]. Other prominent Protestant groups in North Carolina as of the [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2014 study were [[Nondenominational Christianity|non/interdenominational Protestants]] and [[Pentecostalism]]. The [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]] and [[Church of God in Christ]] are the largest Pentecostal denominations operating in the state, while notable minorities include [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness Pentecostals]] primarily affiliated with the [[United Pentecostal Church International]].

The state also has a special history with the [[Moravian Church]], as settlers of this faith (largely of German origin) settled in the [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] area in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Presbyterians]], historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and in [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland County]].

A wide variety of non-Christian faiths are practiced by other residents in the state, including: [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]]. The rapid influx of [[Northern United States|Northerners]] and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity within the state. The number of Roman Catholics and [[Judaism|Jews]] in the state has increased, along with general religious diversity as a whole. There are also a substantial number of [[Quakers]] in Guilford County and northeastern North Carolina. Many universities and colleges in the state have been founded on religious traditions, and some currently maintain that affiliation, including:<ref>{{cite web|first1=Robin |last1=Whitsell |title=Religiously-Affiliated North Carolina Colleges |date=February 26, 2008 |access-date=June 10, 2014 |website=Carolina Parent |url=http://www.carolinaparent.com/articlemain.php?Religiously-Affiliated-North-Carolina-Colleges-552 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192246/http://www.carolinaparent.com/articlemain.php?Religiously-Affiliated-North-Carolina-Colleges-552 |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{colbegin}}

The government of North Carolina is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

North Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

By 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012. Furthermore, Republican Donald Trump carried the state in 2016 and 2020.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In 2012, the state elected a Republican governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and lieutenant governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate. Several U.S. House of Representatives seats flipped control in 2012, with the Republicans holding nine seats to the Democrats' four. In the 2014 mid-term elections, Republican [[David Rouzer]] won the state's [[North Carolina's 7th congressional district|seventh congressional district]] seat, increasing the congressional delegation party split to 10–3 in favor of the GOP.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

North Carolina Republicans won 10 of the 13 seats in 2016, when Democrats got 47 percent of the statewide vote. In 2018 Republicans took nine, with one seat undecided, even though Democrats got 48 percent of the overall vote.<ref name="stohr" /> The undecided election in [[North Carolina's 9th congressional district]] was because the bipartisan State Election Board refused in February 2019 to certify the results, after an investigation found evidence of widespread ballot fraud committed by Republican operatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article226581269.html|title=Mark Harris calls for new election in 9th district|website=newsobserver|access-date=February 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517155732/https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article226581269.html|archive-date=May 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Gerrymandering ===

Because of gerrymandering in redistricting after the 2010 census, Democrats have been underrepresented in the state and Congressional delegations since 2012, although they have sometimes represented more than half the state's population.<ref name="stohr">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-north-carolina-gerrymander-map-supreme-court/|last1=Stohr|first1=Greg|last2=McCartney|first2=Allison|title=The Supreme Court Has Never Struck Down a Partisan Voter Map.

The federal court ordered redistricting in 2015.<ref name="stohr" /> Two suits challenging the state congressional district map were led by "two dozen voters, the state Democratic Party, the state chapter of the League of Women Voters, and the interest group Common Cause".<ref name="stohr" /> They contend that the redistricting resulted in deliberate under-representation of a substantial portion of voters. This case reached the United States Supreme Court in March 2019, which also heard a related partisan gerrymandering case from Maryland.<ref name="stohr" />

== Sports ==

{{Main|Sports in North Carolina}}

North Carolina is home to four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] sports franchises: the [[Carolina Panthers]] of the [[National Football League]], the [[Charlotte Hornets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], and [[Charlotte FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] are based in Charlotte, while the Raleigh-based [[Carolina Hurricanes]] play in the [[National Hockey League]]. The Panthers and Hurricanes are the only two major professional sports teams that have the same geographical designation while playing in different metropolitan areas. The Hurricanes are the only major professional team from North Carolina to have won a league championship, [[2006 Stanley Cup Finals|having captured the Stanley Cup in 2006.]] North Carolina is also home to two other top-level professional teams in less prominent sports—the Charlotte Hounds of [[Major League Lacrosse]] and the [[North Carolina Courage]] of the [[National Women's Soccer League]].

While North Carolina has no [[Major League Baseball]] team, it does have numerous [[Minor League Baseball]] teams, with the highest level of play coming from the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Charlotte Knights]] and [[Durham Bulls]]. Additionally, North Carolina has minor league teams in other team sports including [[Association football|soccer]] and [[ice hockey]], most notably [[North Carolina FC]] and the [[Charlotte Checkers]], both of which play in the second tier of their respective sports.

In addition to professional team sports, North Carolina has a strong affiliation with [[NASCAR]] and stock-car racing, with [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]] hosting two [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] races every year. Charlotte also hosts the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]], while Concord is the home of several top-flight racing teams, including [[Hendrick Motorsports]], [[Roush Fenway Racing]], [[Richard Petty Motorsports]], [[Stewart-Haas Racing]], and [[Chip Ganassi Racing]]. Numerous other tracks around North Carolina host races from low-tier NASCAR circuits as well.

Golf is a popular summertime leisure activity, and North Carolina has hosted several important professional golf tournaments. [[Pinehurst Resort]] in [[Pinehurst, North Carolina|Pinehurst]] has hosted a [[PGA Championship]], [[Ryder Cup]], two [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Opens]], and one [[United States Women's Open Championship (golf)|U.S. Women's Open]]. The [[Wells Fargo Championship]] is a regular stop on the [[PGA Tour]] and is held at [[Quail Hollow Club]] in Charlotte, and Quail Hollow has also played host to the PGA Championship. The [[Wyndham Championship]] is played annually in Greensboro at [[Sedgefield Country Club]].

[[College athletics in the United States|College sports]] are also popular in North Carolina, with 18 schools competing at the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) is headquartered in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], and both the [[ACC Championship Game|ACC Football Championship Game]] (Charlotte) and the [[ACC Men's Basketball Tournament]] (Greensboro) were most recently held in North Carolina. Additionally, the city of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] is home to the [[National Junior College Athletic Association|National Junior College Athletics Association]]'s (NJCAA) headquarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://njcaa.org/about/Staff_Bio/NJCAA_National_Staff_Directory|title=NJCAA|website=NJCAA|access-date=August 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406140847/http://njcaa.org/about/Staff_Bio/NJCAA_National_Staff_Directory|archive-date=April 6, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[College basketball]] is very popular in North Carolina, buoyed by the [[Tobacco Road (rivalry)|Tobacco Road]] rivalries between ACC members [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]], and [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]]. The [[ACC Championship Game]] and the [[Duke's Mayo Bowl]] are held annually in Charlotte's [[Bank of America Stadium]], featuring teams from the ACC and the [[Southeastern Conference]]. Additionally, the state has hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball [[Final Four (college basketball)|Final Four]] on two occasions, in Greensboro in 1974 and in Charlotte in 1994.
