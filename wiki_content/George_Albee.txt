'''George Wilson Albee''' (December 20, 1921 &ndash; July 8, 2006) was a pioneer in [[clinical psychology]], who believed societal factors such as unemployment, racism, sexism, and all the myriad forms of exploitation of people by people were the major cause of mental illness. He was one of  the leading figures in the development of [[community psychology]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
