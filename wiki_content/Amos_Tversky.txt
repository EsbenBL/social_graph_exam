'''Amos Nathan Tversky''' ({{lang-he|עמוס טברסקי}}; March 16, 1937&nbsp;– June 2, 1996) was an Israeli [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[mathematical psychology|mathematical psychologist]] and a key figure in the discovery of systematic human [[cognitive bias]] and handling of [[risk]].

Much of his early work concerned the foundations of measurement.  He was co-author of a three-volume treatise, ''Foundations of Measurement''.  His early work with [[Daniel Kahneman]] focused on the psychology of prediction and probability judgment; later they worked together to develop [[prospect theory]], which aims to explain irrational human [[economic]] choices and is considered one of the seminal works of [[behavioral economics]].

Six years after Tversky's death, Kahneman received the 2002 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for the work he did in collaboration with Amos Tversky.<ref name="Altman">{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Altman |title=A Nobel That Bridges Economics and Psychology |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/10/business/a-nobel-that-bridges-economics-and-psychology.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 October 2002 |access-date=14 March 2009 }}</ref> (The prize is not awarded posthumously.)  Kahneman told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in an interview soon after receiving the honor:  "I feel it is a joint prize.  We were twinned for more than a decade."<ref>{{cite news |first=Erica |last=Goode |title=A Conversation with Daniel Kahneman; On Profit, Loss and the Mysteries of the Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/05/health/a-conversation-with-daniel-kahneman-on-profit-loss-and-the-mysteries-of-the-mind.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2002 |access-date=14 March 2009 }}</ref>

Tversky also collaborated with many leading researchers including [[Thomas Gilovich]], [[Itamar Simonson]], [[Paul Slovic]] and [[Richard Thaler]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Tversky as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with [[Edwin Boring]], [[John Dewey]], and [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III|s2cid=145668721 | display-authors = 8 }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Tversky was born in [[Haifa]], [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]), as son of the Polish-born veterinarian Yosef Tversky and [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] [[Jenia Tversky]] (née Ginzburg), a social worker who later became a member of the [[Knesset]] representing  the [[Mapai]] (Workers' Party).<ref name=":0">[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/1.708958 A Psychologist Who Shed Light on Our Irrationality Is Born] Haaretz, 16 March 2016</ref> Tversky had one sister, Ruth, thirteen years his senior.

Tversky's mother has said he was self-taught in many areas, including mathematics.<ref name="ReferenceA">Priceless: The Hidden Psychology of Value
By William Poundstone</ref> In [[Education in Israel|high school]], Tversky took classes from literary critic [[Baruch Kurzweil]], and befriended classmate [[Dahlia Ravikovitch|Dahlia Ravikovich]], who would become an award-winning poet.

Tversky received his bachelor's degree from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in Israel in 1961, and his [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor in 1965. He had already developed a clear vision of researching judgement.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Military service and career==
During this time he was also a member and leader in [[Nahal]], an [[Israel Defense Forces]] program that combined compulsory military service with the establishment of agricultural settlements.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Undoing Project|last= Lewis|first= Michael |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2017|isbn=978-0-393-35610-6|location=New York}}</ref>

Tversky served with distinction in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as a paratrooper, rising to the rank of captain and being decorated for bravery.<ref name=":0" />  He parachuted in combat zones during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, commanded an infantry unit during the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, and served in a psychology field-unit during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.<ref name=":1" />

==Academic career==

===Academic roles===

After his doctorate, Tversky taught at Hebrew University. He then joined the faculty of [[Stanford University]] in 1978, where he spent the rest of his career.

===Academic work===

====Work with Daniel Kahneman====
Amos Tversky's most influential work was done with his longtime collaborator, [[Daniel Kahneman]], in a partnership that began in the late 1960s.  Their work explored the biases and failures in rationality continually exhibited in human decision-making.<ref name=":1" />  Starting with their first paper together, "Belief in the Law of Small Numbers", Kahneman and Tversky laid out eleven "cognitive illusions" that affect human judgment, frequently using small-scale empirical experiments that demonstrate how subjects make irrational decisions under uncertain conditions.  (They introduced the notion of [[cognitive bias]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kahneman D, Frederick S |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment | veditors = Gilovich T, Griffin DW, Kahneman D |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=51–52 |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8}}</ref>) This work was highly influential in the field of [[economics]], which had largely presumed rationality of all actors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.stanford.edu/pr/96/960605tversky.html|title=Amos Tversky, leading decision researcher, dies at 59|date=1996-06-05|work=Stanford University News Service|access-date=2017-12-25}}</ref>

According to Kahneman the collaboration 'tapered off' in the early 1980s, although they tried to revive it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/biographical/|title = The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2002}}</ref> Factors included Tversky receiving most of the external credit for the output of the partnership, and a reduction in the generosity with which Tversky and Kahneman interacted with each other.<ref>Michael Lewis. "The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed the World". Penguin, 2016 (ISBN 9780141983035)</ref>

====Comparative ignorance====
Tversky and Fox (1995)<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2946693|last=Fox|first=Craig R.|author2=Amos Tversky|year=1995|title=Ambiguity Aversion and Comparative Ignorance|jstor=2946693|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=110|issue=3|pages=585–603|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.8835}}</ref> addressed [[ambiguity aversion]], the idea that people do not like ambiguous gambles or choices with ambiguity, with the comparative ignorance framework. Their idea was that people are only ambiguity averse when their attention is specifically brought to the ambiguity by comparing an ambiguous option to an unambiguous option. For instance, people are willing to bet more on choosing a correct colored ball from an urn containing equal proportions of black and red balls than an urn with unknown proportions of balls when evaluating both of these urns at the same time. However, when evaluating them separately, people are willing to bet approximately the same amount on either urn. Thus, when it is possible to compare the ambiguous gamble to an unambiguous gamble people are averse&nbsp;— but not when one is ignorant of this comparison.

===Approach to research===

Kahneman said that Tversky "had simply perfect taste in choosing problems, and he never wasted much time on anything that was not destined to matter. He also had an unfailing compass that always kept him going forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/biographical/|title = The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2002}}</ref> In his later years Tversky increasingly used the phrase “Let us take what the terrain gives” with respect to selecting areas for research.<ref>"''To understand Amos’ genius – not a word I use lightly – you have to consider a phrase that he was using increasingly often in the last few years: “Let us take what the terrain gives”. In his growing wisdom Amos believed that Psychology is almost impossible, because there is just not all that much we can say that is both important and demonstrably true. “Let us take what the terrain gives” meant not over-reaching, not believing that setting a problem implies it can be solved. The unique ability Amos had – no one else I know comes close – was to find the one place where the terrain will yield (for Amos, usually gold) – and then to take it all. This skill in taking it all is what made so many of Amos’ papers not only classics, but definitive. What Amos had done did not need redoing.''"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/biographical/</ref>

Tversky's 1974 Science article with Kahneman on cognitive illusions triggered a "cascade of related research," Science News wrote in a 1994 article tracing the recent history of research on reasoning. Decision theorists in economics, business, philosophy and medicine as well as psychologists cited their work.<ref name="news.stanford.edu">{{Cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/pr/96/960605tversky.html|title = Amos Tversky, leading decision researcher, dies at 59}}</ref>

In 1980 he became a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterT.pdf</ref>

In 1984 he was a recipient of the [[MacArthur Fellowship]], and in 1985 he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://nas.nasonline.org/site/Dir/1658783591?pg=vprof&mbr=1005584&returl=http://nas.nasonline.org/site/Dir/1658783591?pg=srch&view=basic&retmk=search_again_link|title=National Academy of Sciences|website= nas.nasonline.org}}</ref>   Tversky, as a co-recipient with Daniel Kahneman, earned the 2003 [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Psychology.<ref name="grawemeyer.org">{{cite web|title=2002- Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky|url=http://grawemeyer.org/psychology/previous-winners/2003-daniel-kahneman-and-amos-tversky.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150723084412/http://grawemeyer.org/psychology/previous-winners/2003-daniel-kahneman-and-amos-tversky.html|archive-date=2015-07-23}}</ref>

After Tversky's death, Kahneman was awarded the 2002 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for the work he did in collaboration with Tversky. Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.<ref name="Altman"/>

==Personality and characteristics==

Kahneman has said "Amos was the freest person I have known, and he was able to be free because he was also one of the most disciplined."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/biographical/|title = The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2002}}</ref>

[[Persi Diaconis]], a professor of mathematics at Stanford, has said "You were happy being in his presence. There was a light shining out of him."<ref name="news.stanford.edu"/>

[[Gerhard Casper]], a professor of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, said Tversky "maintained the highest standards of professional ethics", and "His dedication to Stanford and its institutions of faculty governance was exemplary."<ref name="news.stanford.edu"/>

Whilst being very collaborative, Tversky also had a lifelong habit of working alone at night while others slept.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/biographical/|title = The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2002}}</ref>

In intellectual debate Tversky "wanted to crush the opposition".<ref>Kahnemnan, quoted in Michael Lewis, "The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed the World". Penguin, 2016 (ISBN 9780141983035)</ref><ref>Tversky..." didn't have Danny's feeling that we should all think together and work together. He thought "F*** You". [[Walter Mischel]], quoted in Michael Lewis, "The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed the World". Penguin, 2016 (ISBN 9780141983035)</ref>

Tversky believed that humans live under uncertainty, in a probabilistic universe.<ref>"''People live under uncertainty whether they like it or not..... Man is a deterministic device thrown into a probabilistic Universe. In this match, surprises are expected.''" Notes made by Tversky for a scientific paper. Michael Lewis. "The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed the World". Penguin, 2016 (ISBN 9780141983035).</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1963 Tversky married American psychologist [[Barbara Tversky|Barbara Gans]], who later became a professor in the human-development department at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]].<ref name=":1" />  They had three children together.

He died of a [[metastatic]] [[melanoma]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |first=Karen |last=Freeman |title= Amos Tversky, Expert on Decision Making, Is Dead at 59 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/06/us/amos-tversky-expert-on-decision-making-is-dead-at-59.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 June 1996 |access-date=14 March 2009 }}</ref>

==In popular culture==

===Tversky intelligence test===

As recounted by [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in 2013's ''[[David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants]]'', Tversky's peers thought so highly of him that they devised a [[tongue-in-cheek]] one-part test for measuring intelligence. As related to Gladwell by psychologist [[Adam Alter]], the Tversky intelligence test was "The faster you realized Tversky was smarter than you, the smarter you were."<ref>Malcolm Gladwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OkxUrypdTa0C&pg=PT89 ''David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants''], 2013, page 103</ref>

===''The Undoing Project''===

[[Michael Lewis]]'s book ''[[The Undoing Project|The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds]]'', released in 2016, is about Tversky's personal and professional relationship with Daniel Kahneman.<ref>{{cite web|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=The Irony Effect|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/12/kahneman_and_tversky_researched_the_science_of_error_and_still_made_errors.html|work=Slate|date=21 December 2016|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref>
