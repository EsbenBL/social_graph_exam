==Viewpoints==

===Slavery and segregation===

===="Voluntary slave contract"====
{{Anarcho-capitalism sidebar|expanded=People}}
Block believes that people should have the legal right to sell themselves into slavery, or to buy and keep slaves that sold themselves into slavery, in a libertarian legal order.

In an essay on "inalienability" of [[natural and legal rights]], Block defends what he calls a "[[Voluntary slavery|voluntary slave contract]]", arguing that it is "a bona fide contract where [[consideration]] crosses hands; when it is abrogated, theft occurs". He notes only [[Robert Nozick]] agrees with him, and critiques the views of the libertarians who disagree.  Block seeks to make "a tiny adjustment" which "strengthens libertarianism by making it more internally consistent." He argues that his position shows "that contract, predicated on [[private property]] [can] reach to the furthest realms of human interaction, even to voluntary slave contracts."<ref>Walter Block, "[https://mises.org/journals/jls/17_2/17_2_3.pdf Towards a Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein]." pp. 39–85, ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', vol. 17, no. 2, Spring 2003, p. 44, p. 48, p. 82 and p. 46</ref>

====Slavery and civil rights in the United States====
A January 2014 article in the ''New York Times'' stated that Block "suggested in an interview that the daily life of the enslaved was 'not so bad — you pick cotton and sing songs.'"<ref>Tanenhaus, Sam and Ruttenberg, Jim (January 25, 2014). "Rand Paul's Mixed Inheritance". ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/us/politics/rand-pauls-mixed-inheritance.html?_r=0 The New York Times]''</ref> The piece also reported that Block said [[F. W. Woolworth Company#Greensboro sit-in|Woolworth]]'s had the right to exclude black people from its lunch counters, asserting that "no one is compelled to associate with people against their will." Block responded to the article by accusing the ''Times'' of libel for taking quotes out of context and claiming the latter quote was not accurate.<ref>Block, Walter (January 30, 2014). [http://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/01/walter-e-block/scurrilous-libelous-venomous/ "Reply to the Scurrilous, Libelous, Venomous, Scandalous New York Times Smear Campaign."] LewRockwell.cm</ref>  In his response he called slavery "depraved and monstrous," arguing that it is not the nature of the work slaves perform that makes slavery monstrous, but rather it is the fact that they are forced to perform it and are not free to leave. According to Block's [[argument]], forcing a slave to perform pleasant tasks would be no less monstrous because it equally violates the libertarian [[non-aggression principle]]. An [[Inside Higher Education]] piece noted that, in response to the story, seventeen faculty members at Block's university publicly called for him to be censured for his "recurring public attacks ... on the civil rights of all." The piece also reported that Reverend Kevin Wildes, the President of Block's university, took the "unusual step" of publicly critiquing his arguments as fallacious.<ref>Jaschik, Scott (February 24, 2014). [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/24/loyola-new-orleans-discusses-professor-who-defends-segregation "Professor Who Defends Segregation."] Inside Higher Education</ref>

===Pay gap for blacks and women===

In a lecture Block called "Injustices in the Politics and Economics of Social Justice" presented at the invitation of the [[Adam Smith Society]] of the Economics Department of [[Loyola College, Baltimore]] in November 2008, Block asserted that "blacks and women" were paid less than whites because they are "less productive".<ref name=":1">Guess, Andy (November 19, 2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20081220151811/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/11/19/loyola "When Austrian Economics and Jesuit Theology Don't Mix.]" [[Inside Higher Education]]</ref>

In the lecture, Block defended his views on women by alleging that among younger and unmarried women, there is virtually no income disparity. When asked by an attendee to explain the difference in productivity between blacks and whites, he stated that as an economist he was not qualified to explain the disparity. Block offered two thoughts that might account for the disparity: first, what he called the "politically correct" explanation, or socioeconomic disparities and historical injustices towards blacks; second, a "political incorrect" explanation, or "lower black IQs".<ref name=":1"/>

[[James Gill (columnist)|James Gill]] wrote in the ''[[Times-Picayune]]'' that the lecture "ignited a furor", resulting in the president of the university, [[Brian F. Linnane|Reverend Brian F. Linnane]], apologizing for what was taken as a "sexist and racist outburst", with Gill opining that, "ideas contrary to fashionable preconceptions are always likely to throw academia into a fit".<ref name=":Gill">Gill, James (November 26, 2008). [http://blog.nola.com/jamesgill/2008/11/a_tough_sell_in_the_marketplac.html "Loyola economics chair Walter Block ignites furor for asserting that women, blacks less productive in workplace."] ''[[Times-Picayune]]''</ref>

According to [[Inside Higher Ed]]:

<blockquote>Perhaps almost as notable as the president's direct response was the condemnation issued jointly by the college's economics department and the Adam Smith Society ... "It is important to note that the remark was offensive not just because it was racially insensitive, but because it was erroneous and indicated poor-quality scholarship. There is ample scholarly evidence that, after adjusting for productivity-related characteristics (e.g., years of schooling, work experience, union and industry status, etc.) a considerable wage gap remains."<ref name=":1"/></blockquote>

Despite the criticism showing evidence questioning the veracity of his statements, Block said he "regards sensitivity as the enemy of intellectual inquiry and truth."<ref name=":Gill"/><ref name=":2">Block, Walter (November 18, 2008). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/block/block112.html "A (Not So) Funny Thing Happened to me in Baltimore."] [[LewRockwell.com]]</ref> In a December 2008 article, Block wrote that the lessons he had learned from the incident were regarding the need for tenure if one wants to speak out, the wisdom of [[Murray Rothbard]]'s words that "it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects" while remaining ignorant of economics, and the importance of [[Ludwig von Mises]]' motto: "Do not give in to evil, but proceed ever more boldly against it."<ref>Walter Block, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/2008/12/walter-block/battling-political-correctness/ "Battling Political Correctness"], [[LewRockwell.com]], December 16, 2008</ref>

===Highway privatization===
{{further|Highway privatization|Free-market roads}}

Block believes that government management of roads and highways is not only inefficient but also deadly. He argues that "road socialism" causes the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the United States each year. And, although many people blame highway deaths on alcohol, unsafe vehicles, or speeding, Block lays the blame on the government officials who manage the highway system. "It may well be that speed and alcohol are deleterious to safe driving; but it is the road manager's task to ascertain that the proper standards are maintained with regard to these aspects of safety. If unsafe conditions prevail in a private, multistory parking lot, or in a shopping mall, or in the aisles of a department store, the entrepreneur in question is held accountable."<ref>Block, Walter.'' [http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Walter%20Block/The%20Privatization%20of%20Roads%20and%20Highways.pdf The Privatization of Roads and Highways: Human and Economic Factors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216184313/http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Walter%20Block/The%20Privatization%20of%20Roads%20and%20Highways.pdf |date=December 16, 2014 }}''; Auburn, AL: The Mises Institute, 2009</ref>

===Punishment of government employees===

Block has written two papers about [[punishment]] of those engaging in "statist, governmental or other gangster activity". Block argues that there should be "a presumption that all government employees are guilty of a crime against humanity," though he notes that this presumption can be rebutted in many cases, such as that of U.S. Congressman and Mises Institute Senior Fellow [[Ron Paul]]. Block examines issues like [[restitution]] of land taken through [[eminent domain]] and possible [[retributive justice|retribution]] against politicians, IRS employees, and others who cooperated in governmental activity. He describes rules by which [[libertarian]] "[[Nuremberg Trials]]" might operate.<ref>Walter Block, "[https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_33.pdf Toward a Libertarian Theory of Guilt and Punishment for the Crime of Statism"], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 22, (2011): 665–665.</ref><ref>Walter Block, "[https://mises.org/document/3974/ Libertarian Punishment Theory: Working for, and Donating to, the State"], ''Libertarian Papers'' 1, no. 17 (2009): 1–31.</ref>

===Evictionism (in contrast to abortion)===
{{further|Evictionism|Libertarian perspectives on abortion|Stem cell controversy}}

According to Block's [[Morality|moral theory]], the act of abortion must be conceptually separated into the acts of the eviction of the [[fetus]] from the womb, and the [[Homicide|killing]] of the fetus. Building on the libertarian stand against [[trespass]] and [[murder]], Block supports a right to the first act, but, except in certain circumstances, not the second act. Block believes the woman may legally abort if the fetus is not viable outside the womb, or the woman has announced to the world her abandonment of the right to [[Child custody|custody]] of the fetus, and no one else has "[[Homestead principle|homesteaded]]" that right by offering to care for the fetus.<ref>

He also has written on finding a compromise between those who believe stem cell research is murder and those who favor it. He applies a libertarian theory of private property rights to his premise that even fertilized eggs have human rights and that the relevant issues are competition between researchers and those who wish to adopt the eggs.<ref>

===Homesteading===
====Blockian Proviso====

Block argues that if property is "necessary" for others to use, to get to unowned property, they have a easement over it and compared it to a [[Starvation#Concentration camps and ghettos|person who murders a child without feeding it]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/wire/blockean-proviso|author=Stephan Kinsella|title=The Blockean Proviso|website=Mises Wire|date=September 11, 2007}}</ref> He cites the example of a person with donut shaped land who doesn't allow anyone to get to the middle of his land as incompatible with the logic of [[Homestead principle|homesteading]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lukasz Dominiak|title=THE BLOCKIAN PROVISO AND RATIONALITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS|website=Libertarian Papers|url=http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/post/2017/05/lp-9-1-6.pdf|date=2017}}</ref>

{{quote|Picture a bagel (or donut) with a hole in it. Label the hole in the center as ‘A,’ the bagel itself as ‘B’ and the surrounding territory, lying outside of the bagel, as ‘C.’ Suppose that someone, call him Mr. B, homesteads the land depicted by B. Assume away any possibility of tunneling under, or bridging or flying a helicopter over this terrain, B. Mr. B, then, controls area A, without ever having lifted a finger in the direction of homesteading this land, A. Yes, as of now, Mr. B does not own A. But, under our assumptions, he can homestead this territory whenever he wants to do so. Mr. B and [sic] gained an untoward advantage, vis-à-vis all other potential homesteaders of A, who are now residing in territory C, and cannot reach A, without trespassing on B, Mr. B’s property. This, I claim, is incompatible with the logic of homesteading.}}

[[Stephan Kinsella]], who disagreed with Block [[neologism|coined the theory]] "The Blockean Proviso" after [[The Lockean Proviso]]. It has since been called the "Blockian Proviso".<ref>{{cite web|website=Ekonomia|title=Forestalling, Positive Obligations and the Lockean and Blockian Provisos: Rejoinder to Stephan Kinsella*|author1=Walter E.

====Negative homesteading====

Block has theorized on whether a person acting in self-defense can harm a [[human shield]] or [[hostage]] used by an aggressor. Block holds this is legitimate because the human shield is the first victim of the aggressor and, as such, cannot be allowed to pass on their misery to the defending person, the intended second victim of the aggressor. Block calls this "negative homesteading theory".<ref>Jakobsson, Carl. 2010. [https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_6.pdf  ''The Negative Homesteading Theory: Rejoinder to Walter Block on Human Body Shields''], ''Journal of Libertarian Studies''. Vol. 22 Num. 1</ref><ref>Walter Block, [https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_30.pdf The Human Body Shield], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 22 (2011): 625–630.</ref>

===Foreign policy===

Block supports a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mises.org/library/toward-libertarian-society | title=Toward a Libertarian Society| date=2014-06-06}}</ref> On ''[[LewRockwell.com]]'', he criticized [[Randy Barnett]]'s ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial on presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] and on foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2007/07/walter-e-block/libertarianism-vs-war/|title=Libertarianism vs. War}}</ref>

=== Animal rights ===
Block believes that the libertarian non-aggression principle does not apply to animals and that the right of human owners to kill, torture, or otherwise abuse animals may be an unavoidable corollary of libertarian premises. He articulated this position in a 2017 debate on animal rights, maintaining that groups must be able to petition for rights and respect the rights of others in order to qualify for rights themselves.<ref>{{Citation|last=Lucy Steigerwald|title=Animal Rights?: A Debate Between Walter Block and Thomas Raskin|date=2017-08-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEtbzIKPKQI|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2020}}
