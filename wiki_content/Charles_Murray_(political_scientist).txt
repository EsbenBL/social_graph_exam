'''Charles Alan Murray''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜr|i}}; born January 8, 1943) is an American [[Political science|political scientist]], writer and public speaker. He is the W.H. Brady Scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[think tank]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="AEIbio" />

Murray's work has been and remains highly controversial.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Martin|first=Michel|date=7 January 2018|title=Controversial Social Scientist Charles Murray Retires|work=National Public Radio|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/07/576359217/controversial-social-scientist-charles-murray-retires|access-date=11 June 2020}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Siegel|first=Eric|date=12 April 2017|title=The Real Problem with Charles Murray and "The Bell Curve"|work=Scientific American|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/the-real-problem-with-charles-murray-and-the-bell-curve/|access-date=11 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Lemann|first=Nicholas|date=18 January 1997|title=The Bell Curve Flattened: Subsequent research has seriously undercut the claims of the controversial best seller|work=Slate|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/1997/01/the-bell-curve-flattened.html|access-date=11 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-06|title=Bell Curve author Charles Murray speaks out after speech cut short by protests|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/06/bell-curve-author-charles-murray-speaks-out-after-speech-cut-short-by-protests|access-date=2021-05-02|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Sehgal|first=Parul|date=12 February 2020|title=Charles Murray Returns, Nodding to Caution but Still Courting Controversy|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/books/review-human-diversity-charles-murray.html}}</ref>

His book ''[[Losing Ground (book)|Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950–1980]]'' (1984) discussed the American welfare system. He co-wrote the controversial book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994), co-authored with [[Richard Herrnstein]], in which the authors argue that in American society, in the course of the 20th century, intelligence became a better predictor than parental socioeconomic status or education level of many individual outcomes, including income, job performance, pregnancy out of wedlock, and crime, and that social welfare programs and education efforts to improve social outcomes for the disadvantaged are largely counterproductive.

==Early life==
Of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] ancestry,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/murray1.html|title=The Inequality Taboo, by Charles Murray|website=www.bible-researcher.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmag.com/115mag/smartjews/smartjews.htm|title=The Secret of Jewish Genius|first=regenstein@mindspring.com, Jewish|last=Magazine|website=www.jewishmag.com}}</ref> Murray was born in [[Newton, Iowa]], and raised in a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], "[[Norman Rockwell]] kind of family" that stressed [[moral responsibility]]. He is the son of Frances B. (née Patrick) and Alan B. Murray, a [[Maytag]] Company executive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZIYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Alan+B.+Murray,+an+executive+with+the%22+%22AND%22|title=Current Biography Yearbook|year=1986|publisher=H.W. Wilson Co.|via=Google Books}}</ref> His youth was marked by a rebellious and pranksterish sensibility.<ref name=PCOLNyt>{{cite web|author=Jason DeParle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/magazine/daring-research-or-social-science-pornography-charles-murray.html?sec=health&pagewanted=print |title= Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography'?: Charles Murray|work=The New York Times|date=October 9, 1994 |access-date=January 11, 2011}}</ref> As a teen, he played pool at a hangout for juvenile delinquents, developed debating skills, espoused [[labor unionism]] (to his parents' annoyance), and on one occasion helped [[cross burning|burn a cross]]  that he and his friends had erected near a police station.<ref>DeParle 1994, pp.&nbsp;3–4. DeParle's biographical article finds throughout Murray's life the persona of a high-school prankster who "only [learns] later what the fuss [is] all about" (p.&nbsp;12). Some critics have found particularly revealing DeParle's discussion of the cross-burning incident and Murray's subsequent choice to not mention it. Murray and his chums had formed a kind of good guys' gang, "the Mallows". In the fall of 1960, during their senior year, they nailed some scrap wood into a cross, adorned it with fireworks, and set it ablaze on a hill beside the police station, with scattered marshmallows as a calling card.
:Rutledge [a social worker and former juvenile delinquent] who was still hanging around the pool hall [and considers some of Murray's other memories to be idealized] recalls his astonishment the next day when the talk turned to racial persecution in a town with two black families. "There wouldn't have been a racist thought in our simple-minded minds," he says. "That's how unaware we were."
:A long pause follows when Murray is reminded of the event. "Incredibly, incredibly dumb", he says. "But it never crossed our minds that this had any larger significance. And I look back on that and say, 'How on earth could we be so oblivious?' I guess it says something about that day and age that it didn't cross our minds" (p. 4).</ref>

Murray credits the [[SAT]] with helping him get out of Newton and into Harvard. "Back in 1961, the test helped get me into Harvard from a small Iowa town by giving me a way to show that I could compete with applicants from [[Phillips Exeter Academy|Exeter]] and [[Phillips Academy|Andover]]," wrote Murray. "Ever since, I have seen the SAT as the friend of the little guy, just as [[James Bryant Conant]], president of Harvard, said it would be when he urged the SAT upon the nation in the 1940s."<ref name=PCOLAmerican>{{cite web|url=http://american.com/archive/2007/july-august-magazine-contents/abolish-the-sat |author=Charles Murray|title=Abolish the SAT|publisher=[[The American (magazine)|The American]] |date=July–August 2007 |access-date=January 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101113633/http://www.american.com/archive/2007/july-august-magazine-contents/abolish-the-sat |archive-date=January 1, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> However, in an op-ed published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on March 8, 2012, Murray suggested removing the SAT's role in college admissions, noting that the SAT "has become a symbol of new-upper-class privilege, as people assume (albeit wrongly) that high scores are purchased through the resources of private schools and expensive test preparation programs".<ref name=NYtimes382012>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/opinion/reforms-for-the-new-upper-class.html?hp |title=Narrowing the New Class Divide |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref>

Murray obtained a B.A. in history from [[Harvard]] in 1965 and a Ph.D. in [[political science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1974.<ref name=AEIbio/>

==Peace Corps==
Murray left for the [[Peace Corps]] in [[Thailand]] in 1965, staying abroad for six years.<ref>DeParle, pp. 4–5.</ref> At the beginning of this period, Murray kindled a romance with his [[Thai Buddhism|Thai Buddhist]] language instructor (in [[Hawaii]]), Suchart Dej-Udom, the daughter of a wealthy Thai businessman, who was "born with one hand and a mind sharp enough to outscore the rest of the country on the college entrance exam". Murray subsequently proposed by mail from Thailand, and their marriage began the following year, a move that Murray now considers youthful rebellion. "I'm getting married to a one-handed Thai Buddhist," he said. "This was not the daughter-in-law that would have normally presented itself to an Iowa couple."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/magazine/daring-research-or-social-science-pornography-charles-murray.html?sec=health&pagewanted=print |title=Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography'?: Charles Murray|author=Deparle, Jason|newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 9, 1994 |access-date=January 11, 2011}}</ref>

Murray credits his time in the Peace Corps in Thailand with his lifelong interest in Asia. "There are aspects of Asian culture as it is lived that I still prefer to Western culture, 30 years after I last lived in Thailand," says Murray. "Two of my children are half-Asian. Apart from those personal aspects, I have always thought that the Chinese and Japanese civilizations had elements that represented the apex of human accomplishment in certain domains."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isteve.com/2003_QA_with_Charles_Murray_on_Human_Accomplishment.htm |title=Q&A with Charles Murray on Human Accomplishment|author= Steve Sailer. |publisher=Isteve.com |date=October 16, 2003 |agency=UPI|access-date=January 11, 2011}}</ref>

His tenure with the Peace Corps ended in 1968, and during the remainder of his time in Thailand he worked on an [[American Institutes for Research]] (AIR) covert counter-insurgency program for the US military in cooperation with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shameproject.com/profile/charles-murray/ |title=Charles Murray |website=S.H.A.M.E.

Recalling his time in Thailand in a 2014 episode of "Conversations with [[Bill Kristol]]", Murray noted that his worldview was fundamentally shaped by his time there. "Essentially, most of what you read in my books I learned in Thai villages." He went on, "I suddenly was struck first by the enormous discrepancy between what [[Bangkok]] thought was important to the villagers and what the villagers wanted out of government. And the second thing I got out of it was that when the government change agent showed up, the village went to hell in terms of its internal governance."<ref>Murray, Charles. (July 14, 2014) [http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/charles-murray/] Conversationswithbillkristol.org Retrieved on 2014-09-18.</ref>

Murray's work in the [[Peace Corps]] and subsequent social research in Thailand for research firms associated with the US government led to the subject of his doctoral thesis in [[political science]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]], in which he argued against bureaucratic intervention in the lives of Thai villagers.<ref>De Parle 1994.</ref><ref>McIntosh 2006: "My epiphany came in Thailand in the 1960s, when I first came to understand how badly bureaucracies dealt with human problems in the villages, and how well (with qualifications) villagers dealt with their own problems given certain conditions."

==Divorce and remarriage==
By the 1980s, his marriage to Suchart Dej-Udom had been unhappy for years, but "his childhood lessons on the importance of responsibility brought him slowly to the idea that divorce was an honorable alternative, especially with young children involved."<ref>DeParle, p. 7.</ref>

Murray divorced Dej-Udom after fourteen years of marriage<ref name=PCOLNyt /> and three years later married Catherine Bly Cox (born 1949, [[Newton, Iowa]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00533 |title=Cox, Catherine Bly, 1949– .

Cox was initially dubious when she saw his conservative reading choices, and she spent long hours "trying to reconcile his shocking views with what she saw as his deep decency".<ref name=PCOLNyt /> In 1989, Murray and Cox co-authored a book on the [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]], ''Apollo: Race to the Moon''.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/nltr18-1.htm Nasa Symposium on Forty Years of Human Spaceflight] (2001). The book was well reviewed: "Rich, densely packed and beautifully told....

==Research and views==
Murray continued research work at AIR, one of the largest of the private social science research organizations, upon his return to the US. From 1974 to 1981, Murray worked for the AIR eventually becoming chief political scientist. While at AIR, Murray supervised evaluations in the fields of urban education, welfare services, daycare, adolescent pregnancy, services for the elderly, and criminal justice.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

From 1981 to 1990, he was a fellow with the conservative [[Manhattan Institute]] where he wrote ''[[Losing Ground (book)|Losing Ground]]'', which heavily influenced the welfare reform debate in 1996, and ''In Pursuit''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

He has been a fellow of the conservative [[American Enterprise Institute]] since 1990 and was a frequent contributor to ''[[The Public Interest]]'', a journal of conservative politics and culture. In March 2009, he received AEI's highest honor, the [[Irving Kristol Award]]. He has also received a doctorate ''honoris causa'' from [[Universidad Francisco Marroquin|Universidad Francisco Marroquín]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Doctorado_Honor%C3%ADfico_durante_el_Acto_de_Graduaci%C3%B3n,_Charles_Murray |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220044712/http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Doctorado_Honor%C3%ADfico_durante_el_Acto_de_Graduaci%C3%B3n,_Charles_Murray |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 20, 2008 |title=Doctorado Honorífico durante el Acto de Graduación, Charles Murray |language=es |publisher=Newmedia.ufm.edu |access-date=January 11, 2011 }}</ref>

===''Losing Ground''===
Murray argues in his book ''[[Losing Ground (book)|Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950–1980]]'' that social welfare programs actually hurt society as a whole, as well as the very people those programs are trying to help, and concludes that these programs should therefore be eliminated.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mattison | first = Edward| title = Stop Making Sense: Charles Murray and the Reagan Perspective on Social Welfare Policy and the Poor | journal = Yale Law & Policy Review | volume = 4 | number = 1 | pages = 90-102 | date = 1985}} </ref>  Murray proposes three “laws” of social programs to defend this policy prescription:
# "Law of Imperfect Selection": Any objective rule that defines eligibility for a social transfer program will irrationally exclude some persons.
# "Law of Unintended Rewards": Any social transfer increases the net value of being in the condition that prompted the transfer.
# "Law of Net Harm": The less likely it is that the unwanted behavior will change voluntarily, the more likely it is that a program to induce change will cause net harm. <ref>{{Citation| last = Taylor | first = Joan Kennedy | contribution = Deregulating the Poor | editor-last = Boaz | editor-first = David | title = Toward Liberty: The Idea that is Changing the World| pages = 81-94|publisher = [[Cato Institute]] | place = Washington, DC |year = 2002}}</ref>

''[[The Bell Curve|The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life]]'' (1994) is a controversial bestseller that Charles Murray wrote with Harvard professor [[Richard Herrnstein|Richard J. Herrnstein]]. The book's title comes from the bell-shaped [[normal distribution]] of IQ scores. Its central thesis is that in American society in the 20th century intelligence had become a better predictor of many factors including financial income, job performance, unwed pregnancy, and crime than one's parents' [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]] or education level. The book also argued that those with high intelligence (the "cognitive elite") were becoming separated from those with average and below-average intelligence, and that this constituted a dangerous social trend. He also warned of a merger of the "cognitive elite" with the "wealth elite", which would become increasingly isolated and could result in an authoritarian "custodial state". 

Much of the controversy stemmed from Chapters 13 and 14, where the authors write about the enduring differences in [[race and intelligence]] and discuss implications of that difference.

[[Francis Wheen]] summarised Murray's arguments as "Black people are more stupid than white people: always have been, always will be. This is why they have less economic and social success.

===''Coming Apart''===
In his 2012 bestseller ''[[Coming Apart (book)|Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960–2010]]'', Murray describes diverging trends between poor and upper middle-class white Americans in the half-century after the death of [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] He focuses on white Americans in order to argue that economic decline in that period was not experienced solely by minorities, whom he brings into his argument in the last few chapters of the book. He argues that class strain has cleaved white Americans into two distinct, highly segregated strata: "an upper class, defined by educational attainment, and a new lower class, characterized by the lack of it. Murray also posits that the new [white] 'lower class' is less industrious, less likely to marry and raise children in a two-parent household, and more politically and socially disengaged."<ref>{{cite web|last1=NPR Staff|title=Is White, Working Class America 'Coming Apart'?|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/02/06/146463384/is-white-working-class-america-coming-apartl|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref>

Critics have suggested that he cherry-picked the data and time period under analysis, with [[Nell Irvin Painter]], for example, writing that "behaviors that seem to have begun in the 1960s belong to a much longer and more complex history than ideologically driven writers like Mr. Murray would have us believe."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Nell Irvin|title=When Poverty Was White|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/opinion/sunday/when-poverty-was-white.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref>

===Op-ed writings===
Murray has published [[opinion piece]]s in ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', ''[[The Public Interest]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[National Review]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. He has been a witness before United States House and Senate committees and a consultant to senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] government officials in the United States and other conservative officials in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Eastern Europe]], and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].<ref name="PCOLNationalreview">{{cite web|date=November 15, 2006|title=National Review Cruise Speakers|url=http://www.nrcruise.com/Pages/speakers.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20061115101048/http://www.nrcruise.com/Pages/speakers.htm|archive-date=November 15, 2006}}</ref>

In the April 2007 issue of ''Commentary'' magazine, Murray wrote on the disproportionate representation of Jews in the ranks of outstanding achievers and says that one of the reasons is that they "have been found to have an unusually high mean intelligence as measured by IQ tests since the first Jewish samples were tested". His article concludes with an assertion: "At this point, I take sanctuary in my remaining hypothesis, uniquely parsimonious and happily irrefutable. The Jews are God's chosen people."<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish Genius|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/jewish-genius/|access-date=January 9, 2012|publisher=Commentarymagazine.com}}</ref>

In the July/August 2007 issue of ''The American'', a magazine published by the [[American Enterprise Institute]], Murray says he has changed his mind about SAT tests and says they should be scrapped: "Perhaps the SAT had made an important independent contribution to predicting college performance in earlier years, but by the time research was conducted in the last half of the 1990s, the test had already been ruined by political correctness." Murray advocates replacing the traditional SAT with the College Board's subject achievement tests: "The surprising empirical reality is that the SAT is redundant if students are required to take achievement tests."<ref name="PCOLAmerican" />

In June 2016, Murray wrote that replacing welfare with a [[Universal Basic Income]] was the best way to adapt to "a radically changing U.S. jobs market".<ref>{{cite web|date=June 3, 2016|title=A guaranteed income for every American|url=https://www.aei.org/articles/a-guaranteed-income-for-every-american/|access-date=January 25, 2021}}</ref>

===Views on education===
Murray has been critical of the [[No Child Left Behind]] law, arguing that it "set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality.... The United States Congress, acting with large bipartisan majorities, at the urging of the President, enacted as the law of the land that all children are to be above average." He sees the law as an example of "Educational romanticism [which] asks too much from students at the bottom of the intellectual pile, asks the wrong things from those in the middle, and asks too little from those at the top."<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Charles |url=http://www.aei.org/article/27962 |title=Articles & Commentary: The Age of Educational Romanticism |publisher=Aei.org |date=May 1, 2008 |access-date=January 11, 2011}}</ref>

Challenging "educational romanticism", he wrote ''Real Education: Four Simple Truths for Bringing America's Schools Back to Reality''.  His "four simple truths" are as follows:
# Ability varies.
# Half of all children are below average.
# Too many people are going to college.
# America's future depends on how we educate the academically gifted.<ref name="re2008">{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Charles |url=http://www.aei.org/book/958 |title=Real Education |publisher=AEI |date=August 19, 2008 |access-date=January 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107212010/http://www.aei.org/book/958 |archive-date=January 7, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2014, a speech that Murray was scheduled to give at [[Azusa Pacific University]] was "postponed" due to Murray's research on human group differences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Murray Questions Azusa Pacific |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/04/23/charles-murray-questions-azusa-pacific|website=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=October 17, 2014}}</ref> Murray responded to the institution by pointing out that it was a disservice to the students and faculty to dismiss research because of its controversial nature rather than the evidence. Murray also urged the university to consider his works as they are and reach conclusions for themselves, rather than relying on sources that "specialize in libeling people".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jaschik|first1=Scott|title=Charles Murray Questions Azusa Pacific {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/04/23/charles-murray-questions-azusa-pacific|access-date=28 February 2017|work=www.insidehighered.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Charles|title=Charles Murray: An open letter to the students of Azusa Pacific University|url=http://www.aei-ideas.org/2014/04/charles-murray-an-open-letter-to-the-students-of-azusa-pacific-university/|website=AEI Ideas|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|access-date=October 17, 2014}}</ref>

==Public speech and protest at Middlebury College==
[[File:Charles Murray Midd.jpg|thumb|Charles Murray speaks at Middlebury College as students protest]]
On March 2, 2017, Murray was scheduled to speak at [[Middlebury College]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]], [[Vermont]] about ''[[Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010|Coming Apart: the State of White America, 1960–2010]]''. Murray was invited to attend the college by Middlebury's [[American Enterprise Institute]] Club, who received co-sponsorship of the event from a professor in the political science department. Before Murray was able to speak, students within the hall rose to their feet and recited in unison a speech about the [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] implications of Murray's work. Students proceeded to chant—"Charles Murray go away, racist sexist anti-gay!" ; "Who is the enemy? White supremacy!" ; "This is what democracy looks like!"—and dance in the hall in an effort to stop Murray from speaking. Bill Burger, Middlebury College's Vice President of Communications, announced that the speech would be moved to another location. A closed circuit broadcast showed Murray being interviewed by political science professor [[Allison Stanger]]—chanting from protesters could be heard throughout the broadcast. After the interview, there was a violent confrontation between protesters—both from the college and the surrounding community—and Murray, Vice President for Communications Bill Burger, and Stanger (who was hospitalized with a neck injury and concussion) as they left the McCullough Student Center. Middlebury students claimed that Middlebury Public Safety officers instigated and escalated violence against nonviolent protesters and that administrator Bill Burger assaulted protesters with a car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.middbeat.org/2017/03/04/middlebury-students-college-administrator-and-staff-assault-students-endanger-lives-after-murray-protest/|title=Middlebury Students: College Administrator and Staff Assault Students, Endanger Lives After Murray Protest|last=keychainmail|date=March 4, 2017|website=middbeat|access-date=March 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305041134/http://www.middbeat.org/2017/03/04/middlebury-students-college-administrator-and-staff-assault-students-endanger-lives-after-murray-protest/|archive-date=March 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Middlebury President [[Laurie L.
