In 2009, McFaul joined the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Barack Obama administration]] as a senior adviser in Washington, D.C., where he was the architect of the so-called "[[Russian reset]]" policy. In 2011, Obama nominated McFaul to be the 7th post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[United States Ambassador to Russia|United States Ambassador to the Russian Federation]]. On December 17, 2011, the United States Senate confirmed McFaul by [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/galleries/pdcl/index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227172904/https://www.senate.gov/galleries/pdcl/index.htm |archive-date=December 27, 2011 }}</ref> McFaul became the first non-career diplomat to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia.<ref name="NYTimes"/> He arrived in Russia just as massive protests were erupting over [[Vladimir Putin]]'s resumption of the presidency.

McFaul announced his resignation as ambassador to Russia on February 4, 2014, effective after the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi Olympics]].

McFaul returned to Stanford as a professor of political science. He also became a senior fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]].

===Russian opposition visit===
On January 17, 2012, soon after McFaul was appointed the new [[United States Ambassador to Russia]] and arrived in [[Moscow]] to assume his post, a number of organizers and prominent participants of the [[2011 Russian protests]], as well as some prominent figures of the Russian opposition parties, visited the [[Embassy of the United States in Moscow]]. On the entrance to the embassy, they were encountered by TV journalists who asked them why they were visiting the new Ambassador.<ref name=vz-embassy>{{cite news|url=http://www.vz.ru/politics/2012/1/17/554224.html |script-title=ru:Получение инструкций в посольстве США |trans-title=Receiving instructions at the US Embassy |newspaper=[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]] |language=ru |date=January 17, 2012 |access-date=February 4, 2012 |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119073816/http://www.vz.ru/politics/2012/1/17/554224.html }}</ref> On the video later released on [[YouTube]]<ref>[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf3LjntNX20 Получение инструкций в посольстве США]{{better source|date=October 2019}}</ref> and titled "[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf3LjntNX20 Получение инструкций в посольстве США]" (''Receiving instructions in the Embassy of the United States''), opposition activists appear flustered by the unexpected media attention. Later, when upon leaving the embassy and once again being encircled by journalists, the activists responded by declaring the journalists spreaders of "[[Vladislav Surkov|Surkovian]] propaganda" and made no other statement.<ref name=vz-embassy/> The visitors to Michael McFaul included [[Yevgeniya Chirikova]] (member of [[Strategy-31]] and [[Khimki forest]] activist leader), [[Boris Nemtsov]] (leader of the [[People's Freedom Party]] at the time; assassinated in 2015), [[Lev Ponomarev]] (human rights activist of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]]), [[Sergey Mitrokhin]] (leader of [[Yabloko]] party), [[Oksana Dmitriyeva]] (deputy head of [[A Just Russia]]), [[Lilia Shibanova]] (head of the [[GOLOS Association]] elections monitor group).<ref name=vz-embassy/> Leonid Kalashnikov from the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] also attended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/opposition-leaders-brief-mcfaul/451210.html|title=Opposition Leaders Brief McFaul|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|access-date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> Two weeks later, journalist [[Olga Romanova (journalist)|Olga Romanova]] who managed the financial spending of the December protests, also visited the American Embassy. She said that they discussed Russian protests and the [[2012 United States Presidential election|United States Presidential election]] campaign with McFaul.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://vz.ru/news/2012/1/30/557576.html |script-title=ru:Романова: С Макфолом обсудили «бунты рассерженных горожан» |trans-title=Romanova: McFaul explained "riots by disgruntled citizens" |newspaper=Vzglyad |language=ru |access-date=February 5, 2012 |date=January 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202063838/http://vz.ru/news/2012/1/30/557576.html |url-status=live |archive-date=February 2, 2012 }}</ref>

Reaction to the incident was mixed: President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in his public comments at Moscow State University, largely exonerated McFaul by saying that meeting with opposition figures was a routine occurrence, although he warned the new U.S. ambassador that he was on Russian soil and should respect Russian political sensibilities.<ref name=RP/> The incident sparked a highly negative reaction in the state-controlled Russian media, which accused him of conspiring with the opposition.<ref name = "mercury"/><ref name=vz-embassy/><ref name=RP>[http://russiaprofile.org/experts_panel/53857.html Russia Profile Weekly Experts Panel: United States Looms Large in Russian Elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508043536/http://russiaprofile.org/experts_panel/53857.html |date=May 8, 2014 }} russiaprofile.org</ref> But an article in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote that McFaul's stance won plaudits from pro-democracy activists and Web-savvy Russian youth and that, "in the tight-knit world of Moscow’s opposition, McFaul has become something of an [[Internet celebrity]], making him a true 21st-century diplomat."<ref name=DailyBeast/>

==Recognition==
