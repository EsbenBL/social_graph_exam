'''Stephen Alan''' "'''Steve'''" '''Ross''' (February 3, 1944 – March 3, 2017) <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-mourns-passing-trustee-stephen-ross-bs-65-54292|title = Caltech Mourns the Passing of Trustee Stephen A. Ross (BS '65)}}</ref> was the inaugural [[Franco Modigliani]] Professor of [[Financial economics|Financial Economics]] at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] after a long career as  the [[Sterling Professor]] of Economics and Finance at the [[Yale School of Management]].<ref>http://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/events/past-events/big-data-conference/stephen-ross/</ref> He is known for initiating several important theories and models in [[financial economics]]. He is a widely published author in finance and economics, and is coauthor of one of the best-selling [[Corporate Finance]] texts.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stephen Ross|author2=Jeffrey Jaffe|author3=Randolph Westerfield|title=Corporate Finance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0opCwAAQBAJ|date=7 October 2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-29588-1}}</ref>

He received his [[B.S.]] with honors from [[Caltech]] in 1965 where he majored in physics, and his [[Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Harvard]] in 1970, and has taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Yale School of Management]], and [[MIT]].

Ross is best known for the development of the [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (mid-1970s) as well as for his role in developing the [[binomial options pricing model]] (1979; also known as the [[Cox–Ross–Rubinstein model]]). He was an initiator of the fundamental financial concept of [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|risk-neutral pricing]]. In 1985 he contributed to the creation of the [[Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model]] for interest rate dynamics. Such theories have become an important part of the paradigm known as [[neoclassical finance]].

Ross also introduced a rigorous modeling of the [[agency problem]] in 1973, as seen from the principal's standpoint.<ref>Ross, Stephen A. "The economic theory of agency: The principal's problem." The American Economic Review 63.2 (1973): 134-139.</ref>

Ross served as President of the [[American Finance Association]] in 1988. He was named [[International Association of Financial Engineers]]' Financial Engineer of the Year in 1996.

He gave the inaugural lecture of the Princeton Lectures in Finance, sponsored by the Bendheim Center for Finance of [[Princeton University]], in 2001. It became a book in 2004,<ref>Ross, Stephen A. Neoclassical finance. Princeton University Press, 2004.</ref> presenting [[neoclassical finance]] and defending it, including such notions as the [[Financial market efficiency|efficiency]] and [[rationality]] of markets, against its critics, especially those who belong to the [[behavioral finance]] tradition.

Ross was a recipient of a 2006 [[Smith Breeden Prize]], a 2012 [[Onassis Prize]],<ref>https://www.onassis.org/initiatives/onassis-prizes/onassis-prizes-2012-awarding</ref> a 2014 Morgan Stanley - AFA Award for Excellence in Finance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://afajof.org/morgan-stanley-american-finance-association-award-for-excellence-in-finance|title = Morgan Stanley - American Finance Association Award for Excellence in Finance}}</ref> as well as a 2015 [[Deutsche Bank Prize]] for developing models used for assessing prices for options and other assets in the previous 30 years.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/03/03/business/03reuters-economics-ross-prize.html?src=busln U.S. Economist Ross Wins Deutsche Prize for Pricing Models], ''The New York Times''.
