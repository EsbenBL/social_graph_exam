===Other terms===

====Official term====
''Scheduled Castes'' is the official term for Dalits in the opinion of India's National Commissions for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), who took legal advice that indicated modern legislation does not refer to Dalit and that therefore, it says, it is "unconstitutional" for official documents to do so. In 2004, the NCSC noted that some state governments used ''Dalits'' rather than ''Scheduled Castes'' in documentation and asked them to desist.<ref name="express2008a">{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Dalit-word-unconstitutional-says-SC-Commission/262903/|title=Dalit word un-constitutional says SC|date=18 January 2008|newspaper=[[Express India]]|access-date=27 September 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922060507/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Dalit-word-unconstitutional-says-SC-Commission/262903/|archive-date=22 September 2009}}</ref>

Some sources say that ''Dalit'' encompasses a broader range of communities than the official ''Scheduled Caste'' definition. It can include nomadic tribes and another official classification that also originated with the British Raj [[positive discrimination]] efforts in 1935, being the ''Scheduled Tribes''.<ref name="zelliot">{{cite journal|last=Zelliot|first=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Zelliot|year=2010|title=India's Dalits: Racism and Contemporary Change|url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=490|journal=Global Dialogue|volume=12|issue=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430015723/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=490|archive-date=30 April 2013}}</ref> It is also sometimes used to refer to the entirety of India's oppressed peoples,<ref name="kaminsky"/> which is the context that applies to its use in Nepalese society.<ref name="Kanmony"/> An example of the limitations of the ''Scheduled Caste'' category is that, under Indian law, such people can only be followers of Buddhism, Hinduism or Sikhism,<ref name=2011Census/> yet there are communities who claim to be [[Dalit Christian]]s and Muslims,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Kerala Christians and the Caste System |first=C.

====Harijan====
The term ''[[Harijan]]'', or 'children of God', was coined by [[Narsinh Mehta]], a Gujarati poet-saint of the Bhakti tradition, to refer to all devotees of [[Krishna]] irrespective of caste, class, or sex.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ramabadran |first1=Sudharshan |last2=Paswan |first2=Guru |title=Makers of Modern Dalit History |date=2021 |publisher=Penguin Random House India |isbn=9780143451426 |page=xv}}</ref> Mahatma Gandhi, notably an admirer of Mehta's work, first used the word in the context of identifying Dalits in 1933. Ambedkar disliked the name as it placed Dalits in relation to a greater Hindu nation rather than as in an independent community like Muslims. In addition, many Dalits found, and still find, the term patronizing and derogatory, with some even claiming that the term really refers to children of [[devadasi]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/stop-calling-dalits-harijan-sc-calls-term-abusive-we-remain-ignorant-and-insensitive-59315|title=Stop calling Dalits 'Harijan': SC calls the term abusive, as we remain ignorant and insensitive|date=27 March 2017|work=The News Minute|access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Omvedt|first=Gail|author-link=Gail Omvedt|title=Ambedkar: towards an enlightened India|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0143065906}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}} When untouchability was outlawed after Indian independence, the use of the word ''Harijan'' to describe ex-untouchables became more common among other castes than within Dalits themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Rosa Maria|title=Kings and untouchables : a study of the caste system in western India|year=2004|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8-18028-014-6|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDRWAglUumEC&pg=PA15|access-date=25 July 2017}}</ref>

====Regional terms====
In Southern India, Dalits are sometimes known as ''[[Adi Dravida]]'', ''[[Adi Karnataka]]'', and ''Adi Andhra'', which literally mean First Dravidians, Kannadigas, and Andhras, respectively. These terms were first used in 1917 by Southern Dalit leaders, who believed that they were the indigenous inhabitants of India.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Untouchables: Subordination, Poverty and the State in Modern India |first1=Oliver |last1=Mendelsohn |first2=Marika |last2=Vicziany |author-link2=Marika Vicziany |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998|isbn=978-0-52155-671-2 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGbp9MjhvKAC&pg=PA3}}</ref> The terms are used in the states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Andhra Pradesh]]/[[Telangana]], respectively, as a generic term for anyone from a Dalit caste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}{{clarify|reason=Andhra has now bifurcated – does it apply in Telangana also?|date=July 2017}}

In [[Maharashtra]], according to historian and women's studies academic Shailaja Paik, ''Dalit'' is a term mostly used by members of the [[Mahar]] caste, into which Ambedkar was born. Most other communities prefer to use their own caste name.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mahar–Dalit–Buddhist: The history and politics of naming in Maharashtra |first=Shailaja |last=Paik |journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=217–241 |date=September 2011 |doi=10.1177/006996671104500203|s2cid=144346975 }}</ref>

In Nepal, aside from ''Harijan'' and, most commonly, ''Dalit'', terms such as ''Haris'' (among Muslims), ''Achhoot'', ''outcastes'' and ''neech jati'' are used.<ref name="katuwal"/>

==Social status==
{{Main|Caste system in India|Untouchability}}
Dalits have had lowest social status in the traditional Hindu social structure but James Lochtefeld, a professor of religion and Asian studies, said in 2002 that the "adoption and popularization of [the term ''Dalit''] reflects their growing awareness of the situation, and their greater assertiveness in demanding their legal and constitutional rights".<ref>{{cite book|first=James G. |last=Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&pg=PA168|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn= 978-0-8239-3179-8|page=168}}</ref>

India's [[National Commission for Scheduled Castes]] considers official use of ''dalit'' as a label to be "unconstitutional" because modern legislation prefers ''[[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]]''; however, some sources say that ''Dalit'' has encompassed more communities than the official term of ''Scheduled Castes'' and is sometimes used to refer to all of India's oppressed peoples. A similar all-encompassing situation prevails in Nepal.

In 1932, the British Raj recommended separate electorates to select leaders for Dalits in the [[Communal Award]]. This was favoured by Ambedkar but when [[Mahatma Gandhi]] opposed the proposal it resulted in the [[Poona Pact]]. That in turn influenced the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act, 1935]], which introduced the reservation of seats for the Depressed Classes, now renamed as Scheduled Castes.

From soon after [[Indian Independence Act 1947|its independence]] in 1947, India introduced a [[Reservation in India|reservation system]] to enhance the ability of Dalits to have political representation and to obtain government jobs and education.{{clarify|Central or state level or both? Need to check.|date=July 2017}} In 1997, India elected its first Dalit President, [[K. R. Narayanan]]. Many social organisations have promoted better conditions for Dalits through education, healthcare and employment. Nonetheless, while caste-based discrimination was prohibited and untouchability abolished by the [[Constitution of India]], such practices are still widespread. To prevent harassment, assault, discrimination and similar acts against these groups, the [[Government of India]] enacted the [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|Prevention of Atrocities Act]], also called the SC/ST Act, on 31 March 1995. In accordance with the order of the [[Bombay High Court]], the Information and Broadcasting Ministry (I&B Ministry) of the Government of India issued an advisory to all media channels in September 2018, asking them to use "Scheduled Castes" instead of the word "Dalit".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/stop-using-the-term-dalit-i-b-ministry-tells-media-1331855-2018-09-04/ |title=Stop using the term Dalit: I&B Ministry tells media |website=India Today}}</ref>

George Kunnath claims that there "is and has been an internal hierarchy between the various Dalit castes". According to Kunnath, the [[Dusadh]]s are considered the highest while the [[Musahar]]s are considered the lowest within the Dalit groups.<ref>{{cite web |website=[[University of Oxford]] |title=Compliance or Defiance?

=== Occupations ===
In the past, they were believed to be so impure that upper caste Hindus considered their presence to be polluting.

[[Gopal Baba Walangkar]] (c. 1840–1900) is generally considered to be the pioneer of the Dalit movement, seeking a society in which they were not discriminated against. Another pioneer was [[Harichand Thakur]] (c. 1812–1878) with his [[Matua Mahasangha|Matua]] organisation that involved the [[Namasudra]] ([[Chandala]]) community in the [[Bengal Presidency]].

The 1950 Constitution of India, introduced after the [[independence of India|country gained independence]], included measures to improve the socioeconomic conditions of Dalits. Aside from banning untouchability, these included the reservation system, a means of [[positive discrimination]] that created the classifications of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes for Dalits. Communities that were categorised as being one of those groups were guaranteed a percentage of the seats in the national and state legislatures, as well as in government jobs and places of education. The system has its origins in the 1932 Poona Pact between Ambedkar and Gandhi, when Ambedkar conceded his demand that the Dalits should have an electorate separate from the caste Hindus in return for Gandhi accepting measures along these lines.<ref name="keane">{{cite book |title=Religion, Human Rights and International Law: A Critical Examination of Islamic State Practices |editor1-first=Javid |editor1-last=Rehman |editor2-first=Susan |editor2-last=Breau |publisher=BRILL |year=2007 |isbn=978-9-04742-087-3 |first=David |last=Keane |chapter=Why the Hindu Caste System Presents a New Challenge for Human Rights|pages=284–285 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-mwCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA284}}</ref> The notion of a separate electorate had been proposed in the Communal Award made by the British Raj authorities,<ref>{{cite book |title=Religion and Conflict in Modern South Asia |first=William |last=Gould |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-13949-869-2 |pages=151–152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2oexn_mLPIC&pg=PA151}}</ref> and the outcome of the Pact – the Government of India Act of 1935 – both introduced the new term of ''Scheduled Castes'' in replacement for ''Depressed Classes'' and reserved seats for them in the legislatures.<ref>{{cite book |title=Social Exclusion: Essays in Honour of Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak |volume=1 |editor-first=A.

==Discrimination==
According to a 2007 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), the treatment of Dalits has been like a "hidden apartheid" and that they "endure segregation in housing, schools, and access to public services".

According to the 2014 NCAER/University of Maryland survey, 27 per cent of the Indian population still practices untouchability; the figure may be higher because many people refuse to acknowledge doing so when questioned, although the methodology of the survey was also criticised for potentially inflating the figure.<ref>{{cite news|work=Scroll |title=Between the bathroom and the kitchen, there is caste |url=http://scroll.in/article/692513/Between-the-bathroom-and-the-kitchen,-there-is-caste |first=Shivam |last=Vij |date=1 December 2014 |access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref> Across India, Untouchability was practised among 52 per cent of [[Brahmin]]s, 33 per cent of Other Backward Classes and 24 per cent of non-Brahmin [[forward caste]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/casteism-exists-in-india-let-s-not-remain-in-denial/story-QLfGEEFCRVOQLv9eDXIJfN.html |title=Casteism exists in India, let's not remain in denial |last=Bhandare |first=Namita |work=Hindustan Times |date=6 December 2014 |access-date=17 February 2021}}</ref> Untouchability was also practised by people of minority religions – 23 per cent of Sikhs, 18 per cent of Muslims and 5 per cent of Christians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/shashi-tharoor/caste-wont-disappear-india_b_6257354.html|title=Why Caste Won't Disappear From India|first=Shashi|last=Tharoor|date=8 December 2014}}</ref> According to statewide data, Untouchability is most commonly practised in Madhya Pradesh (53 per cent), followed by [[Himachal Pradesh]] (50 per cent), Chhattisgarh (48 per cent), [[Rajasthan]] and Bihar (47 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (43 per cent), and [[Uttarakhand]] (40 per cent).<ref>{{cite news|title=Biggest caste survey: One in four Indians admit to practising untouchability|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/one-in-four-indians-admit-to-practising-untouchability-biggest-caste-survey/ |work=The Indian Express |first=Seema |last=Chishti |date=29 November 2014 |access-date=30 July 2017}}</ref>

In 1855, Mutka Salve, a 14 year old student of Dalit leader [[Savitribai Phule]], wrote that during the rule of [[Baji Rao II|Baji Rao]] of the [[Maratha Empire]], the Dalit castes were chased away from their lands to build large buildings. They were also forced to drink oil mixed with red lead causing them to die, and then they were buried in the foundations of buildings, thus wiping out generations of Dalits. Under the rule of Baji Rao, if a Dalit crossed in front of a gym, they would cut off his head and play "bat and ball" on the ground, with their swords as bats and his head as a ball. Under these 17th century kings, human sacrifice of untouchable persons was not unusual. They also created intricate rules and operations to ensure that they stayed untouchables.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=5 June 2015|title=Contesting Power, Contesting Memories|url=https://www.epw.in/journal/2012/42/special-articles/contesting-power-contesting-memories.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|language=en|volume=47|issue=42|pages=7–8}}</ref> She also wrote that if a Dalit learned to read and write, Baji Rao would say that their education takes away a [[Brahmin]]'s job, and they were punished.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Giri|first=Dipak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWrXDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA167|title=Perspectives on Indian Dalit Literature: Critical Responses|date=19 March 2020|publisher=Booksclinic Publishing|isbn=978-93-89757-71-2|location=|pages=167|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/blog/in-pune-young-dalits-take-on-right-wing-narrative-1794118|title = Blog: In Pune, Young Dalit's Take on Right-Wing Narrative}}</ref>

===Prevention of Atrocities Act===
{{Main|Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989}}{{See also|Caste-related violence in India}}
The Government of India has attempted on several occasions to legislate specifically to address the issue of caste-related violence that affects SCs and STs. Aside from the Constitutional abolition of untouchability, there has been the Untouchability (Offences) Act of 1955, which was amended in the same year to become the Protection of Civil Rights Act. It was determined that neither of those Acts were effective, so the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 (POA) came into force.<ref name="hindu20150823">{{cite news |work=The Hindu |title=Children of a different law |first=G. |last=Sampath |date=23 August 2015 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sunday-anchor/sunday-anchor-g-sampaths-article-on-children-of-a-different-law/article10327614.ece |access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref>

The POA designated specific crimes against SCs and STs as "atrocities" – a criminal act that has "the quality of being shockingly cruel and inhumane" – which should be prosecuted under its terms rather than existing criminal law.<ref name="hindu20150823"/> It created corresponding punishments. Its purpose was to curb and punish violence against Dalits, including humiliations such as the forced consumption of noxious substances. Other atrocities included forced labour, denial of access to water and other public amenities, and sexual abuse. The Act permitted Special Courts exclusively to try POA cases. The Act called on states with high levels of caste violence (said to be "atrocity-prone") to appoint qualified officers to monitor and maintain law and order.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2015, the [[Parliament of India]] passed the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act to address issues regarding implementation of the POA, including instances where the police put procedural obstacles in the way of alleged victims or indeed outright colluded with the accused. It also extended the number of acts that were deemed to be atrocities.<ref name="hindu20150823"/><ref>{{cite news |work=The Hindu |title=Centre notifies rules for amended SC/ST Act |date=24 April 2016 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Centre-notifies-rules-for-amended-SCST-Act/article14253691.ece |access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref> One of those remedies, in an attempt to address the slow process of cases, was to make it mandatory for states to set up the exclusive Special Courts that the POA had delineated. Progress in doing so, however, was reported in April 2017 to be unimpressive. [[P. L. Punia]], a former chairman of the NCSC, said that the number of pending cases was high because most of the extant Special Courts were in fact not exclusive but rather being used to process some non-POA cases, and because "The special prosecutors are not bothered and the cases filed under this Act are as neglected as the victims".<ref>{{cite news |work=Hindustan Times |title=States lag in setting up courts to address SC, ST grievances |first=Smriti Kak |last=Ramachandran |date=16 April 2017 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-lag-in-setting-up-courts-to-address-sc-st-grievances/story-K7r3tuEVHnYWHaRGS6zV6K.html |access-date=23 July 2017}}</ref> While Dalit rights organisations were cautiously optimistic that the amended Act would improve the situation, legal experts were pessimistic.<ref name="hindu20150823"/>

In the 19th century, the [[Brahmo Samaj]], [[Arya Samaj]] and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] actively participated in the rights of Dalits. While Dalits had places to worship, the first upper-caste temple to openly welcome Dalits was the Laxminarayan Temple in [[Wardha]] in 1928. It was followed by the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]] issued by the [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma|last King of Travancore]] in the Indian state of [[Kerala]] in 1936.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In the 1930s, Gandhi and Ambedkar disagreed regarding retention of the caste system. Whilst Ambedkar wanted to see it destroyed, Gandhi thought that it could be modified by reinterpreting Hindu texts so that the untouchables were absorbed into the [[Shudra]] varna. This was this disagreement that led to the Poona Pact.<ref name="keane"/>  Gandhi began the [[Harijan Yatra]] to help the Dalits, but ran into some opposition from Dalits that wanted a complete break from Hinduism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nath|first=Suryakant|title=Gandhi's Harijan Padyatra in Orissa in 1934: Claims over a Contested Social Space|date=2013|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44158858|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=74|pages=564–570|jstor=44158858|issn=2249-1937}}</ref>

The declaration by princely states of Kerala between 1936 and 1947 that temples were open to all Hindus went a long way towards ending Untouchability there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, educational opportunities to Dalits in Kerala remain limited.<ref>{{cite news

Sunrinder S. Jodhka says that, in practice, Sikhs belonging to the landowning dominant castes have not shed all their prejudices against the dalit castes. While dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurudwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar (the communal meal). Therefore, wherever they could mobilise resources, the Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to construct their own gurudwara and other local-level institutions in order to attain a certain degree of cultural autonomy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jodhka|first1=Surinder S|title=Caste and Untouchability in Rural Punjab|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date= 17 May 2002|volume= 37|issue=19|page=1822|jstor=4412102}}</ref> In 1953, Sikh leader, [[Tara Singh (activist)|Master Tara Singh]], succeeded in winning the demands from the Government to include Sikh castes of the converted untouchables in the list of scheduled castes.

Sikh women are required to have the surname "Kaur", and men, the surname "Singh", in order to eradicate caste identities and discrimination.

The [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] reformist [[Satnami]] movement was founded by Dalit [[Guru Ghasidas]]. [[Ravidas|Guru Ravidas]] was also a Dalit. [[Giani Ditt Singh]], a Dalit Sikh reformer, started [[Singh Sabha Movement]] to convert Dalits.

In 2003 the [[Talhan]] village [[Gurudwara]] endured a bitter dispute between [[Jat Sikh]]s and [[Chamar]]s. The Chamars came out in force and confronted the Randhawa and Bains Jat Sikh landlords, who refused to give the Chamars a share on the governing committee of a shrine dedicated to Shaheed Baba Nihal Singh. The shrine earned 3–7 [[crore]] Indian Rupees, and the Jat Sikh [[landlord]]s allegedly "gobbled up a substantial portion of the offerings". Though Dalits form more than 60 per cent of Talhan's 5,000-strong population, local traditions ensured that they were denied a place on the committee. The landlords, in league with radical Sikh organisations and the SGPC, attempted to keep out the Dalits by razing the shrine overnight and constructing a gurdwara on it, but the Dalit quest for a say in the governing committee did not end.<ref name="tehelka.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main16.asp?filename=Cr021806Talhan_scores.asp |title=Talhan scores for dalit rights |work=Tehelka |first=Vikram Jit |last=Singh|date=18 February 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219040226/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main16.asp?filename=Cr021806Talhan_scores.asp|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref>

Chamars fought a four-year court battle with the landlords and their allies, including the [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab Police]]. In that time Jats conducted several boycotts against the Chamars. The Jat Sikhs and their allies cut off the power supply to their homes. In addition, various scuffles and fights set Chamar youths armed with [[Fighting stick|lathis]], rocks, bricks, soda bottles and anything they could find fought Jat Sikh landlords, youths and the Punjab police.

===Christianity===
{{Further|Dalit Christian}}
Christian Dalits are found in India, [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Nepal]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Mohanty, Panchanan |author2=Malik, Ramesh C. |author3=Kasi, Eswarappa |year=2009 |title=Ethnographic Discourse of the Other: Conceptual and methodological issues |pages=39–116 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars}}</ref>

Mass conversions of lower caste Hindus to Christianity and Islam took place in order to escape the discrimination. The main Dalit groups that participated in these conversions were the Chuhras of Punjab, Chamars of North India (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh), Vankars of Gujarat, and Pulayas of Kerala.<ref name="Dalit Christians in India">{{cite web |author=Sobin, George |year=2012 |title=Dalit Christians in India |website=DalitStudies.org.in |url=http://www.dalitstudies.org.in/uploads/publication/1473146694.pdf}}</ref>
The first people converted to Christianity by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] of the Madura Mission were members of Nadars, Maravars, and Pallar.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mosse, David |date=September 1996 |title=[no title cited] |journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=2 |number=3}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=article title, page#, which country's Royal Inst.?}}</ref>
They believed that "Christianity is a true religion; a desire for protection from oppressors and, if possible, material aid; the desire for education for their children; and the knowledge that those who have become Christians had improved".<ref>{{cite conference |conference=South Indian Missionary Congress |year=1908 |place=Madras, Tamil Nadu, IN |title=The Report of Conference Held at Madras}}</ref>

Christianity was thought to be egalitarian and could provide mobility away from the caste. Sometimes the only change seen was their personal religious identity. Even after conversion, in some cases Dalits were discriminated against due to the "residual leftover" practice of caste discrimination from their previous traditions. This is attributed to the predominantly Hindu society they lived in.<ref name=Dumont_1980>{{cite book |author=Dumont, Louis |year=1980 |title=Homo Hierarchicus: The caste system and its implications |edition=Complete Revised |place=Chicago, IL |publisher=Chicago University Press}}</ref>
Discrimination against Dalit Christians also remained in interactions and mannerisms between castes; for example, during the earlier days, the 'lower caste Christians' had to [<!--close-->cover] their mouths when talking to a Syrian Christian.<ref name="Dalit Christians in India"/>
In many cases they were still referred to by their Hindu caste names: For example ''Pulayans'' in Kerala, ''Pariah'' in Tamil Nadu, and ''Madigas'' in Andra Pradesh, by members of all religious backgrounds.<ref name=Louis2007>{{cite report |author=Louis, Prakash |year=2007 |title=Caste-based discrimination and atrocities on Dalit Christians and the need for reservations |series=Working Paper Series |volume=II |issue=4 |place=New Delhi, IN |publisher=Indian Institute of Dalit Studies}}</ref>

Even after conversion, to some extent segregation, restriction, hierarchy, and graded ritual purity remained. Data shows that there is more discrimination and less class mobility among the people living in the rural areas, where incidents of caste discrimination is higher among people from all religious backgrounds.<ref name="Dalit Christians in India"/>
In many cases, the churches referred to the Dalits as 'New Christians'. It is alleged to be a derogatory term which classifies the Dalit Christians to be looked down upon by other Christians. During the earlier days of Christianity, in some churches in south India the Dalits had either separate seating, or had to attend the mass outside.<ref name=Louis2007/> Dalit Christians are also said to be grossly underrepresented amongst the clergy in some places.<ref>{{cite news |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2010 |title=Indian Dalits find no refuge from caste in Christianity}}</ref>

Inter-caste marriage among Christians is also not commonly practised. For example, Syrian Christians in Kerala will not marry Dalit Christians {{Confusing|section|date=September 2021}}{{clarify|date=August 2020|reason=Did the writer mean "will ''not'' marry"? (lost word ''not'')}} Even intermarriage between Bamons and Sudras in Goa is quite uncommon. Sometimes marriage to a higher class Hindu is preferred to marriage to a Dalit Christian.

Caste-based occupations held by Dalits also show a clear segregation which perpetuated even after becoming Christian. Occupational patterns (including manual scavenging) are prevalent among Dalit Christians in north-west India are said to be quite similar to that of Dalit Hindus.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dogar, Vidya Sagar |year=2000 |title=Rural Christian Community in North West India |place=New Delhi, IN}}</ref> Occupational discrimination for Dalit Christians goes so far as to restrict not only employment but in some cases for clean sanitation and water.<ref>Jose, Kananaikil. 1990.

The rise of [[Hindutva]]'s (Hindu nationalism) role in Indian politics has accompanied allegations that religious conversions of Dalits are due to allurements like education and jobs rather than faith. Critics{{Who|date=October 2009}} argue that laws banning conversion and limiting social relief for converts mean that conversion impedes economic success. However, [[Bangaru Laxman]], a Dalit politician, was a prominent member of the Hindutva movement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Sub-Plan===
The [[SC, ST Sub-Plan (Andhra Pradesh)|SC, ST Sub-Plan]], or ''Indiramma Kalalu'', is a budget allocation by the Government of Andhra Pradesh for the welfare of Dalits. The law was enacted in May 2013. SCs and STs have separate panels for spending.

The Hindu Forum of Britain conducted their own research, concluding that caste discrimination was "not endemic in British society", that reports to the contrary aimed to increase discrimination by legislating expression and behaviour and that barriers should instead be removed through education.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Hasan_Suroor/caste-discrimination-uk-dalits-win-the-argument-nearly/article611931.ece |first=Hasan |last=Suroor |title=Caste discrimination – U.K. Dalits win the argument, nearly |work=The Hindu |date=4 September 2010 |access-date=20 January 2013 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>

A 2010 study found that caste discrimination occurs in Britain at work and in service provision. While not ruling out the possibility of discrimination in education, no such incidents were uncovered. The report found favourable results from educational activities. However, non-legislative approaches were claimed to be less effective in the workplace and would not help when the authorities were discriminating. One criticism of discrimination law was the difficulty in obtaining proof of violations. Perceived benefits of legislation were that it provides redress, leads to greater understanding and reduces the social acceptance of such discrimination.<ref name="homeoffice.gov.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/research/caste-discrimination/caste-discrimination?view=Binary|title=Caste Discrimination and Harassment in Great Britain|publisher=Home Office, UK Government |author=Government Equalities Office |date=1 December 2010 |access-date=23 July 2017}}</ref>

From September 2013 to February 2014, Indian philosopher [[Meena Dhanda]] led a project on 'Caste in Britain' for the UK [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC), which focused on the proposed inclusion of a provision in the [[Equality Act 2010]] to protect British citizens against caste discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wlv.ac.uk/about-us/our-schools-and-institutes/faculty-of-arts/school-of-humanities/staff/dr-meena-dhanda/|title=Dr Meena Dhanda – University of Wolverhampton|website=wlv.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref>

Caste-based discrimination has occurred amongst Sikhs in the UK. At a sports competition in [[Birmingham]] in 1999, Jat Sikhs refused to eat food that had been cooked and prepared by the Chamar community.<ref name="Human Rights Commission p22">Human rights watch (2001) Caste discrimination: A global concern.

Many Sikhs do not wish to give Chamars equal status in their gurdwaras and communities.{{sfn|Takhar|2005|p=119}} Sikh Chamars (Ramdassi Sikhs) united with fellow Chamars across religious boundaries to form Ravidassi temples.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Mazhabi Sikhs were subjected to the same forms of inequality and discrimination in gurdwaras from Upper caste Sikhs and unified with Hindu Churas to form Valmiki temples.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Sikh gurdwaras, which often are controlled by the older first generation immigrants, in Britain generally frown upon inter-caste marriages even though they are on the rise. More and more families are affected by inter-caste marriages.

The few gurdwaras that accept inter-caste marriages do so reluctantly. Gurdwaras may insist on the presence of ''Singh'' and ''Kaur'' in the names of the bridegroom and bride, or deny them access to gurdwara-based religious services and community centres.<ref name="newageislam.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.newageislam.com/islam-and-pluralism/multiculturalism--the-rise-of-mixed-marriage-britain/d/6336 |title= Multiculturalism: The Rise of Mixed-marriage Britain, Islam and Pluralism |first=Ramindar |last=Singh |publisher=Newageislam.com |date=10 January 2012 |access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref>

===In the Caribbean===
It is estimated that in 1883, about one-third of the immigrants who arrived in the Caribbean were Dalits. The shared experience of being exploited in a foreign land gradually broke down caste barriers in the Caribbean Hindu communities.<ref name="Naidu"/>

===In the United States===
Many Dalits first came to the United States to flee caste-based oppression in South Asia. After the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], the demand for labourers brought in many caste-diverse South Asian immigrants, many of whom were Dalit. After the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act]], immigrants from India were primarily professionals and students, largely from upper caste or dominant caste families. However, from the 1990s onwards, many more of the skilled labourers arriving from India have been Dalit, due to multiple generations of affirmative action policies in India, as well as ongoing efforts of organised resistance against caste discrimination.<ref>Zwick-Maitreyi, M., Soundararajan, T., Dar, N., Bheel, R.F., and Balakrishnan, P. (2018) "Caste in the United States. A Survey of Caste among South Asian Americans." Equality Labs, USA. 28</ref><ref>Lerche, Jens. "Transnational Advocacy Networks and Affirmative Action for Dalits in India."</ref>

Dalits have faced discrimination and mistreatment throughout their existence in the United States. In the landmark Supreme Court Case ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'', Thind unsuccessfully argued for his right to citizenship by claiming that his lighter complexion and upper-caste background implied that he was in fact Caucasian. Thind's lawyers described his supposed superiority to lower-caste Indians, stating "The high-caste Hindu regards the aboriginal Indian Mongoloid in the same manner as the American regards the Negro, speaking from a matrimonial standpoint." This attitude describes the disapproval of low-caste Indians such as Dalits held by upper caste Indian Americans at the time.<ref>Bigsby, Christopher. The Cambridge Companion to Modern American Culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006.</ref>

Some people, like [[S.P. Kothari]], argue that there is no caste division within Hindus in the United States today.<ref>Ray, Tinku. "The US Isn't Safe from the Trauma of Caste Bias." The World from PRX, 2019. https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-03-08/us-isn-t-safe-trauma-caste-bias.</ref> However, reports and stories have shown Dalit Americans continue to face significant discrimination in the United States. In 2018, Equality Labs released a report on "Caste in the United States". This report found that one in two Dalit Americans live in fear of their caste being "outed". In addition, 60% have experienced caste-based discriminatory jokes, and 25% have suffered verbal or physical assault because of their caste.<ref>Zwick-Maitreyi, M., Soundararajan, T., Dar, N., Bheel, R.F., and Balakrishnan, P. (2018) "Caste in the United States. A Survey of Caste among South Asian Americans." Equality Labs, USA. 8–10</ref>

The Equality Labs report also found that two-thirds of Dalit Americans experienced unfair treatment at their workplace. In late June 2020, the [[California Department of Fair Employment and Housing]] filed a lawsuit against [[Cisco Systems]], alleging that a Dalit engineer at the company faced discrimination from two of his upper-caste supervisors for his Dalit background.<ref>Weissner, Daniel.
