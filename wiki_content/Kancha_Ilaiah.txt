==Early life==
{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}
Kancha Ilaiah was born in the village of Papaiahpet, [[Warangal district]] of [[Chennaraopet]] Mandal in [[Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]] State.<ref name="rediff">{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/may/24ap.htm |work=Rediff |title=The attempt to censor my writings is part of a larger game plan |date=24 May 2000 |access-date=16 December 2014}}</ref> His family belonged to the sheep-grazing [[Golla (caste)|Kuruma Golla]] caste, a community designated by the Government of India as an [[Other Backward Class]].<ref name="Kancha Ilaiah" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-caste-reference-in-his-2009-book-has-come-back-to-haunt-kancha-ilaiah/story-q7EbiFUWXbW902JDn5u1MI.html|title=How a caste reference in his 2009 book has come back to haunt Kancha Ilaiah|date=16 October 2017|website=Hindustan Times}}</ref> Ilaiah's father Kancha Komuraiah was always away from home while grazing sheep.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-16|title=How anti-caste activist Kancha Ilaiah's mother was an inspiration for his rebellion|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/how-anti-caste-activist-kancha-ilaiah-s-mother-was-inspiration-his-rebellion-133170|access-date=2021-03-10|website=The News Minute|language=en}}</ref> The dominant figure in the family was his mother. Ilaiah credited his mother, Kancha Kattamma, as pivotal in shaping his political thought.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-cow-protection-laws-brutalise-our-culture/articleshow/53691544.cms|title=How cow protection laws brutalise our culture|via=The Economic Times}}</ref> According to Ilaiah, she was at the forefront of the Kurumas' struggle against the [[forest range officer|forest guards']] discriminatory behaviour.

Ilaaih suffixed 'Shepherd' to his name symbolically, as he comes from a shepherding family.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shepherd|first=Kancha Ilaiah|title=The violence of caste: Why I have changed my name to Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd|url=http://scroll.in/article/808890/kancha-ilaiah-explains-why-he-decided-to-add-shepherd-to-his-name|access-date=2021-05-13|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Professional life==
Ilaiah received an M.A. degree in [[political science]] and an M.Phil., awarded for his study of [[land reform in India|land reform]] in undivided [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref name=rediff/> He has been a recipient of the [[Mahatma Jyotirao Phule]] Award and was a [[Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship|Nehru Fellow]] between 1994 and 1997.<ref name=rediff/>

Ilaiah earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] on the basis of his work exploring the political dimension of [[Buddhism in India|Buddhism]], culminating in ''God as Political Philosopher - Buddha's Challenge to Brahminism''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/%E2%80%9CModi-should-ask-sadhus-to-clean-the-streets%E2%80%9D/article14481502.ece|title="Modi should ask sadhus to clean the streets"|first=Staff|last=Reporter|date=10 July 2016|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>

Ilaiah has encouraged proficiency in the English language for Dalits, arguing that it would allow Dalits in India to intellectually engage the world outside India without non-Dalits speaking "for them".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introduce English in all schools, says Kancha Ilaiah|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2016/aug/08/Introduce-English-in-all-schools-says-Kancha-Ilaiah-1506820.html|access-date=2020-10-31|website=The New Indian Express}}</ref><ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/interviews/Kancha-Ilaiah-Even-if-10-dalit-children-got-English-education-India-would-change/articleshow/18503625.cms</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/808852/in-defense-of-english-blame-the-education-system-not-the-language|title=In defence of English: Blame the Indian education system, not the language|first=Akshat|last=Jain|website=Scroll.in}}</ref> In May 2016, in protest against "Brahmanic hegemony" he says continues to persist in India, Ilaiah appended "Shepherd" to his name. Ilaiah identified in this choice recognition and reaffirmation of his family origins. As an English-language proper noun rather than its equivalent in an Indian language, "Shepherd" is meant to demonstrate a symbolic break with the cultural norms Ilaiah believed Brahmins sought to "impose" on Indian society. Ilaiah characterises his name change as a tool to break these norms and to value the work of what he terms "productive classes:" including Scheduled Castes and OBCs.<ref name="hindustantimes1">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/we-need-a-new-god-says-dalit-thinker-kancha-ilaiah/story-ooWKO6iUKLAXv7qFqEW4ML.html |title=Good Shepherd: Dalit thinker Kancha Ilaiah on name, caste |work=Hindustan Times |date=2016-05-27 |access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>

Kancha Ilaiah is an [[Ambedkarite]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyo.in/voices/kancha-ilaiah-dalit-gauri-lankesh-br-ambedkar/story/1/19836.html|title=Threats to Kancha Ilaiah show India has learnt nothing from Gauri Lankesh's death|website=www.dailyo.in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-ethereal-realist/280966|title=The Ethereal Realist &#124; Outlook India Magazine|website=www.outlookindia.com/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/2019/06/21/gandhi-was-not-a-caste-abolitionist-kancha-ilaiah-shepherd.html|title=Gandhi was not a caste abolitionist: Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd|website=The Week}}</ref> As an anti-caste activist,<ref name="rediff" /> Ilaiah is often misidentified by the media as being a Dalit himself.<ref>{{cite news|title=India's President Ram Nath Kovind takes oath|work=www.aljazeera.com|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/india-president-ram-nath-kovind-takes-oath-170725074458219.html}}</ref> Ilaiah identifies himself as a [[Shudra|Sudra]] intellectual.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mondal |first1=Sudipto |title=Good Shepherd: Dalit thinker Kancha Ilaiah on name, caste |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/we-need-a-new-god-says-dalit-thinker-kancha-ilaiah/story-ooWKO6iUKLAXv7qFqEW4ML.html |access-date=21 January 2020 |work=Hindustan Times |date=27 May 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

Currently, Ilaiah is serving as retired director of the Centre for Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy at [[Maulana Azad National Urdu University]] (MANUU) in [[Hyderabad]].

Ilaiah has also spoken against caste inequality. BJP govt doesn't want his books because he talks about caste equality when his books were slated to be removed from Delhi University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/india/governance/bjp-govt-doesnt-want-my-books-because-i-talk-of-caste-equality-dalit-writer-kancha-ilaiah/146823/|title=BJP govt doesn’t want my books because I talk of caste equality: OBC writer Kancha Ilaiah}}</ref>

==Criticism==
While working as an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at [[Osmania University]], several of Ilaiah's colleagues as well as academics affiliated with the university expressed, in an open-letter, their concern with respect to certain articles and opinions Ilaiah had contributed to a local newspaper and advised him against writing material that could inflame sectarian discontent or prejudice.<ref name=rediff/>

In February 2013, at the [[Jaipur Literary Festival]], Ilaiah and [[Javed Akhtar]] engaged in a heated discussion over the implications of religion in Indian social life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jaipur-literature-festival-ends-but-controversy-lingers/article4354622.ece|title=Jaipur Literature Festival ends, but controversy lingers|first=Mohammed|last=Iqbal|date=29 January 2013|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>

Ilaiah has also been criticised by right wing [[Hindutva]] activists for accepting the [[Indo-Aryan migration#"Aryan invasion"|Aryan invasion theory]].<ref name="hindustantimes1"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/18franc.htm|title=Who are the real Dalits of India?|website=www.rediff.com}}</ref> In November 2015, Ilaiah stated that if [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of India credited with forging national unity amidst the intense violence and bloodletting that followed the creation of Pakistan, had been Prime Minister of India, India "would have become Pakistan".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/if-sardar-patel-was-pm-india-would-ve-become-pakistan-kancha-ilaiah/story-l3SqCY5Dqta6uu0TeLIYHJ.html |title=If Sardar Patel was PM, India would've become Pakistan: Kancha Ilaiah |work=Hindustan Times |date=2015-11-30 |access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>

In April 2016, Ilaiah gave a controversial remark that vegetarianism is [[anti-nationalism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/politics/vegetarians-are-anti-national-kancha-ilaiahs-hyperbole-illustrating-ambedkars-food-democracy-2728650.html|title=Vegetarianism is anti-nationalism: Kancha Ilaiah on Ambedkar's food democracy-Politics News , Firstpost|date=14 April 2016|website=Firstpost}}</ref> On 18 September 2017, [[T.
