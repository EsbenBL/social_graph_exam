'''Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|uː|k|uː|ˈ|j|ɑː|m|ə|,_|-|k|ə|ˈ|-}}, {{IPA-ja|ɸɯ̥kɯꜜjama|lang}}; born October 27, 1952) is an American [[Political science|political scientist]], [[Political economy|political economist]], and writer of [[Japanese Americans|Japanese descent]].

Fukuyama is known for his book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992), which argues that the worldwide spread of [[liberal democracies]] and free-market [[capitalism]] of the [[Western World|West]] and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government. However, his subsequent book ''Trust: Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity'' (1995) modified his earlier position to acknowledge that culture cannot be cleanly separated from economics. Fukuyama is also associated with the rise of the [[neoconservative]] movement,<ref>Thies, Clifford (June 24, 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5377/The-End-of-Hystery-Francis-Fukuyamas-Review-of-The-Constitution-of-Liberty The End of Hystery?

==Scholarship==

=== ''The End of History and the Last Man'' ===
{{Main|The End of History and the Last Man}}
Fukuyama is best known as the author of ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', in which he argued that the progression of human history as a struggle between ideologies was largely at an end, with the world settling on [[liberal democracy]] after the end of the [[Cold War]] and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. The book was an expansion on ideas expressed in an earlier article, "The End of History?" published in ''[[The National Interest]].'' In the article, Fukuyama predicted the coming global triumph of political and economic liberalism:

{{quote|What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.|author=Francis Fukuyama|title="The End of History?"|source=The National Interest, No.16 (Summer 1989)}}

Authors like [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his [[15 minutes of fame]], which would soon be followed by a slide into obscurity.<ref>Dahrendorf (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=obx2BX91FQUC&pg=PA37 ''Reflections on the revolution in Europe''] p. 37</ref><ref>[[Luciano Canfora]] [http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/la-grande-illusione-del-capitalismo-eterno/ ''La grande illusione del capitalismo eterno''] preface to Ercolani, Paolo ''La storia infinita. Marx, il liberalismo e la maledizione di Nietzsche'' quotation: {{quote|Quanto detto sin qui può forse bastare a non prendere sul serio saggi troppo fortunati (ma già quasi avviati al dimenticatoio) come La fine della storia del nippo-statunitense Fukuyama. Libro che, comunque, è stato ampiamente stroncato per le sciocchezze che contiene: e non già da tardi epigoni del marxismo-leninismo, ma da filosofi 'liberal' come Dahrendorf, il quale ha anche avuto il buon senso di elencare gli errori di fatto (tali da mettere in forse il conseguimento della "maturità classica"!) che il troppo fortunato libretto contiene.}}</ref> However, Fukuyama remained a relevant and cited [[public intellectual]], leading American [[communitarianism|communitarian]] [[Amitai Etzioni]] to declare him "one of the few enduring public intellectuals. They are often media stars who are eaten up and spat out after their 15 minutes. But he has lasted."<ref name="guardianprofile">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/11/academicexperts.artsandhumanities |title=History's Pallbearer |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 10, 2002 |last=Wroe |first=Nicholas}}</ref>

According to Fukuyama, one of the main critiques of ''The End of History'' was of his aggressive stance towards [[postmodernism]]. Postmodern philosophy had, in Fukuyama's opinion, undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the western world in a potentially weaker position.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, "Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: "World Historians and Their Critics" (May 1995): 43.</ref> The fact that Marxism and fascism had proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, "Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: World Historians and Their Critics (May 1995): 36.</ref>

=== ''The Origins of Political Order'' ===
{{Main|The Origins of Political Order}}
In the 2011 book, Fukuyama describes what makes a state stable, using comparative [[political history]] to develop a theory of the stability of a [[political system]]. According to Fukuyama, an ideal political order needs a modern and effective state, the rule of law governing the state and be accountable.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Fukuyama | first1 = Francis | title=Origins of political order : from prehuman times to the French revolution | year = 2011 | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0374-5332-29| edition=1st paperback|pages=312, 420}}</ref>

=== ''Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day'' ===
{{Main|Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day}}
The 2014 book is the second book on political order, following the 2011 book ''[[The Origins of Political Order]].'' In this book, Fukuyama covers events taking place since the French Revolution and sheds light on political institutions and their development in different regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy|url=https://fukuyama.stanford.edu/political-order-and-political-decay-industrial-revolution-globalization-democracy|last1=Fukuyama|first1=Francis|publisher=Stanford.edu|access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref>

After tracing how a modern and effective government was developed in the U.S., Fukuyama asserts that it is experiencing political decay.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Berman|first=Sheri|date=2014-09-11|title=Global Warning|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/books/review/francis-fukuyamas-political-order-and-political-decay.html|access-date=2020-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Fukuyama believes that political decay can be seen in the deterioration of bureaucracies, special interest groups capturing the legislature, and inevitable but cumbersome judicial processes challenging all types of government action.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|date=2016-12-08|title=America in Decay|journal=Foreign Affairs : America and the World|language=en-US|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-18/america-decay|access-date=2020-05-15|issn=0015-7120}}</ref>

=== Other works ===
Fukuyama has written a number of other books, among them ''Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity'' and ''[[Our Posthuman Future|Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution]]''. In the latter, he qualified his original "end of history" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own [[evolution]], it may allow humans to alter [[human nature]], thereby putting liberal democracy at risk.<ref>For a critical analysis of Fukuyama's bioethical argument, see: {{Cite journal|last1=Jordaan|first1=D. W.|year=2009|title=Antipromethean Fallacies: A Critique of Fukuyama's Bioethics|journal=Biotechnology Law Report|volume=28|issue=5|pages=577–590|doi=10.1089/blr.2009.9915}}</ref> One possible outcome could be that an altered human nature could end in radical inequality. He is a fierce enemy of [[transhumanism]], an intellectual movement asserting that [[posthuman]]ity is a desirable goal.

In another work, ''The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order'', Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms, and analyses the current disruptions in the fabric of our moral traditions, which he considers as arising from a shift from the manufacturing to the information age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.

In 2006, in ''[[America at the Crossroads]]'', Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush administration, as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.

In 2008, Fukuyama published the book ''Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States'', which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain understanding on why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations is a key impediment to growth. An unequal distribution of wealth, he stated, leads to social upheaval, which then results in stunted growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fukuyama: "Social Agenda" Needed to Combat Poverty in Latin America|url=http://www.devex.com/blogs/17/blogs_entries/59071|author=Ryan Weddle|date=February 18, 2009|work=[[Devex]]|access-date=February 19, 2009}}</ref>

At the start of the following decade he published some reflections on his work in the form of conversations under the title ''After the End of History''<ref>''After the End of History: Conversations with Francis Fukuyama'', Edited by Mathilde Fasting,
Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2021.</ref>

== Political views ==

===Neoconservatism===
As a key [[Reagan Administration]] contributor to the formulation of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of [[neoconservatism]], although his works came out years after [[Irving Kristol]]'s 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism.<ref>[[Irving Kristol]] (1972), ''On the Democratic Idea in America'', New York: Harper.</ref> Fukuyama was active in the [[Project for the New American Century]] think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 [[Project for the New American Century#Open letter to President Clinton on Iraq|letter]] recommending that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of [[Iraq]] [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=PNACClinton>{{cite web| url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909200819/http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archive-date=September 9, 2008| title=Letter to President Clinton on Iraq| access-date=August 16, 2008| author=Abrams, Elliott| date=January 26, 1998| format=PDF| display-authors=etal| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all| author-link=Elliott Abrams}}</ref> He was also among forty co-signers of [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol's]] September 20, 2001 letter to President [[George W. Bush]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] that suggested the U.S. not only "capture or kill [[Osama bin Laden]]", but also embark upon "a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq".<ref>{{Cite web | title = Letter to President Bush on the War on Terrorism | url = http://www.newamericancentury.org/Bushletter.htm | website = [[Project for the New American Century]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230063728/http://www.newamericancentury.org/Bushletter.htm | archive-date = December 30, 2004 }}</ref>

In a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article from February 2006, Fukuyama, in considering the ongoing [[Iraq War]], stated: "What American foreign policy needs is not a return to a narrow and cynical realism, but rather the formulation of a 'realistic Wilsonianism' that better matches means to ends."<ref name="nyt2006">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/neo.html?pagewanted=6&sq=Francis%20Fukuyama&st=cse&scp=2|title=After Neoconservatism |date=February 19, 2006|work=The New York Times | first=Francis | last=Fukuyama | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref> In regard to neoconservatism, he went on to say: "What is needed now are new ideas, neither neoconservative nor realist, for how America is to relate to the rest of the world – ideas that retain the neoconservative belief in the universality of human rights, but without its illusions about the efficacy of American power and hegemony to bring these ends about."<ref name="nyt2006"/>

===Current views===
Fukuyama began to distance himself from the neoconservative agenda of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], citing its excessive militarism and embrace of unilateral armed intervention, particularly in the Middle East. By mid 2004, Fukuyama had voiced his growing opposition to the [[Iraq War]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.anu.edu.au/sss/pols3017/Recent%20Articles/The%20Neoconservative%20Moment%20Fukuyama.pdf|title=The Neoconservative Moment|author=Francis Fukuyama|work=[[The National Interest]]|date=June 1, 2004|access-date=May 13, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610221956/http://arts.anu.edu.au/sss/pols3017/Recent%20Articles/The%20Neoconservative%20Moment%20Fukuyama.pdf|archive-date=June 10, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and called for [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s resignation as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&alt=&trh=20040714&hn=10372|date=July 14, 2004|access-date=May 13, 2007|title=Fukuyama Withdraws Bush Support|work=[[Today's Zaman (newspaper)|Today's Zaman]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212459/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&alt=&trh=20040714&hn=10372|archive-date=June 13, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

At an annual dinner of the American Enterprise Institute in February 2004, [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Charles Krauthammer]] declared the beginning of a [[Polarity in international relations#Unipolarity|unipolar]] era under American [[hegemony]]. "All of these people around me were cheering wildly,"<ref name=Newsweek>{{cite news |last=Bast |first=Andrew |title=The Beginning of History |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/04/10/the-beginning-of-history.html |access-date=May 5, 2011 |newspaper=[[Newsweek]] |date=April 10, 2011}}</ref> Fukuyama remembers. He believes that the Iraq War was being blundered. "All of my friends had taken leave of reality."<ref name=Newsweek /> He has not spoken to [[Paul Wolfowitz]] (previously a good friend) since.<ref name=Newsweek />

Fukuyama declared he would not be voting for Bush,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article456505.ece |author=Andrew Billen |date=July 14, 2004 |access-date=May 13, 2007 |title=Why I won't vote for George Bush |location=London |work=The Times }}</ref> and that the Bush administration had made three mistakes:<ref>{{cite web|title=Francis Fukuyama on Neo-Cons, Foreign Policy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5239049|publisher=NPR|date=March 1, 2006}}</ref>
* Overstating the threat of [[Islamic extremism]] to the US
* Failing to foresee the fierce negative reaction to its "benevolent hegemony". From the very beginning showing a negative attitude toward the United Nations and other [[intergovernmental organization]]s and not seeing that it would increase [[anti-Americanism]] in other countries
* Misjudging what was needed to bring peace in [[Iraq]] and being overly optimistic about the success with which [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] of western values could be applied to Iraq and the Middle East in general.

Fukuyama believes the US has a right to promote its own values in the world, but more along the lines of what he calls "realistic [[Wilsonianism]]", with military intervention only as a last resort and only in addition to other measures. A latent military force is more likely to have an effect than actual deployment. The US spends 43% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders |title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2011}}</ref> but Iraq shows there are limits to its effectiveness.

The US should instead stimulate political and economic development and gain a better understanding of what happens in other countries. The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of [[World War II]] was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy, but such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work ''[[America at the Crossroads]]''.

In a 2006 essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with [[Leninism]]. He wrote that neoconservatives "believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will. Leninism was a tragedy in its Bolshevik version, and it has returned as farce when practiced by the United States. Neoconservatism, as both a political symbol and a body of thought, has evolved into something I can no longer support."<ref name="After Neoconservatism">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/neo.html?ex=1298005200&en=4126fa38fefd80de&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|title=After Neoconservatism|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=February 19, 2006|access-date=May 13, 2007|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}</ref>

{{quote|I'm voting for Barack Obama this November for a very simple reason. It is hard to imagine a more disastrous presidency than that of George W. Bush. It was bad enough that he launched an unnecessary war and undermined the standing of the United States throughout the world in his first term. But in the waning days of his administration, he is presiding over a collapse of the American financial system and broader economy that will have consequences for years to come. As a general rule, democracies don't work well if voters do not hold political parties accountable for failure. While [[John McCain]] is trying desperately to pretend that he never had anything to do with the Republican Party, I think it would be a travesty to reward the Republicans for failure on such a grand scale.}}

In a 2018 interview with ''[[New Statesman]]'', when asked about his views on the resurgence of [[socialist]] politics in the United States and the United Kingdom, he responded:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2018/10/francis-fukuyama-interview-socialism-ought-come-back|title=Francis Fukuyama interview: "Socialism ought to come back"|author= George Eaton|date=October 17, 2018|access-date=October 17, 2018|work=New Statesman America}}</ref>

{{quote|It all depends on what you mean by socialism. Ownership of the means of production – except in areas where it's clearly called for, like public utilities – I don't think that's going to work. If you mean redistributive programmes that try to redress this big imbalance in both incomes and wealth that has emerged then, yes, I think not only can it come back, it ought to come back. This extended period, which started with Reagan and Thatcher, in which a certain set of ideas about the benefits of unregulated markets took hold, in many ways it's had a disastrous effect. At this juncture, it seems to me that certain things Karl Marx said are turning out to be true. He talked about the crisis of overproduction… that workers would be impoverished and there would be insufficient demand.}}

In a review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Fukuyama discussed [[Ezra Klein]]'s 2020 book ''[[Why We're Polarized]]'' regarding [[US politics]], and outlined Klein's central conclusion about the importance of race and [[white identity]] to [[Donald Trump]] voters and Republicans.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/01/24/why-red-blue-america-cant-hear-each-other-anymore/|title=Why red and blue America can't hear each other anymore|author=Francis Fukuyama|quote=These two phenomena — the Southern realignment and the human propensity to bond with groups — bring us to Klein’s central conclusion about the centrality of race for Trump voters and Republicans who believe their [[white identity]] is under threat.|date=January 24, 2020|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

In 2020, Fukuyama became the chair of the editorial board for ''American Purpose,'' a magazine established in 2020 to promote three central ideas. First, it wants to promote [[liberal democracy]] in the United States. Second, it seeks to understand and opine on the challenges to liberal democracy in other countries. Third, it wants to "offer criticism and commentary on history and biography, high art and pop culture, science and technology."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-01|title=About|url=https://www.americanpurpose.com/about/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=American Purpose|language=en}}</ref>

Fukuyama has also perceived Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election as the result of the Western system's ability to correct mistakes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|date=2020-12-15|title=Francis Fukuyama on the State of Democracy in 2020 and Beyond|language=en-US|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/francis-fukuyama-on-the-state-of-democracy-in-2020-and-beyond-11608051600|access-date=2021-01-15|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>
