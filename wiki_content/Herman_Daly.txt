'''Herman Edward Daly''' (born July 21, 1938) is an American [[Ecological economics|ecological]] and [[Georgism#Georgism and environmental economics|Georgist]] [[economist]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Daly|first1=Herman|title=Smart Talk: Herman Daly on what's beyond GNP Growth|quote=...I am really sort of a Georgist.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npmx_qsCHz4|publisher=Henry George School of Social Science|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref> and emeritus professor at the [[University of Maryland School of Public Policy|School of Public Policy]] of [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in the [[United States]], best known for his time as a senior economist at the [[World Bank]] from 1988 to 1994.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Donella |first1=Meadows |title=A Farewell Address by the World Bank's Most Outrageous Economist |url=http://donellameadows.org/archives/a-farewell-address-by-the-world-banks-most-outrageous-economist/ |publisher=Academy for Systems Change |access-date=6 March 2021}}</ref> In 1996, he was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] for "defining a path of ecological economics that integrates the key elements of ethics, quality of life, environment and community."

== Life and work ==
Before joining the World Bank, Daly was a Research Associate at Yale University,<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Daly | first = Herman E. | title = On thinking about energy in the future | journal = [[Natural Resources Forum]] | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–26 | doi = 10.1111/j.1477-8947.1978.tb00389.x | date = October 1978 }}</ref>  and Alumni Professor of Economics at [[Louisiana State University]].

Daly was Senior Economist in the Environment Department of the [[World Bank]], where he helped to develop policy guidelines related to [[sustainable development]].  While there, he was engaged in environmental operations work in Latin America.  He is closely associated with theories of a [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]].  He was a co-founder and associate editor of the journal, ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=About |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/503305/description#description | website = [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] }}</ref>

In 1989 Daly and [[John B. Cobb]] developed the [[Measure of Economic Welfare|Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW)]], which they proposed as a more valid measure of socio-economic progress than [[gross domestic product]].

Daly is a recipient of an Honorary [[Right Livelihood Award]],<ref>[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daly.html Herman Daly (USA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708053433/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daly.html |date=2009-07-08 }}</ref> the [[Dr A.H.

He is widely credited with having originated the idea of [[uneconomic growth]], though some credit this to [[Marilyn Waring]] who developed it more completely in her study of the [[UN System of National Accounts]].<ref>Waring, M. 1988. ''Counting for Nothing: What Men Value and What Women are Worth''. Reprinted in 1996 by Bridget Williams Books.</ref> In 2014, Daly was the recipient of the [[Blue Planet Prize]]<ref>[http://www.af-info.or.jp/en/blueplanet/list.html#2014 Blue Planet Prize - Laureate 2014]</ref> of the Asahi Glass Foundation.
