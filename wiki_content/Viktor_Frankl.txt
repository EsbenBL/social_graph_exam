==Early life==
Frankl was born the middle of three children to Gabriel Frankl, a civil servant in the Ministry of Social Service, and Elsa (née Lion).<ref name="FranklRecollections" /> His interest in psychology and the role of meaning developed when he began taking night classes on applied psychology while in junior high school.<ref name="FranklRecollections" /> As a teenager he began corresponding with Sigmund Freud, when he asked for permission to publish one of his papers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Viktor Frankl {{!}} Biography, Books, Theory, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Viktor-Frankl|access-date=2021-07-06|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=16 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616065045/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Viktor-Frankl|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hatala|first=Andrew|date=2010|title=Frankl and Freud: Friend or Foe?

During his studies, he specialized in neurology and psychiatry, with a focus on depression and suicide.

In 1924, Frankl's first scientific paper was published in ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/psychology/psychologists/viktor-frankl|title=List of books and articles about Viktor Frankl|website=|access-date=|archive-date=18 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718021858/https://www.questia.com/library/psychology/psychologists/viktor-frankl|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the same year, he was president of the {{Lang|de|Sozialistische Mittelschüler Österreich}}, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party of Austria's]] youth movement for high school students.<ref name="FranklRecollections" /> During this time Frankl began questioning the Freudian approach to [[psychoanalysis]]. He joined Alfred Adler's circle of students and had his second scientific paper, Psychotherapy and Worldview ({{Lang|de|Psychotherapie und Weltanschauung}}) published in Adler's [[The Journal of Individual Psychology#History|''International Journal of Individual Psychology'']] in 1925.<ref name="FranklRecollections" /> Frankl was expelled from Adler's circle<ref name="Klingberg2001" /> when he insisted that meaning was the central motivational force in human beings. From 1926, he began refining his theory, which he termed logotherapy.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.viktorfrankl.org/biography.html|title=Viktor Frankl Biography|website=Viktor Frankl Institute Vienna|access-date=24 April 2020|archive-date=13 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513201549/https://viktorfrankl.org/biography.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==

===Psychiatry===
Between 1928 and 1930, while still a medical student, he organized youth counselling centers<ref>{{Cite book|last=Batthyány|first=Alexander (Ed.)|title=Logotherapy and Existential Analysis. Proceedings of the Viktor Frankl Institute Vienna, Volume 1|publisher=Springer International|year=2016|isbn=978-3319805689|pages=3–6}}</ref> to address the high numbers of teen suicides occurring around the time of end of the year report cards. The program was sponsored by the city of Vienna and free of charge to the students. Frankl recruited other psychologists for the center, including [[Charlotte Bühler]], [[Erwin Wexberg]] and [[Rudolf Dreikurs]]. In 1931 not a single Viennese student died by [[suicide]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frankl, Viktor E. (Viktor Emil), 1905–1997|title=Frühe Schriften, 1923–1942|date=2005|publisher=W. Maudrich|others=Vesely-Frankl, Gabriele|isbn=3851758129|location=Wien|oclc=61029472}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2021}}

After obtaining his M.D. in 1930, Frankl gained extensive experience at [[Steinhof (Vienna)|Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital]] where he was responsible for the treatment of suicidal women. In 1937, he began a private practice, but the [[Anschluss|Nazi annexation of Austria]] in 1938 limited his ability to treat patients.<ref name="FranklRecollections" /> In 1940 he joined [[Rothschild Hospital]], the only hospital in Vienna still admitting Jews, as head of the neurology department. Prior to his deportation to the concentration camps, he helped numerous patients avoid the Nazi euthanasia program that targeted the mentally disabled.<ref name="Klingberg2001" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Neugebauer|first=Wolfgang|title=Von der Zwangssterilisierung zur Ermordung. Zur Geschichte der NS-Euthanasie in Wien Teil II|publisher=Böhlau|year=2002|isbn=978-3205993254|location=Wien/Köln/Weimar|pages=99–111}}</ref>

In 1942, just nine months after his marriage, Frankl and his family were sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. His father died there of starvation and pneumonia. In 1944, Frankl and the surviving members of his family were taken to Auschwitz, where his mother and brother were gassed. His wife died later of typhus in Bergen-Belsen. Frankl himself spent a total of three years in four different concentration camps.<ref name="obit" />

Following the war, he became head of the neurology department of the Vienna Polyclinic Hospital and established a private practice in his home. He actively worked with patients until his retirement in 1970.<ref name="Klingberg2001" />

In 1948, Frankl earned a PhD in philosophy from the University of Vienna. His dissertation, ''[[The Unconscious God]],'' examines the relation of psychology and religion.<ref>Boeree, George. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/frankl.html "Personality Theories: Viktor Frankl."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103032504/http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/frankl.html |date=3 November 2019 }} Shippensburg University. Accessed 18 April 2014.</ref> In this, Frankl advocates for the use of the [[Socratic dialogue]] (self-discovery discourse) to be used with clients, to get in touch with their spiritual unconscious.<ref>Lantz, James E. "Family logotherapy." ''Contemporary Family Therapy'' 8, no. 2 (1986): 124–35.</ref>

[[File:Grave of Viktor Frankl 02.jpg|thumb|Grave of Viktor Frankl in Vienna]]
In 1955, Frankl was awarded a professorship of neurology and psychiatry at the [[University of Vienna]], and as visiting professor, he lectured at [[Harvard University]] (1961), at [[Southern Methodist University]], Dallas (1966), and at [[Duquesne University]], Pittsburgh (1972).<ref name=":0" />

Throughout his career, Frankl argued that the [[reductionist]] tendencies of early psychotherapeutic approaches dehumanised the patient, and advocated for a rehumanisation of psychotherapy.<ref name="FranklUltimateMeaning">{{cite book|author=Frankl, Viktor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hcQAQAAMAAJ|title=Man's search for ultimate meaning|year=2000|publisher=Perseus Pub.|isbn=978-0738203546|access-date=24 May 2016|archive-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322130255/https://books.google.com/books?id=_hcQAQAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] awarded Frankl the 1985 [[Oskar Pfister Award]] for his contributions to religion and psychiatry.<ref name="FranklUltimateMeaning" />

===''Man's Search for Meaning''===
After his liberation, he was able to return to Vienna. There he became the head of the Neurological Department at the general Polyclinic Hospital.{{Clarify|reason=return from where? and when?|date=January 2021}}Then he wrote ''[[Man's Search for Meaning|Man’s Search for Meaning]]'' over a nine-day period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viktorfranklamerica.com/viktor-frankl-bio/|title=The Life of Viktor Frankl|website=Viktor Frankl Institute of America|access-date=24 April 2020|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806130308/https://viktorfranklamerica.com/viktor-frankl-bio/|url-status=live}}</ref> The book, originally titled ''A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp'', was released in German in 1946. Millions of copies were sold out in dozens of languages.

The English translation of ''Man's Search for Meaning'' was published in 1959 and became an international bestseller.<ref name="Klingberg2001" /> Frankl saw this success as a symptom of the "mass neurosis of modern times" since the title promised to deal with the question of life's meaningfulness.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frankl|first=Viktor|title=The Feeling of Meaninglessness|publisher=Marquette University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0874627589}}</ref>

In 1991, ''Man's Search for Meaning'' was listed as one of the ten most influential books in the U.S. by respondents in a survey conducted for the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Fein|first1=Esther B.|date=20 November 1991|title=New York Times, 11-20-1991|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/books/book-notes-059091.html|access-date=21 April 2020|archive-date=28 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428021311/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/books/book-notes-059091.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Logotherapy and existential analysis===
Frankl developed logotherapy and existential analysis, which are based on philosophical and psychological concepts, particularly the desire to find a meaning in life and [[free will]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.viktorfrankl.org/logotherapy.html|title=What is Logotherapy/Existential Analysis|access-date=24 April 2020|archive-date=13 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513201732/https://viktorfrankl.org/logotherapy.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Frankl identified three main ways of realizing meaning in life: by making a difference in the world, by having particular experiences, or by adopting particular attitudes.

The primary techniques offered by logotherapy and existential analysis are:<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Frankl|first=Viktor|title=The Doctor and the Soul.

His acknowledgement of meaning as a central motivational force and factor in mental health is his lasting contribution to the field of psychology. It provided the foundational principles for the emerging field of [[positive psychology]].<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294286062_Viktor_Frankl's_Meaning-Seeking_Model_and_Positive_Psychology Viktor Frankl’s Meaning-Seeking Model and Positive Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210719224356/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294286062_Viktor_Frankl%27s_Meaning-Seeking_Model_and_Positive_Psychology |date=19 July 2021 }} Chapter from book 'Meaning in Positive and Existential Psychology' (pp. 149–84)</ref>
