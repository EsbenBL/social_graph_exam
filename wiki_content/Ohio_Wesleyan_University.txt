[[File:SulfurSpringAdjusted2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.]]

In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university "of the highest order" in central Ohio.<ref>Williams, p. 15.</ref> To that end, they purchased the [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Elliott Hall|Mansion House Hotel]], a former health resort with its Sulphur Spring, using funds raised from local residents.<ref name="elliott">{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060306153516/http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf | archive-date = March 6, 2006| title = The University: Policy on Voluntary Sexual Relationships between Faculty/Staff and Students&nbsp;– Traditions (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | access-date = September 1, 2005}}</ref><ref name="order">{{cite web | url = http://news.owu.edu/2003/elliott2.html| title = Elliott Hall Dedication | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | access-date = May 15, 2003}}</ref> Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing "the [[democracy|democratic]] spirit of teaching", which was approved by the [[Ohio]] State [[Legislature]].

During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 45.</ref> [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Sturges Hall|Sturges Hall]] was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.<ref name="sturges">{{cite web|url=http://admission.owu.edu/sturges.html |title=Sturges Hall |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |access-date=March 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410121140/http://admission.owu.edu/sturges.html |archive-date=April 10, 2005 }}</ref> In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in [[History of Ohio Wesleyan University#Campus expansion|Merrick Hall]].<ref name="merrick">{{cite web | url = http://botany.owu.edu/depthist.html|title = Departmental History |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|access-date = March 4, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209110531/http://botany.owu.edu/depthist.html |archive-date = February 9, 2007}}</ref> The [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877.<ref>Taylor, p. 53.</ref><ref name="merged">{{cite web | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=787|title = Ohio Wesleyan University|publisher = Ohio Historical Society|access-date = October 19, 2006}}</ref> Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and [[music education]] greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.<ref>Hubbart, p. 68.</ref><ref>Hubbart, pp. 72–80.</ref>

[[File:OWU Athletic Grounds, Delaware Ohio 1915.jpg|250px|thumb|right|An early baseball game at Edwards Field, with Edwards Gymnasium in the background.]]
By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).<ref>Kukula, R. & K. Trubner (1923). ''Minerva: Jahrbuch der Gelehrten Welt''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company</ref> To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#University Hall|University Hall]], [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Slocum Hall|Slocum Library]], extensions to the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett campus]], and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 87–88.</ref>

Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[geology]], [[Public speaking|speech]], [[history]], [[French language|French]], [[English studies|English]], and [[economics]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 90.</ref> This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe.<ref name="nsfphdrate">{{cite web|url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf|title = Top 50 U.S. baccalaureate institutions of Ph.D.s: 1920–24 and 1995–99 (PDF)|publisher = National Science Foundation|access-date = December 24, 2006|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108210719/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf|archive-date = November 8, 2006|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Two professional schools for [[law]] and [[medicine]] were formed in 1896.

In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.<ref>Hubbart, p. 142.</ref> During the presidency of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|John W. Hoffman]] (1916–1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.<ref>Hubbart, p. 127.</ref> Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and [[sororities]] were formed. Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and [[Perkins Observatory]]; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.<ref>Hubbart, p. 141.</ref>

=== Years of change, 1930–1984 ===
[[File:StuyFront.png|250px|left|thumb|Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus. A $14 million, donor-funded renovation of the facility was completed in September 2012.]]
During [[the Great Depression]], both enrollment and [[alumni]] donations shrank.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 140–160.</ref> While the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Edmund D. Soper]] (1928–1938), Acting President [[Edward Loranus Rice]] (1938–1939), and [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Herbert John Burgstahler]] (1939–1949).<ref>Tull, p. 180.</ref>

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 160–164.</ref> Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from [[New England]] states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body;<ref>Burtchaell, pp. 174–175;</ref> formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s<ref>Burtchaell, pp. 304–319.</ref> and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>Burtchaell, p. 323.</ref> In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that "in its personnel, its resources, and its students", Ohio Wesleyan lost its "symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church."<ref>Burtchaell, p. 326.</ref>

In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.<ref name="Tull-182">Tull, p. 182.</ref> Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.<ref name="Tull-182"/> In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control.<ref>Tull, pp. 182–183.</ref> They eventually settled on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.<ref>Tull, p. 183</ref>

Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968–1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the [[ROTC]] building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.<ref>Murchland, p. 34</ref><ref>Murchland, p. 74.</ref> Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period.<ref>Murchland, p. 35</ref> Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing "[[party school]]" image,<ref>Murchland, pp. 38–39</ref> leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.<ref>Murchland, p. 39</ref> Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper ''[[The Transcript]]'' frequently criticized Wenzlau's presidency, blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college".<ref>Murchland, p. 41</ref> This exchange resulted in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.<ref name="OWUandWP">Peterson, Bill. "Enrollments Lower, Costs Higher". ''The Washington Post'', December 19, 1982, First Section, A5.</ref>

=== 1984-today ===

The president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a "live-in" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts.  Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] networks.<ref>Murchland, pp. 44–45</ref>

More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled "Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges," identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective "science-active" liberal arts institutions in the nation.<ref>[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED258532&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b801160bc Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges].

Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The Hamilton-Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship.

=== Emphasis on internationalism ===
[[File:UniversityHallFlags.jpg|right|thumb|Flags in University Hall of students' countries represented at Ohio Wesleyan University]]
Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded [[Kwassui College|Kwassui Women's College]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant.<ref>{{cite book | last = Windolf | first = Paul |author2=Francisco Ramirze | year = 1989 | title = Expansion and Structural Change: Higher Education in Germany, the United States, and Japan, 1870–1990 | publisher = Contemporary Sociology | id =Vol. 27, No. 2}}</ref> Today, Kwassui College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan.<ref name="kwassuijp">{{cite web | url = http://www.kwassui.ac.jp/ | title = Kwassui Institute|publisher = Kwassui Institute|access-date = October 15, 2006}}</ref> In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to [[Africa]] and opened a school in [[Mutare]], [[Zimbabwe]], that eventually became the [[University of Africa|Africa University]].<ref name="africauniv">{{cite web | url = http://www.africau.edu/ | title = Africa University | publisher = Africa University | access-date = October 15, 2006}}</ref> [[Ada M.

The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually.

{{Main|List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings}}
{{see also|Richard Ross Museum of Art|Ohio Wesleyan University Library|Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)}}
The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

=== Other facilities and off-campus programs ===
{{Main|Perkins Observatory|Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)}}

OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, [http://nyartsprogram.org/ The New York Arts Program] for the performing, visual, and media arts (a GLCA arts program), [[Perkins Observatory]], [[Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)|The Strand Theatre]], and the [[Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University|Kraus Wilderness Preserve]].

=== Community relations ===
{{see also|Delaware, Ohio}}

OWU has strong community ties with the City of Delaware.<ref name="towngown">{{cite web | last = Donnelly | first = Sara | url = http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/features/02/04/19/feat_bates.html | title = Can Bates and L/A excel together? | publisher = The Portland Phoenix | date = April 18–25, 2002 | access-date = November 29, 2006 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023030745/http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/features/02/04/19/feat_bates.html | archive-date = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Students participate in Delaware's community through a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs.

Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Ohio Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts.<ref name="artscastle">{{cite web | url = http://www.artscastle.org/house.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061219180855/http://www.artscastle.org/house.html | archive-date = December 19, 2006 | title = History of The Arts Castle | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University, The Arts Castle | access-date = November 25, 2006}}</ref> In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic [[Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)|Strand Theatre]] in downtown Delaware.<ref name="strandpurchase">{{cite web | url = http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/strand.html | title = Gift Support Enables OWU to Purchase Strand Theatre | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | access-date = October 15, 2006 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111190155/http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/strand.html | archive-date = January 11, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Traditions ===
{{see also|Ohio Wesleyan Sweetly and strong}}

Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate from its early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a "People's Parade" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival.<ref>Murchland, p. 79.</ref><ref>Hubbart, p. 121.</ref> It started as a girls' athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett Campus]], where female students danced around the [[Maypole]], while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.<ref>Tull, p. 102.</ref>

Approximately 90 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are [[cooperative|co-ops]] united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 10–17 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2017–2018 academic year, the SLUs consist of The [[Peace]] and [[Justice]] House, The Citizens of the World House, The Sexuality and Gender Equality House, The House of [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] Diversity (HOLD), The House of Spiritual Athletes, The [[Ecology|Tree]] House, and The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own members and do not have [[resident assistant|resident advisers]] or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who is selected by Residential Life and undergoes the same training as a resident advisor. At the end of each calendar year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis.<ref name="SLUprocess">{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/95.php | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901174509/http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/95.php| archive-date=September 1, 2006| title = SLUSH is Here: Apply to your Favorite SLU | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | access-date = January 5, 2007}}</ref> In addition the school offers Theme Houses, which do not have to go through the renewal process.
