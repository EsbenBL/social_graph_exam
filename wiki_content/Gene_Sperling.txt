Sperling left the National Economic Council in March 2014.<ref>Politico,[http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/gene-sperling-last-day-103665.html Gene Sperling: Last day is March 5], February 19, 2014.</ref>

Two years after Sperling left the White House, a ''[[ProPublica]]'' article reported that he had taken loans totaling between $300,000 and $600,000 from Howard Shapiro, a lawyer at [[Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr]], between 2011 and 2013.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Eisinger|first=Jesse|title=While in the White House, Economist Received Personal Loans From Top Washington Lawyer|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/white-house-economist-received-personal-loans-top-washington-lawyer?token=yIzUwxhFBlPUbcgl8aMwDk7gQ6AdqbgA|access-date=2020-11-30|website=ProPublica|language=en}}</ref> Shapiro has been Sperling's closest friend since they were housemates at Yale Law School in 1983.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sperling|first=Gene|title=Economic Dignity|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|year=2020|isbn=9781984879882|location=Chicago|pages=304}}</ref> Sperling stated that when his savings were depleted, he "took personal loans from my very closest friend of more than 30 years so that I could afford to remain in public service without having to sell our house when we had only two more years left with both of our children at home."<ref name=":2" /> His house in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]] was valued at "around $2 million."<ref name=":2" />

A White House spokesperson said that every loan had been "reviewed and cleared by [[White House Counsel]] and the [[United States Office of Government Ethics|Office of Government Ethics]]" and that "no issue came before Sperling that prompted him to recuse himself."<ref name=":2" /> Kenneth Gross, a partner at [[Skadden|Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom]] who specializes in federal gift and gratuity rules, stated that the fact that the loans were disclosed and cleared by the ethics office "takes the guy off the hook. What more is he supposed to do?"<ref name=":2" />

The ''ProPublica'' article stated that Sperling "played a role" in a federal and state government settlement with five major financial institutions over foreclosure and mortgage servicing abuses, and that WilmerHale was "one of many law firms involved in negotiating the settlement," though it did not state that Shapiro was involved in the settlement.<ref name=":2" /> Sperling told ProPublica he was not involved in the negotiations and only "helped decide that settlement money would go toward reducing principal on mortgages for borrowers whose homes were worth less than their mortgages.”<ref name=":2" /> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Sperling met with groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] to persuade them of the benefits the deal would have for borrowers.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Nasiripour|first=Shahien|date=February 7, 2012|title=White House courts support for mortgage pact|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3e4e49d0-51de-11e1-a30c-00144feabdc0|website=Financial Times}}</ref>
