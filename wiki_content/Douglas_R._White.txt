'''Douglas R. White''' (1942 â€“ 22 August 2021) was an American [[complexity|complexity researcher]], [[Social anthropology|social anthropologist]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[social network]] researcher at the [[List of University of California, Irvine people|University of California, Irvine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki|title=InterSciWiki|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref>

==Biography==
Douglas White was born in [[Minneapolis]] in 1942. He attended the [[University of Michigan]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Minnesota]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1964, an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1967, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1969, all under advisor E. Adamson [[Hoebel]] and the Travelling Scholars Program.<ref>[http://www.cic.uiuc.edu/programs/TravelingScholars/ CIC: Travelling Scholars Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405145357/http://www.cic.uiuc.edu/programs/TravelingScholars/ |date=April 5, 2007 }}</ref>

White taught at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1967 to 1976. Since then he has been a Social Science Professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]], teaching in Social Relations, in Comparative Culture, in Social Networks and in Anthropology. He co-founded and chaired the [[Social network|Social Networks]] PhD program and within the Institute for Mathematical [[Behavioral Sciences]] chaired the Social Dynamics and Complexity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socsci.uci.edu/socdyn/|title=Home|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> research group and the [[University of California|UC]] four-campus videoconference group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/center/cac.html|title=Human Sciences and Complexity (HSC-UC)|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref>

He was on the external faculty at the [[Santa Fe Institute]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Douglas_R._White|title=Douglas R. White|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> was on the governing Council of the European Complex Systems Society,<ref>[http://complexsystems.lri.fr/ECSS/tiki-index.php European Complex Systems Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901090924/http://complexsystems.lri.fr/ECSS/tiki-index.php |date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref> and served as President of the [http://computationalsocialscience.org/ Social Science Computing Association] and of the Linkages Development Research Council.

He founded the [[World Cultures]] electronic journal in 1985 as part of the movement for [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] scientific data and publication and founded the open access and [[peer reviewed]] [[Structure and dynamics|Structure and Dynamics]] electronic journal in 2005, where he continued as editor-in-chief.

He was a recipient of the U.S. Distinguished Scientist Award of the [[Alexander von Humboldt#The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Alexander von Humboldt]] Foundation, the "Best Paper in Mathematical Sociology of 2004" Award of the [[American Sociological Association]] (2004), and the 2007 "Viviana Zelizer Distinguished Scholarship Award" for the outstanding article published in the field of economic sociology in the previous two years.

== Work ==
Major contributions of Douglas R. White:
* White was known for [[Cross-cultural studies]], studies of the [[division of labor]], sexual division of labor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pw/SexualDivision_ofLabor.htm|title=Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: The Sexual Division of Labor Page, Causes and Entailments|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> polygyny,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pw/Polygyny.htm|title=Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: The Polygyny Page|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> marriage and [[kinship]], his collaborative creation of the [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]] (SCCS), and [http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Standard_Cross-Cultural_Sample#Download_for_Spss:_Standard_Cross-Cultural_Sample_Spss_data_file public domain distribution of SCCS data, courseware and software], which has given way to the [http://www.xsede.org/gateways-listing UCI Complex Social Science Gateway] that hosts Anthropology's [http://intersci.ss.uci.edu Ethnographics of the Lives of World Peoples] along with software used in solving [[Galton's problem]] of autocorrelation [http://SocSciCompute.ss.uci.edu for analysis of observational data],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/DEf|title=DEf|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> and for research on:
* [[Longitudinal study|Longitudinal]] historical evolution and field studies of human groups, larger societies, and city systems<ref>[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Realistic_modeling_of_complex_interactive_systems Realistic modeling of complex interactive systems]</ref>
* [[Mathematical modeling]] of social, economic, and historical dynamics, as well as statistical [[entailment]] analysis, [[Galton's problem]], the Natchez Paradox,<ref>[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pub/NatchezPeople.pdf the Natchez Paradox]</ref> [[Structural endogamy]] and network simulation, [[Weighted networks#cite note-5|regular equivalence]], flow [[centrality]], and [[structural cohesion#cite note-1|structural cohesion]],
* [[Social networks]], including, more specifically, the network realism<ref>[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/NetworkRealism.htm network realism]</ref> paradigm,
* Social complexity and [[Social-circles network model|complex-network]] system dynamics.
* [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]]
* [[System dynamics]] Studies of world system dynamics and urban studies, including his current studies of urban dynamics over the last millennium,

A reaction to his latest book, [[Network Analysis and Ethnographic Problems]], by one reviewer, was that this "could be the most important book in anthropology in fifty years." His work on implications of feedback and feedforward processes, published in [[Physical Review]] in collaboration with the founder of [[Constantino Tsallis|nonextensive physics]], a founder of [[J. Doyne Farmer|chaos theory]], and two young computer scientists, provides one of the foundational network simulations for understanding complex networks.
