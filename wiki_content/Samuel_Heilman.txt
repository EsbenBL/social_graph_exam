==Criticism==
As a scholar who writes about different sectors of the Jewish community, Heilman's statements have been a target for both praise and criticism. Together with [[Menachem Friedman]], Heilman authored "The Rebbe: The Life and Afterlife of Menachem Mendel Schneerson".
Aside from the book's selection as a recipient of the 2012 [[National Jewish Book Award]], Publishers Weekly called the book an [http://soc.qc.cuny.edu/faculty/the-rebbe/the-rebbe-reviews/ "outstanding biography"], as did the [http://soc.qc.cuny.edu/faculty/the-rebbe/the-rebbe-reviews/ Library Journal]. Allan Nadler writing in the Forward called it "lively and provocative" and pointed to its "rich" chapters".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/128494/

Despite these accolades, some of the author's conclusions, as well as their methodology and research, were later criticized by some, including [[Chaim Rapoport]], in a book titled ''The Afterlife of Scholarship - A Critical Review of 'The Rebbe''' by Samuel Heilman and Menachem Friedman. (Friedman was also criticized for not disclosing that he had served as an [[expert witness]] against the rebbe in a lawsuit involving ownership of the [[Chabad]] library, which may invite suspicion of an agenda-driven or biased opinion. Heilman responded that "we have no ax to grind".<ref>Patricia Cohen, NY Times, June 14, 2010</ref>)

Shortly after publication Orthodox Rabbi [[Shmuley Boteach]] criticized the book, writing in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' that the book's central thesis had a "fatal flaw", though he concluded that the book had "merit" and provided a "humanizing portrait."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Books/Article.aspx?id=176750

==Controversy==

In 1996, Heilman was quoted in the press as opposing the appointment of Thomas Bird as head of the Jewish Studies program at Queens College. Leon Wieseltier, literary editor for the New Republic, criticized Heilman for "behaving like a tribalist".<ref>{{cite web
