'''Graciela Chichilnisky''' (born 1944)<ref>Birth year from [http://d-nb.info/gnd/114886105 German National Library catalog data], retrieved 2019-09-22</ref> is an [[Argentine American]] [[mathematical economics|mathematical economist]].

==Background and education==
Chichilnisky was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the daughter of Russian&nbsp;Jewish immigrants.  After a [[Argentine Revolution|military coup]],  the [[Argentine military]] violently closed scientific&nbsp;faculties at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] on July 29, and she left Argentina for the United States, Supported by a fellowship from the [[Ford Foundation]],.<ref name="cv" /> Chichilnisky matriculated in the doctoral program in mathematics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] although without an undergraduate degree;<ref name="che" /> she moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1968, and completed her [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics there in 1970, under the supervision of [[Jerrold E. Marsden]]. She  earned a second Ph.D. in  economics in 1976 under the supervision of [[Gérard Debreu]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://econ.columbia.edu/files/econ/gc_cv_may_2015_final_0.pdf |title=Chichilnisky's CV |access-date=2016-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219070715/http://econ.columbia.edu/files/econ/gc_cv_may_2015_final_0.pdf |archive-date=2018-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==
After a postdoctoral position at [[Harvard University]], she accepted a position as an associate professor at Columbia University in 1977, and received tenure there in 1979, and was named UNESCO Professor of Mathematics and Economics from 1995 to 2008. She also held a chair in economics at the [[University of Essex]] from 1980 to 1981, and  has additionally been a visiting professor at other universities including at Stanford in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Graciela Chichilnisky {{!}} SIEPR |url=https://siepr.stanford.edu/events/speakers/graciela-chichilnisky |website=siepr.stanford.edu |access-date=13 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="cv" /><ref name="che" />

In 2010 Chichilnisky, together with Peter Eisenberger and [[Edgar Bronfman Jr.]] formed Global Thermostat, a company that specializes in [[Direct air capture]] from a unit that extracts [[carbon dioxide]] directly from air.

==Research==

Chichilnisky is the author of over 17 books and over 330 scientific research papers. She is best known for proposing and designing the [[carbon credit]] [[emissions trading]] market underlying the [[Kyoto Protocol]] which was international law since 2005, and was a lead author on the 2007 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] that won the 2007 Nobel Prize.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Siegle |first1=Lucy |title=Graciela Chichilnisky's innovation: carbon capturing |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/14/graciela-chichilnisky-carbon-capture-global-thermostat |access-date=13 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=14 November 2010 |language=en}}</ref>

In the theory of [[international trade]], she constructed an example of a "transfer paradox", where a transfer of goods from a donor to a recipient can render the recipient worse off and the donor better off. She constructed examples where [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]] strategies for developing countries could result in paradoxically poor results, because of [[increasing returns to scale]] in the technologies of the developed countries.

In [[welfare economics]] and [[voting theory]], particularly in the specialty of [[social choice]] theory, Chichilnisky introduced a continuous model of collective decisions to which she applied [[algebraic topology]]; following her initiatives, continuous social choice has developed as an international subdiscipline. During the 1980s and 1990s some of Chichilnisky's research was done in collaboration with mathematical economist Geoffrey M. Heal, who has been her colleague at Essex and Columbia.

==Litigation==
In 1994 Chichilnisky sued two other economics professors, accusing them of stealing her ideas. Chichilnisky was countersued and dropped her lawsuit. The subject matter of the controversy was described in contemporaneous news reports as "distinctly small-time stuff, at least according to most experts."<ref>{{citation|title=A bitter battle illuminates an esoteric world|journal=[[Boston Globe]]|date=May 5, 1996|first=David|last=Warsh}}.
