==Education==
Wedderburn was born in [[Walthamstow]] and educated at [[Walthamstow School for Girls|Walthamstow County High School for Girls]] in north-east London and [[Girton College, Cambridge]], where she read economics.<ref name = "WW"/> She joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] in the 1940s, but ended her membership of the party in the late 1950s, though remaining on the left of the labour movement.<ref name = "Inde">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-dorothy-wedderburn-eminent-social-scientist-8198455.html "Professor Dorothy Wedderburn: Eminent social scientist", Peta Steel, ''The Independent'', 5 October 2012 Accessed 5 November 2014]</ref>

==Career==
===Cambridge and Imperial===
She was a research officer at the [[Board of Trade]] from 1946–66, did research in applied economics at Cambridge and then worked as a lecturer, and subsequently reader and professor, in [[industrial sociology]] at the [[Imperial College of Science and Technology]] in London, then part of the University of London, from 1965–1981. At Imperial she was head of the Department of Social and Economic Studies from 1978–81.<ref name="guardian1"/>

===Bedford and Royal Holloway merger===
In 1981 she became Principal of Bedford College. The 1982 partnership agreement between Bedford and Royal Holloway was signed as a result of severe cuts in government spending on higher education. Discussions had taken place between Wedderburn and Holloway's then principal, [[Lionel Harry Butler|Dr Lionel Butler]]. Before anything was finalised, Butler died suddenly on 26 November 1981.<ref name="Bingham"/> Following this, final discussions took place between Wedderburn and [[Roy Miller (academic)|Dr Roy Miller]], Holloway's new principal. These included Bedford leaving its site in Regent's Park, London and moving to the Holloway site.<ref name="Bingham"/> The merger finally took place in 1985 and the newly merged Royal Holloway and Bedford New College was inaugurated in 1986 by [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty The Queen]] at a ceremony at Royal Holloway's chapel.<ref name="Bingham">{{Cite book|author=Bingham, Caroline|title=The history of the Royal Holloway College 1886–1986|year=1987|publisher=Constable|location=London, UK|isbn=0-09-468200-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofroyalho0000bing/page/226 226 et seq]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofroyalho0000bing/page/226}}</ref> Wedderburn was appointed as first principal of the merged college and served from 1985–1990, and was also the last principal of Bedford.

The official title (Royal Holloway and Bedford New College) is still retained, but for everyday use the college is now referred to as [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] or simply Royal Holloway, London. On leaving Royal Holloway she declined the   [[Order of the British Empire|damehood]] normally offered to former female principals. There is no explanation given in any of the published obituaries.<ref name="guardian1"/>

===Sale of Royal Holloway's paintings===
The late 1980s were difficult times financially for universities including the new college. She closed the Chemistry Department, for which the extensive Bourne building had been constructed in the late 1960s, as chemistry had become too expensive a subject. She reduced staff across all departments and, more controversially, agreed to the sale of the three most valuable paintings in RHC's collection.<ref name = "Inde"/>

Between 1993 and 1995, a [[J M W Turner|Turner]] ''("Van Tromp going about to please his Masters, Ships at Sea, getting a good wetting" c. 1844)'', [[John Constable|Constable]] ''("A Sketch for View on the Stour, nr Dedham" c.1821/2)'' and [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] ''("Peasants going to Market: Early Morning"  c. 1770)'' were sold for a total of £21m.<ref name="RHC 20 Sep 2012"/><ref name="VicTaste">{{Cite book|author=Chapel, Jennie|title=Victorian Taste – The complete catalogue of paintings at the Royal Holloway College|year=1982|publisher=A Zwemmer Ltd|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-90219-408-9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.leicestergalleries.com/19th-20th-century-paintings/d/sketch-for-view-on-the-stour-near-dedham/19695 Leicester Galleries archive; accessed 2 September 2013]</ref><ref>[http://www.leicestergalleries.com/19th-20th-century-paintings/d/peasants-going-to-market%3A-early-morning/19676 Leicester Galleries archive]; accessed 2 September 2013.</ref><ref name="JPGetty">[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=1049 J Paul Getty Museum website], getty.edu; accessed 2 September 2013.</ref> Holloway's remaining paintings were worth about £17m, but probably now substantially more.

===Other posts===
Wedderburn was a [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]] of the University of London from 1986–88. From 1981–2003 she was also a senior research fellow at Imperial College.

==Personal life==
She was married twice: to the economic historian A N "Max" Cole from whom she was divorced in 1960. From 1962 to 1968, she was married to [[Bill Wedderburn, Baron Wedderburn of Charlton]], which union also ended in divorce. Both marriages were childless.<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news|author=Eric Hobsbawm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/21/dorothy-wedderburn|title=Dorothy Wedderburn obituary|work=The Guardian|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012|location=London, UK}}</ref>
