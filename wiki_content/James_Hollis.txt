}}</ref> but advises the reader "[not to] interpret ''What Matters Most'' as self-help cheesiness. This blunt and refreshing work by a follower of Jung is a radical and humbling way of thinking about psychology."<ref name="Guardian Burkeman"/> Burkeman points to "the one-star Amazon reviews of his books [which] are full of people furious at his refusal to offer cheery reassurance or a one-size-fits-all recipe for happiness,"<ref name="Guardian Burkeman"/> and he agrees that "[a]s a teenager or young adult, I suspect I'd have been equally annoyed. But I discovered Hollis at the right time, a few years back, and his writing was a bracing draught of reality, a rousing slap in the face, a wake-up call – pick your metaphor, but ''What Matters Most'' was what I needed."<ref name="Guardian Burkeman"/>

===''Living Between Worlds''===
Steven Gaydos, interviewing Hollis for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine writes: "''Living Between Worlds'' ... is a terrific place to start digging into Hollis' sage counseling, packed as it is with his trademark bracing, no-punches-pulled observations about what he sees as the increasingly perilous state of modern life."<ref name="Variety magazine"/> The reviewer continues: "Hollis travels the Jungian path in his fundamental belief that modernity may have infinite comforts and distractions, but nothing can or will replace the certainty about our place in the world that disappeared in the 19th century."<ref name="Variety magazine"/>

Gaydos quotes the author, who writes in ''Living Between Worlds'': "our culture's treatment plans for the absence of a personal, intimate relationship with the gods are materialism, hedonism, narcissism and nationalism, as well as a coursing nostalgia for a world that never really existed. Our contemporary Odysseys are redirected to the Apple Store, the palliative pharmacy, or forays along the River Amazon Prime. Guided by Google, whereby all things are knowable, we wonder why we are so absent-spirited, so lost, and so adrift. We may say that these secular surrogates, these 'isms,' constitute our values, our de facto religions, those in which we most invest our energies. But we have to ask the obvious question, 'How well are they working for us?'"<ref name="Living Between Worlds quote 1">{{cite book
