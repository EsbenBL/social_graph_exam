== Early life ==
Furnham was born on 3 February 1953 of British parents. He grew up in his birthplace [[Port Shepstone]], [[Union of South Africa]], where he was exposed to many people of different national origins. He was the only child of his parents. His father was a newspaper printer and publisher, while his mother was a nurse.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian"/>

Growing up, Furnham came to discover traits of his that were not shared by his parents. He found himself to be ambitious, striving for academic and financial success at a young age. On the other hand, his parents had no such ambitions for themselves. He was opened to new and exotic experience, unlike his parents, who were not eager with exploring things outside of the [[Anglo-Saxon culture]]. His parents were satisfied with a shallow understanding of things, while Furnham would crave for a deep level of understanding.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian"/>

==Education==
Adrian completed in total one undergraduate degree, three master's degrees and three doctorates. In 1970, at the age of sixteen, he began his university education at the University of Natal ([[Pietermaritzburg]] campus), completing a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972, and an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973. His academic studies focused on history, psychology, and theology. He then went on to complete a Master of Arts in 1974, composing his thesis on "Cross-cultural conformity and field dependence". In 1975 he proceeded to complete an economics master's degree at the University of London, focusing his research, essays, and examinations on his thesis: "The relative contribution of verbal, vocal, and visual cues to person perception". Furthering his education, he completed a Master of Science at the University of Strathclyde, completing research on "Sex and class factors in the perception of social episodes". From there, in 1981 Furnham completed a doctorate at Oxford and later received a D.Sc. from London in 1991 and a D.Litt. from Natal in 1997.<ref>Permission for writing Wikipedia Page .

== Educators ==
Throughout his education, Furnham had many great educators who had a positive influence on his life, but two of them particularly notable.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

The first is [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] (11 August 1925 – 6 September 2002), who was Furnham's PhD supervisor. Argyle wrote approximately 250 papers on a number of different topics including body language, religion, money, happiness, and work. At one point, he was the fourth most cited British Psychologist. According to Furnham, there are many things that are unique about Argyle. One thing that stood out to Furnham in particular is that Argyle advised his Doctorate students not too read too much about an idea initially as it would limit their creativity and thinking. A significant impact that he had on Furnham's career is that he taught him not to be afraid to explore new areas of research, and not limit himself to already existing fields. Furnham also learned from Argyle the characteristics of a good doctoral supervisor, to be cooperative with colleagues, and to work hard and play hard.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

The second is [[Hans Eysenck]] ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈaɪzɛŋk/]]; 4 March 1916 – 4 September 1997), who was Furnham's role model. Eysenck was the living psychologist most frequently cited in the [[peer-review]]ed [[scientific journal]] literature in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(00)00235-x|title=A scientometric appreciation of H. J. Eysenck's contributions to psychology|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=31|pages=17–39|year=2001|last1=Rushton|first1=J.Philippe}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/e413802005-787|title=The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the Twentieth Century|journal=APA PsycNet|year=2001|last1=Haggbloom|first1=Steven J.}}</ref> Furnham met Eysenck while doing his PhD. He was one of the first theorists to advocate a biologically based theory of personality. Furnham became an Eysenckian after reading his books and papers, and started using his [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] tests during his PhD. In 2008, Furnham wrote a paper suggesting five reasons why Eysenck's tests have remained popular for a long time. He suggested that these reasons are: parsimony, explanation of process, experimentation, wide application, and continuous improvement and development.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

== Career ==

Adrian Furnham is currently a professor of psychology at University College London. Before his current placement, he had previously lectured at numerous institutes, including: Pembroke College, Oxford, University of New South Wales, and the University of West Indies. More so, he also taught management at both the Hong Kong University Business school as well as the Henley Management College. In 2009, he was assigned a position of adjunct professor of management at the Norwegian School of Management.<ref name=":4" />

He is also currently the elected president of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences, as well as the founder and director of Applied Behavioural Research Associates (ABRA); which is a consultancy in psychology. Furnham's work was used at universities and other associations.

== Research ==

=== His contributions ===
Furnham reports being uncertain as to what type of psychologist he is as he is interested in a multiple topics. He has been labelled an applied, differential, economic, health, occupational, and social psychologist at different times. However, he is a [[British Psychological Society]] chartered occupational and a chartered health psychologist. He believes that his personality and upbringing has resulted in his curiosity about a variety of issues within and outside the discipline, hence the diversity in his interdisciplinary work.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

=== Themes ===

==== Psychometric housekeeping and reviews ====
Furnham has an interest in documenting different scales that measure the same thing and comparing their quantities. He has done this through reviewing old and new personality tests. These are critical reviews which are comprehensive, extensively quoted, and are updated occasionally. Some examples of his extensive reviews are Tolerance of Ambiguity (co-authored by Ribchester and Marks), Belief in a Just World, and the Protestant Work Ethic.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

==== Test development ====
Furnham has developed several tests throughout his career. He adapted already existing ideas to make specific tests like the Economic Locus of Control measure in 1986, and the Organisational Attributional Style Questionnaire in 1992. He developed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, which is a self-report inventory that measures the sampling domain of trait emotional intelligence, along with his PhD student Dino Petrides in 2006.<ref>Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). (n.d.). Retrieved from <nowiki>http://www.eiconsortium.org/measures/teique.html</nowiki>.</ref> He also developed the High Flyer Trait Inventory (formerly High Flying Personality Inventory), with his colleague Ian Macrae in 2014.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" /> The High Flyer Trait Inventory is a measure of personality traits directly related to workplace behaviours, thoughts, and perceptions of oneself and others.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2018.02.025|title=High potential personality and intelligence|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=128|pages=81–87|year=2018|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Treglown|first2=Luke}}</ref>

==== The relationship between tests of preference and power ====
To this day Furnham had been interested in the distant relationship between the two pillars differential psychology. Furnham had given his opinion on this topic to the International Society for the Study of Individual differences. He currently works on this topic with the help of his PhD students.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

==== Self-appraisal and awareness ====
Beginning early on Furnham took a great interest in self-awareness and self-estimating intelligence, in which he published many studies on. The findings of his studies revealed that males tend to estimate their general intelligence 5-15 IQ points higher than females do, these sex differences occur across the generations and that sex differences are cross-culturally consistent.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" />

==== Dark side ====
Furnham was introduced to the dark side personality by Robert Hogan. Dark side personalities are those that portray dysfunctional behaviours and beliefs towards others. For instance, Psychopaths would fall under this category.<ref name="Furnham, Adrian" /> These types of people do not consider how their actions affect their reputation, and, although this may seem like deviant behaviour, it also seems to help them people climb up the corporate ladder.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjop.12260|title=A Big Five facet analysis of a psychopath: The validity of the HDS mischievous scale of sub-clinical psychopathy|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Psychology|volume=57|issue=2|pages=117–121|year=2016|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Crump|first2=John|pmid=26812058}}</ref> Dark side personality research was based on the DSM-III. Using the Hogan Development Survey in various studies, Furnham was able to collect sufficient amounts of data, which later on aided in studying misbehaviour at work. According to the HDS, mischievous people were considered to be extraverts, disagreeable, deliberate, and stable. They scored high on the excitement scale and low on the consciousness scale.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1057/9780230281226_6|chapter=The Machiavellian Leader|title=The Elephant in the Boardroom|url=https://archive.org/details/elephantboardroo00furn|url-access=limited|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elephantboardroo00furn/page/n150 140]–151|year=2010|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|isbn=978-1-349-31092-0}}</ref> Furnham has written multiple papers as well as two books on this topic.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0971685816673490|title=Book Review: Adrian Furnham, 2015, Backstabbers and Bullies: How to Cope with the Dark Side of People at Work|journal=Journal of Human Values|volume=23|pages=66–68|year=2017|last1=Jena|first1=Lalatendu Kesari|last2=Patra|first2=Banita|s2cid=152120616}}</ref>
