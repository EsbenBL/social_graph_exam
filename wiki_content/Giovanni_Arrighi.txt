'''Giovanni Arrighi''' (7 July 1937 – 18 June 2009) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[economist]], [[sociologist]] and [[World-systems theory|world-systems analyst]], from 1998 a [[Professor]] of Sociology at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. His work has been translated into over fifteen languages.

==Biography==
Arrighi was born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1937. He received his [[Laurea]] in [[economics]] from the [[Bocconi University]] in 1960.  Arrighi began his career teaching at the [[University of Zimbabwe|University College of Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and later at the [[University of Dar es Salaam|University College of Dar es Salaam]] in [[Tanzania]], where he developed arguments about how the [[labor supply]] and labor resistance affected the development of [[colonialism]] and [[national liberation movements]], and where he met [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] with whom he late collaborated on a number of research projects. After returning to Italy in 1969, Arrighi and others formed the "Gruppo Gramsci" in 1971. In 1979 Arrighi joined Wallerstein and [[Terence Hopkins]] as a professor of sociology at the [[Fernand Braudel Center]] for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations at [[Binghamton University]]. It was during this time that the Fernand Braudel Center became known as the main center of [[World-systems theory|world-systems analysis]], attracting scholars from all over the world.{{cn|date=August 2021}}

His trilogy on the origins and transformations of [[capitalism#Modernity|global capitalism]] began in 1994 with a book that reinterpreted the evolution of capitalism, ''[[The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times]]''. The book was published in at least ten languages. Giovanni completed a second edition of ''The Long Twentieth Century'' in 2009. In 1999, he published ''Chaos and Governance in the Modern World System'' with [[Beverly Silver]], and in 2007, he published ''Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the Twenty-First Century'', comparing Western and East Asian economic development and exploring [[China]]’s rise as an economic [[world power]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Although in many ways intellectually close to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], Arrighi tends to ascribe greater significance to the recent shift in economic power to [[East Asia]]. He also emphasized his debt to [[Adam Smith]], [[Max Weber]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Arrighi died in his home in Baltimore on June 18, 2009. He had been diagnosed with [[cancer]] in July 2008. His widow and collaborator is Professor [[Beverly J. Silver|Beverly Silver]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

A retrospective interview by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] on his intellectual trajectory, [http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=2771 The Winding Paths of Capital], was published in the March/April 2009 issue of [[New Left Review]].
