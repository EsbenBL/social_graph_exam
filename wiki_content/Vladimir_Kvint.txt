==Early life==
Vladimir Kvint was born in [[Krasnoyarsk]], Siberia into a family of engineers. He studied in Railroad elementary and junior high school. Then he moved to [[Norilsk]], the northernmost city in the world, located 1,000 miles above the [[Arctic Circle]]. He began his 14-year career in the non-ferrous metals industry at the age of 14 as a construction and metal worker. Most of Kvint's education was completed in parallel with his professional and athletic activities (boxing). By the age of 27 Kvint had established himself as the chief economist and vice chairman of a major Russian high-tech company in addition to successfully earning his Ph.D. in economics at age 26 and being educated in the fields of mining-electrical engineering and law.<ref>[http://libris.kb.se/bib/11716406;jsessionid=B3500C3C9417C0A9D460BF6457AA5B7C Libris] Russian</ref>

==Early career in industry==
===Norilsk Mining - metallurgical concern - MMC Norilsk Nickel===

Despite an invitation to work as an associate professor in Moscow, Kvint returned to Norilsk. Between 1975 and 1978, he continued his work in the mining-metallurgical industry. He founded and was Chief of the Department of Organization Management at the Norilsk Mining –Metallurgical Concern, later renamed [[MMC Norilsk Nickel]], which was the largest Russian enterprise (150,000 employees) and still the largest producer worldwide of nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and osmium. Under his leadership, the company's first general organizational structure, focusing on the strategic improvement of final products was developed. The theoretical results of his work were published in Moscow in 1976, in ''The Acceleration of the Industrial-Technical Development''. This book received the U.S.S.R. Annual Award "Best Popular Scholarly Book of the Year".

===Sib Tsvemet Automatica===

In 1976, Kvint was promoted to the position of deputy director general and deputy chairman of "SibTsvemetAutomatica", a scientific-technological company, which automated the [[non-ferrous]] metals industry throughout the former U.S.S.R.[4]. He was responsible for economic policy, business planning, the organization of compensation systems, and accounting departments in this company of 5,000 employees. Under Kvint's [[Economics|economic strategy]], this company became one of the first self-sufficient firms in the U.S.S.R. despite the Soviet command planning system. In addition, he was Chief of the Forecasting Economics Laboratory of the Non-ferrous Metals and Gold Industry, and prepared strategies and forecasts for the non-ferrous and [[precious metal]]s and diamond industries.

==Later career in education and lecturing==
===Arctic Seaway Economic Expedition===

In 1978, he was invited to join the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]], and was elected as the Chief of the Department of Regional Problems of Scientific-Technological Progress at the Institute of Economy and Industrial Organization of the Siberian Branch of the USSR [[Academy of Sciences]]. The Siberian School of Economics was at that time under the leadership of the world-renowned economists [[Abel Aganbegyan]] and Nobel Laureate in Economics [[Leonid Kantorovich]].<ref>[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/books/cross/russia_2006.pdf The Russian Academy of Sciences, 2006 update]</ref>

In the Academy, Kvint found a lack of accurate empirical statistics and economic information. As a result, many economic studies based on this incorrect information had no practical use. With Kvint's business experience, he recognized this problem and developed the methods of studying economic situations, natural resources, and strategic business opportunities through the organization of complex economic expeditions.

In 1979 the chairman of the Siberian branch of the Academy appointed him to head these expeditions. Several of these major expeditions were unprecedented. For example, in 1980 the [[academician]]s ventured across the entire eight seas of the Arctic Seaway by ship, helicopter and SUV. Another economic expedition traveled through three seas along the entire [[Pacific Coast]] of Russia to evaluate the area's natural resources and [[productive forces]].<ref>[Capitalizing on the New Russia, Arcade Publishing: New York, 1993 p.&nbsp;29-33]</ref>

===Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow)===

In 1982, Kvint was elected as a senior researcher and then as the Head of Department and later a leading scholar at the Institute of Economics of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]](Moscow). During these nine years he discovered and developed the concept of two new global trends: Regionalization and Technologization. He defined the category of regional scientific-technological policy and the role of this policy in the reduction of poverty and ecological protection. In the late 1980s he came up with the theory of regional and global [[emerging markets]].

In 1986, he wrote the report on the organization of strategic development of scientific-technological process which he brought to the attention of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]], explaining that without the activation of these factors, as well as the function of motivation, the Soviet Union would have no economic future. After this predication, Kvint again faced a great deal of pressure from the Soviet [[Hierarchy|power structure]].<ref>[March 7, 1990 ''Komsomolskaya Pravda'' (Moscow)]</ref>

In 1985, Kvint prepared his second [[Thesis|Doctoral dissertation]] on the "Regional Management of the Scientific-Technological Development of the National Economy". Among the consequences of Kvint's recommendations would have been the decentralization of the Soviet [[Planned economy|command economy]]. As a result, he was not allowed to present his dissertation to the Scientific Council until February 1988, when he finally received the highest European scientific degree- [[Habilitation]]-"Doctor of Sciences in Economics".<ref>[http://www.russika.ru/poisk.asp Russika.Ru]</ref> In 1989, he received the lifetime title of "Professor of Political Economy" - the highest state academic title in the former Soviet Bloc. Many years later, in 2011 by decree of the President of the Russian Federation he was awarded with the title of Honored professor of Higher Education of the Russian Federation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1556662 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208134809/http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1556662 |archive-date=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The fundamental ideas of Kvint's theories were explored in his dissertations and books. Since 1989, he has continued his studies in [[Austria]], and then in the United States. However, the development of his theory of the global emerging market has its roots in all of his years of scholarly activity. For these studies, Kvint would later receive international recognition<ref>[Kvint, Vladimir, The Global Emerging Market in Transition. [[Fordham University Press]], 2006.</ref><ref>Kvint Vladimir, ''The Global Emerging Market: Strategic Management and Economics''. [[Routledge]], New York, London, 2009].</ref> Developing his earlier strategic studies he contributed to theory of strategy and came up with his own theory of holistic strategy.<ref>[Kvint Vladimir,  Strategy for the Global Market. [[Routledge]], New York, London, 2016].</ref>

===European professorship and international lecturing===

In 1988 and 1989, Kvint was finally allowed to travel outside of the Soviet Union, upon which he gave speeches and lectures on the results of his studies. He was invited to many universities and prestigious academic centers in Austria, Switzerland, Italy, [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], China, the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Among his many lectures was his speech in front of the Presidium of the [[Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1989-1990, he worked as a visiting professor at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration]]. During his academic career he was invited to give lectures in Universities of many European nations including Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, England, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Scotland, Turkey and Ukraine. In 2009 Kvint gave a lecture at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]],<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/london-school-economics-public/id279428154 London School of Economics: public lectures and events] itunes.apple.com</ref> in 2010 in the [[Scottish Parliament]],<ref>Bradley, Jane, January 31, 2010, [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article7009585.ece Kvint: Scot was architect of my career] ''The Sunday Times''</ref> in 2011 at [[Imperial College London]], and since 2009 every year in [[The University of Edinburgh]].

Since 1990, Kvint has lived and worked in the United States where he has been granted citizenship. In 1990, he gave lectures and consultations in several [[think tank]]s and leading corporations of the United States including the [[RAND|RAND Corporation]], [[Kissinger Associates]], [[General Electric]], [[General Motors]], Transamerica, Timex, and the [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Corporation]], among others.

==Topics of research and forecasts==
35 years of Kvint's research and scholarly activity have been dedicated to the creation of theories on new regional economic development and strategy and emerging market countries. Among Kvint's achievements are:

*Theory of Regionalization of Scientific-Technological Progress
*Evaluation of the Role of the Scientific-Technical Strategy in the Regional Economy
*Theory of the Global Emerging Market
*Theory of Strategy and its implementation in the Global Emerging Market
*Theory of Holistic Strategy

While his strategic analysis and forecasts of events are not infrequently outspoken, controversial, and at times even criticized as outlandish or impossible [Forbes Global, January 24, 2000 p.&nbsp;24], in hindsight, they have been remarkably accurate and insightful. Indeed, it becomes evident that his forecasts are soundly grounded in detailed analysis of fact.

One of his most accurate forecasts was published in 1989, proclaiming that “by 1992 there will be no country called the Soviet Union”. In fact, the Soviet Union disappeared in December 1991. Kvint's cover story in the February 1990 issue of ''Forbes'' magazine was called “Russia Should Quit the Soviet Union”, and received worldwide attention.

Among his other forecasts are:

*accurate prediction of [[exchange rate]] between East and West Deutsche Mark during unification of Germany [Basler Zeitung (Basel, Switzerland), March 20, 1990, p.&nbsp;1 (in German) and Der Neue Tag (Bavaria Germany) November 28, 1989, p.&nbsp;1]
*prediction of an early resignation of President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and his replacement by a successor in uniform [http://vkvint.com/documents/the_last_days_of_boris_yeltsin.pdf]

==Published works==
Kvint is the author of 35 books and over 450 articles. Many of his articles have been published and translated around the world, including in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[Institutional Investor (magazine)|Institutional Investor]]'', ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'', ''[[International Executive]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' (London), ''[[Die Presse]]'' (Austria), ''[[The New Times (Russia)|The New Times]]'' (Moscow), and others.
