}}</ref> Wolf recalls that his background left him wary of political extremes and encouraged his interest in economics, as he felt economic policy mistakes were one of the [[Causes of World War II|root causes of World War II]].<ref name = "CalloftheWolf"/>  He was an active supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] until the early 1970s.<ref name = "wolfBio"/>

==Education==
Wolf was educated at [[University College School]], a day [[independent school]] for boys in [[Hampstead]] in north west London, and in 1967 entered [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] at [[Oxford University]] for his undergraduate studies. He initially studied [[Classics]] before starting the [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] Course.<ref>{{Cite book

As a graduate student Wolf moved on to [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]], also at Oxford, which he left with a master of philosophy degree in economics in 1971. Wolf has said that he never pursued a PhD, because he "didn't want to become an academic".<ref name = "wolfBio"/>

==Career==
In 1971, Wolf joined the [[World Bank]]'s young professionals programme, becoming a senior economist in 1974. By the start of the eighties, Wolf was deeply disillusioned with the Bank's policies undertaken under the direction of [[Robert McNamara]]: the Bank had been strongly pushing for increased capital flows to developing countries, which had resulted in many of them suffering debt crises by the early 1980s. Seeing the results of misjudged intervention by global authorities and also influenced from the early 1970s by various works critical of government intervention, such as [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Wolf shifted his views towards the right and the free market.<ref name = "CalloftheWolf"/><ref name = "wolfBio"/>

Wolf left the World Bank in 1981, to become Director of Studies at the ''Trade Policy Research Centre'', in London. He joined the ''Financial Times'' in 1987, where he has been associate editor since 1990 and chief economics commentator since 1996. Up until the late 2000s, Wolf was an influential advocate of [[globalisation]] and the [[free market]].

In addition to his journalism and participation in various international forums, Wolf had also attempted to influence opinion with his books; he has stated that his 2004 book, ''Why Globalization Works'', was intended to be a persuasive work rather than an academic study. By 2008, Wolf had become disillusioned with theories promoting what he came to see excessive reliance on the [[private sector]]. While remaining a pragmatist free of binding commitments to any one ideology, Wolf's views partially shifted away from free market thinking back to the Keynesian ideas he had been taught when young.<ref name = "CalloftheWolf"/><ref name = "wolfBio"/>

He became one of the more influential drivers of the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]], and in late 2008 and early 2009, he used his platform on the ''Financial Times'' to advocate a massive fiscal and monetary response to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. According to [[Julia Ioffe]] writing in 2009 for ''[[The New Republic]]'', he was "arguably the most widely trusted pundit" of the crisis.<ref name = "CalloftheWolf"/> Wolf is a supporter of a [[land value tax]].<ref>{{cite web
