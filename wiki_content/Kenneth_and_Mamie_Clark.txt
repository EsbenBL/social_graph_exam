==Mamie Phipps Clark==
{{main|Mamie Phipps Clark}}

===Early life===
The oldest of three children, two girls and one boy, Mamie Phipps was born in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], to Harold and Katie Phipps. Her father was a [[physician|doctor]], a native of the [[British West Indies]]. Her father also supplemented his income as a manager at a nearby vacation resort. Her mother helped him in his practice and encouraged both their children in education. Her brother became a [[dentist]].<ref name=Arkansas_Encyclopaedia/><ref name=Guthrie_1990>Guthrie, R., "Mamie Phipps Clark", ''Women in psychology'', O'Connell, A. and Russo, N., Eds. (1990), [[Westport, Connecticut]]: [[Greenwood Press]].</ref> Even though Mamie grew up during the Depression and a time of racism and segregation, she had a privileged childhood.<ref name= Karera_2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/mamie-phipps-clark/ |title=Mamie Phipps Clark - Psychology's Feminist Voices |website=Feministvoices.com |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref> Her father's occupation and income allowed them to live a middle-class lifestyle and even got them into some white-only parts of town. However, Mamie still attended segregated elementary and secondary schools, graduating from Pine Bluff's Langston High School in 1934 at only 16 years old.<ref name=Koesterer>[http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/mamiephippsclark.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113225007/http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/mamiephippsclark.htm |date=November 13, 2012 }}</ref> Being able to do things that white people could do, but still having to go to a segregated school allowed her to see how society treated white and black people differently. This realization contributed to her future research of racial identity in Black children.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=Robert|title=Even the Rat was White: A Historical View of Psychology|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Pearson|edition=2}}</ref> Despite the small amount of opportunities for black students to pursue higher education, Mamie was offered several scholarships for college. Fisk University in Tennessee and Howard University in Washington D.C. were two of the universities to offer Mamie a scholarship and were also two of the most prestigious black universities at that time.<ref name= Karera_2010 />

Sumner also  allowed her to work part-time in the psychology department where she expanded her knowledge about psychology.<ref name="O'Connell">{{cite book|last=O'Connell|first=Agnes|title=Women in Psychology|date=January 1, 1990|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}</ref> During her senior year in 1937 Kenneth and Mamie got married; they had to elope because her mother did not want her to get married before she graduated.<ref name="Butler">{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Stephen|title=Mamie Katherine Phipps Clark (1917–1983)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2938|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture|access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref> A year later, she earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in [[psychology]] (1938).<ref name=Arkansas_Encyclopaedia/><ref name=Guthrie_1990/><ref name=Columbia_on_Clarks>[http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/kenneth_mamie_clark.html "Kenneth B. Clark and Mamie Phipps Clark"], Columbia University.</ref> Both Kenneth and Mamie went on for additional study at [[Columbia University]]. They later had two children together, Katie Miriam and Hilton Bancroft.

In the fall of 1938 Mamie Clark went to graduate school at Howard University to get a master's degree in psychology. The summer following her undergraduate graduation Mamie worked for Charles Houston as a secretary at his law office. At the time, Houston was a popular civil rights lawyer and Mamie was privileged to see lawyers such as Thurgood Marshall come into the office to work on important cases.<ref name= The_Central_Arkansas_Library_System>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2938 |title=Mamie Katherine Phipps Clark (1917–1983) |publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref> She admits that she did not think anything could be done about segregation and racial oppression until after this experience. Believing in a tangible end to segregation inspired Mamie's future studies whose results went on to aid lawyers, such as Houston and Marshall, win the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court Case in 1954.<ref name= Karera_2010 />

[[File:Mr. & Mrs. Kenneth Clark and children. 1958 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Kenneth and Mamie Clark with their children, 1958]]
While working on her master's degree, Mamie became increasingly interested in developmental psychology. The inspiration for her thesis came from working at an all Black nursery school. Mamie contacted psychologists Ruth and Gene Horowitz for advice. At the time they were conducting psychological studies about self-identification in young children and suggested that she conduct similar research with her nursery school children.<ref name= The_Central_Arkansas_Library_System /> Her master's thesis was entitled "The Development of Consciousness of Self in Negro Pre-School Children."<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Elizabeth D.|date=2020-06-30|title="Racial and Religious Democracy": Identity and Equality in Midcentury Courts|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3441367|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}</ref> Her husband Kenneth was fascinated by her thesis research and after her graduation they worked together on the research. They developed new and improved versions of the color and doll tests used in her thesis for a proposal to further the research. In 1939 they received a three-year Rosenwald Fellowship for their research that allowed them to publish three articles on the subject and also permitted Mamie to pursue a doctoral degree at Columbia University.<ref name= Koesterer />

During her time at Columbia, Mamie was the only black student pursuing a doctorate in psychology and she had a faculty adviser, Dr. Henry Garrett, who believed in segregation. Despite their differences in beliefs, Mamie was able to complete her dissertation, "Changes in Primary Mental Abilities with Age."<ref name= The_Central_Arkansas_Library_System /> In 1943 Mamie Phipps Clark was the first [[African-American]] women to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in psychology from [[Columbia University]]. She was the second Black person to receive a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University, following her husband Kenneth.<ref name= Karera_2010 />

=== Career ===
After Mamie graduated she had a hard time being a psychologist as an African American woman living in New York. She found it difficult to get a job; she lost some opportunities to less qualified white men and white women. In the summer of 1939, Mamie took one of her first jobs as a secretary in the legal office of African American lawyer [[Charles Hamilton Houston]].<ref name=":3" /> This law firm involved the planning of legal action that would challenge the segregation laws.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Koesterer|first1=Marie|title=Dr. Mamie Phipps Clark: Segregation & Self-esteem|url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/mamiephippsclark.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031213045729/http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/mamiephippsclark.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2003-12-13|website=Webster.edu|access-date=2015-02-19}}</ref> In 1944 she found a job through a family friend at the American Public Health Association analyzing research about nurses, which she hated.<ref name="Butler"/>  She stayed at that job for one year but was grossly overqualified for the position and found it embarrassing. She then obtained a position at the United States Armed Forces Institute as a research psychologist but she still felt pigeonholed. In 1945 she was able to get a better job working for the United States Armed Forces Institute as a research psychologist; but, as World War II ended they did not feel the need to employ her anymore and she was fired in 1946. Later that year, Mamie got a job that she finally thought was rewarding, at the Riverdale Home for Children in New York; there she conducted psychological test and counseled young homeless black people.<ref name="O'Connell"/> While here she saw how insufficient psychological services were for minority children. Many of the children were called mentally retarded by the state and Clark tested them and realized that they had IQ's that were above mental retardation.<ref name="Butler"/> She saw society's segregation as the cause for gang warfare, poverty, and low academic performance of minorities.<ref name="O'Connell"/> This was a "kick start" to her life's work and led to her most significant contributions in the field of developmental psychology.

Kenneth and Mamie Clark decided to try to improve social services for troubled youth in Harlem, as there were virtually no mental-health services in the community. Kenneth Clark was then an [[assistant professor]] at the [[City College of New York]] and Mamie Clark was a psychological consultant doing psychological testing at the Riverdale Children's Association. Kenneth Bancroft Clark and Mamie Phipps Clark approached social service agencies in New York City to urge them to expand their programs to provide [[social work]], [[psychological evaluation]], and remediation for youth in Harlem. None of the agencies took up their proposal. The Clarks "realized that we were not going to get a child guidance [[clinic]] opened that way. So we decided to open it ourselves."

Together in 1946 the Clarks created the Northside Center for Child Development, originally called the Northside Testing and Consultation Center.<ref name=":3" /> They started it in a one-room basement apartment of the Dunbar Houses on 158th Street (Manhattan).<ref name=":3" /> Two years later in 1948, Northside moved to [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]], across from [[Central Park]], on the sixth floor of what was then the [[New Lincoln School]]. In 1974, Northside moved to its current quarters in Schomburg Plaza. It continues to serve Harlem children and their families in the 21st century.

Their goal was to match or surpass the quality of service for poor African Americans. They provided a homelike environment for poor black children that provided pediatric and psychological help.<ref name="Butler"/> It served as a location for initial experiments on racial biases of education and the intersection of education and varying theories and practices of psychology and social psychology. The psychological work that they did here led them to the conclusion that the problems of minority children are psychosocial.<ref name="Butler"/> This was the first center that offered psychological services to minority families in the areas around Harlem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/psychologists/clark.aspx |title=Featured Psychologists: Mamie Phipps Clark, PhD, and Kenneth Clark, PhD |publisher=American Psychological Association |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref>

Mamie remained the director of the Northside Center for 33 years. Upon her retirement, Dora Johnson, a staff member at Northside, captured the importance of Mamie Clark to Northside. "Mamie Clark embodied the center. In a very real way, it was her views, philosophy, and her soul that held the center together". She went on to say that "when an unusual and unique person pursues a dream and realizes that dream and directs that dream, people are drawn not only to the idea of the dream, but to the uniqueness of the person themselves."<ref>Markowitz, G., & Rosner, D. (1996). In Children, power and race (pp 246). [[Charlottesville]]: University Press of Virginia.</ref> Her vision of social, economic, and psychological advancement of African American children resonates far beyond the era of integration.<ref>Lal, S. (2002). Giving Children Security. American Psychologist Association (57)(1), 20–28.</ref>

Mamie did not limit her contributions to her work. She was also a very involved member of the community. She was on the boards of directors for several community organizations, along with being involved with the Youth Opportunities Unlimited Project and the initiation of the Head Start Program.<ref name= Karera_2010 /> She also volunteered in the psychiatric clinic of the Domestic Relations Court while she was completing her degree at Columbia.<ref name=":3" />

=== Published work ===
One of Mamie's published works was titled "The Development of Consciousness of Self and the Emergence of Racial Identification in Negro Preschool Children." This study was an investigation of early level of conscious racial identity in black preschool children. This study included 150 black children from segregated nursery schools in Washington, D.C. 50% of the participants were girls and 50% were boys. There were 50 three-year-old, 50 four-year-old, and 50 five-year-old children involved. Each participant was given a set of pictures that included white and black boys, a lion, a dog, a clown, and a hen. The participants were asked to point to the drawing that represented who or what they were asked about. An example of this procedure would be a black boy being asked to point to his cousin or brother. The results of this study showed that the group tended to choose the black drawing more than the white drawing. As age increased, there was an increase in the ratio of choosing the black boy in contrast to the white boy in favor of the black boy. This finding indicates that a great amount of self-conscious development and racial identity happens between ages three and fours years old. Once past four years old, this identification with the black boy plateaus. This plateau may imply that the picture study is not sensitive enough for children over four. It also suggests that maybe five-year-old children have reached a self-awareness and now see themselves in an intrinsic way and are less capable of external representations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Kenneth|last2=Clark|first2=Mamie|title=The development of consciousness of self and the emergence of racial identification in Negro preschool children|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=10|date=1939|issue=4|pages=591–599|doi=10.1080/00224545.1939.9713394}}</ref>

=== Legacy ===
Phipps Clark's work provided key contributions to the fields of developmental psychology and the psychology of race by shedding light on the impact of racial discrimination. She made lasting contributions at the United States Armed Forces Institute and the Public Health Association. Her unrelenting research on the identity and self-esteem of Black people expanded the work on identity development.

Clark is not as famous as her husband. It has been noted that she adhered to feminine expectations of the time and often took care to "remain in the shadows of her husband's limelight". She often presented as shy. It should also be noted, however, that Phipps Clark's desire to remain in her husband's shadow occurred in the backdrop of blatant sexism and racism in the psychological field. She received a Candace Award for Humanitarianism from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1983<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNeill |first1=Leila |title=How a Psychologist’s Work on Race Identity Helped Overturn School Segregation in 1950s America |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/psychologist-work-racial-identity-helped-overturn-school-segregation-180966934/#:~:text=Even%20though%20Clark%20left%20academic,the%20Candace%20Award%20for%20humanitarianism. |website=smithsonianmag.com |access-date=2 December 2021}}</ref>.

==Kenneth Clark==

===Early life and education===
Kenneth Clark was born in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Arthur Bancroft Clark and Miriam Hanson Clark. His father worked as an agent for the [[United Fruit Company]]. When he was five, his parents separated and his mother took him and his younger sister Beulah to the US to live in [[Harlem]] in [[New York City]]. She worked as a [[seamstress]] in a [[sweatshop]], where she later [[union organizer|organized]] a [[trade union|union]] and became a [[shop steward]] for the [[International Ladies Garment Workers Union]]. Clark moved to [[New York City]] while the ethnic diversity of [[Harlem]] was disappearing, and his school was predominantly black. Clark noted that he first "became aware of color" when he was taught by a black teacher, who happened to be [[Hubert Thomas Delany|Hubert Thomas Delaney]].<ref name=":3" /> Clark was trained to learn a trade, as were most black students at this time. Miriam wanted more for her son and transferred him to [[George Washington Educational Campus|George Washington High School]] in [[Upper Manhattan]]. Clark graduated from high school in 1931 (Jones & Pettigrew, 2005).<ref name=NYT_obit_2005>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/nyregion/02clark.html?_r=1 Richard Severo, "Kenneth Clark, Who Fought Segregation, Dies"], ''The New York Times,'' 2 May 2005, accessed 20 Jan 2009</ref>

Clark attended [[Howard University]], a [[historically black university]], where he first studied political science with professors including [[Ralph Johnson Bunche]]. During his years at Howard University, he worked under the influence of mentor [[Francis Cecil Sumner]], the first African American to receive a doctorate in psychology. He returned in 1935 for a master's in psychology.<ref name=NYT_obit_2005/>  Clark was a distinguished member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity. After earning his master's degree, Sumner directed Clark to [[Columbia University]] to work with another influential mentor, [[Otto Klineberg]] (Jones & Pettigrew, 2005).

While studying psychology for his doctorate at Columbia University, Clark did research in support of the study of race relations by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[economist]] [[Gunnar Myrdal]], who wrote ''[[An American Dilemma]]''. In 1940, Clark was the first African American to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in psychology from Columbia University.

===Career===
During the summer of 1941, after Clark was already asked to teach a summer session at City College of New York, the Dean of Hampton Institute asked Clark to start a department of psychology there. In 1942 Kenneth Clark became the first African-American tenured full professor at the [[City College of New York]]. Clark also started a psychology department at Hampton Institute in 1942 and taught a few courses within the department. In 1966 he was the first African American appointed to the [[University of the State of New York|New York State Board of Regents]] and the first African American to be president of the [[American Psychological Association]].<ref name=NYT_obit_2005/>

Much of Clark's work came as a response to his involvement in the 1954 [[Brown v. Board of Education]] US Supreme Court desegregation decision. Lawyers [[Jack Greenberg (lawyer)|Jack Greenberg]] and [[Robert L. Carter]], with resources and funding from the [[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC) and Topeka Jewish Community Relations Bureau, hired Clark to present his work on the effects of segregation on children.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1m--hIat1-YC&q=American+Jewish+Committee+Kenneth+Clark&pg=PA93 |title=Broken Alliance |last=Kaufman |first=Jonathan |page=93 |access-date=2015-12-01|isbn=9780684800967 |year=1995 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/node/11826 |title=Brown v.

Board of Education case, Clark was still dissatisfied by the lack of progress in school desegregation in New York City. In a 1964 interview with [[Robert Penn Warren]] for the book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', Clark expressed his doubts about the efficacy of certain busing programs in desegregating the public schools.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Kenneth Bancroft Clark|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/kenneth-bancroft-clark|website=Robert Penn Warren's Who Speaks for the Negro? Archive|access-date=10 December 2014}}</ref> Clark also felt very discouraged by the lack of social welfare organizations to address race and poverty issues. Clark argued that a new approach had to be developed to involve poor blacks, in order to gain the political and economic power needed to solve their problems. Clark called his new approach "internal colonialism", with hope that the Kennedy-Johnson administration's [[War on Poverty]] would address problems of increasing social isolation, economic dependence and declining municipal services for many African Americans (Freeman, 2008).

Clark in 1962 was among the founders of [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited]] (HARYOU), an organization devoted to developing educational and job opportunities. With HARYOU, Clark conducted an extensive sociological study of Harlem. He measured IQ scores, crime frequency, age frequency of the population, drop-out rates, church and school locations, quality of housing, family incomes, drugs, STD rates, homicides, and a number of other areas.<ref name=Free/> It recruited educational experts to help to reorganize Harlem schools, create preschool classes, tutor older students after school, and job opportunities for youth who dropped out. The Johnson administration earmarked more than $100 million for the organization. When it was placed under the administration of a pet project of [[U.S. Congressman|Congressman]] [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]] in 1964, the two men clashed over appointment of a director and its direction.<ref name=NYT_obit_2005/>

Clark used HARYOU to press for changes to the educational system to help improve black children's performance. While he at first supported decentralization of city schools, after a decade of experience, Clark believed that this option had not been able to make an appreciable difference and described the experiment as a "disaster."<ref name=NYT_obit_2005/>

Following [[Mass racial violence in the United States#1967|race riots in the summer of 1967]], [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] appointed the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders ([[Kerner Commission]]). The Commission called Clark among the first experts to testify on urban issues. In 1973, Clark testified in the trial of [[Marin County courthouse incident|Ruchell Magee]].<ref name="Close">{{cite journal |last=Close |first=Alexandra |date= June 1973 |title=Ruchell Magee: The Defense Never Rests |journal=Ramparts |pages=21–24 |access-date=January 23, 2011 |url=http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Underground_News/pdf/Ramparts_June_1973_1.pdf }}</ref>

Clark retired from City College in 1975, but remained an active advocate for integration throughout his life, serving on the board of the [http://nycivilrights.org New York Civil Rights Coalition], of which he was Chairman Emeritus until his death. He opposed separatists and argued for high standards in education, continuing to work for children's benefit. He consulted to city school systems across the country, and argued that all children should learn to use Standard English in school.<ref name=NYT_obit_2005/>

Clark died in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]] in May 2005.

== The Coloring Test ==
The coloring test was another experiment that was involved in the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision.<ref name=":3" /> Mamie and Kenneth did this experiment in order to investigate the development of racial identity in African American children and examine how a negro child’s color and “their sense of their own race and status” influenced “their judgment about themselves” and their “self esteem.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=cla0015.0289.020|title=Eyes on the Prize Interviews I|website=digital.wustl.edu|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> The coloring test was administered to 160 African American children between the ages of five and seven years old. The children were given a piece of coloring paper with a leaf, an apple, an orange, a mouse, a boy and a girl on it. They were all given a box of crayons and asked to first color the mouse to make sure they had a basic understanding of the relationship between color and object. If they pass, they were then asked to color a boy if they were a boy and a girl if they were a girl. They were told to color the boy or girl the color that they are. They were then told to color the opposite sex the color that they want that sex to be.<ref name="Clark 1950 341–350">{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|author2=Mamie Clark|year=1950|title=The Negro child in the American social order|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=19|issue=3|pages=341–350|doi=10.2307/2966491|jstor=2966491}}</ref> The Clarks categorized the responses into reality responses (accurately colored their skin color), phantasy responses (very different from their skin color), and irrelevant responses (used bizarre colors like purple or green).

== Doll experiments ==
<!-- linked from Brown v. Board of Education -->
The Clarks' doll experiments grew out of Mamie Clark's [[master's degree]] [[thesis or dissertation|thesis]]. They published three major papers between 1939 and 1940 on children's self-perception related to race. Their studies found contrasts among African-American children attending [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated schools]] in [[Washington, DC]] versus those in integrated schools in New York.<ref>[http://www.apa.org/research/action/segregation.aspx "Segregation Ruled Unequal, and Therefore Unconstitutional"], ''Psychology Matters'', American Psychological Association. Undated. Accessed 29 March 2010.</ref> The doll experiment involved a child being presented with two dolls. Both of these dolls were completely identical except for the skin and hair color.

This work suggests that by its very nature, segregation harms children and, by extension, society at large, a suggestion that was exploited in several legal battles. The Clarks testified as expert witnesses in several school desegregation cases, including ''[[Briggs v. Elliott]]'', which was later combined into the famous ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). In 1954, Clark and [[Isidor Chein]] wrote a brief whose purpose was to supply evidence in the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' case underlining the damaging effects [[racial segregation]] had on African-American children. ''Brown v. Board'' was a test case supported by the [[NAACP]] to end the precedent of legal segregation when conditions are “[[separate but equal]],” established by the case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in 1896.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483|title=Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1)|website=Oyez|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> In a 9-0 decision for Brown, the Court decided that segregation based on race in public schools violates the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep347483/|title=U.S. Reports: Brown v.

The Supreme Court declared that separate but equal in education was unconstitutional because it resulted in African American children having "a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community."<ref name="Butler" /> The Doll Study is cited in the 11th footnote of the Brown decision to provide updated and “ample” psychological support to the Kansas case. The Brown decision quotes that, “segregation of white and colored children in public schools has detrimental effect upon the colored children” and this sense of inferiority “affects the motivation of a child to learn.”<ref name=":1" /> The evidence provided by Clark helped end segregation in the public school systems. Regarding Brown, this question of psychological and psychic harm fit into a very particular historical window that allowed it to have formal traction in the first place. It was not until a few decades prior (with the coming of Boas and other cultural anthropologists) that cultural and social-science research—and the questions that they invoked—would even be consulted by the courts and therefore able to influence decisions.

=== Response to Doll tests ===
Not everyone accepted the Doll tests as valid scientific studies. [[Henry Garrett (psychologist)|Henry E. Garrett]], Mamie Clark’s former professor and advisor at Columbia, was an avid supporter of segregation and a witness in ''[[Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]], VA (''one of the five court cases that combined to form ''Brown v. Board).'' Garrett argued that no tests could adequately gauge a student’s attitudes toward segregation, and that the Clarks’ tests in Virginia were biased and had too small of a sample size.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Steven|last2=Ancheta|first2=Angelo N.|date=2005-10-01|title=Scientific Evidence and Equal Protection of the Law|journal=The American Journal of Legal History|volume=47|issue=4|pages=448|doi=10.2307/30039559|jstor=30039559|issn=0002-9319}}</ref> Garrett advocated in his Virginia school board testimony that if a negro child had access to equal facilities surrounded by his own teachers and friends, “he would be more likely to develop pride in himself as a Negro, which I think we would all like to see him do – to develop his own potential, his sense of duty…” and Garrett even claimed that they would “prefer to remain as a Negro group” instead of mixing and facing hostility, animosity, and inferiority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GarrettTestimony/page/n1/mode/2up|title=Garrett Testimony|last=Henry|first=Garrett|website=Internet Archive|url-status=live|archive-date=January 1, 1970}}</ref> Garrett and his colleague [[Wesley Critz George|Wesley C. George]]’s 1964 letter to the ''Science'' journal further questioned the Brown decision, claiming the only reference to science in the entire decision is in footnote 11. Garrett and George argue that the Court overlooked the “mental difference” between races, and that Clark’s evidence was invalid and misleading because “integration, not segregation, injured the Negro child’s self-image.” <ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Garrett|first1=Henry E.|last2=George|first2=Wesley C.|last3=Commoner|first3=Barry|last4=Brode|first4=Robert B.|last5=Byerly|first5=T.

Board of Education and the Interest-Divergence Dilemma|journal=Journal of American History|language=en|volume=91|issue=1|pages=92–118|doi=10.2307/3659616|jstor=3659616}}</ref> The Clark Doll Study was influential scientific evidence for the Brown v. Board decision, but a few academics questioned the study.

In 2005, filmmaker [[Kiri Davis]] recreated the doll study and documented it in a film entitled ''[[A Girl Like Me (documentary)|A Girl Like Me]]''. Despite the many changes in some parts of society, Davis found the same results as did the Drs. Clark in their study of the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the original experiments, the majority of the children chose the white dolls. When Davis repeated the experiment 15 out of 21 children also chose the white dolls over the black doll.

[[CNN]] recreated the doll study in 2010 with cartoons of five children, each with different shades of skin color.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/05/13/doll.study/index.html|title=Study: White and black children biased toward lighter skin - CNN.com|website=www.cnn.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> The experiment was designed by Margaret Beale Spencer, a child psychologist and University of Chicago professor. Children were asked to answer the same doll test questions, such as “who is the nice child” or “who has the skin color most adults like” and choose between the cartoon people arranged in order of lightest to darkest skin. The results were interpreted as indicating “white bias,” meaning that children (mostly white, but also “black children as a whole have some bias”) continue to associate positive attributes with lighter skin tones, and negative attributes with darker skin tones.<ref name=":2" />

==Family==
The Clarks had two children: a son Hilton and daughter Kate. During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]], Hilton was a leader of the Society of Afro-American Students; his father negotiated between them and the [[university administration]]. The Clark's were happily married for forty-five years, until Mamie's death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rutherford |first1=A |title=Mamie Phipps Clark: Developmental psychologist, starting from strengths. |date=2011 |location=Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology |pages=261-276 |access-date=2 December 2021}}</ref> Kate Clark Harris directed the Northside Center for Child Development for four years after her mother's death.

A ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report in the 1970s noted that Clark, who supported integration and [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]], moved to [[Westchester County]] in 1950 because of his concern about failing public schools in the city.<ref name="'70s 264">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= [[Basic Books]]|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/264 264]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/264|url-access= registration}}</ref>  Clark said: "My children have only one life and I could not risk that."<ref name=NYT_obit_2005/><ref name="'70s 264"/>
