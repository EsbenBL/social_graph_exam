'''Fred Manville Taylor''' (July 11, 1855, [[Northville, Michigan]] – August 7, 1932<!-- , Pasadena?-->) was a U.S. [[economist]] and educator best known for his contribution to the theory of [[market socialism]]. He taught mostly history at [[Albion College]] from 1879 to 1892. He taught in the department of economics at [[University of Michigan]] from 1892 to 1929 after receiving his Ph.D. in [[political philosophy]] there in 1888. His ''Principles of Economics'' (1911) went through 9 editions.<ref>*F.M. Taylor ([1911] 1925, 9th ed.). ''Principles of Economics''. Chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=QShBAAAAIAAJ&printsec=find&pg=PR7=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false links] (1921, 8th ed.).</ref> Of a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[economic ideology|ideology]], he was noted as a clear and rigorous expositor of economic theory in the [[partial equilibrium|partial-equilibrium]] lineage of [[Alfred Marshall]].<ref>Daniel R. Fusfeld (1987). "Taylor, Fred Manville" ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp.&nbsp;611–12.</ref>

In his [[American Economic Association]] presidential address, Taylor (1929) laid out the conditions under which a [[socialist economy]] could in theory achieve an efficient allocation of resources. The conditions parallel those of a [[capitalism|private-enterprise economy]]. They include the state providing money income to its citizens, citizens using their income as they choose to buy output produced by [[State (polity)|state]] [[Business|enterprises]], and the state setting prices equal to marginal cost so as to compensate factors of production, including labor, with prices set by trial-and-error to clear markets.<ref>Fred M.

Lange|Oscar Lange]] in the following decade and anticipated in mathematical form by [[Enrico Barone]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2551426|title = Fred M.
