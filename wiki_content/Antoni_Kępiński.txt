'''Antoni Ignacy Tadeusz Kępiński''' (16 November 1918 – 8 June 1972) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[philosopher]]. He is known as the originator of concepts of [[information metabolism]] (IM) and [[Antoni Kępiński#Axiological psychiatry|axiological psychiatry]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kokoszka|first1=Andrzej|title=States of Consciousness: Models for Psychology and Psychotherapy|date=2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-32758-7|page=20|ref=1}}</ref>

==Biography==
Kępiński was born in [[Dolyna|Dolina]], which at that time was part of Poland (now southwestern Ukraine). During the childhood years, he resided in [[Nowy Sącz]] where his father held the position of [[Starostwo|starosta]].<ref name ="ryn1">{{cite web|last1=Ryn|first1=Zdzisław|title=Mistrz Antoni Kępiński|url=http://www.psychiatria.pl/artykul/mistrz-antoni-kepinski/776|website=psychiatria.pl|access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref> He attended the high-ranking [[Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School]] in [[Kraków]]. In 1936, Kępiński entered the Medical Faculty of the [[Jagiellonian University]]. In 1939, he interrupted his studies before graduation and volunteered for the Polish Army to defend his country from the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion]]. After the successful invasion of Poland by [[Wehrmacht|Germany]], Kępiński was captured and imprisoned in [[Hungary]], to where he had fled. In 1940, he managed to escape imprisonment and headed to [[France]], then [[Spain]], where he was imprisoned in [[Miranda del Ebro]].<ref name="ryn1" /> 

Later he was freed and moved to the [[United Kingdom]], spending a short time with the Polish [[aircraft]] division. In 1944-5, he continued his medical studies in [[Edinburgh]], graduating in 1946. Soon he returned to Poland and took up psychiatry at the Psychiatric Clinic in Collegium Medicum of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków. Shortly before his death in 1972 he was appointed as professor of that faculty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Antoni Kępiński's short biography (In Polish) at newzealandline.wordpress.com|url=https://newzealandline.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/antoni-kepinski/}}</ref>

As a concentration camp inmate himself, Kępiński took part in a rehabilitation programme for survivors from the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp.<ref name="ryn1" />

==His work==
===Auschwitz syndrome===
Due to his involvement, in the 1950s, in the rehabilitation program for the former concentration camp prisoners, Kępiński may be regarded as the pioneer of the [[posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] research.<ref name="schochow2016">{{cite journal|last1=Schochow|first1=Maximilian|last2=Steger|first2=Florian|title=Antoni Kepiński (1918–1972), pioneer of post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=208|issue=6|year=2016|pages=590|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.115.168237|pmid=27251694|doi-access=free}}</ref> The idea of such research originated in the mind of Kępiński's colleague [[Stanisław Kłodziński]].<ref name="kepinski1972">{{cite book|last1=Kępiński|first1=Antoni|title=Rhythm of life (in Polish)|date=1972|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Kraków}}
</ref> Together with fellow researchers from the Psychiatric Clinic of the Medical Academy in Cracow they examined large number of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] survivors and mapped out the clinical picture of the concentration camp syndrome which they called the ''KZ-Syndrome''. As noted by psychiatrist Krzysztof Rutkowski, the same syndrome was later investigated in other countries (for example in the [[United States of America|United States]] after the [[Vietnam war]] in the 1970s), and it is currently known as the [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name="jurszo2018">{{cite web|last1=Jurszo|first1=Robert|title=Syndrom obozowy mógł latami trwać uśpiony w psychice więźnia|url=https://psychiatria.mp.pl/aktualnosci/136620,syndrom-obozowy-mogl-latami-trwac-uspiony-w-psychice-wieznia|website=psychiatria.mp.pl|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>

===The specificity of psychiatric examination===
Co-workers and biographers of Kępiński emphasize that the key characteristic of his professional activity was his unique approach to the patient, inspired by the [[philosophy of dialogue]].<ref name="bulaczek2013" /><ref name="kokoszka2012">{{cite journal|last1=Kokoszka|first1=Andrzej|title=Dialog according to Antoni Kępiński: comments to the session "The patient as the person" (in Polish)|journal=Psychoterapia|date=2012|volume=4|issue=163|pages=47–54|url=http://www.psychoterapiaptp.pl/uploads/PT_4_2012/Kokoszka47_Psychoterapia_4_2012.pdf}}</ref> Part of his writings is devoted to peculiarities and subtleties of the psychiatric examination. In his view, diagnosis and therapy should not be based solely on logical analysis, as the inclusion of the [[emotion]]al dimension is indispensable in [[psychology]]. Therefore, the therapist should form an emotional relationship with the patient, based on [[empathy]] and trust.<ref name="bulaczek2013" /> The hierarchy in such relationship should be more or less horizontal, as both parties can learn a lot from each other. The general attitude of the therapist should encourage the patient to share experiences, feelings and thoughts without the fear of being judged.<ref name="kokoszka2012" /> In such way, the doctor obtains the chance to better understand the structure and beauty of the inner world of the patient and to establish an appropriate base for the diagnosis. Wearing masks, assuming the position of superiority and being inauthentic during the therapeutic interaction are the most significant mistakes made by therapists.<ref name="kokoszka2012" />

===Axiological psychiatry===
In [[philosophy]], [[axiology]] is the theory of value.<ref name="stanford2018">{{cite web|last1=Schroeder|first1=Mark|title=Value Theory|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref> According to Kępiński, the problem of value is of the greatest importance in psychiatry. It has two dimensions. Firstly, there are certain ethical values which should guide the doctors in their medical practice. Secondly, the therapeutic process in psychiatry should lead to reorganization or rebuilding of the hierarchy of values in the patient.<ref name="bulaczek2013">{{cite journal|last1=Bulaczek|first1=Aleksandra|title=Relations patient – doctor in axiological psychiatry of Antoni Kępiński (in Polish)|journal=Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae UKSW|date=2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=9–28|url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-37c5d3a1-9ee9-49e4-b9d1-287df1ef3a58/c/tom_11_2_1_aleksandra_bulaczek_relacje_pacjent_lekarz_w_psychiatrii_aksjologicznej_antoniego_kepinskiego.pdf}}</ref>

Kępiński's bioethics was derived directly from The [[Hippocratic Oath]]. In his view, the main goal of the psychiatrist is to bring relief to  their patients. Being a physician is a type of mission or calling rather than an ordinary paid occupation. The key value which should never be ignored is hope. Without it, the actions undertaken by the doctors become meaningless. Moreover, patients are able to read from the faces of their physicians and will quickly recognize any doubt. Therefore, the belief in the possibility of improvement is indispensable in the medical profession.<ref name="bulaczek2013" />

Another axiological theme in Kępiński's psychiatry was his view on the nature of neuroses, especially [[schizophrenia]]. According to that view, neuroses may be seen as distortions of the hierarchy of values which is one of the key aspects of the [[information metabolism]] process occurring in the organism of the patient.<ref name="schochow2016"/>  Therapeutic work should lead to formation of a healthy hierarchy of value, allowing the patient to interact with reality in a balanced manner.<ref name="bulaczek2013" /> Axiological take on psychopathology was seen as something unique and new in Polish psychiatry. It opened the way for new directions of research, and due to that some reviewers recognized Kępiński's works as the foundation for a new branch of psychiatry.<ref name="bulaczek2013" />

===Information metabolism===
{{main|Information metabolism}}
Information metabolism is a [[psychology|psychological]] theory of interaction between biological organisms and their environment based on [[information processing]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bielecki|first1=Andrzej|title=The general entity of life: a cybernetic approach.|journal=Biological Cybernetics|volume=109|issue=3|year=2015|pages=401–419|doi=10.1007/s00422-015-0652-8|pmid=25985758}}</ref> The most detailed description of information metabolism concept was given by Kępiński in his book ''Melancholy'' (1974).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kępiński|first1=Antoni|title=Melancholy (In Polish)|date=2014|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Kraków}}</ref> In this model, the living organism is considered an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] as understood by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|von Bertalanffy]]. Living beings are characterized by ability to increase and maintain their own [[negentropy]] - an idea popularized in [[Schrödinger]]'s book ''[[What is life?]]''.<ref name="kepinski1972"/> This ability makes the difference between them and inanimate objects which obey the [[second law of thermodynamics|increase of entropy principle]]. The body retains the same basic structure, although its building elements (molecules) are replaced quite frequently in [[metabolism|anabolic and catabolic]] processes. The energy derived from food and oxygen is spent on securing the integrity of the organism. To refer to anabolic and catabolic processes in cells Kępiński used the term "energy metabolism". Any activity of an organism is an informational sign to other beings. Activities in the physical realm are reactions to changes perceived in the external or internal reality of the organism. Bearing that in mind, the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] can be seen as the information-processing unit. As emphasized by Kępiński, psychological structure of an individual remains relatively stable despite an ongoing exchange of information, analogically to the physical structure subject to energy metabolism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kępiński|first1=Antoni|title=Schizophrenia (In Polish)|date=2012|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|isbn=978-83-08-04947-1}}</ref>
In his books, Kępiński explained various mental conditions as disorders and imbalances of the information metabolism in general and its inherent value structure in particular.<ref name="schochow2016"/> During his life, Kępiński mentioned that his model of information metabolism is not complete.<ref name="struzik1987">{{cite journal|last1=Struzik|first1=Tadeusz|title=Kepiński's Information Metabolism, Carnot's Principle and Information Theory|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|date=1987|volume=36|issue=1–2|pages=105–111|doi=10.3109/00207458709002144|pmid=3654085}}</ref> The work upon it was interrupted by his illness and death.

===Kępiński as philosopher===
Despite being essentially scientific, Kępiński's works invoked great interest among Polish philosophers, most notably [[Józef Tischner]], who greatly appreciated his [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights.<ref name="bulaczek2013" /> Kępiński was not afraid of hypothesizing about the most difficult philosophical problems such as the nature of life, the problem of [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and human autonomy. On the other hand, he was skeptical about methods and theories which lacked solid scientific basis, e.g. [[psychoanalysis]], and rejected various forms of magical thinking in psychology.<ref name="zawila2018">{{cite web|last1=Zawiła-Niedźwiecki|first1=Jakub|title=Kępiński, philosophy of mind, an inquiry into some limits of patient's autonomy|url=https://www.academia.edu/20222967|website=academia.edu|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> Kępiński supported the idea that human [[ethics]] is not socially-constructed but it is rooted in biology and its prerequisites can be found in the animal world.<ref name="kepinski1977">{{cite book|last1=Kępiński|first1=Antoni|title=Anxiety (in Polish)|date=1977|publisher=Państwowy Zakład Wydawnictw Lekarskich|location=Warszawa}}</ref> He strongly rejected every form of ideology and extensively commented on the destructive impact of ideologies on human history.<ref name="kepinski1972" /> Tischner emphasized that many interesting ideas found in Kępiński's works are taken from other thinkers. He recognized [[information metabolism]] and axiological psychiatry as two truly original ideas of Kępiński.<ref name="kokoszka2012" /> Kępiński's disciple - psychiatrist Jacek Bomba - noted that the greatest value of information metabolism theory is its quality of being an accurate and comprehensive synthesis of knowledge from [[neurophysiology]], [[psychology]], [[social science]] and [[medicine]].<ref name="ceklarz2018">{{cite journal|last1=Ceklarz|first1=Jan|title=Revision of Antoni Kępiński's concept of information metabolism (in Polish)|journal=Psychiatr. Pol.|date=2018|volume=52|issue=1|pages=165–173|doi=10.12740/PP/65751|pmid=29704423|url=http://www.psychiatriapolska.pl/uploads/images/PP_1_2018/165Ceklarz_PsychiatrPol2018v52i1.pdf|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Kępiński maintained good relationship with [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Roman Ingarden]] - a prominent  disciple of [[Edmund Husserl]]. The influence of phenomenology is apparent in his approach to human psychology.<ref name="kokoszka2012" /> It may be regarded as his second favorite analytical tool, next to the scientific approach.<ref name="kokoszka2012" />

Some of the works were translated to Russian, but not to English. As a result, his contributions in the field of [[psychiatry]] and anthropology are not known well in the English-speaking world. There are some attempts to link Kępiński to postpsychiatry. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stupak |first1=Radosław |last2=Dyga |first2=Krzysztof |title=Postpsychiatry and postmodern psychotherapy: Theoretical and ethical issues in mental health care in a Polish context |journal=Theory & Psychology |date=December 2018 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=780–799 |doi=10.1177/0959354318802973}}</ref>
