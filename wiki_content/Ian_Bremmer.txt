== Career ==

=== Eurasia Group ===
Bremmer founded the political risk research and consulting firm [[Eurasia Group]] in 1998 in the offices of the World Policy Institute in New York City.<ref name="Politico2018-02-03">{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934|title=Why Carter Page Was Worth Watching: There's plenty of evidence that the former Trump campaign adviser, for all his quirks, was on suspiciously good terms with Russia.|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=February 3, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=October 8, 2018|author-link=Luke Harding}}</ref> The firm opened a London office in 2000, a Washington, DC office in 2005, a Tokyo office in 2015, San Francisco and São Paulo offices in 2016, and Brasilia and Singapore offices in 2017.

===J-Curve===
{{Main|The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall}}
[[File:The-J-Curve blanksm.jpg|right]]
Bremmer's [[The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|J curve]]<ref>Bremmer, Ian. 2006. ''The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall''. Simon and Schuster.</ref> outlines the link between a country's openness and its stability. While many countries are stable because they are open (the United States, France, Japan), others are stable because they are closed ([[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]]). States can travel both forward (right) and backward (left) along this J curve, so stability and openness are never secure. The J is steeper on the left-hand side, as it is easier for a leader in a [[failed state]] to create stability by closing the country than to build a civil society and establish accountable institutions; the curve is higher on the far right because states that prevail in opening their societies (Eastern Europe, for example) ultimately become more stable than [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]]. The book was listed as a top 10 pick by ''The Economist'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fighting to be tops |url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2006/12/07/fighting-to-be-tops}}</ref>

===State capitalism===
Ian Bremmer describes [[state capitalism]] as a system in which [[State (polity)|the state]] dominates markets primarily for political gain. In his 2010 book ''[[The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations]]'', Bremmer describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the [[Market economy|free market economies]] of [[Human Development Index|the developed world]], particularly in the aftermath of the [[financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/439ccee0-bec6-11df-a755-00144feab49a |title=State capitalism: China's 'market-Leninism' has yet to face biggest test |website=Ft.com |access-date=July 19, 2017}} {{subscription required|date=July 2017}}</ref>

===G-Zero===
The term G-Zero world refers to a breakdown in global leadership brought about by a decline of Western influence and the inability of other nations to fill the void.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks|title=Eurasia Group Top 10 Risks of 2011|website=Eurasiagroup.net|access-date=July 19, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131233850/http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks|archive-date=January 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Gregory Scoblete.

In his book, ''[[Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World]]'' (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains that, in the G-Zero, no country or group of countries has the political and economic leverage to drive an international agenda or provide [[Public good (economics)|global public goods]].<ref>Ian Bremmer and David Gordon.[http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/07/g_zero G-Zero] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912015854/http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/07/g_zero |date=September 12, 2011 }}, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', January 7, 2011.</ref><ref>Ian Bremmer and [[Nouriel Roubini]].

===Weaponization of finance===
The term ''weaponization of finance'' refers to the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive diplomacy. In his [[Eurasia Group]] Top Risks 2015 report,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/toprisks2015/Top+Risks+2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128072806/https://s3.amazonaws.com/toprisks2015/Top+Risks+2015.pdf |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |last1=BRINK Editorial Staff |title=Ian Bremmer Q&A: Top Risks of 2015 |url=https://www.brinknews.com/ian-bremmer-qa-top-risks-of-2015/ |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=BRINK |date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |last1=Holodny |first1=Elena |title=2015 Could Be The Year We Witness The 'Weaponization Of Finance' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/weaponization-of-finance-eurasia-group-2015-1 |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=The Insider |date=January 5, 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |last1=Bremmer |first1=Ian |title=5 Patterns Disrupting the World |url=https://www.ge.com/news/reports/ian-bremmer-5-political-risks-set-to-disrupt-the-world |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=GE |date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>

Bremmer coins the term weaponization of finance to describe the ways in which the United States is using its influence to affect global outcomes. Rather than rely on traditional elements of America's security advantage – including US-led alliances such as [[NATO]] and multi-lateral institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] – Bremmer argues that the US is now 'weaponizing finance' by limiting access to the American marketplace and to US banks as an instrument of its foreign and security policy. <ref>{{cite news |last1=BRINK Editorial Staff |title=Ian Bremmer Q&A: Top Risks of 2015 |url=https://www.brinknews.com/ian-bremmer-qa-top-risks-of-2015/ |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=BRINK |date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |last1=Bremmer |first1=Ian |title=5 Patterns Disrupting the World |url=https://www.ge.com/news/reports/ian-bremmer-5-political-risks-set-to-disrupt-the-world |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=GE |date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Pivot state===
Bremmer uses ''pivot state'' to describe a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304811304577365990370899520|title=The Future Belongs to the Flexible|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=July 19, 2017}}</ref> This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at the hands of a single country. At the opposite end of the spectrum are ''shadow states'', frozen within the influence of a single power. [[Canada]] is an example of a pivot state: with significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia, and formal security ties with [[NATO]], it is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. [[Mexico]], on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bremmer |first1=Ian |title=Which Countries Will Rise to the Top in a Leaderless World? |url=https://hbr.org/2012/05/which-countries-will-rise-to-t |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=Harvard Business Review |date=30 May 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |last1=Foxman |first1=Simone |title=These Are The Countries That Will Win And Lose In The New Global Paradigm |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/bremmer-these-are-the-countries-that-will-win-and-lose-in-the-g-zero-world-2012-5#loser-mexico-19< |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=Business Insider |date=May 1, 2012}}</ref>

In ''Every Nation for Itself'',<ref>Bremmer, Ian. ''Every Nation for Itself'',</ref> Bremmer explains how, in a volatile [[G-Zero]] world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance.

=== Geopolitical recession ===
Bremmer has coined the term “geopolitical recession” to describe the current geopolitical environment, one defined by an unwind of the former US-led global order. Unlike economic recessions, linked to frequent boom and bust cycles, Bremmer see geopolitical recessions as much longer cycles and are less likely to be recognized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/china-emerging-markets-are-rising-us-led-order-ending-ian-bremmer.html|title=A 'geopolitical recession' has arrived and the US-led world order is ending, Ian Bremmer says|last=Tan|first=Weizhen|date=2018-10-10|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>  He sees the present geopolitical recession as defined by deteriorating relations between the US and its traditional allies—particularly the Europeans—as China is rising but creating alternative international political and economic architecture. Bremmer argues that the overall result is a more fragmented approach to global governance, an increase in geopolitical tail risks, and a reduced ability to respond effectively to major international crises when they do hit. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Bremmer |first1=Ian |title=3 Risks Poised to Disrupt a Fast-Changing World by 2021 {{!}} GE News |url=https://www.ge.com/news/reports/ian-bremmer-3-risks-poised-to-disrupt-a-fast-changing-world-by-2021 |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=GE |date=March 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bremmer |first1=Ian |title=US-EU relations will never be the same again |url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/columnists/2021-04-07-ian-bremmer-us-eu-relations-will-never-be-the-same-again/ |access-date=24 October 2021 |publisher=BusinessLIVE |date=7 April 2021}}</ref>

=== World Data Organization ===
Bremmer proposed creating a “World Data Organization” to forestall a division in technology ecosystems due to conflict between the United States and China. He described it as a digital version of the [[World Trade Organization]], arguing that the United States, Europe, Japan, and other “governments that believe in online openness and transparency” should collaborate to set standards for artificial intelligence, data, privacy, citizens’ rights, and intellectual property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gzeromedia.com/why-we-need-a-world-data-organization-now|title=Why we need a World Data Organization.

== Other organizations ==
===Eurasia Group Foundation===
In 2016, Bremmer founded the Eurasia Group Foundation (EGF), a 501(c)3 public charity. Bremmer currently serves as the Eurasia Group Foundation’s board president.
===GZERO Media===
In 2017, Bremmer and Eurasia Group launched digital media company GZERO Media,<ref>{{Cite web|title=GZERO Media|url=https://www.gzeromedia.com/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=GZERO Media|language=en}}</ref> and a US national public television show called ''GZERO World with Ian Bremmer'' on PBS.<ref>{{Citation|title=GZERO WORLD with Ian Bremmer|url=https://www.pbs.org/show/gzero-world/|language=en|access-date=2020-07-15}}</ref> The company’s name refers to the term coined by Bremmer in ''[[Every Nation for Itself]]'' to describe a world where no country or group of countries has the political and economic leverage to drive an international agenda or provide global public goods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Coping with a G-Zero World|url=https://thediplomat.com/2012/06/coping-with-a-g-zero-world/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=thediplomat.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In March 2016, Bremmer sent a weekly note to clients where he unintentionally came up with the "[[America First (policy)|America First]]" slogan used by Donald Trump. The note described then-candidate Trump's foreign policy as not isolationist but "America First", a transactional, unilateralist perspective that was more a Chinese than American framework for foreign policy. Bremmer used the term to help explain Trump’s foreign policy views and not as a campaign slogan. A few weeks later New York Times reporters David Sanger and [[Maggie Haberman]], both of whom receive Bremmer's weekly note, conducted Trump’s first foreign policy interview and asked him if he would describe himself as an isolationist. He said no. They then asked Trump if he considered himself America First. Trump said yes<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-transcript.html|title=Transcript: Donald Trump Expounds on His Foreign Policy Views|date=2016-03-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-06-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and liked the term so much he started using it himself. Haberman later credited Bremmer with coming up with “America First” to describe Trump’s foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/713781776477515776|title=.@ianbremmer was one who identified Trump's view as "America First" a few months ago|last=Haberman|first=Maggie|date=2016-03-26|website=@maggieNYT|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>

In July 2017, Bremmer broke news of a second, previously undisclosed meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin during the G20 heads of state dinner in Hamburg. He wrote about the meeting in his weekly client note and later appeared on [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]] to discuss the meeting’s implications. Other major media outlets quickly picked up the news. [[Newsweek]] profiled Bremmer in an article titled "Who is Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer, the risk consultant who exposed the second Trump-Putin meeting?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-putin-ian-bremmer-eurasia-group-638724|title=Who is Ian Bremmer, the political risk consultant who broke the story of the second Trump-Putin meeting?|last=EDT|first=Tom Porter On 7/19/17 at 9:09 AM|date=2017-07-19|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>  Trump initially denied that his second meeting with Putin happened and called Bremmer "fake news."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/07/19/russian-lawmaker-reports-secret-putin-trump-meeting-sick/491014001/|title=Russian lawmaker: Reports of 'secret' Putin-Trump meeting 'sick'|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> However, then-White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Sanders]] later held a press conference and admitted the second meeting indeed happened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-putin-had-second-previously-undisclosed-meeting-g-20-summit-n784201|title=Trump, Putin had second, previously undisclosed meeting at G-20 summit|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>

In 2019, Donald Trump issued a Tweet that appeared to praise North Korean dictator [[Kim Jong Un]] for criticizing rival [[Joe Biden]]: "I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse."<ref name="TrumpKimIQ">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me.
