== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Pyotr Kropotkin was born in Moscow, into an ancient Russian princely family. His father, [[Major General]] Prince Alexei Petrovich [[Kropotkin family|Kropotkin]], was a descendant of the [[Smolensk]] branch,<ref>{{cite book|title=Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990|isbn=9780921689607|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9210921689609/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9210921689609 |url-access=registration|author1=Woodcock, George |author2=Avakumović, Ivan |name-list-style=amp }}</ref> of the [[Rurik dynasty]] which had ruled Russia before the rise of the Romanovs. Kropotkin's father owned large tracts of land and nearly 1,200 male [[serf]]s in three provinces.<ref name="harman-p20">{{cite book |author=Harman, Oren|title=The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness|publisher=W.W.

The widowed father married Yelizaveta Markovna Korandina in 1848.<ref name="spartacus"/>

Kropotkin dropped his princely title at age 12 "[u]nder the influence of [[Republicanism|republican]] teachings" and "even rebuked his friends, when they so referred to him."<ref name="rnb">Roger N. Baldwin, "The Story of Kropotkin's Life," in Kropotkin's ''Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings'', ed. by Baldwin (Orig. 1927; Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc., 1970), p. 13.</ref>

In 1857, at age 14, Kropotkin enrolled in the [[Page Corps|Corps of Pages]] at [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name=Miller7>Martin A. Miller, "Introduction" to P. A. Kropotkin, ''Selected Writings on Anarchism and Revolution.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1970; p. 7.</ref> Only 150 boys&nbsp;– mostly children of nobility belonging to the court&nbsp;– were educated in this privileged corps, which combined the character of a military school endowed with exclusive rights and of a court institution attached to the [[Imperial Household]]. Kropotkin's memoirs detail the [[hazing]] and other abuse of pages for which the Corps had become notorious.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Smith, Elder & Co.|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrevolut01kropuoft/page/63 63]|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrevolut01kropuoft|quote=peter kropotkin memoirs revolutionist.}}</ref>

In Moscow, Kropotkin developed what would become a lifelong interest in the condition of the peasantry. Although his work as a page for Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] made Kropotkin skeptical about the tsar's "liberal" reputation,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Kropotkin, Petr Alexseyevich|editor=Winkle, Justin|title=The Concise New Makers of Modern Culture|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2009|isbn=9780415477826|page=425|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_mVLMM55gUC&pg=PA425}}</ref> Kropotkin was greatly pleased by the tsar's decision to [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipate the serfs]] in 1861.<ref>{{cite book |author=Todes, Daniel Philip|title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195058307|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVskyJh6TgC&pg=PA124}}</ref> In [[St. Petersburg]], he read widely on his own account and gave special attention to the works of the [[Encyclopédistes|French encyclopædists]] and [[History of France|French history]]. The years 1857–1861 witnessed a growth in the intellectual forces of Russia, and Kropotkin came under the influence of the new liberal-revolutionary literature, which largely expressed his own aspirations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=270}}</ref>

In 1862, Kropotkin graduated first in his class from the Corps of Pages and entered the Tsarist army.<ref name=Miller8>Miller, "Introduction," pg. 8.</ref> The members of the corps had the prescriptive right to choose the regiment to which they would be attached. Following a desire to "be someone useful", Kropotkin chose the difficult route of serving in a [[Cossack]] regiment in eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Miller8 /> For some time, he was ''[[aide de camp]]'' to the governor of [[Transbaikalia]] at [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]]. Later he was appointed attaché for Cossack affairs to the governor-general of East Siberia at [[Irkutsk]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=198}}</ref>

=== Geographical expeditions in Siberia ===
The administrator under whom Kropotkin served, General [[Boleslar Kazimirovich Kukel]], was a liberal and a democrat who maintained personal connections to various Russian radical political figures exiled to Siberia. These included the writer [[Mikhail Larionovitch Mikhailov]], whom Kropotkin (on the orders of Kukel) once warned about the Moscow police's investigation into his political activities in confinement. Mikhailov later gave the young Tsarist functionary a copy of a book by the French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] — Kropotkin's first introduction to anarchist ideas. Kukel was later dismissed from his administrative position, being transferred, instead, to state-sponsored scientific endeavors.<ref name="Miller9">Miller, "Introduction," p. 9.</ref>

In 1864, Kropotkin accepted a position in a geographical survey expedition, crossing North [[Manchuria]] from [[Transbaikalia]] to the [[Amur River|Amur]], and soon was attached to another expedition up the [[Sungari River]] into the heart of [[Manchuria]]. The expeditions yielded valuable geographic results. The impossibility of obtaining any real administrative reforms in [[Siberia]] now induced Kropotkin to devote himself almost entirely to scientific exploration, in which he continued to be highly successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=214}}</ref>

Kropotkin continued his political reading, including works by such prominent liberal thinkers as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alexander Herzen]]. These readings, along with his experiences among peasants in Siberia, led him to declare himself an anarchist by 1872.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ward, Dana|chapter=Alchemy in Clarens: Kropotkin and Reclus, 1877–1881|editor1=Jun, Nathan J. |editor2=Wahl, Shane|title=New Perspectives on Anarchism|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2010|isbn=9780739132418|page=211|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5t0R0ckDMAC&pg=PA211}}</ref>

In 1867, Kropotkin resigned his commission in the army and returned to St. Petersburg, where he entered the [[Saint Petersburg Imperial University]] to study mathematics, becoming at the same time secretary to the geography section of the [[Russian Geographical Society]].<ref name="Marshall-2010-p311">{{cite book |author=Marshall, Peter|title=Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism|publisher=PM Press|year=2010|isbn=9781604860641|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDWIOL_KtGYC&pg=PA311}}</ref> His departure from a family tradition of military service prompted his father to disinherit him, "leaving him a 'prince' with no visible means of support".<ref name=Riggenbach>{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=The Anarchism of Peter Kropotkin |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=4 March 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5071/The-Anarchism-of-Peter-Kropotkin}}</ref>

In 1871, Kropotkin explored the glacial deposits of [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] for the Society.<ref name="Marshall-2010-p311" /> In 1873, he published an important contribution to science, a map and paper in which he showed that the existing maps entirely misrepresented the [[geography of Asia|physical features of Asia]]; the main structural lines were in fact from southwest to northeast, not from north to south or from east to west as had been previously supposed. During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large. Accordingly, he refused the offer and returned to St. Petersburg, where he joined the revolutionary party.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=235–236}}</ref>

=== Activism in Switzerland and France ===
[[File:Peter Kropotkin 1864.png|thumb|left|upright|Kropotkin in 1864]]
Kropotkin visited [[Switzerland]] in 1872 and became a member of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA) at [[Geneva]]. However, he found that he did not like IWA's style of socialism. Instead, he studied the programme of the more radical [[Jura federation]] at [[Neuchâtel]] and spent time in the company of the leading members, and adopted the creed of anarchism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=282–287}}</ref>

=== Activism in Russia and arrest ===
On returning to Russia, Kropotkin's friend Dmitri Klements introduced him to the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], a socialist/populist group created in 1872. Kropotkin worked to spread revolutionary propaganda among peasants and workers, and acted as a bridge between the Circle and the aristocracy. Throughout this period, Kropotkin maintained his position within the Geographical Society to provide cover for his activities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cahm, Caroline|title=Kropotkin: And the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872–1886|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780521891578|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zk7wTSWT3JUC&pg=PA44}}</ref>

In March 1874, Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for subversive political activity, as a result of his work with the Circle of Tchaikovsky. Because of his aristocratic background, he received special privileges in prison, such as permission to continue his geographical work in his cell. He delivered his report on the subject of the [[Ice Age]] in 1876, where he argued that it had taken place in not as distant a past as initially thought.<ref>{{cite book |author=Todes, Daniel Philip|title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195058307|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVskyJh6TgC&pg=PA125}}</ref>

=== Escape and exile ===
In June 1876, just before his trial, Kropotkin was moved to a low-security prison in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped with help from his friends. On the night of the escape, Kropotkin and his friends celebrated by dining in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming correctly that the police would not think to look for them there. After this, he boarded a boat and headed to [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Bell, Jeffrey A.|chapter=Kropotkin, Pyotr|editor=Bell, Jeffrey A.|title=Industrialization and Imperialism, 1800–1914: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780313314513|page=199|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XB6ckxWOq9kC&pg=PA199}}</ref> After a short stay there, he moved to [[Switzerland]] where he joined the Jura Federation. In 1877, he moved to [[Paris]], where he helped start the socialist movement. In 1878, he returned to Switzerland where he edited the Jura Federation's revolutionary newspaper ''Le Révolté'' and published various revolutionary pamphlets.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=417–423}}</ref>

[[File:Kropotkin Nadar.png|thumb|Kropotkin by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]]]
In 1881, shortly after the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Tsar Alexander II]], he was expelled from Switzerland. After a short stay at [[Thonon]] (Savoy), he stayed in [[London]] for nearly a year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|page=440|year=2010 |version=reproduction of 1899 edition|isbn=978-0-486-47316-1}}</ref> He attended the Anarchist Congress in London from 14 July 1881.<ref name=Bantman2006>{{cite journal |page=965|last=Bantman|first=Constance|title=Internationalism without an International?

Kropotkin returned to Thonon in late 1882. Soon he was arrested by the French government, tried at [[Lyon]], and sentenced by a police-court magistrate (under a special law passed on the fall of the [[Paris Commune]]) to five years' imprisonment, on the ground that he had belonged to the IWA (1883). The French Chamber repeatedly agitated on his behalf, and he was released in 1886. He was invited to Britain by [[Henry Seymour (secularist)|Henry Seymour]] and [[Charlotte Wilson]] and all three worked on Seymour's newspaper ''[[The Anarchist]]''. Soon after, Wilson and Kropotkin split from the individualist anarchist Seymour and found the anarchist newspaper ''[[Freedom Press]]'', which continues to this day. Kropotkin was a regular contributor, while Wilson was integral to the administrative and financial running of the paper until she resigned its editorship in 1895. He settled near London, living at various times in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], then [[Bromley]], where his daughter and only child, [[Alexandra Kropotkin|Alexandra]], was born on 15 April 1887.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8z8mdUYp-6gC&pg=PA16 "Alexandra Kropotkin"].

In 1916, Kropotkin and [[Jean Grave]] drafted a document called ''[[Manifesto of the Sixteen]]'', which advocated an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory over Germany and the [[Central Powers]] during the [[First World War]]. Because of the manifesto, Kropotkin found himself isolated by the mainstream<ref>peter marshall, p 332, Demanding the impossible 1993</ref> of the anarchist movement.<ref>''The Palgrave Handbook of Anarchism'', Edited by Carl Levy and Matthew S. Adams, page 404 publication Palgrave Macmillan, 2019</ref>

=== Return to Russia ===
In 1917, after the [[February Revolution]], Kropotkin returned to Russia after 40 years of exile. His arrival was greeted by cheering crowds of tens of thousands of people. He was offered the ministry of education in the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which he promptly refused, feeling that working with them would be a violation of his anarchist principles.<ref>{{cite book |author=Burbank, Jane|title=Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism, 1917–1922|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195045734|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJHHAttsOL4C&pg=PA99}}</ref>

His enthusiasm for the changes occurring in the [[Russian Empire]] expanded when [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. He had this to say about the October Revolution: "During all the activities of the present revolutionary political parties we must never forget that the October movement of the proletariat, which ended in a revolution, has proved to everybody that a social revolution is within the bounds of possibility. And this struggle, which takes place worldwide, has to be supported by all means – all the rest is secondary. The party of the Bolsheviks was right to adopt the old, purely proletarian name of 'Communist Party'. Even if it does not achieve everything that it would like to, it will nevertheless enlighten the path of the civilised countries for at least a century. Its ideas will slowly be adopted by the peoples in the same way as in the nineteenth century the world adopted the ideas of the Great French Revolution. That is the colossal achievement of the October Revolution. [...] I see the October Revolution as an attempt to bring the preceding February Revolution to its logical conclusion with a transition to communism and federalism."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bolshevik.info/meeting-lenin-kropotkin-bonc-brujevic1919.htm | title=A meeting between V.I. Lenin and P. A. Kropotkin}}</ref>

Although he led a life on the margins of the revolutionary upheaval, Kropotkin became increasingly critical of the methods of the Bolshevik dictatorship and went on to express these feelings in writing. "Unhappily, this effort has been made in Russia under a strongly centralized party dictatorship. This effort was made in the same way as the extremely centralized and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] endeavor of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]]. I owe it to you to say frankly that, according to my view, this effort to build a communist republic on the basis of a strongly centralized state communism under the iron law of party dictatorship is bound to end in failure. We are learning to know in Russia how not to introduce communism, even with a people tired of the old regime and opposing no active resistance to the experiments of the new rulers."<ref>{{cite book |title="Letter to the Workers of Western Europe", in Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|year=1970|isbn=9780486225197|page=254}}</ref>

== Philosophy ==
{{anarcho-communism sidebar}}
{{libertarian socialism sidebar}}

=== Critique of capitalism ===
Kropotkin pointed out what he considered to be the fallacies of the [[Economics#Criticisms|economic systems]] of [[feudalism]] and [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalism]]. He believed they create poverty and [[artificial scarcity]], and promote [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. Instead, he proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid, [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual support]], and [[cooperation|voluntary cooperation]]. He argued that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mutualaidafacto00knigoog|title=Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|publisher=McClure, Philips & Company|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|year=1902|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mutualaidafacto00knigoog/page/n247 223]}}</ref>

Kropotkin disagreed in part with the Marxist critique of capitalism, including the [[labour theory of value]], believing there was no necessary link between work performed and the values of commodities. His attack on the institution of wage labour was based more on the power employers exerted over employees, and not only on the extraction of [[surplus value]] from their labour. Kropotkin claimed this power was made possible by the state's protection of private ownership of productive resources.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PoqAJrrYtAC&q=kropotkin+labor+theory&pg=PT18|title=Radical Economics and Labour.

=== Cooperation and competition ===
In 1902, Kropotkin published his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which gave an alternative view of animal and human survival. At the time, some "[[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]]" such as [[Francis Galton]] proffered a theory of interpersonal competition and natural hierarchy. Instead, Kropotkin argued that "it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human".<ref name=Sale>[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (1 July 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ Are Anarchists Revolting?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212113034/http://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ |date=12 December 2010 }}, ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> In the last chapter, he wrote:
{{quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species [...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits [...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development [...] are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.<ref>{{cite book |author = Kropotkin, Peter | title = quotation from ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'' | year = 1902 | url = http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29 }}</ref>}}

Kropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not consider them the driving force of history.<ref name=Gallaher>{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&pg=PA262 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |access-date=31 July 2014}}</ref>{{rp|262}} He believed that seeking out conflict proved to be socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or [[organized religion|the Church]], which he saw as stifling human creativity and impeding human instinctual drive towards cooperation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&pg=PA349}}</ref>

Kropotkin's observations of cooperative tendencies in [[indigenous people]]s (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) led him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition as were those of industrialized Europe, and that many societies exhibited cooperation among individuals and groups as the norm. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government, and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when they died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth, in the form of a [[gift economy]].<ref>Morris, David.

=== Mutual aid ===
[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[French language|French translated]] cover of'' [[The Conquest of Bread]]'', influential work by Kropotkin which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
In his 1892 book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', Kropotkin proposed a system of economics based on mutual exchanges made in a system of voluntary cooperation. He believed that in a society that is socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services it needs, there would be no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange, to prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/conquestbread00kropgoog|title=The Conquest of Bread|publisher=Putnam|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|year=1892|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conquestbread00kropgoog/page/n219 201]}}</ref>

Kropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]] economic model was just a wage system by a different name<ref>Kropotkin wrote: "After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap." (quoted in {{cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&pg=PA211}})</ref> and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labour]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.<ref>{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=The Russian Anarchists|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29|title-link=The Russian Anarchists}}</ref>

According to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], "[w]ith ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of [[communal anarchism]], following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control."<ref name=Sale/>

=== Self-sufficiency ===
Kropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports. To these ends, he advocated [[irrigation]] and [[greenhouse]]s to boost local food production.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFFOCgAAQBAJ&q=Kropotkin+on+self-sufficiency&pg=PA114|title=Kropotkin, Read, and the Intellectual History of British Anarchism: Between Reason and Romanticism|last=Adams|first=Matthew S.|date=4 June 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137392626|language=en}}</ref>
