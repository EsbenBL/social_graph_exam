'''Michel Callon''' (born 1945) is a professor of sociology at the [[École des mines de Paris]] and member of the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]]. He is an author in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]] and one of the leading proponents of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT) with [[Bruno Latour]].

== Recent career ==
In recent years (since the late 1990s), Michel Callon has spearheaded the movement of applying ANT approaches to study economic life (notably economic markets). This body of work interrogates the interrelation between the economy and economics, highlighting the ways in which economics (and economics-inspired disciplines such as marketing) shapes the economy (see Callon, 1998 and 2005).
