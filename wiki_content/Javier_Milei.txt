=== Personal life ===

==Criticism==
It has been pointed out that one important issue is that Milei makes constant use of mathematical formulae and charts throughout his writings to illustrate his points, which clearly contradicts the skeptical Austrian views on the [[Austrian School#Methodology|usage of mathematics in economics]], regarded by them as a social science. This is the main obstacle to frame Milei as an 'Austrian' economist. Although his conceptual framework is decidedly Austrian, his methodology is overall not.<ref>[http://www.novasalta.com/nota.asp?n=2018_7_6&id=1200&id_tiponota=10 Milei disertará en Metán sobre capitalismo y monopolios], ''NOVA Salta'', Retrieved 21 December 2018 {{in lang|es}}</ref>

He has distinguished himself by his sometimes aggressive way of debating and his recurrent use of foul language, leading to several controversies. On 25 August 2021, he insulted the head of the government of the city of Buenos Aires,  [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]], calling him a "fucking leftist", a "bald shit", and saying that he could "crush" him. He justified himself by saying that Horacio Rodríguez Larreta was using "public funds to persecute opponents".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/javier-milei-insulto-horacio-rodriguez-larreta-amenazo-zurdo-mierda-puedo-aplastar-_0_rLUZy3FZq.html|title=Javier Milei insultó a Horacio Rodríguez Larreta y lo amenazó: 'Zurdo de mierda, te puedo aplastar'|date=27 August 2021|website=Clarín}}</ref>'<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/esta-operando-en-mi-contra-javier-milei-explico-por-que-insulto-a-horacio-rodriguez-larreta-nid28082021/|title="Está operando en mi contra": Javier Milei explicó por qué insultó a Horacio Rodríguez Larreta|newspaper=La Nación|date=28 August 2021|via=La Nación (Argentina)}}</ref>
