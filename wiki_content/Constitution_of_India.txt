==Background==
[[File:Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, chairman of the Drafting Committee, presenting the final draft of the Indian Constitution to Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 25 November, 1949.jpg|thumb|alt=A smiling Babasaheb Ambedkar and Rajendra Prasad|upright=1.2|[[Babasaheb Ambedkar]], chairman of the drafting committee, presenting the final draft of the Indian constitution to Constituent Assembly president [[Rajendra Prasad]] on 25 November 1949]]
In 1928, the [[All Parties Conference]] convened a committee in [[Lucknow]] to prepare the Constitution of India, which was known as the [[Nehru Report]].<ref name="ElsterGargarellaNareshRasch2018">{{cite book |last1=Elster |first1=Jon |last2=Gargarella |first2=Roberto |last3=Naresh |first3=Vatsal |last4=Rasch |first4=Bjørn Erik |title=Constituent Assemblies |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42752-4 |page=64 |language=en|quote=Nevertheless, partition increased the dominance of the Congress Party in the constituent assembly, which in turn made it easier for its leadership to incorporate in the constitution elements of its vision of Indian unity. This vision was based on a decades-long period of Congress-led consultation concerning the future independent constitution. More importantly, it rested on a detailed draft constitution adopted in 1928 by the All Parties Conference that met in Lucknow. The draft, known as the "Nehru Report," was written by a seven-member committee, chaired by Motilal Nehru. ... The committee was appointed during the May 1928 meeting of the All Parties Conference, which included representatives of all the major political organizations in India, including the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, the All-India Muslim League, the All-India Liberal Federation, the States' Peoples Conference, The Central Khalifat Committee, the All-India Conference of Indian Christians, and others.}}</ref>

Most of the [[colonial India]] was under [[British Raj|British rule]] from 1857 to 1947. From 1947 to 1950, the same legislation continued to be implemented as India was a [[Dominion of India|dominion]] of Britain for these three years, as each princely state was convinced by [[Sardar Patel]] and [[V. P. Menon|V.P.Menon]] to sign the [[Political integration of India|articles of integration]] with India, and the British government continued to be responsible for the external security of the country.<ref name="menon">{{cite book |last1=Menon |first1=V.P. |title=The story of the integration of the India states |date=15 September 1955 |publisher=Longman Greens and Co |location=Bangalore }}</ref> Thus, the constitution of India repealed the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] and [[Government of India Act 1935]] when it became effective on 26 January 1950. India ceased to be a [[dominion]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]] and became a sovereign democratic republic with the constitution. Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391, 392, 393, and 394 of the constitution came into force on 26 November 1949, and the remaining articles became effective on 26 January 1950.<ref name=cameintoforce>{{cite web | url = http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p22394.html | title = Commencement | access-date = 20 February 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150220131327/http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p22394.html | archive-date = 20 February 2015 | url-status = live }}</ref>

==={{anchor|Previous legislation used as sources}}Previous legislation===
The constitution was drawn from a number of sources. Mindful of India's needs and conditions, its framers borrowed features of previous legislation such as the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the [[Indian Councils Act 1861|Indian Councils Acts of 1861]], [[Indian Councils Act 1892|1892]] and [[Indian Councils Act 1909|1909]], the Government of India Acts [[Government of India Act 1919|1919]] and [[Government of India Act 1935|1935]], and the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]]. The latter, which led to the creation of India and [[Pakistan]], divided the former Constituent Assembly in two. The Amendment act of 1935 is also a very important step for making the constitution for two new born countries. Each new assembly had sovereign power to draft and enact a new constitution for the separate states.<ref name=":3" />

I am aware of the amount of work and enthusiasm that he has brought to bear on the work of drafting this Constitution. At the same time, I do realise that that amount of attention that was necessary for the purpose of drafting a constitution so important to us at this moment has not been given to it by the Drafting Committee. The House is perhaps aware that of the seven members nominated by you, one had resigned from the House and was replaced. One died and was not replaced. One was away in America and his place was not filled up and another person was engaged in State affairs, and there was a void to that extent. One or two people were far away from Delhi and perhaps reasons of health did not permit them to attend. So it happened ultimately that the burden of drafting this constitution fell on Dr. Ambedkar and I have no doubt that we are grateful to him for having achieved this task in a manner which is undoubtedly commendable."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ambedkar-constitution-narendra-modi-govt-2851111/|title=Denying Ambedkar his due|date=14 June 2016|access-date=6 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331065443/https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ambedkar-constitution-narendra-modi-govt-2851111/|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://164.100.47.194/loksabha/writereaddata/cadebatefiles/C05111948.html|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates|website=164.100.47.194|access-date=6 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107124534/http://164.100.47.194/loksabha/writereaddata/cadebatefiles/C05111948.html|archive-date=7 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

* Under Articles 52 and 53: the [[president of India]] is head of the executive branch
* Under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 60]]: the duty of preserving, protecting, and defending the constitution and the law.
* Under [[Article 74 (Constitution of India)|Article 74]]: the [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] is the head of the [[Union Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]], which aids and advises the president in the performance of their constitutional duties.
* Under Article 75(3): the Council of Ministers is answerable to the [[Lok Sabha|lower house]].

The constitution is considered [[Federalism|federal]] in nature, and [[Unitary state|unitary]] in spirit. It has features of a federation, including a [[codified constitution|codified]], supreme constitution; a three-tier governmental structure (central, state and local); [[separation of powers|division of powers]]; [[bicameralism]]; and an independent [[Judiciary of India|judiciary]]. It also possesses unitary features such as a single constitution, single [[Indian nationality law|citizenship]], an integrated judiciary, a flexible constitution, a strong [[Government of India|central government]], appointment of [[Governor (Indian states)|state governors]] by the central government, [[All India Services]] (the [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]], [[Indian Forest Service|IFS]] and [[Indian Police Service|IPS]]), and [[Emergency provisions of the Constitution of India|emergency provisions]]. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form.<ref>{{cite book|author1=M Laxmikanth|title=Indian Polity|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|isbn=978-1-25-906412-8|page=3.2|edition=4th|chapter=3|year=2013}}</ref>

Each state and [[union territory]] has its own government. Analogous to the president and prime minister, each has a [[Governor (Indian states)|governor]] or (in union territories) a [[Lieutenant Governor (India)|lieutenant governor]] and a [[Chief Minister (India)|chief minister]]. [[s:Constitution of India/Part XVIII|Article 356]] permits the president to dismiss a state government and assume direct authority if a situation arises in which state government cannot be conducted in accordance with constitution.

Certain amendments pertaining to the constitution's federal nature must also be ratified by a majority of state legislatures.

Unlike ordinary bills in accordance with [[s:Constitution of India/Part XI|Article 245]] (except for [[money bill]]s), there is no provision for a joint session of the [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]] to pass a constitutional amendment. During a parliamentary recess, the president cannot promulgate [[Ordinance (India)|ordinances]] under his legislative powers under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 123, Chapter III]].

In 2000, the [[National Commission to review the working of the Constitution|Justice Manepalli Narayana Rao Venkatachaliah Commission]] was formed to examine a constitutional update.

{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}
In ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala]]'', the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] ruled that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to modify; it cannot tinker with the constitution's basic structure or framework, which are immutable. Such an amendment will be declared invalid, although no part of the constitution is protected from amendment; the basic structure doctrine does not protect any one provision of the constitution. According to the doctrine, the constitution's basic features (when "read as a whole") cannot be abridged or abolished. These "basic features" have not been fully defined,<ref name="MadhavaMenon"/> and whether a particular provision of the constitution is a "basic feature" is decided by the courts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dhamija|first1=Dr. Ashok|title=Need to Amend a Constitution and Doctrine of Basic Features|date=2007|publisher=Wadhwa and Company|isbn=9788180382536|pages=568|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHxUPgAACAAJ&q=ashok+dhamija|access-date=17 June 2014}}</ref>

The ''Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala'' decision laid down the constitution's basic structure:<ref name=structure/>

# Republican, democratic form of government
# Its secular nature
# Separation of powers
# Its federal character<ref name=structure>{{Cite web|title = Doctrine of Basic Structure{{snd}}Constitutional Law|url = http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/thyg.htm|website = www.legalserviceindia.com|access-date = 26 January 2016|last = aDvantage|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160321214815/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/thyg.htm|archive-date = 21 March 2016|url-status = live}}</ref>

This implies that Parliament can only amend the constitution to the limit of its basic structure. The Supreme Court or a [[List of high courts in India|high court]] may declare the amendment null and void if this is violated, after a [[Judicial review in India|judicial review]]. This is typical of parliamentary governments, where the judiciary checks parliamentary power.

[[Judicial review]] was adopted by the constitution of India from [[judicial review in the United States]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Venkatesan|first=V.|date=10-23 March 2012|title=Three doctrines|url=https://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2905/stories/20120323290507900.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|volume=29|issue=5|issn=0970-1710|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613062951/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2905/stories/20120323290507900.htm|archive-date=13 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In the Indian constitution, [[Judicial review in India|judicial review]] is dealt with in [[s:Constitution of India/Part III|Article 13]]. The constitution is the supreme power of the nation, and governs all laws. According to '''Article 13''':

# All pre-constitutional laws, if they conflict wholly or in part with the constitution, shall have all conflicting provisions deemed ineffective until an amendment to the constitution ends the conflict; the law will again come into force if it is compatible with the constitution as amended (the Doctrine of Eclipse).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Constitutional Law|last=Jain|first=Mahabir Prashad|publisher=LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur|year=2010|isbn=978-81-8038-621-3|edition=6th|location=[[Gurgaon]]|pages=921|oclc=650215045}}</ref>
# Laws made after the adoption of the constitution must be compatible with it, or they will be deemed void ''[[ab initio]]''.
# In such situations, the Supreme Court (or a high court) determines if a law is in conformity with the constitution. If such an interpretation is not possible because of inconsistency (and where separation is possible), the provision which is inconsistent with the constitution is considered void. In addition to Article 13, Articles 32, 226 and 227 provide the constitutional basis for judicial review.<ref>Lectures By Professor Parmanad Singh, Jindal Global Law School.</ref>

Due to the adoption of the [[Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of India|Thirty-eighth Amendment]], the Supreme Court was not allowed to preside over any laws adopted during a state of emergency which infringe [[fundamental rights]] under article 32 (the right to constitutional remedies).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutional Identity|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalid00jaco|url-access=limited|last=Jacobsohn|first=Gary|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0674047662|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalid00jaco/page/n77 57]|oclc=939085793}}</ref> The [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]] widened Article 31C and added Articles 368(4) and 368(5), stating that any law passed by Parliament could not be challenged in court.
