== Model Parliament ==
Dyck was responsible for the creation of the Laurentian University [[Model parliament|Model Parliament]], or (LMP), in 1993.<ref name=few>{{cite web|url=https://laurentian.ca/faculty/arts/few-remarkable-people|title=A Few Remarkable People|website=Laurentian University|accessdate=24 June 2020}}</ref> Since that time, the LMP has been organized by the Laurentian University Political Science Association. In previous years, participants to the LMP have included Laurentian students, as well as those at the [[Georgian College]] University Partnership Centre campuses in [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]] and [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]]; and students from Laurentian's affiliate, [[Algoma University College]] in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]].

The LMP meets every January. Past LMP [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] debated at the annual session have dealt with such topics as: the role of the [[Federation|federal]] government in education and training; promoting sexual education in Canada; increasing the budget of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Radio-Canada]]; forgiving outstanding student loans; creating a national registry of sex offenders; creating an [[Triple-E Senate|elected Senate]]; reinstating capital punishment; reforming the correctional system by transferring some of its functions to the Canadian Department of National Defence; using toll booth revenues in the [[province]] of [[Quebec]] to fund the teaching of [[French language|French]] to [[English-speaking Quebecker|Anglophones]] in Quebec; and abolishing the [[monarchy]] in Canada.

Since 1998, this event has been held in the legislative chamber of the Canadian House of Commons.<ref name=few/> In addition to the use of the legislative chamber, the House of Commons generously provides the services of simultaneous [[Interpreting|interpreters]], [[microphone]] operators, pages, and rooms for caucus meetings.
