== Biography ==

===Youth and education===
Rifkin was born in [[Denver, Colorado]], to Vivette Ravel Rifkin, daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants to [[Texas]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-08-15/news/0708140775_1_books-blind-started|title=Vivette R. Rifkin: 1911 – 2007|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune | date=August 15, 2007}}</ref> and Milton Rifkin, a plastic-bag manufacturer. He grew up on the southwest side of Chicago. He was president of the graduating class of 1967 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a bachelor of science degree in economics at the [[Wharton School]] of Finance and Commerce. Rifkin was also the recipient of the University of Pennsylvania's General Alumni Association's Award of Merit 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foet.org/img/University%20Of%20Pennsylvania%20Student%20Award%20of%20Mert.jpg |title=The University of Pennsylvania Student Award of Merit |publisher=Foet.org |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325193639/http://foet.org/img/University%20Of%20Pennsylvania%20Student%20Award%20of%20Mert.jpg |archive-date=March 25, 2012  }}</ref>

He had an epiphany when one day in 1967 he walked past a group of students protesting the [[Vietnam War]] and picketing the administration building and was amazed to see, as he recalls, that "my frat friends were beating the living daylights out of them. I got very upset." He organized a freedom-of-speech rally the next day. From then on, Rifkin quickly became an active member of the [[Vietnam War protests|peace movement]]. He attended the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] (MA, International Affairs, 1968) where he continued anti-war activities. Later he joined [[Volunteers in Service to America]] (VISTA).

===1970s===
In 1970, Rifkin founded the [[People's Bicentennial Commission]] to provide "revolutionary alternatives for the Bicentennial years.".<ref name="Daly">{{cite news|last=Daly|first=Christopher|title=The Peoples Bicentennial Commission: Slouching Towards the Economic Revolution|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/4/28/the-peoples-bicentennial-commission-pif-you|access-date=January 16, 2021|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=April 28, 1975}}</ref> The [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] was the official U.S. celebration of the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the events leading up to it.

In 1973, Rifkin organized a mass protest against oil companies at the commemoration of the 200th Anniversary of the [[Boston Tea Party]] at Boston Harbor. Thousands joined the protest, as activists dumped empty oil barrels into Boston Harbor. The protest came in the wake of the increase in gasoline prices in the fall of 1973, following the [[OPEC]] oil embargo.<ref name="Trillin">{{cite news|last=Trillin|first=Calvin|title=U.S. Journal: Boston Parallels|url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/1974/01/21/1974_01_21_067_TNY_CARDS_000305675|access-date=April 3, 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=January 21, 1974}}</ref> Later, this was called a "Boston Oil Party" by the press.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/01/21/u-s-journal-boston-parallels|title=U.S. JOURNAL: BOSTON PARALLELS|first=Condé|last=Nast|date=January 13, 1974|magazine=The New Yorker}}</ref>

In 1977, with [[Ted Howard (author)|Ted Howard]], he founded the Foundation on Economic Trends (FOET), which is active in both national and international public policy issues related to the environment, the economy, and climate change. FOET examines new trends and their effects on the environment, the economy, culture, and society, and it engages in litigation, public education, coalition building, and grassroots organizing activities to advance their goals. Rifkin became one of the first major critics of the nascent [[biotechnology]] industry with the 1977 publication of his book, ''Who Should Play God?''<ref>{{cite book|last=Rifkin|first=Jeremy|title=Who Should Play God? The Artificial Creation of Life and What it Means for the Future of the Human Race (with Ted Howard)|year=1977|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-440-19504-7|url=https://archive.org/details/whoshouldplaygod00howa}}</ref>

In 1978, Jeremy Rifkin and Randy Barber co-authored the book The North Will Rise Again: Pensions, Politics, and Power in the 1980s. The book and subsequent activist engagement by the authors with the American Labor Union movement, the financial community, and civil society organizations helped spawn the era of socially responsible investment of public and union pension funds in America. An article on socially responsible investment in the New York University Review of Law and Social Change noted that "the idea of socially responsible investing, long a concern of only special interest groups, achieved widespread attention in 1978 with the publication of Jeremy Rifkin and Randy Barber's The North Will Rise Again."<ref>https://socialchangenyu.com/review/socially-responsible-investment-of-public-pension-funds-the-south-africa-issue-and-state-law/</ref> The book helped lay the early groundwork for what later would evolve into the principles of environment, society, and governance (ESG) standards in investments.<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.4179/NLF.191.0000012</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25075236</ref>

===1980s===
Rifkin's 1980 book, ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', discusses how the physical concept of [[entropy]] applies to nuclear and solar energy, urban decay, military activity, education, agriculture, health, economics, and politics. It was called "A comprehensive worldview" and "an appropriate successor to... ''[[Silent Spring]]'', ''The Closing Circle'', ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''" by the ''Minneapolis Tribune''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foet.org/books/entropy.html |title=Jeremy Rifkin &#124; The Foundation on Economic Trends &#124; Books |publisher=Foet.org |access-date=February 10, 2012}}</ref> Rifkin's work was heavily influenced by the ideas expressed by [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] in his 1971 book ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process''. In Rifkin's 1989 revised edition of ''Entropy:...'', entitled ''Entropy: Into the Greenhouse World'', its "afterword" was written by Georgescu-Roegen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rifkin|first1=Jeremy|last2=Howard|first2=Ted|title=Entropy: Into the Greenhouse World|url=https://archive.org/details/entropyintogreen00rifk|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0553347173|publisher=Bantam Books|access-date=December 6, 2017|date=1989}}</ref>

In 1980, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of granting a patent on the first genetically engineered life form with 5 justices favoring the patent and 4 justices opposed. Jeremy Rifkin's office - The People's Business Commission - provided an amicus curiae brief in support of the US Patent and Trademark Office, arguing that extending patents to genetically-engineered organisms was not covered by US patent law. Speaking on behalf of the majority opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger referred to the petitioners' briefs as "the gruesome parade of horribles" and argued that "the relevant distinction was not between living and inanimate things, but between products of nature, whether living or not, and human-made inventions". Speaking for the minority opinion, Justice William Brennan argued that "it is the role of Congress, not this court, to broaden or narrow the reach of patent laws" and further suggested that "the composition [the genetically engineered micro-organism] sought to be patented uniquely implicates matters of public concern". <ref>https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/447/303.html#t*</ref> <ref>https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/303/</ref>

On May 16th, 1984, Federal District Judge John J. Sirica issued a ruling halting an experiment that would have involved the "first deliberate release into the environment of organisms altered by gene splicing". The court suit was brought by Jeremy Rifkin, the President of the Washington DC-based Foundation on Economic Trends. The plaintiff argued that the National Institutes of Health had violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to undergo an assessment of the potential risks and impacts of releasing the genetically engineered organism into the environment before "giving the testing a green light". The Journal Science recorded that the ruling "stunned most observers". In his ruling, Judge Sirica said that Rifkin and his legal counsel "had made a satisfactory showing that they are likely to succeed" in their lawsuit. In the meantime, Science reported that Judge Sirica told NIH "not to approve any more experiments by academic researchers involving release of modified organisms". The court ruling was credited with beginning the process of how to regulate the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment in the United States and governments around the world. <ref>https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.6719128</ref>

In 1989, Rifkin brought together climate scientists and environmental activists from 35 nations in Washington, D.C. for the first meeting of the Global Greenhouse Network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/4559-1 |title=The Global Greenhouse Network – C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=October 10, 1988 |access-date=February 10, 2012}}</ref> In the same year, Rifkin did a series of Hollywood lectures on global warming and related environmental issues for a diverse assortment of film, television, and music industry leaders,{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} with the goal of organizing the Hollywood community for a campaign. Shortly thereafter, two Hollywood environmental organizations, Earth Communications Office (ECO) and [[Environmental Media Association]], were formed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brownstein|first=Ronald|title=Hollywood Hardball|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/mother%20jones/904Y-000-007.html|publisher=Mother Jones|date=January–February 1991|access-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref>

Also in 1989 Rifkin with a group of environmentalists attempted to prevent launch of NASA rocket that was expected to lift Galileo space probe, claiming it carried a "very high risk" of explosion and "spraying deadly plutonium" over the territory of USA. The lawsuit was eventually rejected and the Galileo mission succeeded.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Leary|first1=Warren E.|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|date=October 11, 1989|title=JUDGE REJECTS BAN ON NASA LAUNCHING (Published 1989)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/us/judge-rejects-ban-on-nasa-launching.html|access-date=February 19, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===1990s===
In 1992, Rifkin published the book Beyond Beef. In its review, the Washington Post praised the book for its "fresh thinking and well-reasoned arguments...[and for] combining reliable research with logical conclusions", noting that "[Rifkin] offers enough economic, medical, environmental, and ethical arguments to persuade any open minded person to pass by the meat (en)counter.” <ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1992/05/31/the-high-price-of-hamburger/35fa5a97-3368-40ba-8b50-8e0c3d6a1102/</ref>

In 1993, Rifkin launched the Beyond Beef Campaign, a coalition of six environmental groups including [[Greenpeace]], [[Rainforest Action Network]], and [[Public Citizen]], with the goal of encouraging a 50% reduction in the consumption of beef, arguing that [[methane emissions]] from cattle has a warming effect 23 times greater than carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Takahashi, Young|first=Takahashi, Bruce, A.|title=Greenhouse Gases and Animal Agriculture|year=2002|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-444-51012-9|page=372}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Burros|first=Marian|title=Agriculture Dept.

His 1995 book, ''[[The End of Work]]'', is credited by some with helping shape the current global debate on [[automation]], technology displacement, corporate [[Layoff|downsizing]], and the future of jobs. Reporting on the growing controversy over automation and technology displacement in 2011, ''[[The Economist]]'' pointed out that Rifkin drew attention to the trend back in 1996 with the publication of his book, ''The End of Work''. Then ''The Economist'' asked "what happens... when machines are smart enough to become workers? In other words, when capital becomes labor." ''The Economist'' noted that "this is what Jeremy Rifkin, a social critic, was driving at in his book, "The End of Work," published in 1996... Mr. Rifkin argued prophetically that society was entering a new phase, one in which fewer and fewer workers would be needed to produce all the goods and services consumed. 'In the years ahead,' he wrote, 'more sophisticated software technologies are going to bring civilization ever closer to a near-workerless world. The process has already begun."<ref>{{cite news|last=V|first=N|title=Difference Engine: Luddite legacy|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/11/artificial-intelligence|access-date=April 2, 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

His 1998 book, ''The Biotech Century'', addresses issues accompanying the new era of genetic commerce. In its review of the book, the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' observed that "Rifkin does his best work in drawing attention to the growing inventory of real and potential dangers and the ethical conundrums raised by genetic technologies... At a time when scientific institutions are struggling with the public understanding of science, there is much they can learn from Rifkin's success as a public communicator of scientific and technological trends."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krimsky|first=Sheldon|title=All Aboard The Biotech Express|journal=Nature|date=May 7, 1998|volume=393|issue=6680|pages=31–32|doi=10.1038/29911|bibcode=1998Natur.393...31K|s2cid=2483198|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In ''The Biotech Century'', Rifkin argues that 'Genetic engineering represents the ultimate tool.' 'With genetic technology we assume control over the hereditary blueprints of life itself. Can any reasonable person believe for a moment that such unprecedented power is without substantial risk?'<ref>Rifkin, Jeremy, ''The Biotech Century'': the coming age of Genetic Commerce (London, 1998), p. 36.</ref> Some of the changes he highlights are: replication partially replacing reproduction; and 'Genetically customized and mass-produced animal clones could be used as chemical factories to secrete—in their blood and milk—large volumes of inexpensive chemicals and drugs for human use.'<ref>Rifkin, Jeremy, ''The Biotech Century'': the coming age of Genetic Commerce (London, 1998), p. 2</ref>

Rifkin's work in the biological sciences includes advocacy of [[animal rights]] and animal protection around the world.<ref>Rifkin, Jeremy, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/16/animalwelfare.world “Man and Other Animals: Our Fellow Creatures Have Feelings – So We Should Give Them Rights Too,” in ''The Guardian'' (16 August 2003)].</ref><ref>Rifkin, Jeremy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vep0YbndO14 Video for the Stop Vivisection campaign (10 July 2013)].

===2000s===
Rifkin's book, ''The Age of Access'', published in the year 2000, was the first to introduce the concept that society is beginning to move from ownership of property in markets, to access to services in networks, giving rise to the ''Sharing Economy''. According to the Journal of Consumer Research, "the phenomenon of access was first documented in the popular business press by Rifkin (2000), who primarily examines the business-to-business sector and argues that we are living in an age of access in which property regimes have changed to access regimes characterized by short-term limited use of assets controlled by networks of suppliers."<ref>https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/203789/Access-Based-Consumption.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.uu.nl/en/file/21381/download?token=yV2nHJUn.</ref>

Rifkin published the book The Hydrogen Economy: The Creation of the Worldwide Energy Web and the Redistribution of Power on Earth in 2002. That same year, Mr. Rifkin, who at the time served as an advisor to Romano Prodi, then President of the European Commission, developed a strategic white paper committing the European Union to a multi-billion Euro research and development plan that would transform the EU into a green hydrogen economic paradigm. Mr. Rifkin joined President Prodi at an EU Commission conference in October 2002 to announce "a coordinated long-term plan for Europe to make the transition from fossil-fuel dependency to become the first “hydrogen economy” superpower of the 21st century".<ref name="power-eng.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-eng.com/coal/the-european-union-becomes-the-first-superpower-to-announce-a-plan-to-become-a-hydrogen-economy/|title=The European Union becomes the first superpower to announce a plan to become a 'hydrogen economy'|date=October 25, 2002}}</ref> President Prodi remarked that the EU hydrogen R&D initiative would be as significant for the future of Europe as the space program was for the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="power-eng.com"/>

After the publication of ''The Hydrogen Economy'' (2002), Rifkin worked both in the U.S. and Europe to advance the political cause of renewably generated hydrogen. In the U.S., Rifkin was instrumental in founding the Green Hydrogen Coalition, consisting of thirteen environmental and political organizations (including [[Greenpeace]] and [[MoveOn.org]]) that are committed to building a [[Hydrogen economy|renewable hydrogen-based economy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/cmep/article_redirect.cfm?ID=10703 |title=Public Citizen Climate and Energy |publisher=Citizen.org |date=December 3, 2010 |access-date=February 10, 2012}}</ref>

His 2004 book, ''[[The European Dream]]'', was an international bestseller and winner of the 2005 [[Corine Literature Prize|Corine International Book Prize]] in Germany for the best economics book of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Books: European Dream|url=http://www.foet.org/books/european-dream.html|publisher=Foet.org|access-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Winners|url=http://www.corine.de/chronik/index.php|publisher=Corine Internationaler Buchpreis|access-date=April 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201013/http://www.corine.de/chronik/index.php|archive-date=October 29, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In its review of the book, BusinessWeek noted that "Rifkin makes a compelling case for [the European] vision, which he says is usurping the American Dream as a global ideal … a fascinating study of the differences between the American and European psyches."<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2004-09-12/nice-dream-if-you-can-live-it</ref>

In 2009, Jeremy Rifkin authored The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis. In her review of the book in the HuffPost book club, Ariana Huffington said "I have chosen a big book -- both figuratively and literally. Jeremy Rifkin's The Empathic Civilization clocks in at close to 700 pages and sets out to present nothing less than -- as Rifkin puts it -- "a new rendering of human history and the meaning of human existence"...As he does in all of his work, Rifkin really swings for the fences in The Empathic Civilization, challenging us all to rise above the clutter of our daily lives, and explore life's larger questions. He is that rare breed, one whose disappearance is often and rightly bemoaned: a public intellectual...a brilliant read and offering a vitally important perspective".<ref>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/only-empathy-can-save-us_b_447685</ref>

===2011–2012===
In 2011, Rifkin published ''[[The Third Industrial Revolution (book)|The Third Industrial Revolution; How Lateral Power is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World]]''. The book was a ''New York Times'' best-seller,<ref>{{cite news|title=Best Sellers – October 23, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-10-23/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 5, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}</ref> and has been translated into 19 languages. By 2014, approximately 500,000 copies were in print in China alone.

Rifkin delivered a keynote address at the Global Green Summit 2012 on May 10, 2012.

In September 2019, Rifkin published ''The Green New Deal: Why the Fossil Fuel Civilization will Collapse by 2028, and the Bold Economic Plan to Save Life on Earth''. In its review of the book, ''Forbes'' noted that "[Jeremy Rifkin] is a principal architect of the European Union’s long-term economic vision, Smart Europe, and a key advisor to China's Third Industrial Revolution vision... His new book, The Green New Deal, is essentially an attempt to rouse the United States from its slumber within a collapsing 20th century fossil fuel era."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Araya |first1=Daniel |title=The Green New Deal: Jeremy Rifkin And The Coming Collapse |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielaraya/2019/10/08/the-green-new-deal-jeremy-rifkin-and-the-coming-collapse/ |website=Forbes |access-date=June 23, 2021 |language=en |date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>

=== 2021 ===
Jeremy Rifkin and TIR Consulting Group, LLC and partners published a $16 trillion twenty-year America 3.0 Resilient Infrastructure plan prepared for Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer and first released by Bloomberg on July 29 in an article entitled "Energy Guru is Beyond Disappointed with Dwindling US Infrastructure Plan".

The America 3.0 infrastructure transformation 2022-2042 details a massive investment to scale, deploy, and manage a smart digital zero-emission Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure for a 21st century economy. The plan will create an average of 15 to 22 million net new jobs over the period 2022 to 2042. For every dollar invested, it is projected to return $2.9 dollars in GDP between 2022 and 2042.<ref>https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001z8SLP9l30-t05Ic_IjE7NL327ofIGUWyXs4GmKodCWFHglyHHEaclvIwHV87GKZULGIy0iYoLQxQLWnGg4GMTvsXJj-P3s14WGkany_QjOSs5DWi9TpSmo993tiae0PXYzo7xWFOQenAaJVqa-4zOFy0HXC8OA-VtM75tD8x969Vj_Dl1XmcAeT-_t67Yd0L9KgLFDNc7v6LEeLdOPzcf-lZfdF3lneSSNd0t1bRFUkLob00CXriG1Si3EeNnlBJFXQb0kgR5ew=&c=XRZT9LW4IqQT9unE9-K-xLw6sPqDYqCFTLwdPK-70i9-qnqmtyU-lA==&ch=OldsAdQrMsek2D0BclpuDVkhAma3jTCRIEeojmCDkJ9Nhy0mP7C6Gg==</ref>

The Bloomberg article noted that "For almost two decades the U.S. author and climate activist Jeremy Rifkin has advised governments in Europe and China on how to retool their economies for what he calls a third industrial revolution."<ref>https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001z8SLP9l30-t05Ic_IjE7NL327ofIGUWyXs4GmKodCWFHglyHHEaclvIwHV87GKZUaXusxKyDLe0vf_gQQj0ZYu1-44OmuYLrnj6zjFW_BdBoLaPnasPlZEYjviPW_pIt55bDkJrhFphLyerZrYvbk_8F8JIAskEXYvTYel0obgF_eQnCrBU4-3W5t4bfOQrSzOmAAaceNLxQ-l8j6WB6GL-_pkFcsVN7rER4HGrFHnbd2z70InDMo1X7d-izGct___gkDJTxHgIVWNy8b75AjsEMVkiAWTL1wEVsNA7y2aw=&c=XRZT9LW4IqQT9unE9-K-xLw6sPqDYqCFTLwdPK-70i9-qnqmtyU-lA==&ch=OldsAdQrMsek2D0BclpuDVkhAma3jTCRIEeojmCDkJ9Nhy0mP7C6Gg==</ref>

Commenting on the release of the 3.0 Resilient Infrastructure deployment plan, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said that the Rifkin blueprint "underscores the need to pass big, bold solutions to address climate change through investments in our infrastructure”.

Bloomberg reported that "at a 2015 United Nations conference, President Xi Jinping proposed Rifkin’s vision of a global, integrated “energy internet.” Language and ideas from Rifkin’s books marked the government’s two five-year economic plans since. When the industry ministry launched a Digital Silk Road to accompany China’s Belt and Road Initiative, he was drafted to write the foreword."

Jeremy Rifkin provided the economic and environmental commentary in the fifth and final episode of the BBC documentary series Perfect Planet starring Sir David Attenborough. <ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/attenborough-presents-perfect-planet</ref>

== Reception ==
According to The ''European Energy Review'', "Perhaps no other author or thinker has had more influence on the EU's ambitious [[climate and energy]] policy than the famous American 'visionary' Jeremy Rifkin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foet.org/press/interviews/EuropeanEnergyReview06-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002055/http://foet.org/press/interviews/EuropeanEnergyReview06-08.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the United States, he has testified before numerous congressional committees and has had success in litigation to ensure responsible government policies on a variety of environmental, scientific and technology related issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vjolt.net/vol5/issue2/v5i2a5-Naik.html#3b2 |title=Biotechnology Through the Eyes of an Opponent |publisher=Virginia Journal of Law and Technology Association |last=Naik |first=Paul |date=Spring 2000 |access-date=March 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312060718/http://www.vjolt.net/vol5/issue2/v5i2a5-Naik.html#3b2 |archive-date=March 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] has cited some of Rifkin's publications as useful references for consumers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/ucs/cg-chapter-1.pdf |title=The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices |year=1999 |access-date=March 30, 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115129/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/ucs/cg-chapter-1.pdf |archive-date=May 11, 2011 }}</ref> and ''The [[New York Times]]'' once stated that "others in the scholarly, religious, and political fields praise Jeremy Rifkin for a willingness to think big, raise controversial questions, and serve as a social and ethical prophet"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/11/us/working-profile-jeremy-rifkin-an-activist-takes-on-genetic-engineering.html|title=AN ACTIVIST TAKES ON GENETIC ENGINEERING|date=April 11, 1984|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Rifkin's work is controversial due to a lack of scientific rigor in his claims as well as some of the tactics he has used to promote his views. These include claims that the theory of evolution is a product of "19th century industrial capitalism" and frequent use of the [[Straw man|strawman]] fallacy.<ref name=":0" />

{{Quote|text=I regard Algeny as a cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda masquerading as scholarship. Among books promoted as serious intellectual statements by important thinkers, I don't think I have ever read a shoddier work. Damned shame, too, because the deep issue is troubling and I do not disagree with Rifkin's basic pleas for respecting the integrity of evolutionary lineages. But devious means compromise good ends, and we shall have to save Rifkin's humane conclusion from his own lamentable tactics.|author=[[Stephen Jay Gould]]|source="Integrity and Mr. Rifkin", ''Discover Magazine'', January 1985; reprinted in Gould's essay collection ''An Urchin in the Storm'', 1987, Penguin Books, p. 230}}
