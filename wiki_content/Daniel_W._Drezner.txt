==Education==
Drezner graduated from [[Williams College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in political economy in 1990. He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] degree from [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/Fletcher_Directory/Directory/Faculty%20Profile?personkey=BA36790F-937D-4738-9D89-C52D444E9993 |title=Faculty Profile Tufts Fletcher School |publisher=Fletcher.tufts.edu |access-date=2013-04-25}}</ref><ref name="WashPost Profile">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/daniel-w-drezner/|title=Washington Post: Daniel Drezner|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Stephen D.

==Political views==
Drezner rarely discusses his political loyalties, but in 2011 he wrote: "I find liberals write 'even conservative Dan Drezner...' while conservatives often deploy terms like 'academic elitist' or '[[RINO]].' In my case, at this point in time, I believe that last appellation to be entirely fair and accurate. I'm not a Democrat, and I don't think I've become more liberal over time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/11/27/hi_my_names_dan_and_im_a_rino|title=Hi, my name's Dan, and I'm a RINO | publisher=foreignpolicy.com/ |date=2011-11-27 |access-date=2013-11-18}}</ref>

Drezner supported the [[Iraq War|2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]], writing that "a successful invasion not only eliminates the Iraqi threat, but over the long run it reduces the Arab resentment that feeds Al-Qaeda."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/000580.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112225128/http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/000580.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-01-12|title= Responding to the Realists}}</ref>

Drezner was a signatory to a March 2016 open letter by Republican [[National security#United States|national security]] community members that opposed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for U.S. President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/|title=Open Letter on Donald Trump from GOP National Security Leaders}}</ref> Drezner announced in July 2017 that he is no longer part of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/dandrezner/status/883110458361884673|title=Not a Republican as of November 2016.}}</ref>
In October 2017, he recommended resignation to Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/10/18/the-sooner-rex-tillerson-resigns-as-secretary-of-state-the-better/?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-f%3Ahomepage%2Fstory ''The sooner Rex Tillerson resigns as secretary of state the better''] (October 18, 2017)</ref>

==Books and commentary==
Drezner has published columns, essays, and [[op-ed]]s in many media outlets, including ''[[The New Republic]]'',<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/authors/daniel-w-drezner Author: Daniel W. Drezner], ''The New Republic''</ref> ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/author/daniel-w-drezner/index.html |title=Daniel W.

He has also been a frequent guest on [[Bloggingheads.tv]] and various other broadcast media. He originally blogged on his website, DanielDrezner.com, but moved in January 2009 to become a contributing blogger at ForeignPolicy.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com |title=Daniel W. Drezner &#124; FOREIGN POLICY |publisher=Drezner.foreignpolicy.com |access-date=2013-04-25}}</ref>  Drezner then moved to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2014/04/28/amanda-erickson-and-dan-drezner-join-the-posts-digital-opinion-venture/|title=Amanda Erickson and Dan Drezner join The Post's digital opinion venture|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-11}}</ref> He has moderated and spoken at various [[Council on Foreign Relations]] events.<ref>[http://www.cfr.org/staff/b5471 Daniel W. Drezner Professor of International Politics, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University], Council on Foreign Relations.</ref>

Drezner's 2007 book, ''All Politics Is Global: Explaining International Regulatory Regimes'', looked at international [[economic regulations]] and concluded that these were under the control of the most wealthy and powerful nations, as they had been in the past. [[G. John Ikenberry]] in ''Foreign Affairs'' comments:  "His main contribution, however, is to explode a popular notion of globalization and thereby to set an agenda for the study of global regulatory politics. For social movements seeking to shape the governance of the world economy, all roads still lead to the state."<ref name = FAreview>[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2007-09-01/all-politics-global-explaining-international-regulatory-regimes Review], [[G. John Ikenberry]], [[Foreign Affairs]], September/October 2007</ref>

Drezner's 2011 book, ''Theories of International Politics and Zombies'', speculated about different ways the international community might respond to a [[zombie]] outbreak, although he "concedes that the statistical probability of such an event is extremely difficult to determine but generally thought to be low." [[Oliver Stuenkel]], writing in Post-Western World, commented: "Drezner's book is a must-read for young international relations scholars, considering the vast attention this topic is likely to get in the future."<ref name = PWWreview>[http://www.postwesternworld.com/2012/01/01/book-review-%E2%80%9Ctheories-of-international-politics-and-zombies%E2%80%9D-by-daniel-w-drezner/ Review], January 1, 2011</ref>

Drezner's 2014 book, ''The System Worked: How the World Stopped Another Great Depression'', examines the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. In it, Drezner praises the international response to the crisis and says that a major [[economic depression]] was averted. Jonathan Kirshner, in his review in ''[[Boston Review]]'', said the book was "smart, thoughtful, and important" but disagreed with Drezner on the issues of [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].<ref name = BRreview>[http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/jonathan-kirshner-daniel-drezner-neoliberal-bailout The Neoliberal Bailout],  Jonathan Kirshner, [[Boston Review]], July 7, 2014</ref>

Drezner has been characterized as one of the most influential scholars and commentators on the [[international political economy]] of money and finance.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Pepinsky|first=Thomas|last2=Steinberg|first2=David A.|date=2020|title=Is International Relations Relevant for International Money and Finance?|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/2542821|url-status=live|website=Bridging the Theory-Practice Divide in International Relations|publisher=Georgetown University Press|language=en}}</ref>
