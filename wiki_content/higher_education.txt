'''Higher education''' is [[tertiary education]] leading to award of an [[academic degree]]. Higher education, also called '''post-secondary education''', third-level or [[tertiary education]], is an optional final stage of [[formal learning]] that occurs after completion of [[secondary education]]. It represents levels 6, 7 and 8 of the [[ISCED#2011 version|2011 version]] of the [[International Standard Classification of Education]] structure. [[Tertiary education]] at a non-degree level is sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] as distinct from higher education.

==The right of access to higher education==
The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of [[international human rights instruments]]. The [[United Nations|UN]] [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that "higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education". In [[Europe]], Article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights]], adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the [[right to education]].

==Definition==
Higher education, also call post-secondary education, third-level or [[tertiary education]], is an optional final stage of [[formal learning]] that occurs after completion of [[secondary education]].{{cn|date=December 2020}}.This consists of Universities, Colleges and Polytechnics that offer formal degrees beyond high school or secondary school education.

The [[International Standard Classification of Education]] in 1997 initially classified all tertiary education together in [[ISCED#ISCED 1997 levels of education|1997 version]] of its schema. They were referred to as level 5 and doctoral studies at level 6. In 2011, this was refined and expanded [[ISCED#2011 version|2011 version]] of the structure. Higher education at undergraduate level, masters and doctoral level became levels 6, 7 and 8. Non-degree level [[Tertiary education]], sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] was reordered ISCED 2011 level 4, with level 5 for some higher courses.<ref>[http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf Revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)], retrieved 05-04-2012.</ref>

In the days when few pupils progressed beyond [[primary education]] or [[basic education]], the term "higher education" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion.{{NoteTag|For example, ''Higher Education: General and Technical'', a 1933 [[National Union of Teachers]] pamphlet by [[Lord Eustace Percy]], which is actually about secondary education and uses the two terms interchangeably.}} This is the origin of the term ''[[High school (North America)|high school]]'' for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (UK and Australia).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/high-school|title=high school|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref>

Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the ''[[undergraduate education|undergraduate]]'' level, and beyond that, ''[[Postgraduate education|graduate-level]]'' (or ''postgraduate'' level). The latter level of education is often referred to as [[graduate school]], especially in North America. In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]] and [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, fluency in speaking and writing, [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.<ref>{{cite press release|date=20 January 2015|title=Employers Judge Recent Graduates Ill-Prepared for Today's Workplace, Endorse Broad and Project-Based Learning as Best Preparation for Career Opportunity and Long-Term Success|url=http://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/2015employerstudentsurveys|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Association of American Colleges and Universities]]|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
The oldest institutions of higher education {{which?|date=December 2020}} appeared between the 5th and the 2nd centuries B.C. in several major cultural areas of Eurasia. {{where?|date=December 2020}} <!--This is an encyclopedia not a middle school kids homework--> In the Greek world, [[Plato's Academy]], [[Lyceum (Classical)|Aristotle's Lycaeum]] and other philosophical-mathematical schools became models for other establishments, particularly in [[Alexandria]] of Egypt under the [[Ptolemies]]. In India, the city of [[Takṣaśilā]]{{when?|date=December 2020}}, later the great Buddhist monastery of [[Nālandā]], attracted students and professors even from distant regions.<ref>Radha Kumud Mookerji, ''Ancient Indian education: Brahmanical and Buddhist'' (2nd ed.). Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1989</ref> In China, the [[Han dynasty]] established chairs to teach the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Confucean Classics]], then in - 124 the Grand School ([[Taixue]]) to train cadres for the imperial administration.<ref>Étienne Balazs, ''La Bureaucratie céleste (recherches sur l’économie et la société de la Chine traditionnelle)'', Paris, Gallimard, 1968</ref><ref>Peter Tze Ming Ng, « Paradigm Shift and the State of the Field in the Study of Christian Higher Education in China », in ''Cahiers d’Extrême-Asie'', 2001, n° 12, pp. 127-140</ref> All these higher-learning institutions became models for other schools within their sphere of cultural influence. {{cn|date=December 2020}}

In 425, the Byzantine emperor [[Theodosius II]] innovated as he established the [[Pandidakterion]], with a faculty of 31 professors, to train public servants. In the 7th and 8th centuries, "cathedral schools" were created in Western Europe. Meanwhile, the first Medresahs were founded in the Moslem empire –&nbsp;initially mere primary schools in the premises of major mosques, which gradually evolved toward secondary, later higher education. However high the intellectual level of these schools could be, it would be anachronistic to call them "universities". Their organization and purposes were markedly different from the corporations of students and teachers, independent from both the Church and the State, which established themselves from the 12th century in Western Europe as ''Universitas Studiorum''.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

===General===
The general higher education and training that takes place in a [[university]], [[college]], or [[Institute of technology]] usually includes significant [[theory|theoretical]] and abstract elements, as well as applied aspects (although limited offerings of [[internship]]s or [[Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)|SURF]] programs attempt to provide practical applications). In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.

In addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although [[alternative pathways in education|alternative means]] of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.

When employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]], [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, [[Communication studies|communication skills]] (using both text and speech), [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.

In the United States, there are large differences in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.<ref name="Simkovic" /><ref>{{cite press release| title =The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher =Georgetown University| date =May 2015| url =https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/| access-date =17 August 2016 }}</ref>

==== Liberal arts ====
{{Main|Liberal arts college}}

Academic areas that are included within the [[liberal arts]] include [[great books]], [[history]], [[language]]s including English, [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[Music education|music]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[science]], [[environmental science]], [[sociology]] and [[Drama school|theater]].

==== Engineering ====
{{Main|Engineering college}}

Teaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include [[aerospace]], [[biological]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[chemical]], [[Computer engineering|computer]], [[electrical]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]].

====Performing arts====
{{Main|Performing arts education}}

The [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].

Performing arts institutions include [[:Category:Circus schools|circus schools]], [[Dance studio|dance schools]], [[drama school]]s and [[music school]]s.

====Plastic or visual arts====
{{Main|Art education|Art school}}

The [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]].

Higher educational institutions in these arts include [[film school]]s and [[List of art schools|art schools]].

===Vocational===
{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}}

Higher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade schools]]. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.

===Professional higher education===
This describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.

The intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013|title=Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|url=http://haphe.eurashe.eu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704003142/http://haphe.eurashe.eu/|archive-date=July 4, 2013|access-date=2014-10-17|website=Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|publisher=EURASHE}}</ref>

Examples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of [[architecture]], [[Business school|business]], [[Journalism school|journalism]], [[Law school|law]], [[Library school|library science]], [[optometry]], [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy]], [[Public policy school|public policy]], [[Medical school|human medicine]], [[Engineering education|professional engineering]], [[Podiatric medical school|podiatric medicine]], [[Dental school|scientific dentistry]], [[K-12 education]], and [[Veterinary school|veterinary medicine]].

==Statistics==
A 2014 report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] states that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men.  Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25–34 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55–64), were being educated at university.<ref name="ReportOECD">{{cite news|author=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|author-link=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|date=September 2014|title=Higher levels of education paying off for young, says OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm|url-status=dead|access-date=September 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628230324/http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm|archive-date=June 28, 2013}}</ref>
