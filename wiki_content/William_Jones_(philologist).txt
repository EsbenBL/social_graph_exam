'''Sir William Jones''' {{post-nominals|FRS|FRAS|FRSE|country=GBR}} (28 September 1746 – 27 April 1794) was an [[Anglo-Welsh]] [[Philology|philologist]], a [[puisne judge]] on the [[Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William]] in [[Bengal]], and a scholar of ancient [[India]], particularly known for his proposition of the existence of a relationship among European and Indo-Aryan languages, which he coined as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].

Jones is also credited for establishing the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]] in the year 1784.

== Biography ==
William Jones was born in London; his father [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]] (1675–1749) was a mathematician from [[Anglesey]] in Wales, noted for introducing the use of the symbol [[pi|π]]. The young William Jones was a [[multilingualism|linguistic prodigy]], who in addition to his native languages English and Welsh,{{sfn|Anthony|2010|p=6}} learned [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the basics of Chinese writing at an early age.{{sfn|Said|1978|p=77}} By the end of his life he knew eight languages with critical thoroughness, was fluent in a further eight, with a dictionary at hand, and had a fair competence in another twelve.{{sfn|Edgerton|2002|p=10}}

Jones' father died when he was aged three, and his mother Mary Nix Jones raised him. He was sent to [[Harrow School]] in September 1753 and then went on to [[University College, Oxford]]. He graduated there in 1768 and became M.A. in 1773. Financially constrained, he took a position tutoring the seven-year-old [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Althorp]], son of [[John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]]. For the next six years he worked as a tutor and translator. During this time he published ''Histoire de Nader Chah'' (1770), a French translation of a work originally written in Persian by [[Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi]]. This was done at the request of King [[Christian VII of Denmark]]: he had visited Jones, who by the age of 24 had already acquired a reputation as an [[oriental studies|orientalist]]. This would be the first of numerous works on [[Persia]], [[Anatolia]], and the Middle East in general.

[[File:W.jones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tomb of William Jones in [[South Park Street Cemetery]], [[Kolkata]].]]

In 1770, Jones joined the [[Middle Temple]] and studied law for three years, a preliminary to his life-work in India. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 30 April 1772. After a spell as a [[Circuit judge (UK)|circuit judge]] in Wales, and a fruitless attempt to resolve the conflict that eventually led to the [[American Revolution]] in concert with [[Benjamin Franklin]] in Paris, he was appointed [[puisne judge]] to the [[Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William]] in Calcutta, [[Bengal]] on 4 March 1783, and on 20 March he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. In April 1783 he married Anna Maria Shipley, the eldest daughter of [[Jonathan Shipley|Dr. Jonathan Shipley]], [[Bishop of Llandaff]] and [[Bishop of St Asaph]]. Anna Maria used her artistic skills to help Jones document life in India. On 25 September 1783 he arrived in [[Calcutta]].

Jones was a radical political thinker, a friend of American independence. His work, ''The principles of government; in a dialogue between a scholar and a peasant'' (1783), was the subject of a trial for seditious libel after it was reprinted by his brother-in-law William Shipley.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cannon |first1=Garland |date=August 1978 |title=Sir William Jones and Anglo-American Relations during the American Revolution |journal=Modern Philology |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=43–44|doi=10.1086/390823 |s2cid=153596466 }}</ref>

In the [[Indian subcontinent|Subcontinent]] he was entranced by [[Indian culture]], an as-yet untouched field in European scholarship, and on 15 January 1784 he founded the [[Asiatic Society]] in [[Calcutta]].{{sfn|Anthony|2010|p=6}} He studied the [[Vedas]] with Rāmalocana, a pandit teaching at the Nadiya Hindu university, becoming a proficient Sanskritist.{{sfn|Anthony|2010|p=6}} Jones kept up a ten-year correspondence on the topic of ''[[jyotisa]]'' or Hindu astronomy with fellow orientalist [[Samuel Davis (orientalist)|Samuel Davis]].{{sfn|Davis|Aris|1982|p=31}} He learnt the ancient concept of Hindu Laws from Pandit [[Jagannath Tarka Panchanan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Dictionary_of_Indian_Biography.djvu/431|title=Dictionary of Indian Biography|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>

Over the next ten years he would produce a flood of works on India, launching the modern study of the subcontinent in virtually every social science. He also wrote on the local laws, music, literature, botany, and geography, and made the first English translations of several important works of Indian literature.

Sir William Jones sometimes also went by the [[Pen name|nom de plume]] Youns Uksfardi (یونس اوکسفردی, "Jones of Oxford"). This pen name can be seen on the inner front cover of his ''Persian Grammar'' published in 1771 (and in subsequent editions).

He died in Calcutta on 27 April 1794 at the age of 47 and is buried in [[South Park Street Cemetery]].<ref>''The South Park Street Cemetery, Calcutta'', published by the Association for the Preservation of Historical Cemeteries in India, 5th ed., 2009</ref>

==Scholarly contributions==
Jones is known today for making and propagating the observation about relationships between the [[Indo-European languages]]. In his ''Third Anniversary Discourse '' to the [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]] (1786) he suggested that [[Sanskrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] languages had a common root, and that indeed they may all be further related, in turn, to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and the [[Celtic languages]], as well as to [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref name=Patil>{{cite book|title=The Variegated Plumage: Encounters with Indian Philosophy : a Commemoration Volume in Honour of Pandit Jankinath Kaul "Kamal" |year=2003 |page=249 |author=Patil, Narendranath B. |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C1GWkeyXnQC&pg=PA249|isbn=9788120819535 }}</ref>
Although his name is closely associated with this observation, he was not the first to make it.

Nevertheless, Jones' third annual discourse before the Asiatic Society on the history and culture of the Hindus (delivered on 2 February 1786 and published in 1788) with the famed "philologer" passage is often cited as the beginning of [[historical linguistics|comparative linguistics]] and [[Indo-European studies]].<ref name="jones1824discourses">{{Cite book |title=Discourses delivered before the Asiatic Society: and miscellaneous papers, on the religion, poetry, literature, etc., of the nations of India |last=Jones |first=Sir William |publisher=Printed for C.

Jones was the first to propose the concept of an "[[Indo-Aryan migrations|Aryan invasion]]" into the [[Indian subcontinent]], which according to Jones led to a lasting ethnic division in India between descents of indigenous Indians and those of the Aryans. This idea fell into obscurity due to a lack of evidence, but was later taken up by amateur Indologists such as the colonial administrator [[Herbert Hope Risley]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian anthropometry |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=231 |access-date=2 December 2011}}</ref>

Jones also propounded theories that might appear peculiar today but were less so in his time. For example, he believed that Egyptian priests had migrated and settled down in India in prehistoric times. He also posited that the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] were originally Hindus belonging to the [[Kshatriya]] caste.{{sfn|Singh|2004|p=9}}

Jones, in his 1772 ''Essay on the Arts called Imitative'', was one of the first to propound an expressive theory of poetry, valorising expression over description or imitation: "If the arguments, used in this essay, have any weight, it will appear, that the finest parts of poetry, musick, and painting, are expressive of the passions...the inferior parts of them are descriptive of natural objects".<ref>Quoted in M H Abrams, ‘'The Mirror and the Lamp'’ (Oxford 1971) p. 88</ref> He thereby anticipated [[Wordsworth]] in grounding poetry on the basis of a Romantic subjectivity.<ref>M Franklin, ‘'Orientalist Jones'’ (2011) p. 86</ref>

Jones was a contributor to [[John Hyde (judge)|Hyde's Notebooks]] during his term on the bench of the Supreme Court of Judicature. The notebooks are a valuable primary source of information for life in late 18th century Bengal and are the only remaining source for the proceedings of the Supreme Court.{{fact|date=March 2021}}

Jones said that "either the first eleven chapters of Genesis ... are true, or the whole fabrick [sic] of our national religion is false, a conclusion which none of us, I trust, would wish to be drawn."

He also said that "I.. . am obliged of course to believe the sanctity of the venerable books [of Genesis]" (1788, 225)<ref name ="Bryant"></ref>

Jones "traced the foundation of the Indian empire above three thousand eight hundred years from now" (Jones, 1790). Jones thought it was important that this date would be between Bishop Usher's creation date of 4004 B.C.E. and the Great Flood that Jonas considered to be in 2350 B.C.E.<ref name = "Bryant"></ref>

== Encounter with Anquetil-Duperron ==
In Europe a discussion as to the authenticity of the first translation of the [[Avesta]] scriptures arose. It was the first evidence of an Indo-European language as old as Sanskrit to be translated into a modern European language. It was suggested that the so-called Zend-Avesta was not the genuine work of the prophet [[Zoroaster]], but was a recent forgery. Foremost among the detractors, it is to be regretted, was the distinguished (though young) orientalist William Jones. He claimed, in a letter published in French (1771), that the translator [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil-Duperron]] had been duped, that the Parsis of Surat had palmed off upon him a conglomeration of worthless fabrications and absurdities. In England, Jones was supported by Richardson and Sir John Chardin; in Germany, by Meiners. Anquetil-Duperron was labelled an impostor who had invented his own script to support his claim.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/The%20First%20European%20Translation%20of%20the%20Holy%20Avesta.htm|title=The First European Translation of the Holy Avesta|website=www.zoroastrian.org.uk|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> This debate was not settled for almost a century.

It is not curious that Jones didn't include Iranian in his naming of the cluster of Indo-European languages, since he hadn't any idea about the relationship between Avestan and Sanskrit as two main branches of this language group.

== Chess poem ==
In 1763, at the age of 17, Jones wrote the poem ''[[Caïssa|Caissa]]'', based on a 658-line poem called "Scacchia, Ludus" published in 1527 by [[Marco Girolamo Vida]], giving a mythical [[origins of chess|origin of chess]] that has become well known in the chess world. This poem he wrote in English.

In the poem the nymph Caissa initially repels the advances of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war. Spurned, Mars seeks the aid of the god of sport, who creates the game of [[chess]] as a gift for Mars to win Caissa's favour. Mars wins her over with the game.

Caissa has since been characterised as the "goddess" of chess, her name being used in several contexts in modern chess playing.

== An Elegiac Poem ==
Maurice, Thomas. (1754-1824), published ''An Elegiac Poem''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rev. Thomas Maurice: An Elegiac and Historical Poem, sacred to the Memory and Virtues of the Honourable Sir William Jones.|url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?action=GET&textsid=37333|access-date=2020-12-13|website=spenserians.cath.vt.edu}}</ref> in 1795, full title An Elegiac Poem, sacred to the memory and virtues of the honourable Sir William Jones. Containing a retrospective survey of the progress of science and the Mohammedan Conquests in Asia.

==Schopenhauer's citation==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] referred to one of Sir William Jones's publications in §1 of  ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819). Schopenhauer was trying to support the doctrine that "everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation." He quoted Jones's original English:
<blockquote>... how early this basic truth was recognized by the sages of India, since it appears as the fundamental tenet of the [[Vedanta|Vedânta]] philosophy ascribed to [[Vyasa]], is proved by Sir William Jones in the last of his essays: "On the Philosophy of the Asiatics" (''Asiatic Researches'', vol. IV, p. 164): "The fundamental tenet of the Vedânta school consisted not in denying the existence of matter, that is solidity, impenetrability, and extended figure (to deny which would be lunacy), but in correcting the popular notion of it, and in contending that it has no essence independent of mental perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible terms."</blockquote>

Schopenhauer used Jones's authority to relate the basic principle of his philosophy to what was, according to Jones, the most important underlying proposition of Vedânta. He made more passing reference to Sir William Jones's writings elsewhere in his works.

==Oration by Hendrik Arent Hamaker==
On 28 September 1822 the Dutch orientalist [[Hendrik Arent Hamaker]], who accepted a professorship at the [[University of Leiden]], gave his inaugural lecture in Latin ''[https://archive.org/details/annalesacademiae22rijk/page/n153 De vita et meritis Guilielmi Jonesii] (The Life and Works of William Jones)(Leiden, 1823).{{sfn|Blok|Molhuysen|1914}}

== Cited by Edgar Allan Poe ==

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story [[Berenice (short story)|"Berenice"]] starts with a motto, the first half of a poem, by Ibn Zaiat: ''Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas.'' It was taken from the works of William Jones, and here is the missing part (from Complete Works, Vol. 2, London, 1799): 
<blockquote>''Dixi autem, an ideo aliud praeter hoc pectus habet sepulchrum?''

My companions said to me, if I would visit the grave of my friend, I might somewhat alleviate my worries. I answered "could she be buried elsewhere than in my heart?"
</blockquote>
