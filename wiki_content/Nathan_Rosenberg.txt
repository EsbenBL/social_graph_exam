Rosenberg's contribution to understanding technological change was acknowledged by [[Douglass C. North]] in his Nobel Prize lecture entitled "Economic Performance through Time".<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1993/north-lecture.html Douglass C. North's Nobel Prize lecture]</ref> In 1996 he was awarded the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]], the highest award of the Society for the History of Technology.

This is why, the book states, most of the population was to some extent involved in agriculture and its related occupations of transporting produce from place to place.<ref>[https://mises.org/daily/5506/Food-and-the-Art-of-Commerce Food and the Art of Commerce], August 2, 2011, Jeffrey A Tucker.

This hypothesis is tested and supported by [[Joel Mokyr]] in his contribution to the [[Festschrift]]-issue of ''[[Research Policy]]'', which was published in honor of Nathan Rosenberg in 1994.<ref>D.
