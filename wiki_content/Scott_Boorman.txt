'''Scott Archer Boorman''' (born February 1, 1949) is a [[mathematical sociology|mathematical sociologist]] at [[Yale University]]. 

==Life==
His father, [[Howard L. Boorman]], was a Foreign Service Officer in [[Beijing]], China, and he was born there as Chinese Communists troops entered the city. He received no formal education before enrolling at [[Harvard College]], and had largely completed work on his book, ''The Protracted Game'', which was published in 1971.{{sfnb|Reinhold|1971}}

He earned his B.A. in Applied Mathematics, and was a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]]. He  received his Ph.D. in [[Sociology]] from Harvard University and was appointed to a full professorship at Penn before moving to Yale. He is also a graduate of [[Yale Law School]].

==Works==
While still a teenager, Boorman wrote ''The Protracted Game : A Wei-Ch'i Interpretation of Maoist Revolutionary Strategy''[http://senseis.xmp.net/?TheProtractedGame] (1969), an analysis of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. He shows that the U.S. thought it was playing [[Chess]], while in fact the game was Wei-Ch'i (also known as [[Go (board game)|Go]]).

He systematically explores the similarity between the military strategies of Chinese Communist insurgency and the Chinese board game wei-châ€™i, in contrast to parallel U.S. analyses of the same events. Boorman also argues that wei-chi's analysis of a strategic system presents a more sophisticated and flexible form of [[game theory]] than the traditional western models of strategic choice. <ref>{{citation|first=Robert|last=Reinhold|journal= New York Times|title= Maoist Strategy Likened to Complex Game of Go|date= 6 March 1971|page= 11|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/03/06/81876666.html?pageNumber=11 }}</ref>

His book, ''Genetics of Altruism'' (1980) uses mathematical population genetics to analyze the development of sociality and altruism through three modes of selection: group, kin and reciprocity.
