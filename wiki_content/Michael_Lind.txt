[[File:2015-Feb-25 Future of War Lind Morris Freedman Bobbitt.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Michael Lind, [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]], [[Lawrence Freedman]], [[Philip Bobbitt]]; "What Do Lessons from History Tell Us About the Future of War?" panel discussion at [[New America Foundation]] first annual Future of War conference, Washington, D.C., February 25, 2015]]
Lind has examined and defended the tradition of [[American nationalism|American democratic nationalism]] associated with [[Alexander Hamilton]] in a series of books, including ''The Next American Nation'' (1995), ''Hamilton’s Republic'' (1997), ''What Lincoln Believed'' (2004) and ''[[Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States]]'' (2012). Lind has also written two books on [[American foreign policy]], ''The American Way of Strategy'' (2006) and ''Vietnam: The Necessary War'' (1999). A former [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] in the tradition of [[New Deal|New Deal liberalism]]; with the original neoconservatives being anti-Soviet liberals who drifted to the right, Lind criticized the American right in ''Up From Conservatism: Why the Right is Wrong for America'' (1996) and ''Made in Texas: George W. Bush and the Southern Takeover of American Politics'' (2004).

In 1995, Lind criticized the systems of [[jury trial]]s and [[common law]], arguing that [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] trials are superior to common law trials, and that the civil law model of a mixed panel of professional and [[lay judge]]s is preferable to juries. On the history of trial by jury in the United States, he wrote that "from independence until the civil rights revolution, the jury was a means by which white bigots legally lynched Indians, blacks and Asians (or acquitted their white murderers). Today urban black juries all too often put race above justice in the same manner." He argued that among other things, the process of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] was much fairer in a civil law system.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/legal-and-political-magazines/criminal-jury-should-be-abolished</ref>

In May 2015, Lind argued for the adoption of "enlightened nationalism", also called "[[liberal nationalism]]", in which the United States "would combine its security strategy of offshore balancing with intelligent [[economic nationalism]]". Regarding [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] and other American allies, a liberal nationalist foreign policy, Lind continued, "would shift much of the burden of the defense of its allies and protectorates to those countries themselves". He has argued for "an immigration policy in the national interest would shift the emphasis from family reunification to skills [...] [and] enable long-term population growth [...] compatible with the economic integration and cultural assimilation of newcomers to the United States".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-case-american-nationalism-10328|title=The Case for American Nationalism|first=Michael|last=Lind|date=May 17, 2015|website=The National Interest}}</ref>

Lind is an outspoken critic of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]]. He had observed that of the 195 countries in the world today, none is fully a libertarian society:

{{quote|If libertarianism was a good idea, wouldn't at least one country have tried it?  Wouldn't there be at least one country, out of nearly two hundred, with [[minarchism|minimal government]], free trade, open borders, decriminalized drugs, no welfare state and no public education system?<ref>Lind, Michael.  (June 4, 2013.). [http://www.salon.com/2013/06/04/the_question_libertarians_just_cant_answer "The Question Libertarians Just Can't Answer."]  ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]].''</ref>}}
