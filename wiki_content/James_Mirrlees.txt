'''Sir James Alexander Mirrlees''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRSE|FBA}} (5 July 1936 – 29 August 2018) was a British economist and winner of the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. He was [[British honours system|knighted]] in the [[1997 Birthday Honours]].

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Minnigaff]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], Mirrlees was educated at [[Douglas Ewart High School]], then at the [[University of Edinburgh]] ([[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in 1957) and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] ([[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]] and PhD in 1963 with thesis title ''Optimum Planning for a Dynamic Economy'', supervised by [[Richard Stone]]). He was a very active student debater. A contemporary, [[Quentin Skinner]], has suggested that Mirrlees was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]] along with fellow Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] during the period.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Economics ==
Between 1968 and 1976, Mirrlees was a visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] three times. He was also a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1986) and [[Yale University]] (1989).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1996/mirrlees-cv.html |title=James A. Mirrlees – Curriculum Vitae |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=29 October 2013}}</ref> He taught at both [[Oxford University]] (as [[Edgeworth Professor of Economics]] 1968–1995) and [[University of Cambridge]] (1963–1968 and 1995–2018).

During his time at Oxford, he published papers on [[economic model]]s for which he would eventually be awarded his Nobel Prize. The papers centred on [[asymmetric information]], which determines the extent to which they should affect the optimal rate of saving in an economy. Among other results, he demonstrated the principles of "[[moral hazard]]" and "[[optimal income taxation]]" discussed in the books of [[William Vickrey]]. The methodology has since become the standard in the field.

Mirrlees and Vickrey shared the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] "for their fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information".<ref name="Nobel bio"/>

Mirrlees was also co-creator, with MIT Professor [[Peter A. Diamond]], of the Diamond–Mirrlees efficiency theorem, which was developed in 1971.<ref>Peter A. Diamond and James A. Mirrlees (1971).

Mirrlees was emeritus [[Professor of Political Economy, Cambridge University|Professor of Political Economy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He spent several months a year at the [[University of Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. He was the Distinguished Professor-at-Large of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] as well as [[University of Macau]].<ref>[http://www.umac.mo/economics/staff/index.html UMAC Department of Economics: Staff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316151608/http://www.umac.mo/economics/staff/index.html |date=16 March 2011 }}</ref>

In 2009, he was appointed Founding Master of the [[Morningside College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

Mirrlees was a member of [[Scotland]]'s [[Council of Economic Advisers (Scotland)|Council of Economic Advisers]]. He also led the [[Mirrlees Review]], a review of the UK tax system by the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]].

His Ph.D. students included eminent academics and policy makers like professor [[Franklin Allen]], Sir [[Partha Dasgupta]],<ref name="Nobel bio">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1996/mirrlees-bio.html|title=James A.
