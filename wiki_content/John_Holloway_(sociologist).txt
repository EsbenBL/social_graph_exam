'''John Holloway''' (born 1947) is a lawyer, [[Marxist]]-oriented [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher]], whose work is closely associated with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] movement in Mexico, his home since 1991. It has also been taken up by some intellectuals associated with the [[piquetero]]s in [[Argentina]]; the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] movement in South Africa and the [[Anti-Globalization Movement]] in Europe and North America.{{clarify|date=September 2021|reason=What has been taken up?}} He is currently a professor at the Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences at the [[Autonomous University of Puebla]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-holloway John Holloway - The Guardian]</ref>

==Background==
He was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and has a [[Ph.D]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Holloway|date=1975|title=Harmonisation and co-ordination of social security in the European Communities: the law and its social function, a commentary on articles 51, 117, 118 of the Treaty of Rome|hdl=1842/17525|language=en}}</ref> in Political Science from the [[University of Edinburgh]].

He is brother to writer and academic [[David Holloway (political scientist)|David Holloway]], and first cousin to Canadian political activist Kate Holloway and Canadian entertainer [[Maureen Holloway]].

==Work==
During the 1970s, Holloway was an influential member of the [[Conference of Socialist Economists]], particularly in his support of an approach to the state as a social form constituted ultimately by class struggle between capital and the working class.<ref>The State Debate (1991), Simon Clarke (ed.) {{ISBN|0-333-53584-7}}</ref> This approach was developed primarily through the critical appropriation of aspects of the German [[state derivation debate]] of the early 1970s, in particular the work of [[Joachim Hirsch]], and led him and [[Sol Picciotto]] to publish "State and Capital: A Marxist Debate",<ref>''State and Capital: A Marxist Debate'' (1978), {{ISBN|0-7131-5987-1}}, ed. with Sol Picciotto</ref> an anthology of texts from the German debate with a critical introduction. This conception of state, social form and class struggle, within the Conference of Socialist Economists developed current that ultimately gave rise to the [[Open Marxism]] school of thought in which Holloway remained a significant participant. This current rejects both traditional [[Marxist]] ideas of [[state monopoly capitalism]] and innovations such as [[Poulantzas]]' [[Althusserian]] state theory, and the [[Regulation school]],<ref>''Post-Fordism and Social Form: A Marxist Debate on the Post-Fordist State'' (1991), {{ISBN|0-333-54393-9}}, ed. with Werner Bonefeld</ref> and affirms the centrality of the class relation between capital and working class, as a struggle.

His 2002 book, ''[[Change the World Without Taking Power]]'', has been much debated in Marxist, [[anarchist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] circles, and contends that the possibility of revolution resides not in the seizure of state apparatuses, but in day-to-day acts of abject refusal of capitalist society – so-called [[anti-power]], or 'the scream' as he puts it. Holloway's thesis has been analysed by thinkers like [[Tariq Ali]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Critics and supporters alike consider Holloway broadly [[Autonomist]] in outlook, and his work is often compared and contrasted with that of figures such as [[Antonio Negri]].

His 2010 book ''[[Crack Capitalism]]'' carries on with the political ideas developed in ''Change the World Without Taking Power''. Holloway sees the problem of political activism, in terms of people struggling “in-and-against” the system, as one of continuing to perpetuate capitalism through their commitment to abstract labour. He argues that from the Marxist stand-point of “two-fold nature of labour” or [[abstract labour and concrete labour]], that [[anti-capitalist]] struggles should be about concrete doing against labour, and not a struggle of labour against capital.
