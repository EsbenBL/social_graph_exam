{{short description|Psychological behavior}}

'''Learned helplessness''' is behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated [[aversive stimuli]] beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused from the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness: discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon exhibiting such behavior, the subject was said to have acquired learned helplessness.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Psychology the science of behavior |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |pages=409 |isbn=978-0-205-69918-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|author=Nolen, J.L.|title=Learned helplessness|access-date=14 January 2014}}</ref> Over the past few decades, neuroscience has provided insight into learned helplessness and shown that the original theory actually had it backwards: the brain's default state is to assume that control is not present, and the presence of "helpfulness" is what is actually learned first. However, it is unlearned when a subject is faced with prolonged aversive stimulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maier|first1=Steven F.|last2=Seligman|first2=Martin E.

In humans, learned helplessness is related to the concept of [[self-efficacy]]; the individual's belief in their innate ability to achieve goals. '''Learned helplessness theory''' is the view that [[clinical depression]] and related [[mental illness]]es may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=M.

==Foundation of research and theory==
===Early experiments===
[[File:Shuttle_Box_Dog_Orange.png|thumb|285x285px|Inescapable shock training in the shuttle box]]
American psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] initiated research on learned helplessness in 1967 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as an extension of his interest in depression.<ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972">{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = M. E. P. | year = 1972 | title = Learned helplessness | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 407–412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.me.23.020172.002203 | pmid = 4566487 }}</ref>  This research was later expanded through experiments by Seligman and others. One of the first was an experiment by Seligman & Overmier:  In Part 1 of this study, three groups of dogs were placed in harnesses. Group 1 dogs were simply put in a harness for a period of time and were later released. Groups 2 and 3 consisted of "[[Yoke|yoked pairs]]". Dogs in Group 2 were given electric shocks at random times, which the dog could end by pressing a lever. Each dog in Group 3 was paired with a Group 2 dog; whenever a Group 2 dog got a shock, its paired dog in Group 3 got a shock of the same intensity and duration, but its lever did not stop the shock. To a dog in Group 3, it seemed that the shock ended at random because it was their paired dog in Group 2 that was causing it to stop. Thus, for Group 3 dogs, the shock was "inescapable".

In Part 2 of the experiment, the same three groups of dogs were tested in a shuttle-box apparatus (a chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided by a barrier a few inches high). All of the dogs could escape shocks on one side of the box by jumping over a low partition to the other side. The dogs in Groups 1 and 2 quickly learned this task and escaped the shock. Most of the Group 3 dogs – which had previously learned that nothing they did had any effect on shocks – simply lay down passively and whined when they were shocked.<ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972"/>

In a second experiment later that year with new groups of dogs, Maier and Seligman ruled out the possibility that, instead of learned helplessness, the Group 3 dogs failed to avert in the second part of the test because they had learned some behavior that interfered with "escape". To prevent such interfering behavior, Group 3 dogs were immobilized with a paralyzing drug ([[curare]]) and underwent a procedure similar to that in Part 1 of the Seligman and Overmier experiment. When tested as before in Part 2, these Group 3 dogs exhibited helplessness as before. This result serves as an indicator for the ruling out of the interference hypothesis.

From these experiments, it was thought that there was to be only one cure for helplessness. In Seligman's hypothesis, the dogs do not try to escape because they expect that nothing they do will stop the shock. To change this expectation, experimenters physically picked up the dogs and moved their legs, replicating the actions the dogs would need to take in order to escape from the electrified grid. This had to be done at least twice before the dogs would start willfully jumping over the barrier on their own. In contrast, threats, rewards, and observed demonstrations had no effect on the "helpless" Group 3 dogs.<ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972" /><ref name=":0">Seligman, M. E.

===Later experiments===
Later experiments have served to confirm the depressive effect of feeling a lack of control over an aversive stimulus. For example, in one experiment, humans performed mental tasks in the presence of distracting noise. Those who could use a switch to turn off the noise rarely bothered to do so, yet they performed better than those who could not turn off the noise. Simply being aware of this option was enough to substantially counteract the noise effect.<ref name="Learned helplessness in man">{{cite journal | last1 = Hiroto | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Seligman | first2 = M.E.P. | year = 1975 | title = Generality of learned helplessness in man | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 311–27 | doi=10.1037/h0076270}}</ref> In 2011, an animal study<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/npre.2011.6267.1 | title=Control over stress induces plasticity of individual prefrontal cortical neurons: A conductance-based neural simulation| journal=Nature Precedings| year=2011| last1=Varela| first1=Juan| last2=Wang| first2=Jungang| last3=Varnell| first3=Andrew| last4=Cooper| first4=Donald| doi-access=free}}</ref> found that animals with control over stressful stimuli exhibited changes in the excitability of certain neurons in the prefrontal cortex.  Animals that lacked control failed to exhibit this neural effect and showed signs consistent with learned helplessness and [[social anxiety]].

==Expanded theories==
Research has found that a human's reaction to feeling a lack of control differs both between individuals and between situations, i.e. learned helplessness sometimes remains specific to one situation but at other times generalizes across situations.<ref name="Learned helplessness in man"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=C. |last2=Park |first2=C. |year=1998 |chapter=Learned helplessness and explanatory style |editor1-first=D.

In 1978, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson]], Seligman and [[John D. Teasdale]] reformulated Seligman's work, using [[attribution theory]]. They proposed that people differed in how they classified negative experiences on three scales, from internal to external, stable to unstable, and from global to specific. They believed that people who were more likely to attribute negative events to internal, stable, and global causes were more likely to become depressed than those attributed things to causes at the other ends of the scales.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Abramson |first1=L. Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=M. E. |last3=Teasdale |first3=J. D. |title=Learned helplessness in humans: critique and reformulation |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |date=February 1978 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856 |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/649856/ |issn=0021-843X}}</ref>

[[Bernard Weiner]] proposed a detailed account of the attributional approach to learned helplessness in 1986. His attribution theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and [[Locus of control|internality/externality]]:<ref>Weiner, B. (1986). An attributional theory of motivation and emotion. New York: Springer-Verlag.</ref>

* A ''global attribution'' occurs when the individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts.
** A ''specific attribution'' occurs when the individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation.
* A ''stable attribution'' occurs when the individual believes the cause to be consistent across time.
** An u''nstable attribution'' occurs when the individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time.
* An ''external attribution'' assigns causality to situational or external factors,
** while an ''internal attribution'' assigns causality to factors within the person.<ref name="Helplessness in humans" />

Research has shown that those with an internal, stable, and global attributional style for negative events can be more at risk for a depressive reaction to failure experiences.

==Neurobiological perspective==
Research has shown that increased 5-HT ([[serotonin]]) activity in the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] plays a critical role in learned helplessness. Other key brain regions that are involved with the expression of helpless behavior include the [[basolateral amygdala]], central nucleus of the [[amygdala]] and
[[Stria terminalis#Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)|bed nucleus of the stria terminalis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hammack|first1=Sayamwong|last2=Cooper|first2=Matthew|last3=Lezak|first3=Kimberly|title=Overlapping neurobiology of learned helplessness and conditioned defeat: Implications for PTSD and mood disorders|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.02.024|pmid=21396383|pmc=3433056|journal=Original Paper|volume=62|issue=2|pages=565–575|publisher=University of Vermont|year=2012}}<!--|access-date=16 November 2012--></ref> Activity in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, septum and hypothalamus has also been observed during states of helplessness.

In the article, "Exercise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain", Benjamin N. Greenwood and Monika Fleshner discuss how exercise might prevent stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. They show evidence that running wheel exercise prevents learned helplessness behaviors in rats.<ref>idem, p82</ref>  They suggest that the amount of exercise may not be as important as simply exercising at all. The article also discusses the neurocircuitry of learned helplessness, the role of serotonin (or 5-HT), and the exercise-associated neural adaptations that may contribute to the stress-resistant brain. However, the authors finally conclude that "The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this effect, however, remain unknown. Identifying the mechanisms by which exercise prevents learned helplessness could shed light on the complex neurobiology of depression and anxiety and potentially lead to novel strategies for the prevention of stress-related mood disorders".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=Benjamin|title=Exercise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain|url=http://exuberantanimal.com/web/library/case_for_the_body_resources/neuro/Greenwood-2008_Exercise%20and%20the%20brain.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623171003/http://exuberantanimal.com/web/library/case_for_the_body_resources/neuro/Greenwood-2008_Exercise%20and%20the%20brain.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 June 2011|pmid=18300002|journal=Original Paper|volume=10|issue=2|pages=81–98|publisher=University of Colorado-Boulder and Department of Integrative Physiology|access-date=2 November 2012|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12017-008-8029-y|last2 = Fleshner|first2 = Monika|s2cid=2235604}}</ref>

==Health implications==
People who perceive events as uncontrollable show a variety of symptoms that threaten their mental and physical well-being.  They experience stress, they often show disruption of emotions demonstrating passivity or aggressivity, and they can also have difficulty performing cognitive tasks such as problem-solving.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = S. | year = 1980 | title = A revised model of learned helplessness in humans | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 103–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1980.tb00969.x| pmid = 7365672 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60253-1 |chapter = Responses to Uncontrollable Outcomes: An Integration of Reactance Theory and the Learned Helplessness Model|title = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume = 8|pages = 277–336|year = 1975|last1 = Wortman|first1 = Camille B.|last2 = Brehm|first2 = Jack W.|isbn = 9780120152087|editor-first1=Leonard |editor-last1=Berkowitz}}</ref><ref name="stress">{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Liu| first2 = X |last3=Corwin |first3=D.S. | year = 2012 | title = Learned Helplessness Among Families and Surrogate Decision-makers of Patients Admitted to Medical, Surgical and Trauma Intensive Care Units | journal = Chest | volume = 142 | issue = 6|doi=10.1378/chest.12-0112 | pages=1440–1446 | pmid=22661454 | pmc=3515025}}</ref> They are less likely to change unhealthy patterns of behavior, causing them, for example, to neglect diet, exercise, and medical treatment.<ref name="life stress">{{cite journal | last1 = Henry | first1 = P.C. | year = 2005 | title = Life stress, explanatory style, hopelessness, and occupational stress | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 241–56 | doi=10.1037/1072-5245.12.3.241}}</ref><ref name="The Human Factor">Jones, Ishmael (2008, revised 2010).

===Social impact===
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}
Learned helplessness can be a factor in a wide range of social situations.
*In [[Psychological abuse|emotionally abusive relationships]], the victim often develops learned helplessness. This occurs when the victim confronts or tries to leave the abuser only to have the abuser dismiss or trivialize the victim's feelings, pretend to care but not change, or impede the victim from leaving. Unfortunately, as the situation continues and the abuse gets worse, the victim will begin to give up and show signs of this learned helplessness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Abuse Can Create Learned Helplessness|url=https://www.growbeyondwords.com/why-abuse-can-create-learned-helplessness/|url-status=live}}</ref>
*The motivational effect of learned helplessness is often seen in the classroom. Students who repeatedly fail may conclude that they are incapable of improving their performance, and this attribution keeps them from trying to succeed, which results in increased helplessness, continued failure, loss of self-esteem and other social consequences. This becomes a pattern that will spiral downward if it continues to go untreated.<ref>Stipek, D.E.P. (1988). Motivation to learning.

*[[Child abuse]] by neglect can be a manifestation of learned helplessness. For example, when parents believe they are incapable of stopping an infant's crying, they may simply give up trying to do anything for the child.

*According to Ruby K.

The UK educationalist Phil Bagge describes it as a learning avoidance strategy caused by prior failure and the positive reinforcement of avoidance such as asking teachers or peers to explain and consequently do the work. It shows itself as sweet helplessness or aggressive helplessness often seen in challenging problem solving contexts, such as learning to use a new computer [[programming language]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=How To Rid Your Primary Computing Classes Of 'Learned Helplessness'|url=http://www.teachwire.net/news/how-to-rid-your-primary-computing-classes-of-learned-helplessness|access-date=2021-01-04|website=Teachwire|language=en}}</ref>

The US [[sociologist]] [[Harrison White]] has suggested in his book ''Identity and Control'' that the notion of learned helplessness can be extended beyond psychology into the realm of social action. When a culture or political identity fails to achieve desired goals, perceptions of collective ability suffer.

The Unabomber, [[Ted Kaczynski]], used the concept of learned helplessness to mass-diagnose the psychological problems that are prevalent in modern society, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and eating disorders.
