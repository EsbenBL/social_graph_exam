==Life and work==
Arun Sundararajan graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]] in 1993 with a BTech in [[electrical engineering]]. He subsequently attended the [[University of Rochester]] where he received an M. Phil in [[operations research]] and a PhD in [[business administration]]. After he earned his doctorate, he joined the faculty at [[New York University]], where his work focuses on the transformation of business and society by information technologies, and the Indian economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/facultyindex.cgi?id%3D155 |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610160822/http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/facultyindex.cgi?id=155 |archive-date=10 June 2011 }}</ref>

Sundararajan's scholarly research analyzes what makes the economics of IT products and industries unique. He asserts that there are three technological invariants—digitization, exponential growth, and modularity—that have characterized and distinguished information technologies since the 1960s,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dhar, Vasant  |author2=Arun Sundararajan |s2cid=33958254 |name-list-style=amp | title=Information technologies in business: a blueprint for education and research| journal=Information Systems Research| year=2007| volume=18 | pages=125–141 | doi=10.1287/isre.1070.0126 | issue=3}}</ref> and that these invariants lead to the ubiquity of information goods, [[digital piracy]] and [[network effects]] in IT industries. His research papers illustrate how these distinctive economics of information technologies warrant new pricing strategies,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sundararajan, Arun| title=Nonlinear pricing of information goods | journal=Management Science| year=2004| volume=50 | pages=1660–1673 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0291 | jstor=30048058 | issue=12| s2cid=1715181 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal
