He also served in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]] from 2010 to 2015.

Cable studied Economics at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], before working as an economic adviser to the [[Government of Kenya]] in the 1960s, and for the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General|Commonwealth Secretariat]] in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, he also lectured in economics at Glasgow. He later served as Chief Economist for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] in the 1990s. Initially active in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Cable became a Labour councillor in Glasgow in the 1970s, during which time he also served as a [[Special adviser (UK)|special adviser]] to then-[[Secretary of State for Trade|Trade Secretary]] [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. In 1982, however, he defected to the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which later amalgamated with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to form the Liberal Democrats.

After standing unsuccessfully for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] four times, Cable was elected for [[Twickenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Twickenham]] in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]. He was quickly appointed the [[Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team|Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman]], and was later [[2006 Liberal Democrats deputy leadership election|elected as Deputy Leader]] in 2006. Cable resigned from both of these positions in May 2010 after being appointed as Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2010/05/vince-cable-resigns.html |title=Vince Cable Resigns! |publisher=Iaindale.blogspot.com |date=26 February 2010 |access-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529155933/http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2010/05/vince-cable-resigns.html |archive-date=29 May 2010}}</ref> He lost his seat in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], although later regained it in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].

In May 2019, Cable led the Liberal Democrats to their best national electoral performance since the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]], gaining fifteen seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament election]].

===Early years===
At [[university]], Cable was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] but then joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1966. In [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]], he contested [[Glasgow Hillhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Hillhead]] for Labour, but failed to unseat the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, [[Tam Galbraith]]. The same year, Cable stood for election to the [[Glasgow Corporation|Corporation of Glasgow]] in the Partick West ward, but failed to be elected. He became a Labour [[councillor]] in 1971, representing Maryhill ward, and stood down in 1974. In [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]], he sought the Labour Party nomination for [[Hampstead (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead]], losing to [[Ken Livingstone]], who was unsuccessful in taking the seat.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/dec/26/michael-white-politicians-decade-vincent-cable|title=Michael White's politicians of the decade: Vincent Cable|last=White|first=Michael|date=26 December 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=31 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101175531/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/dec/26/michael-white-politicians-decade-vincent-cable|archive-date=1 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

He was the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] parliamentary candidate for his home city of [[York (UK Parliament constituency)|York]] in both the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]]s. Following the 1988 merger of the SDP and the Liberal Party, he finished in second place at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] to [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Toby Jessel]] in the Twickenham constituency, by 5,711 votes.<ref name=":5" />

===Member of Parliament (1997–2015)===

Prior to the 2005 Liberal Democrat party conference, Cable did not rule out the possibility that the Lib Dems might form a [[coalition government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the event of a [[hung parliament]] at the forthcoming general election. However, party leader [[Charles Kennedy]] said that the Lib Dems would remain an "independent political force".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4246080.stm |title=Interview: Vincent Cable |author=Justin Parkinson |work=BBC News |date=18 September 2005 |access-date=19 November 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223055306/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4246080.stm |archive-date=23 December 2007  }}</ref>

In late-2005 or early-2006, Cable presented [[Charles Kennedy]] a letter signed by eleven out of the twenty-three frontbenchers, including himself, expressing a lack of confidence in Kennedy's leadership of the Liberal Democrats. On 5 January 2006, because of pressure from his frontbench team and an [[ITN News]] report documenting his [[alcoholism]], [[Charles Kennedy]] announced a [[2006 Liberal Democrats leadership election|leadership election]] in which he pledged to stand for re-election. However, he resigned on 7 January. Cable did not run for the party leadership, instead supporting [[Menzies Campbell]]'s candidacy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511962/Campbell-chosen-to-take-on-Tories.html|title=Campbell chosen to take on Tories|last1=Carlin|first1=Brendan|last2=Jones|first2=George|last3=Isaby|first3=Jonathan|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826112130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511962/Campbell-chosen-to-take-on-Tories.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2006|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-date=26 August 2017}}</ref>

====Expenses====
A Twickenham resident, Cable commuted by train into [[Central London]] daily and so claimed the "London Supplement" instead of the Additional Costs Allowance. However, the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported in May 2009 that he had been unaware that he was entitled to the London Supplement and so in 2004 wrote to the Fees Office to ask if he could receive retrospective payments for 2002–03 and 2003–04. The Fees Office refused the request, informing Cable that these accounts were already closed.<ref name=13dt>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5314829/Vince-Cable-doesnt-claim-for-second-home-but-asked-for-backdated-London-Supplement-MPs-expenses.html |title=Vince Cable doesn't claim for second home but asked for backdated London Supplement: MPs' expenses |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 May 2009 |first=Nick |last=Allen |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517001058/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5314829/Vince-Cable-doesnt-claim-for-second-home-but-asked-for-backdated-London-Supplement-MPs-expenses.html |archive-date=17 May 2009  }}</ref>

When overall MP allowances are ranked, Cable came in 568th for 2007–08 (out of 645 MPs). The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' also noted that he did not take a recent 2.33% salary rise.<ref name=13dt/>

===Deputy Leadership of the Liberal Democrats (2006–2010)===
[[File:CleggCable.jpg|thumb|right|Cable with Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] in 2009]]
Cable won plaudits for his repeated warnings and campaigns on the high level of [[personal debt]] in Britain.<ref name="Guardian1">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/20/vincentcable.liberaldemocrats |title=The cult of Cable |quote=...Cable had been warning against Britain's growing personal credit card debt for several years..." |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=16 January 2009 |date=20 February 2008 |author=Michael White |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217182828/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/20/vincentcable.liberaldemocrats |archive-date=17 December 2013  }}</ref> His was a significant voice of criticism during the [[Northern Rock]] crisis, calling for the [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock|nationalisation of the bank]], capitalising on the claimed indecisiveness of both the Labour Government and Conservative Opposition on the issue.

In May 2010, Cable declared his resignation as Deputy Leader to dedicate more time to his [[United Kingdom Cabinet|Cabinet]] role as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Business Secretary]]. His responsibilities and authority were somewhat reduced when it was revealed in December 2010 that he had boasted to ''Daily Telegraph'' reporters posing as constituents of his "nuclear option" to bring the government down by his resignation. Still worse, he claimed to the reporters that he had "declared war" on [[Rupert Murdoch]] of News Corporation despite having the responsibility to impartially arbitrate on the News Corporation bid to acquire the remaining 60.9% of BSkyB it did not already own. Amid cries for his resignation or sacking, all his responsibilities concerning the bid were removed. Cable did not resign.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Acting leader of the Liberal Democrats (2007)====
Following the resignation of Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] as Party Leader on 15 October 2007, Cable being Deputy Leader automatically succeeded him as Party Leader, pending a leadership election. He declined to stand for leader, reportedly fearing [[ageism]] (Campbell's critics were accused of ageism,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrzone.com/engage/employees/sir-menzies-a-victim-of-ageism|title=Sir Menzies - a victim of ageism?|date=17 October 2007|work=HRZone|access-date=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703050520/https://www.hrzone.com/engage/employees/sir-menzies-a-victim-of-ageism|archive-date=3 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and Cable was only 2 years his junior).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40655847|title=The Vince Cable story|last=Wheeler|first=Brian|date=20 July 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009144853/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40655847|archive-date=9 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Cable received significant acclaim during his tenure as Acting Party Leader, with particular praise for his strong performances at [[Prime Minister's Questions]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7118733.stm |title=Vince Cable: Acting like a leader |work=BBC News |date=30 November 2007 |first=Arif |last=Ansari |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217165113/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7118733.stm |archive-date=17 February 2009  }}</ref> He was popular in the party and media for his attacks on the government's record over [[Northern Rock]], [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|HMRC's]] loss of 25,000,000 individuals' child benefit data and the party funding scandal surrounding [[David Abrahams (Labour party donor)|David Abrahams']] secret donations to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The latter attracted for Cable positive media attention for a joke at PMQs describing [[Gordon Brown]]'s "remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] to [[Mr Bean]], creating chaos out of order rather than order out of chaos", called by ''[[The Economist]]'', "the single best line of [[Gordon Brown]]'s premiership".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10225014&fsrc=RSS |title=Liberal Democrat leaders: The final straight |work=The Economist |date=29 November 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222214414/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10225014&fsrc=RSS |archive-date=22 December 2007  }}</ref>

====Views on the financial crisis====
[[File:Vince Cable, March 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vince Cable in March 2008]]
Cable is credited by some{{who|date=August 2017}} with prescience of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. In November 2003, Cable asked [[Gordon Brown]], then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], "Is not the brutal truth that&nbsp;... the growth of the British economy is sustained by consumer spending pinned against record levels of personal debt, which is secured, if at all, against house prices that the [[Bank of England]] describes as well above equilibrium level?" Brown replied, "As the Bank of England said yesterday, consumer spending is returning to trend. The Governor said,
"there is no indication that the scale of debt problems have ... risen markedly in the last five years." He also said that the fraction of household income used up in debt service is lower than it was then."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2003/nov/13/interest-rates |title=House of Commons Debates 13 November 2003 vol 413 col 396–400 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704022509/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2003/nov/13/interest-rates |archive-date=4 July 2009  }}</ref>

In his book ''The Storm'', Cable writes, "The trigger for the current global financial crisis was the US mortgage market and, indeed, the scale of improvident and unscrupulous lending on that side of the Atlantic dwarfs into insignificance the escapades of our own banks." Cable commented that he had not warned about this: "one of the problems of being a British MP is that you do tend to get rather parochial and I haven't been to the States for years and years, so I wouldn't claim to have any feel for what's been going on there."<ref>{{cite news |author=Dominic Lawson |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5949844.ece |title=News Review interview: Vince Cable |work=The Sunday Times |date=22 March 2009 |location=London|author-link=Dominic Lawson }}</ref>

In September 2008, Cable praised the-then US [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] for his [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|response to the financial crisis]] and for attempting to "save Western [[capitalism]]." He compared this with [[Gordon Brown|Prime Minister Gordon Brown]]'s response which Cable claimed was to be like a "Fairy Godmother" to the banks, and a "sideshow".{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Cable has also been vocal over the [[bankers' bonuses|bonus culture]] in the banking system. He has called for bonuses to all bank employees to be frozen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7878418.stm Brown 'very angry' about bonuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212085010/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7878418.stm |date=12 February 2009 }} BBC News, 9 February 2009</ref>

However, Cable has been criticised by some, mostly Conservatives, for "[[flip-flopping]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/leftwatch/2010/04/vince-cable-is-a-serialflipflopper.html |title=Vince Cable is a serial-flip-flopper |publisher=Conservative Home Leftwatch |date=8 January 2009 |access-date=24 April 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430041832/http://conservativehome.blogs.com/leftwatch/2010/04/vince-cable-is-a-serialflipflopper.html |archive-date=30 April 2010  }}</ref> on issues in connection with the crisis.

On the issue of fiscal stimulus, Cable said in October 2008, "it is entirely wrong for the government to assume the economy should be stimulated by yet more public spending rather than tax cuts".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7696733.stm |title=Fiscal rules are dead – Cameron |work=BBC News |date=29 October 2008 |access-date=14 April 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216105104/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7696733.stm |archive-date=16 February 2009  }}</ref> In February 2009, however, he said, "we believe – and the Government say that they believe – in the need for a fiscal stimulus.

At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] Cable was again returned as MP for Twickenham. With the election resulting in a [[hung parliament]], Cable was a key figure in coalition talks, particularly the unsuccessful negotiations with the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|entered a coalition agreement]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] on 11 May 2010, and Cable was appointed [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]] on 12 May. [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] approved his appointment as a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Counsellor]], and he formally joined the [[Privy Council]] on 13 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/may/12/general-election-2010-davidcameron|title=New government – live blog|work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|date=12 May 2010|access-date=12 May 2010|location=London|first=Haroon|last=Siddique|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217183207/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/may/12/general-election-2010-davidcameron|archive-date=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/her-majestys-government-49840 |title=Her Majesty's Government |work=Number 10 website |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister |date=12 May 2010 |access-date=12 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515034600/http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/her-majestys-government-49840 |archive-date=15 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page76.asp |title=Privy Counsellors |publisher=Privy Council Office |access-date=14 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202200122/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page76.asp |archive-date=2 December 2010 }}</ref>

In May 2010, Cable insisted the coalition government was not split over planned increases to non-business [[Capital Gains Tax]], which some thought would raise taxes on sales of second homes by 40% or 50%. Senior Conservative MPs attacked the rise as a tax on the [[middle class|middle-classes]] and a betrayal of Conservative values. Cable said that it was a "key" part of the coalition deal and there was no disagreement over it between the coalition partners.<ref name="CG tax rise">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8707931.stm |title=Capital Gains Tax: No coalition split says Vince Cable |work=BBC News |date=27 May 2010 |access-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514181758/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8707931.stm |archive-date=14 May 2014  }}</ref> Cable said the changes to Capital Gains Tax would help to fulfill the Lib Dem aim of bringing more "fairness" to the tax system: "It's very important that we have wealth taxed in the same way as income."<ref name="CG tax rise"/> He continued,

{{quote|At present it is quite wrong and it is an open invitation to tax avoidance to have people taxed at 40% or potentially 50% on their income, but only taxed at 18% on capital gains; it leads to large scale tax avoidance so for reasons of fairness and practicality, we have agreed that the capital gains tax system needs to be fundamentally reformed."<ref name="CG tax rise"/>}}

In July 2010, Cable sought to reform [[Line of credit|credit lines]] amid a "significant demand" (according to the [[Forum of Private Business]]) of smaller firms finding it harder to secure loans. Among a range of proposals published in a [[green paper]], Cable urged banks to limit bonus and [[Dividend|dividend payments]] to "pre-crisis and 2009 levels respectively", the green paper stating that such a move would enable banks to retain £10,000,000,000 of additional capital in 2010 could in turn sustain £50,000,000,000 of new lending.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7911219/Vince-Cable-threatens-tax-on-profits-if-banks-pay-staff-rather-than-lend.html|title=Vince Cable threatens tax on profits if banks pay staff rather than lend|last=Armitstead|first=Louise|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=27 July 2010|access-date=3 November 2017|issn=0307-1235|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917214001/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7911219/Vince-Cable-threatens-tax-on-profits-if-banks-pay-staff-rather-than-lend.html|archive-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>

Beginning in 2010 and continuing throughout the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition's tenure in office, Cable led the drive for [[deregulation]]; notably the "[[Red tape|Red Tape]] Challenge" to reduce existing regulation and the "One In, One Out" rule to limit any future regulation, Cable agreeing with the need for a "bonfire of regulations".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vince-cable-speech-bcc-annual-conference-central-hall-westminster-15-march-2012|title=Vince Cable Speech: BCC Annual Conference, Central Hall, Westminster, 15 March 2012 – GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=17 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918022510/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vince-cable-speech-bcc-annual-conference-central-hall-westminster-15-march-2012|archive-date=18 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-19535440/vince-cable-on-a-carefully-considered-bonfire-of-regulations|title=Vince Cable on a 'carefully considered' bonfire of regulations|work=BBC News|access-date=17 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171126191448/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-19535440/vince-cable-on-a-carefully-considered-bonfire-of-regulations|archive-date=26 November 2017}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' dubbed this as "[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]]" while the response from the business community was largely positive.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/04/vince-cable-tory-songbook|title=Vince Cable is a Neoliberal Democrat|date=4 June 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=17 July 2017|issn=0261-3077|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610180302/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/04/vince-cable-tory-songbook|archive-date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/story/2012-09-10/business-secretary-vince-cable-red-tape-health-and-safety-inspections/|title=Cable vows to cut back red tape|work=ITV News|access-date=17 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917214000/http://www.itv.com/news/story/2012-09-10/business-secretary-vince-cable-red-tape-health-and-safety-inspections/|archive-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>

After the interim report on banking by [[John Vickers]] was published in April 2011, Cable said: "I was very impressed with the quality of the analysis. It does address head on the issue of banks that are too big to fail, the dependency on the government guarantee. It makes the case for separation," he added.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8444306/Sir-John-Vickers-unveils-radical-shake-up-of-banking-industry-regulation.html|title=Sir John Vickers unveils radical shake-up of banking industry regulation|date=12 April 2011|work=Telegraph.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415003329/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8444306/Sir-John-Vickers-unveils-radical-shake-up-of-banking-industry-regulation.html|archive-date=15 April 2011|last1=Wilson|first1=Harry}}</ref>

In June 2011, Cable said "rewards for failure" were unforgivable at a time when real wages were being squeezed across the country. Speaking at the [[Association of British Insurers]] biennial conference, Cable warned he planned to bring "excessive and unjustified" executive pay under control by launching a fresh consultation. He said that although "Britain does have some world-class executives", [[investor]]s had not seen a [[Return on investment|return]] "since the turn of the century" and claimed executive pay was 120 times that of the average UK employee, whereas it was only 45 in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8592727/Vince-Cable-attacks-executive-pay-levels.html|title=Vince Cable attacks executive pay levels|date=23 June 2011|work=Telegraph.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819075206/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8592727/Vince-Cable-attacks-executive-pay-levels.html|archive-date=19 August 2013|last1=Dunkley|first1=Jamie}}</ref> Cable later revealed Government plans that would require companies to publish "more informative remuneration reports" for [[shareholder]]s.

In November 2011, Cable announced the first of several reforms to employment laws.

He revealed that at a recent meeting of European economic ministers, a group of like-minded nations had formed in making these same demands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9250316/The-tide-is-turning-against-EU-bureaucracy.html|title=The tide is turning against EU bureaucracy|last=Cable|first=Vince|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=7 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017|issn=0307-1235|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026001415/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9250316/The-tide-is-turning-against-EU-bureaucracy.html|archive-date=26 October 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, Cable refused to issue export licences for the sale of [[Paveway IV]] laser-guided bomb to the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] over concern about how they might be used in the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]]. Cable came under pressure from then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]], Defence Secretary [[Michael Fallon]] and Foreign Secretary [[Philip Hammond]] for the immediate resumption of exports. Cable stated he was then given specific assurances by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] that the UK would be given oversight of potential bombing targets to minimise the risk of civilian casualties, including involvement in decisions, to a similar level given to the [[United States]]. On this understanding, Cable agreed to issue export licences for a £200,000,000 order for the weapons. In 2016, it became apparent the Ministry of Defence did not have this level of oversight, to which Cable responded "That is categorically contrary to what I was told was going to happen."<ref name="guardian-20161104">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/mod-seriously-misled-me-on-saudi-arms-sales-says-vince-cable |title=MoD seriously misled me on Saudi arms sales, says Vince Cable |author=Nick Hopkins |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 November 2016 |access-date=5 November 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105130004/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/mod-seriously-misled-me-on-saudi-arms-sales-says-vince-cable |archive-date=5 November 2016  }}</ref><ref name="dn-20150716">{{cite news |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/breaking-news/2015/07/16/britain-diverts-bombs-destined-for-raf-to-help-saudi-fight-in-yemen/30236031/ |title=RAF Bombs Diverted to Saudis for Yemen Strikes |publisher=Gannett |work=DefenseNews |date=16 July 2015 |access-date=5 November 2016 |quote=Britain is transferring Paveway IV precision guided bombs originally earmarked for the Royal Air Force to Saudi Arabia to enable the Gulf state to build stocks of the weapon being used against targets in Yemen and Syria, sources here said.}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name="independent-20151127">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-could-be-prosecuted-for-war-crimes-over-missiles-sold-to-saudi-arabia-that-were-used-to-kill-a6752166.html |title=UK could be prosecuted for war crimes over missiles sold to Saudi Arabia that were used to kill civilians in Yemen |author=James Cusick |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 November 2015 |access-date=5 November 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106123118/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-could-be-prosecuted-for-war-crimes-over-missiles-sold-to-saudi-arabia-that-were-used-to-kill-a6752166.html |archive-date=6 November 2016  }}</ref> The sale is being investigated by the [[Committees on Arms Export Controls]].<ref name="independent-20160310">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/saudi-arabia-use-of-british-weapons-in-yemen-to-be-investigated-by-parliamentary-commission-a6922906.html |title=Saudi Arabia's use of British weapons in Yemen to be investigated by Parliamentary commission |author=Cahal Milmo |newspaper=The Independent |date=10 March 2016 |access-date=5 November 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106062102/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/saudi-arabia-use-of-british-weapons-in-yemen-to-be-investigated-by-parliamentary-commission-a6922906.html |archive-date=6 November 2016  }}</ref>

====December 2010 ''Daily Telegraph'' comments====
In late-December 2010, undercover reporters from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', posing as constituents, set up a meeting with Cable, who expressed frustration with being in the coalition and compared it to "fighting a war"; he stated he had "a nuclear option... if they push me too far then I can walk out and bring the government down and they know that", and had to "pick" his fights carefully. He also claimed the Liberal Democrats had pressed for a "very tough approach" to the UK's banks, which had been opposed by the Conservatives. He described the coalition's attempt at fast, widespread reforms (including the health service and local governments) as being a "kind of [[Maoism|Maoist]] revolution", and thought "we [the Government] are trying to do too many things... a lot of it is Tory inspired. The problem is not that they are Tory-inspired, but that they haven’t thought them through. We should be putting a brake on them." When his comments appeared in the press, Cable stated, "Naturally I am embarrassed by these comments and I regret them", before reaffirming his commitment to the Coalition Government, stating that "I am proud of what it is achieving".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/8215462/Vince-Cable-I-could-bring-down-the-Government.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110108201009/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/8215462/Vince-Cable-I-could-bring-down-the-Government-if-Im-pushed.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 January 2011 |title=Vince Cable: I could bring down the Government |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=20 December 2010 |access-date=21 December 2010 |location=London |first=Holly |last=Watt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Norman Smith |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12045792 |title=Vince Cable said he could quit coalition if pushed |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=21 December 2010 |access-date=21 December 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221051137/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12045792 |archive-date=21 December 2010  }}</ref>

====Royal Mail sale====
As Business Secretary, Cable oversaw the [[privatisation]] of the [[Royal Mail]] in 2013. The share price increased by 38% within a day and 70% in a year. The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] said that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was too cautious when setting the sale price, but that a planned postal workers' union strike also affected the government's sale price. Cable refused to apologise, and said that the Government had been right to take a cautious approach, pointing out that the sale had raised £2,000,000,000 for the taxpayer, with a further £1,500,000,000 from the 30% stake in Royal Mail which it had retained. The NAO also noted that some "priority investors", had made significant profits following the sale, having been allocated more shares in the belief that they would form part of a stable and supportive shareholder base. However, almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within a few weeks of the sale.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26819971|title=BBC News – Business Secretary Vince Cable defends Royal Mail sale|work=BBC News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406074328/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26819971|archive-date=6 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/royal-mail-vince-cable-faces-grilling-from-mps-over-privatisation-8966518.html|title=Royal Mail: Vince Cable faces grilling from MPs over privatisation|work=Evening Standard|access-date=1 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201140131/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/royal-mail-vince-cable-faces-grilling-from-mps-over-privatisation-8966518.html|archive-date=1 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

He supported the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] trade agreement (TTIP), saying in 2014 that "if you are a true believer in free trade then you want to trade more with the US." To critics such as trade unions he replied that he was "genuinely baffled" about their fears that TTIP would lead to the [[Privatization|privatisation]] of the NHS, adding that TTIP had "nothing to do with allowing the Americans to interfere with our NHS".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/02/ttip-vince-cable-ukip_n_5914040.html|title=Cable Mocks Ukip For Opposing Controversial US-EU Trade Deal|date=2 October 2014|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223232302/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/02/ttip-vince-cable-ukip_n_5914040.html|archive-date=23 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ttip-vince-cables-response-to-ttip-no-public-benefits-but-major-costs/ttip-vince-cables-detailed-response-to-ttip-no-public-benefits-but-major-costs|title=TTIP: Vince Cable's detailed response to 'TTIP: no public benefits, but major costs' - GOV.UK|access-date=22 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223171306/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ttip-vince-cables-response-to-ttip-no-public-benefits-but-major-costs/ttip-vince-cables-detailed-response-to-ttip-no-public-benefits-but-major-costs|archive-date=23 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, concerning the possibility of US-UK trade deal which might follow the United Kingdom's future exit from the European Union, Cable warned that a trade deal in such circumstances might involve agreeing to open up the NHS to private American healthcare firms.

===Brexit===
{{Update|date=October 2021}}
Cable believed [[Brexit]] might never happen. He maintained that when people saw the economic costs they would turn against it and a cross-party coalition of opponents to Brexit might develop. Cable said, "the whole question of continued membership will once again arise" if people's living standards worsened and unemployment rose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/09/brexit-may-never-happen-says-vince-cable-liberal-democrats|title=I'm beginning to think Brexit may never happen, says Vince Cable|first=Rowena Mason Deputy political|last=correspondent|date=9 July 2017|via=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144330/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/09/brexit-may-never-happen-says-vince-cable-liberal-democrats|archive-date=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="BBC9/7/2017" />

Cable called for cross-border digital services and a single EU market for [[Netflix]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/11355831/Vince-Cable-calls-for-single-EU-market-for-Netflix.html|title=Vince Cable calls for single EU market for Netflix|last=Williams|first=Christopher|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2015|access-date=25 October 2017|issn=0307-1235|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025184954/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/11355831/Vince-Cable-calls-for-single-EU-market-for-Netflix.html|archive-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>

On 23 June 2018 Cable appeared at the [[People's Vote]] march in London to mark the second anniversary of [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the referendum to leave the European Union]].In his speech he said, "keep fighting, keep hoping, we will win."<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = 'At least 100,000' march for vote on final Brexit deal | url = https://news.sky.com/story/live-thousands-marching-for-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-11414177 | work = [[Sky News]] | date = 23 June 2018 | access-date = 25 June 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180625185649/https://news.sky.com/story/live-thousands-marching-for-vote-on-final-brexit-deal-11414177 | archive-date = 25 June 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Cable maintained it "beggars belief that the army and the police are now being asked to prepare for riots in the chaotic aftermath of a botched Brexit. (...)  For the 'true believers' - the fundamentalists - the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant.  Years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union.  Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it. (...) [Theresa May] is dutifully delivering a policy she doesn't really believe in; failing in negotiations; losing public support; and all to appease a dwindling group of angry people in her party who will denounce her as a traitor, whatever she comes up with. (...) Our sympathy can only extend so far, while she puts the interests of the country second to the whims of the extremists in her party."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45553411 Sir Vince Cable: Economic pain from Brexiteers' 'erotic spasm'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918074223/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45553411 |date=18 September 2018 }} ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

===Tuition fees===
In 2017, Cable defended the [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|£9,000 per year university tuition fees cap]], claiming it would be "dangerous and stupid" and a "cheap populist gesture" to abolish tuition fees, adding that the "40% of students" who go to university should not be subsidised by the "60% who don't".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/scrapping-tuition-fees-would-be-stupid-sir-vince-cable-10934161|title=Cable: Scrapping tuition fees would be stupid|work=Sky News|access-date=13 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702142844/http://news.sky.com/story/scrapping-tuition-fees-would-be-stupid-sir-vince-cable-10934161|archive-date=2 July 2017}}</ref> The comments were criticised on social media by figures on the left, while Conservative MP [[Jo Johnson]] voiced support for Cable's stance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/michael-gove-vince-cable-anger-university-tuition-fees_uk_595a0b8be4b02734df334f0e|title=Vince Cable And Michael Gove Spark Anger Over 'Hypocritical' Tuition Fee Defences|date=3 July 2017|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=13 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703133705/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/michael-gove-vince-cable-anger-university-tuition-fees_uk_595a0b8be4b02734df334f0e|archive-date=3 July 2017}}</ref>

===The House of Lords===
In 2018, Cable wrote that he had opposed and still opposed the [[House of Lords]], the [[upper house]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], for being made up of unaccountable members. However, he expressed his appreciation for the Lords' "capacity to defeat and embarrass the government" over [[Brexit]] legislation, in which he argued the House of Lords were exercising more thorough oversight.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cable|first1=Vince|title=The House of Lords is leaping to the defence of UK democracy|url=https://www.ft.com/content/88ff8496-545a-11e8-84f4-43d65af59d43|access-date=12 May 2018|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=12 May 2018|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513053745/https://www.ft.com/content/88ff8496-545a-11e8-84f4-43d65af59d43|archive-date=13 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Cable's first wife was Olympia Rebelo, a [[Goan Catholics|Goan Roman Catholic]], whom he met "in the unromantic setting of a [[York]] mental hospital where we happened to be working as nurses during a summer holiday."<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |author=Vince Cable |title=Married to the multiculture |date=30 October 2005}}</ref> They had three children together and she completed her PhD in History at [[Glasgow University]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] DSpace Service |title=Brazilian presidential elections of the first Republic, 1889–1930 |year=1976 |last=Cable |first=Olympia |url=https://dspace.gla.ac.uk/handle/1905/293 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024336/https://dspace.gla.ac.uk/handle/1905/293 |archive-date=6 March 2012  }}</ref> Olympia was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] shortly after the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]].

She died shortly after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

In 2004, he married Rachel Wenban Smith. When appearing on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' programme in January 2009, Cable revealed that he wears the [[wedding ring]]s from both of his marriages.<ref name="Romantic">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5537291.ece |title='Two rings' Cable is Mr Romantic |last=Brooks |first=Richard |date=18 January 2009 |work=The Sunday Times |access-date=19 January 2009 |location=London}}</ref>
