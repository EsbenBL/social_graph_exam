'''Laura Nader''' (born February 16, 1930) is an American anthropologist. She has been a Professor of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] since 1960.<ref name="peacepsych200">{{cite journal | journal = Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology | year = 2004 | volume = 10| issue = 3 | pages =297–299 |  doi = 10.1207/s15327949pac1003_6 | author = Laura Nader | title = The Link Between Justice and International Law | issn = 1532-7949 }}</ref> She was the first woman to receive a [[tenure]]-track position in the department. She is also the older sister of U.S. activist, consumer advocate, and frequent third-party candidate [[Ralph Nader]], and the younger sister of community advocate [[Shafeek Nader]] and social scientist [[Claire Nader]].

==Early life and education==
Nader is a native of [[Winsted, Connecticut]]. Her father Nathra owned a restaurant/store in [[Connecticut]], which served as a place for many political discussions.  Her mother, [[Rose Nader|Rose]], was a schoolteacher who had a strong interest in justice and would express her views in letters to the press. Her older deceased brother, [[Shafeek Nader|Shafeek]]; her older sister, [[Claire Nader|Claire]] and her younger brother, [[Ralph Nader|Ralph]] have all served in public interest careers. [[Gamal Nkrumah]] (2005) profiled Dr. Nader in the weekly online news out of Egypt and commented on her loyalties to her father who emigrated from Lebanon for political reasons, “Nader is very much her father's daughter. And it was her elder brother who first suggested she read anthropology at university."<ref>{{cite journal| journal = Web Ezine| year = 2005| pages = 1–5| author = Gamal Nkrumah| title = Speaking Out in Al-Ahram Weekly| url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/726/profile.htm| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011182529/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/726/profile.htm| archivedate = 2007-10-11}}</ref>

Nader received a BA in Latin American Studies from [[Wells College]] in [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora, New York]] in 1952. She received her [[Ph.D.]] in [[Anthropology]] from [[Harvard University]] ([[Radcliffe College]]) in 1961 under the mentorship of [[Clyde Kluckhohn]].<ref name="peacepsych200"/>  Her education included fieldwork in a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] village in [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]], and later in South Lebanon.

==Research==
Nader's areas of interest include comparative [[ethnography]] of [[law]] and [[dispute resolution]], conflict, comparative family organization, the anthropology of professional mindsets and ethnology of the [[Middle East]], Mexico, [[Latin America]] and the contemporary [[United States]]. She was involved in conferences, determining the direction the study of law in society as a part of society and not insulated and isolated from other human institutions, should take as it developed. Nader edited and published essays from these conferences as well as authoring several books on the anthropology of law, establishing herself as one of the most influential figures in the development of the field. She has been a visiting professor at Yale, Stanford, and Harvard Law Schools. In the 1960s she taught a joint course at Boalt School of Law.

Some of her work focuses on [[conflict resolution]] in the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] village she studied. Nader notes that people confront each other face to face on a personal scale. Judges strive to find solutions that are balanced rather than placing one hundred percent of the blame on one party. Nader believes this reflects the society, their [[economic system]], [[hierarchy|hierarchal structure]] and any other institution or variable. In contrast, she finds that in the United States, conflict often escalates to polarized blame and violence. The group of people a person may need to confront may be large and impersonal and much more powerful than themselves. She concludes that the kinds of cases people bring to court, reflect areas of stress in the social structure of a community.

===Harmony ideology===
However, Nader has written extensively about "[[harmony ideology]]," the ideology centered around the belief that the existence of conflict is necessarily a bad or dysfunctional thing and that a healthy society is one that achieves harmony between people and minimizes conflict and confrontation. She has argued in her book ''Harmony Ideology'' that harmony ideology has been spread amongst colonized peoples around the world by missionaries prior to (and facilitating) their military colonization and that the Zapotec used it in a "counter-hegemonic" way by maintaining the appearance of harmony (while in practice engaging in a great deal of litigation) in order to prevent the Mexican government from interfering with their relative autonomy. Nader has also argued that harmony ideology has been an important basis for unsubstantiated ideas that have developed in the United States since the 1960s about a "litigation explosion" and for the development of [[Alternative Dispute Resolution]] (ADR) as a method for removing so-called "garbage cases" (for instance, the then newly appearing civil rights cases of the 1960s) from the courtroom into an arena that emphasizes harmony, compromise and the language of therapy over talk of injustice.

While Nader's career began with a strong interest in law and forms of social control, over time she became more interested in questions of cultural control and "controlling processes" (also the title of an immensely popular undergraduate course she taught from 1984 until 2010), a concept described further in her 1997 article, "Controlling Processes: Tracing the Dynamic Components of Power."<ref>{{cite web|author=Laura Nader|title=Controlling Processes - Tracing the Dynamic Components of Power|date=997|publisher=Current Anthropology|volume=38 |issue=5|pages=711–737|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/3107}}</ref>

One of Nader's best known contributions was in writing the at the time highly controversial "Up the Anthropologist--Perspectives Gained From Studying Up" in 1969, which was "one of the first calls to anthropologists to think more about the 'study of the colonizers rather than the colonized, the culture of power rather than the culture of the powerless, the culture of affluence rather than the culture of poverty.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ANTH/centennial/imprint/nader_anthropologist.html#|title=Anthropology: Berkeley's Imprint - Laura Nader - "Up the Anthropologist: Perspectives Gained from Studying Up"|publisher=Lib.berkeley.edu|accessdate=13 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118124739/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ANTH/centennial/imprint/nader_anthropologist.html|archive-date=18 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> This call led many anthropologists to begin to "study up," although many misinterpreted Nader's call and did not simultaneously study "down" and "sideways." Nader's works for the field of anthropology and discipline have led her to be described as "the embodied moral conscience of post-[[Franz Boas|Boas]]ian American anthropology.".<ref>David H. Price (2004), ''Threatening Anthropology''. p. xv. Durham: Duke University Press</ref> Her interest in the anthropology of science has developed throughout her career.

Nader has coined the term "trustanoia" to describe the antonym of paranoia and the state of Americans' feeling of trust of others. She contends that people in the United States trust that there is always someone there to take care of them, and that everyone (including legislators and politicians) acts in their interest.
