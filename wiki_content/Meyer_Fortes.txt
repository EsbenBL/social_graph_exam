{{Anthropology}}
'''Meyer Fortes''' [[British Academy|FBA]] [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|FRAI ]] (25 April 1906 – 27 January 1983) was a [[South African people|South African]]-born [[anthropologist]], best known for his work among the [[Tallensi]] and [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] in [[Ghana]].

Originally trained in [[psychology]], Fortes employed the notion of the "person" into his [[structural-functional]] analyses of [[kinship]], the family, and [[ancestor worship]] setting a standard for studies on [[African social organization]].  His celebrated book, ''Oedipus and Job in West African Religion'' (1959), fused his two interests and set a standard for comparative [[ethnology]].  He also wrote extensively on issues of the [[first born]], [[kingship]], and [[divination]].

==Life==

Fortes received his anthropological training from [[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] at the [[London School of Economics]].  Fortes also trained with [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Raymond Firth]].  Along with contemporaries [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]], Sir [[Edmund Leach]], [[Audrey Richards]], and [[Lucy Mair]], Fortes held strong [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] views that insisted upon [[empirical evidence]] in order to generate analyses of society.  His volume with [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''[[African Political Systems]]'' (1940) established the principles of segmentation and balanced opposition, which were to become the hallmarks of African political anthropology.  Despite his work in Francophone West Africa, Fortes' work on political systems was influential to other British anthropologists, especially [[Max Gluckman]] and played a role in shaping what became known as the [[Manchester school (anthropology)|Manchester school]] of social anthropology, which emphasized the problems of working in colonial Central Africa.

Fortes spent much of his career as a Reader at the [[University of Cambridge]] and was the [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology]] there from 1950–1973.

In 1963, Fortes delivered the inaugural [[Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture]] at the [[University of Rochester]], considered by many to be the most important annual lecture series in the field of Anthropology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/9/16/matory-to-join-duke-faculty-anthropology/|title=Matory To Join Duke Faculty|accessdate=July 19, 2014|date= September 16, 2008|first= Bonnie J|last= Kavoussi|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}</ref>

Fortes was President of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute|Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]] from 1965–67 and recipient of the Institute's highest honour, the Huxley Memorial Medal in 1977.
