'''Julian Jaynes''' (February 27, 1920 &ndash; November 21, 1997) was an American researcher in [[psychology]] at [[Yale]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] for nearly 25 years and best known for his 1976 book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]''.<ref name=JJ_2000>{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian | author-link=Julian Jaynes | title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin |orig-year=1976| year=2000 |isbn=0-618-05707-2 |url=http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf}}</ref> His career was dedicated to the problem of [[consciousness]], "…the difference between what others see of us and our sense of our inner selves and the deep feelings that sustain it. … Men have been conscious of the problem of consciousness almost since consciousness began."<ref name=JJ_2000 />{{rp|2}} Jaynes' solution touches on many disciplines, including [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[Archaeology|archeology]], history, religion and [[analysis]] of [[ancient literature|ancient texts]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-10-05|title=The Origin of Consciousness|url=https://evanderprice.com/2016/10/05/the-origin-of-consciousness/|access-date=2021-05-24|website=Evander Price|language=en}}</ref>

==Life==
Jaynes was born and lived in [[West Newton, Massachusetts]], son of Julian Clifford Jaynes (1854–1922), a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, and Clara Bullard Jaynes (1884–1980). He had an older sister, Helen, and a younger brother, Robert. The family had a summer home in [[Keppoch-Kinlock, Prince Edward Island|Keppoch, Prince Edward Island]], which was a place Jaynes loved, and which gave him a Canadian connection for his entire life.<ref name=WW_Bio06>{{cite encyclopedia |last1= Woodward |first1= William R. |last2= Tower |first2= June F. |title= Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness: Julian Jaynes's Bicameral Mind Theory Revisited - Julian Jaynes Society - Download PDF, epub, mobi |editor-last=Kuijsten |editor-first=Marcel |encyclopedia=Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness: Julian Jaynes's Bicameral Mind Theory Revisited |date=2006 |publisher=Julian Jaynes Society |location=Henderson, NV |pages=13–68 |volume=Chapter 1 |isbn=978-0-9790744-0-0 |url=https://www.julianjaynes.org/product/reflections-on-the-dawn-of-consciousness/|contribution=Julian Jaynes: Introducing His Life and Thought}}</ref>

In the summer of 1939 he registered to attend [[Harvard University]] but took a scholarship from [[McGill University]], where he graduated in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, and then began graduate studies at the [[University of Toronto]] to learn more about the brain. His studies were interrupted during the [[Second World War]]: because of his [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] principles, he applied for and received official recognition as a [[conscientious objector]], but refused to comply with the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|U.S. government's law]] for [[pacifism|pacifists]]; Jaynes spent three years in the [[penitentiary]] at [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]], working in the prison hospital.{{r|WW_Bio06|p=21-24}}<ref>{{Cite book|last= Gara |first= Larry | title= A Few Small Candles: War Resisters of World War II Tell Their Stories |publisher= Kent State University Press |date= 1999 |isbn=978-0-87338-621-0}}</ref> On his release in 1946 he enrolled at [[Yale University]] hoping that in animal behavior he would find clues to the beginnings of consciousness.{{r|WW_Bio06|p=24}} Jaynes received his master's degree in 1948, and then refused to accept his doctorate, again on a dispute of "principle" regarding educational credentials.{{r|WW_Bio06|p=25}} After Yale, Jaynes spent several years in England working as an actor and playwright.{{r|WW_Bio06|p=26}}

He returned to Yale in 1954, working as an Instructor and Lecturer until 1960, making significant contributions in the fields of [[experimental psychology]], [[learning]], and [[ethology]], and co-publishing some papers with [[Frank A. Beach]]. Jaynes had begun to turn his focus to [[comparative psychology]] and the [[history of psychology]], and in 1964 he became a [[research associate]] at [[Princeton University]]. There he befriended [[Edwin G. Boring]], and with plenty of time to pursue the problem of consciousness, Princeton became his academic home until 1995.{{r|WW_Bio06|p=28}}

After publishing {{em|[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]}}, Jaynes was in high demand as a lecturer and was frequently invited to speak at conferences and as a guest lecturer at other universities. In 1984, he was invited to give the plenary lecture at the Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg, Austria. He gave six major lectures in 1985 and nine in 1986. He was awarded an [[honorary PhD]] by [[Rhode Island College]] in 1979 and another from [[Elizabethtown College]] in 1985.{{r|WW_Bio06}}

Jaynes died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]], on November 21, 1997. In 2006, his biographers Woodward and Tower reported that Jaynes “felt he had not truly succeeded” in his lifelong work because, in their words, “He was right” about his feeling that “there were people who disagreed with him [who] had not really read his book or understood it.”{{r|WW_Bio06|p=47}}

==Research and motivations==
Jaynes had dedicated years of research in psychology to the problem of consciousness<ref name=Rhodes78>{{cite journal | last= Rhodes |first= Richard |date= January–February 1978 | title= Alone in the country of the mind: the origin of Julian Jaynes (Interview)  |journal= Quest/78|volume=2 |issue =1 |pages=71–78 |publisher=Ambassador International Cultural Foundation |location=Pasadena |author-link=Richard Rhodes}}</ref>{{rp|72}} and he had sought the roots of consciousness in the processes of [[learning]] and [[cognition]] that animals and humans shared in common, in accord with prevailing [[evolution]]ary assumptions that dominated mid-20th century thinking.{{r|WW_Bio06}}  He had established his reputation in the study of [[animal learning]] and natural [[ethology|animal behaviour]], and in 1968 he lectured on the history of [[comparative psychology]] at the [[National Science Foundation]] Summer Institute. In September 1969 he gave his first public address on his “new theory of consciousness” at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]].{{r|WW_Bio06}}{{rp|31–34}}

His “radical approach”<ref name=Morriss78>{{cite journal | last= Morriss |first= James E. | title= Reflections on Julian Jaynes's THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND: An Essay Review |pages= 314–327 |url= http://www.generalsemantics.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/articles/etc/35-3-morriss.pdf |journal= ETC: A Review of General Semantics |volume=35 |issue =3 |year= 1978 }}</ref> explained the phenomena of [[introspection]] as dependent on culture and language, especially [[metaphors]], more than on the physiology of the brain. This was a challenge to mainstream assumptions of 20th century research, especially to those that justified looking for origins of consciousness in evolution. It was also a challenge to the [[Behaviorism|behaviorists]], who, “under the tutelage of [[J. B. Watson|John Watson]], solved the problem of consciousness by ignoring it.”{{r|Morriss78}}{{rp|315}} What they had 'ignored' were the problems of [[introspection]] and the weaknesses of introspectionist methods of 19th century psychologists. Those 20th century thinkers who questioned the existence of introspection never doubted the existence of sense [[perception]], however; they clearly distinguished between the two.{{r|JJ_2000|p=448}} On the other hand, in later years Jaynes's approach had become "radical" for emphasizing the distinction. Jaynes differed with those who ignored it, for example [[Stuart Sutherland]], who simply defined consciousness as '[[awareness]]'.<ref name=Sutherland>{{cite book |author=Stuart Sutherland |title=Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology |publisher=Macmillan |chapter=Consciousness |date=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-38829-7|author-link=Stuart Sutherland }}</ref>  Jaynes acknowledged that his whole argument was “contradictory to the usual and [...] superficial views of consciousness”, and he insisted that “the most common error” people make “is to confuse consciousness with perception.”{{r|JJ_2000|p=447}}
<blockquote>But there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until careful distinctions have been made between what is introspectable and all the hosts of other neural abilities we have come to call [[cognition]]. Consciousness is not the same as cognition and should be sharply distinguished from it.{{r|JJ_2000|p=447}} </blockquote>

In the years following, Jaynes talked more about how consciousness began, presenting "his talk [...] widely, as word of his slightly outrageous but tantalizing theory had spread.”{{r|WW_Bio06}}{{rp|37}} In 1972 he had delivered a paper, “The Origin of Consciousness”, at Cornell University, writing: “For if consciousness is based on language, then it follows that only humans are conscious, and that we became so at some historical epoch after language was evolved.”{{r|WW_Bio06}}{{rp|38}} This took Jaynes, as he put it, directly into “. . . the earliest writings of mankind to see if we can find any hints as to when this important invention of consciousness might have occurred.”{{r|WW_Bio06}}{{rp|38}} He went to ancient texts searching for early evidence of consciousness, and found what he believed to be evidence of remarkably recent {{em|voice-hearing without consciousness}}. In the [[Greek mythology|semi-historical Greek epic]] the ''[[Iliad]]'' Jaynes found “. . .the earliest writing of men in a language that we can really comprehend, [which] when looked at objectively, reveals a very different mentality from our own.”{{r|JJ_2000|p=82}} In a 1978 interview, [[Richard Rhodes]] reported that Jaynes “took up the study of [[Homeric Greek|Greek]] to trace [[Mycenaean Greek|Greek]] words for mind back to their origins. By the time he got to [[Iliad|the ''Iliad'']], the words had become concrete, but there is no word for mind in the ''Iliad'' at all.”{{r|Rhodes78}}{{rp|74}}

==Publications and theories==
Jaynes's one and only book, published in 1976, is [[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]. The topic of {{em|[[consciousness]]}} – "the human ability to introspect"<ref name="GVB-Intro">{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuijsten |editor1-first=Marcel |last1=Kuijsten |first1=Marcel |year=2016 |chapter=Introduction |title= Gods, Voices and the Bicameral Mind: The Theories of Julian Jaynes |publisher=Julian Jaynes Society |isbn=978-0-9790744-3-1|edition=First |location=Henderson NV }}</ref> - is introduced by reviewing prior efforts to explain its problematic nature: those efforts, as one of Jaynes's early critics has acknowledged, add up to a "spectacular history of failure".<ref name="Jones79">Jones, William Thomas (1979) Mr. Jaynes and the bicameral mind: a case study in the sociology of belief. Humanities Working Paper, 23. California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20090714-105138181</ref> Abandoning the assumption that consciousness is innate, Jaynes explains it instead as a learned behavior that "arises&nbsp;... from language, and specifically from [[metaphor]]."<ref name="Jones79" /> With this understanding, Jaynes then demonstrates that ancient texts and archeology can reveal a history of human mentality alongside the histories of other cultural products. His analysis of the evidence leads him not only to place the origin of consciousness during the [[2nd millennium BCE]] but also to hypothesize the existence of an older non-conscious "mentality that he calls the [[wikt:bicameral mind|bicameral mind]], referring to the brain’s two hemispheres".<ref name="Dawn-intro">{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuijsten |editor1-first=Marcel |last1=Kuijsten |first1=Marcel |year=2006 |chapter=Introduction |title= Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness: Julian Jaynes's Bicameral Mind Theory Revisited  |publisher=Julian Jaynes Society |isbn=978-0-9790744-0-0|edition=First |location=Henderson NV }}</ref>

Jaynes wrote an extensive afterword for the 1990 edition of his book,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.julianjaynes.org/resources/books/ooc/en/the-auguries-of-science-2/|title=Afterword}}</ref> in which he addressed criticisms and clarified that his theory has four separate hypotheses: 1) consciousness is based on and accessed by language; 2) the non-conscious bicameral mind is based on verbal hallucinations; 3) the breakdown of bicameral mind precedes consciousness, but the dating is variable; 4) the 'double brain' of bicamerality is based on the two [[cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres of the cerebral cortex]] being organized differently from today's [[Lateralization of brain function|functional lateralization]]. He also expanded on the impact of consciousness on imagination and memory, notions of The Self, emotions, anxiety, guilt, and sexuality.
