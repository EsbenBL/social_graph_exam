===Presidency at FEE===
Skousen served as president of the free market nonprofit [[Foundation for Economic Education]] (FEE) from 2001 to 2002.

Skousen's brief tenure as president of [[Foundation for Economic Education|FEE]] ended on a controversial note when he resigned in late 2002 at the request of the organization's board of trustees. This move followed Skousen's decision to invite, as keynote speaker for FEE's annual Liberty Banquet, [[New York City]] Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]]. Giuliani proved to be an extremely unpopular choice among many of the organization's board members as well as several prominent libertarians.
