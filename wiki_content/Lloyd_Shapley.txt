'''Lloyd Stowell Shapley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|æ|p|l|i}}; June 2, 1923 – March 12, 2016) was an American [[mathematician]] and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[economist]]. He contributed to the fields of [[mathematical economics]] and especially [[game theory]]. Shapley is generally considered one of the most important contributors to the development of game theory since the work of [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]].<ref>Roth, A.E., Introduction to the Shapley Value, in "The Shapley Value: Essays in Honor of Lloyd S. Shapley", Cambridge University Press, 1988.</ref> With [[Alvin E.

== Life and career ==

Lloyd Shapley was born on June 2, 1923, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], one of the sons of astronomers [[Harlow Shapley]] and [[Martha Betz Shapley]], both from Missouri.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/27/obituaries/martha-betz-shapley.html|title=MARTHA BETZ SHAPLEY|date=January 27, 1981|work=The New York Times}}</ref> He attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and was a student at Harvard when he was drafted in 1943. He served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in [[Chengdu, China]] and received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] decoration for breaking the Soviet weather code.<ref name=int>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/shapley-interview.html|title=Lloyd S. Shapley – Interview|publisher=Nobel Media AB| access-date = March 13, 2016}}</ref>

After the war, Shapley returned to Harvard and graduated with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in mathematics in 1948. After working for one year at the [[RAND Corporation]], he went to [[Princeton University]] where he received a Ph.D. in 1953<ref name=princ>{{cite web | url = https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S35/03/02E57/index.xml | title = Princeton alumnus Shapley wins Nobel Prize | date= October 15, 2012 | access-date = March 13, 2016|publisher = [[Princeton University]]}}</ref> based on the thesis "Additive and non-additive set functions"{{r|AWT_LSShapley}}.<ref name=PhDLink>{{cite web

|title=Additive and non-additive set functions

}}</ref> His thesis and post-doctoral work introduced the [[Shapley value]] and the [[core (game theory)|core]] solution in [[game theory]].  Shapley defined game theory as "a mathematical study of conflict and cooperation." After graduating, he remained at Princeton for a short time before going back to the RAND corporation from 1954 to 1981. In 1950, while a graduate student, Shapley invented the board game ''[[So Long Sucker]]'', along with [[Mel Hausner]], [[John Forbes Nash]], and [[Martin Shubik]].<ref>Hausner, M., Nash, J. F., Shapley, L. S. & Shubik, M., (1964), "So Long Sucker, A Four-Person Game", ''Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior'', John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.</ref> Israeli economist [[Robert Aumann]] said Shapley was "the greatest game theorist of all time."<ref name="Hagerty, James 2016">Hagerty, James, Lloyd Shapley: 1923-2016, Wall Street Journal, March 19–20, 2016, p. A7.</ref>

[[File:Lloyd Shapley 2 2012.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.85|Lloyd Shapley in Stockholm 2012]]
From 1981 until his death, Shapley was a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), serving at the time of his death as a professor emeritus there, affiliated with the Mathematics and Economics departments. He died on March 12, 2016, in [[Tucson, Arizona]], after suffering from a [[broken hip]], at the age of 92.<ref name=":0" />

Shapley was an expert [[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]] player, and an avid baseball fan.<ref name="Hagerty, James 2016"/>

== Contribution ==

Along with the [[Shapley value]], [[stochastic games]], the [[Bondareva–Shapley theorem]] (which implies that [[convex games]] have non-empty cores), the [[Shapley–Shubik power index]] (for [[Weighted voting|weighted]] or block voting power), the [[Gale–Shapley algorithm]] for the [[stable marriage problem]], the concept of a [[potential game]] (with [[Dov Monderer]]), the [[Aumann–Shapley value|Aumann–Shapley]] pricing, the [[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi]]–Shapley solution, the [[Snow–Shapley theorem]] for matrix games, and the [[Shapley–Folkman lemma|Shapley–Folkman lemma & theorem]] bear his name.<ref name=aea/> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', Shapley "may have thought of himself as a mathematician, but he cannot avoid being remembered for his huge contributions to economics".<ref name=econ>{{cite news | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/03/matchmaker-heaven | title = Matchmaker in heaven – Lloyd Shapley, a Nobel laureate in economics, has died | work = [[The Economist]] | access-date = March 13, 2016 | date = March 13, 2016}}</ref>  The [[American Economic Association]] noted that Shapley was "one of the giants of game theory and economic theory".<ref name=aea>{{cite web | url = https://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Shapley_bio.pdf | access-date = March 13, 2016 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | title = Lloyd Shapley | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160316223210/https://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Shapley_bio.pdf | archive-date = March 16, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Besides, his early work with R. N. Snow and [[Samuel Karlin]] on [[matrix game]]s was so complete that little has been added since. He has been instrumental in the development of [[utility theory]], and it was he who laid much of the groundwork for the solution of the problem of the existence of [[Von Neumann-Morgenstern solution|Von Neumann–Morgenstern stable sets]]. His work with [[Michael Maschler|M. Maschler]] and B. Peleg on the kernel and the nucleolus, and his work with [[Robert Aumann]] on non-atomic games and on long-term competition have all appeared in economic theory.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qWyjAQAAQBAJ&q=shapley+%22utility+theory%22&pg=PA385 | title = Economic Thinkers: A Biographical Encyclopedia | page = 385 | last = Diertele | first = David A. | access-date = 2016-03-13| isbn = 9780313397479 | date = 2013-08-08 }}</ref>

Shapley argued with his sons about whether he should accept the Nobel Prize at all.  He opined that his father, the astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]], deserved it more.  His sons persuaded him to accept it and accompanied him to [[Stockholm, Sweden|Stockholm]].<ref>Hagerty, James, Lloyd Shapley: 1923-2016, Wall Street Journal, March 19–20, 2016, p.A7</ref>
