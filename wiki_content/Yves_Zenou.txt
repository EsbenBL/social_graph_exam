'''Yves Zenou''' is a French-Swedish economist. He is a Professor at [[Monash University]] and holds the Richard Snape Chair in Business and Economics.<ref name=MON>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/|title=Yves Zenou}}</ref>

Zenou's main research focus is in the field of network economics. He has applied his research to crime, labor, development and other issues in economics. He is the author of ‘Urban Labor Economics’ and ‘Economic Analyses of Social Networks’ and has published various research articles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qDXAKDkAAAAJ&hl=en|title=Yves Zenou - Google Scholar}}</ref>

He was a co-editor of ''Regional Science and Urban Economics'' for ten years, between 2007 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/regional-science-and-urban-economics/vol/42/issue/5|title=Special issue on "Migration and Development"}}</ref> He has been an Associate editor of many journals such as the ''Journal of the European Economic Association'', ''Journal of Urban Economics'', ''Scandinavian Journal of Economics'' and ''Journal of Public Economic Theory''. He has also obtained many research grants from the Australian Research Council, the Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse, the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, the Vetenskapsrådet, the Norface Research Program, and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.<ref name=MON/>

==Education==
Zenou completed his master's degree in economics and econometrics in 1987 from the [[Paris Nanterre University]]. In 1991, he earned his PhD in economics from Panthéon-Assas University. In 1998, he completed the "Agrégation des Facultés de Droit et de Sciences Economiques", the exam for becoming a professor in [[France]].<ref name=MON/>

==Career==
Zenou started his career as an assistant professor at Panthéon-Assas University in 1992. Then, he became a research fellow at the [[Center for Operations Research and Econometrics]] (CORE), [[Louvain-La-Neuve]], Belgium, from 1994 to 1996. He became an associate professor from 1996 till 1998 at Pantheon-Assas University. Then, he became a professor of economics at the Université du Maine, Le Mans, France in 1998 until 2000. He was a professor of economics at the University of Southampton in the UK from 2000 till 2003, a senior research fellow at [[Research Institute of Industrial Economics]] (IFN) from 2003 till 2007, and a professor of economics at [[Stockholm University]] from 2007 until 2016.<ref name=MON/>

In 2016, Zenou joined Monash University as a professor and was appointed the Richard Snape Chair in Business and Economics. Zenou has research associations with the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN), the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), and the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CReAM).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cream-migration.org/personneldetail.php?id=96|title=External Research Fellow}}</ref>

== Research ==
Zenou has been working in different areas in economics such as urban economics, labor economics, development economics, game theory, network economics, crime, segregation, discrimination, etc. both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. He developed the concept of ‘key player’ in network economics to help determine the individuals/agents that are the key actors in an economy. In crime, key players are the criminals who, once removed, lead to the highest reduction in total criminal activity. Originally developed for analyzing criminal activity, the key player theory is proving useful across multiple settings, such that of banking, crime, financial markets, macroeconomics, developing economies, and R&D issues. By identifying these key players, the outcomes were found to be more efficient than when targeting other agents such as the most active ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/storyworks/future/masters-of-change/social-networks-and-human-behaviour|title=A Key Player; The network economics expert and his innovative theory}}</ref>

Zenou researched in 1999 about the reasons why rich families tend to live in the center of European cities such as Paris and why poor families tend to reside in the center of American cities such as downtown Detroit. Using an amenity-based theory, Zenou and his co-authors showed that the location of different income groups is related to the spatial pattern of amenities (such as restaurants, theatres, parks, etc.) in a city. Zenou takes the example of Paris (where there is a higher average income in the center) and compares with Detroit (where there is a lower average area income in the central area). The main result is to show that the rich in European cities are sensitive to the amenities provided by the center of the cities and are, therefore, more inclined to live in a city's central area if it has a greater amenity advantage over the suburbs. The opposite is true is American cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292198000191|title=Why is central Paris rich and downtown Detroit poor?: An amenity-based theory}}</ref>

In 2009, Zenou published an article about ‘Peer Effects and Social Networks in Education’. This was the first article that investigated how the position in the network of each student affects his or her education outcome. It shows that being more central in a network does have a positive impact on the grades of the students because of the complementarity of study efforts between different peers in the same classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/76/4/1239/1590174|title=Peer Effects and Social Networks in Education}}</ref>

In 2009, he wrote a book entitled ''Urban Land Economics''. This book proposes a theoretical overview of the links between urban and labor economics. Zenou discusses various models of urban labor theory of economics and then sheds light to the practical applications of this theory while analyzing the urban ghettos and the ethnic minorities residing there. Search-matching models, efficiency-wage models, urban ghettos and labor markets are discussed in detail. Yasuhiro Sato while reviewing the book wrote that "This informative book sets the stage for further theoretical and empirical work on urban labor markets." Sato also states that "the book provides a framework for further empirical tests of hypotheses concerning the urban labor market. It would be safe to say that Urban Labor Economics has opened a door to new and interesting work, both theoretical and empirical."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.214403.1418309238%21/menu/standard/file/RSUE%20Review%20Sato.pdf|title=Regional Science and Urban Economics}}</ref> Rouwendal and Ommeren called the book "competently written" and "compulsory reading for anyone in Urban Land Economics". According to them "Zenou presents each model masterfully, confirming his reputation as a skillful model builder. The variety of approaches serves to analyze a problem from various points of view."  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.214404.1418309319%21/menu/standard/file/JRS_van%20Ommeren%20and%20Rouwendal_2011.pdf|title=Book Reviews}}</ref> While reviewing the book in the Journal of Economic Geography, Duranton calls it "a lone star in the literature" and "a demanding read". About the content written in the book, Duranton states that "The first two appendices about the monocentric model and dynamic optimization are remarkable. I am actually using them in my own teaching" and writes that "Yves Zenou’s book is a worthy heir" to a book written by Masa Fujita about the monocentric model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.214408.1418309476%21/menu/standard/file/JEOG_Review_Duranton_2010.pdf|title=Urban Labor Economics}}</ref>

With Matt O. Jackson, Zenou authored another book called ''Economic Analyses of Social Networks'' in 2013. This is a collection of the most important articles in the field of network economics, both from an empirical and theoretical perspective, and also in applied fields, such as education, crime, labor, and industrial organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/b/elg/eebook/14958.html|title=Economic Analyses of Social Networks}}</ref>
