'''Jonathan Holmes Gruber''' (born September 30, 1965) is an American professor of economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he has taught since 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/gruberj|title= Jonathan Gruber|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= MIT Economics|access-date=December 16, 2014}}</ref> He is also the director of the Health Care Program at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], where he is a research associate. An associate editor of both the ''Journal of Public Economics'' and the ''[[Journal of Health Economics]]'', Gruber has been heavily involved in crafting [[public health policy]].

He has been described as a key architect<ref name="everything you wanted to know">{{cite news |title=Everything you wanted to know about health reform, in one comic book |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-health-reform-in-one-comic-book/2011/10/11/gIQAN4AzcL_blog.html |work=Wonkblog |publisher =The Washington Post |first=Sarah |last=Kliff |date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> of both the 2006 [[Massachusetts health care reform]], sometimes referred to as "Romneycare", and the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], sometimes referred to as the "ACA" and "Obamacare". He became the focus of media and political controversy in late 2014 when videos surfaced in which he made controversial statements about the legislative process, marketing strategies, and public perception surrounding the passage of the ACA.

==Early life==
Gruber was born on September 30, 1965, the son of Martin Jay Gruber and Ellie Gruber. His father is Professor Emeritus of Finance at the [[New York University Stern School of Business]], having taught there for more than 40 years. Jonathan Gruber was raised in the New York suburb of [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]]. He completed his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[economics]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1987 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1992, with a thesis titled ''Changes in the Structure of Employer-Provided Health Insurance''.<ref>{{cite book|date=1992|title=Changes in the structure of employer-provided health insurance|first=Jonathan|last=Gruber|id={{ProQuest|304000122}}}}</ref> He has 3 children, Rachel Gruber, Jack Gruber, and Ava Gruber.

==Academic research career==
Gruber began his career as an assistant professor of economics at MIT in 1992.<ref name="economics.mit.edu">{{cite web| url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/9877| access-date=July 25, 2014|title=Gruber MIT bio}}</ref> He is also a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].<ref name="economics.mit.edu"/> Gruber's research has focused on public finance and health economics. He has published over 150 research articles and has had his hand in editing six research volumes. He has written ''Public Finance and Public Policy'', ''Health Care Reform'' and ''Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revived Economic Growth and the American Dream'' (with Simon Johnson). In 2006 he won the American Society of Health Economists Inaugural Medal for the best health economist in the nation aged 40 and under.<ref>{{cite web |title=MIT Economics > Jonathan Gruber |url=https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/gruberj/short}}</ref>

From 2003-2006, Gruber was an essential architect in Massachusetts' health reform effort and became an inaugural member of the Health Connector Board whose job was to oversee these efforts. Later, Gruber was involved in the creation of the Affordable Care Act and Patient Protection Act. He worked closely with the Obama administration and Congress as a technical consultant.

==Government work and consulting==
During the 1997–98 academic year, Gruber was on leave as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].

===Massachusetts health care reform===
From 2003-06 he was one of the architects of [[Massachusetts health care reform]], also known as "Romneycare."<ref name="a thank you">{{cite news|title=Viewpoint: A thank you to Gov. Mitt Romney for signing Massachusetts' historic health care reform|url=http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/04/viewpoint_a_thank_you_to_gov_m.html|first=Jonathan|last=Gruber|work=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]]|date=April 11, 2012}}</ref>  In 2006 he became an inaugural member of the Health Connector Board, the main implementing body for that effort.

Gruber was ousted from the Massachusetts Health Connector in February 2015.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Wheaton|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/jonathan-gruber-massachusetts-obamacare-115523.html|title=Jonathan Gruber among 4 ousted from Massachusetts Obamacare board|date=February 25, 2015|work=Politico}}</ref>

===Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act===
During the 2008 election he was a consultant to the [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]], [[John Edwards|Edwards]] and [[Barack Obama|Obama]] presidential campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leighbureau.com/speakers/JGruber|title=Looking at the National Health Care Debate through a Massachusetts Lens|last=Groves|first=Victoria|date=May 2, 2011|website=[[Harvard Kennedy School]]|access-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

From 2009-10, Gruber served as a technical consultant to the Obama Administration and worked with both the administration and [[U.S. Congress]] to help craft the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], often referred to as the ACA or "Obamacare". The Act was signed into law in March 2010, and Gruber has been described as an "architect", "writer", and "consultant" of the legislation. He was widely interviewed and quoted during the legislation's roll-out.<ref>{{cite news|first=Catherine|last=Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/business/jonathan-gruber-health-cares-mr-mandate.html?pagewanted=all|title=Academic Built Case for Mandate in Health Care Law|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

===Vermont health care reform===
In 2010 and 2011, Gruber was involved in crafting and advocating for the [[Vermont health care reform|Single-Payer and Unified Health System]] bill in [[Vermont]], which passed in May 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obamacare Architect To Help Vermont Design Single Payer|url=http://digital.vpr.net/post/obamacare-architect-help-vermont-design-single-payer|first=Peter|last=Hirschfield|work=[[Vermont Public Radio]]|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref><ref name="proposal">[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/jfo/healthcare/Hsiao%20Proposal%20-%20public.pdf "The Vermont Option: Achieving Affordable Universal Health Care"], William Hsaio, Steven Kappel, Jonathan Gruber, and a team of health policy analysts, June 21, 2010.</ref>

The bill established Green Mountain Care, which aimed to be the first-ever state-level [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States by the time it was to have kicked in fully in 2017. Green Mountain Care was cancelled in December 2014 by Governor [[Peter Shumlin]] saying its projected costs were becoming too high.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/governor-abandons-single-payer-health-care-plan-225042240.html "Governor abandons single-payer health care plan"], yahoo.com, December 17, 2014.</ref>

Jonathan Gruber was later sued by the state of Vermont for falsely claiming hours worked by his research assistant which he invoiced the state for. He denies the claims and settled out of court forfeiting almost $100,000.

==Writing==
Gruber has published more than 140 research articles (the majority of which were for NBER) and has edited six research volumes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nber.org/authors/jonathan_gruber|author=Jonathan Gruber|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|title=NBER Working Papers by Jonathan Gruber|access-date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

He is a co-editor of the ''Journal of Public Economics'', an associate editor of the ''Journal of Health Economics'', and the author of ''Public Finance and Public Policy''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bcs.worthpublishers.com/gruber3e/#t_544924____|title=Worth Publishers Student Center for Public Finance and Policy|publisher=Bcs.worthpublishers.com|access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> In 2011, he wrote ''Health Care Reform: What It Is, Why It's Necessary, How It Works'', delineating the Affordable Care Act, and illustrated by Nathan Schreiber.<ref name="everything you wanted to know"/>

Gruber's published works include:
* In 1999, the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' published "Abortion legalization and child living circumstances: who is the 'marginal child'?"<ref name="QJE2">{{cite journal |last1=Gruber |first1=J. |last2=Levine |first2=P. |last3=Staiger |first3=D. |title=Abortion Legalization and Child Living Circumstances: Who is the "Marginal Child"? |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |year=1999 |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=263–91 |doi=10.1162/003355399556007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.493.8996 |s2cid=11326452 }}</ref> which suggests that the legalized abortion has a selective effect for reducing the birth of "marginal children" that saved the government over $14 billion in welfare payments through 1994.
* Writing for the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] in 2002, Gruber worked together with [[Sendhil Mullainathan]] on a paper titled “Do [[Cigarette taxes in the United States|Cigarette Taxes]] Make Smokers Happier", which did find an improvement in smokers’ psychological state because higher taxes were a disincentive to smoking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mullainathan|first1=Sendhil|last2=Gruber|first2=Jonathan |title=Do Cigarette Taxes Make Smokers Happier? |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 8872 |date=April 2002 |doi=10.3386/w8872 |doi-access=free }}</ref>
* On February 15, 2006, the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] published an article by Gruber entitled "The Cost and Coverage Impact of the President's Health Insurance Budget Proposals"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbpp.org/2-15-06health.htm|journal=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=The Cost and Coverage Impact of The President's Health Insurance Budget Proposals|date=February 15, 2006|access-date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>
* In a December 4, 2008 editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Medicine for the Job Market", he claimed that expanding health insurance, even in difficult financial times, would stimulate the economy.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|date=December 4, 2008|title=Medicine for the Job Market|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04gruber.html}}</ref>
* In an article for the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation in April 2010, "Taxing Sin to Modify Behavior and Raise Revenue", Gruber advocated a sort of "[[sin tax]]" for the obese. He uses the model of [[Cigarette taxes in the United States|cigarette taxes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/ExpertVoices_Gruber_April2010.pdf|title=Taxing Sin to Modify Behavior and Raise Revenue|date=April 2010|access-date=February 7, 2015}}</ref>
* On February 9, 2011, the [[Center for American Progress]] published an article by Gruber titled "Health Care Reform Without the Individual Mandate", analyzing the health insurance coverage impacts of alternative policy options for encouraging purchase of health insurance under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], including the mandate, a late penalty, and automatic enrollment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/02/gruber_mandate.html|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|date=February 9, 2011|title=Health Care Reform Without the Individual Mandate|work=American Progress|access-date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

==Awards==
In 2006, Gruber received the American Society of Health Economists Inaugural Medal for the best health economist in the nation aged 40 and under.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.mit.edu/shass/soundings/issue_06f/honors.html|title=Honors & awards – Fall 2006 Soundings|publisher=Web.mit.edu|access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> He was elected a member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nasi.org/about/spotlight/jonathan-gruber|title=National Academy of Social Insurance|publisher=National Academy of Social Insurance|access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> In 2009 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the [[American Economic Association]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 2011 he was named “One of the Top 25 Most Innovative and Practical Thinkers of Our Time” by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' Magazine. In both 2006 and 2012 he was rated as one of the top 100 most powerful people in health care in the United States by ''Modern Healthcare'' Magazine.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Controversies==
===Non-disclosure of HHS contract===
In January 2010, after news emerged that Gruber was under a $297,000 contract with the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], while at the same time promoting the [[Obama administration]]'s [[health care reform]] policies, some commentators suggested a [[conflict of interest]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/08/economist-contract-health-department-touting-reform|title=Economist Was Under Contract With HHS While Touting Health Reform Bill| work=Fox News|date=January 8, 2010|access-date=November 15, 2013|author=Berger, Judson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ronald|last=Brownstein|date=January 8, 2010|title=On Jonathan Gruber's Conflict Of Interest|website=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/01/on-jonathan-grubers-conflict-of-interest/33215}}</ref> [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Krugman|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/jonathan-gruber|title=Jonathan Gruber|work=The New York Times|date=January 11, 2010|access-date=September 3, 2014}}</ref> argued that, although Gruber didn't always disclose his HHS connections, the times when he didn't were no big deal. In response to Krugman's contention, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'''s [[Glenn Greenwald]] wrote, "What will make it impossible to effectively call out wrongdoing by future corrupt administrations (by which Krugman seems to mean: Republican administrations) is the willingness of some people to tolerate and defend corruption when done by 'their side.'"<ref>{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Greenwald|url= http://www.salon.com/2010/01/16/krugman_5|title=Krugman, Gruber and non-disclosure issues|publisher=Salon Media Group|date=January 16, 2010|access-date=February 22, 2015}}</ref>

===Description of ACA subsidies===
One heavily scrutinized part of the ACA reads that subsidies should be given to healthcare recipients who are enrolled "through an Exchange established by the State". Some have read this to mean that subsidies can be given only in states that have chosen to create their own healthcare exchanges, and do not use the federal exchange, while the Obama administration says that the wording applies to all states. This dispute was part of a series of lawsuits referred to collectively as ''[[King v. Burwell]]''. In July 2014, two separate recordings of Gruber, both from January 2012, surfaced in which he seemed to contradict the administration's position. In one, Gruber states, in response to an audience question, that "if you’re a state and you don’t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their [[tax credits]]",<ref>{{cite web|last=Radia|first=Ryan|title=Obamacare Architect Admitted in 2012 States without Exchanges Lose Subsidies|date=July 24, 2014|url=https://cei.org/blog/obamacare-architect-admitted-2012-states-without-exchanges-lose-subsidies|website=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]}}</ref> while in the other he says, "if your governor doesn't set up an exchange, you're losing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits to be delivered to your citizens".<ref>{{cite news|last=Serwer|first=Adam|title=Adviser's past remarks could give Obamacare a headache|date=July 26, 2014|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jonathan-gruber-video-obamacare#53439|website=msnbc.com}}</ref> When these recordings emerged, Gruber called these statements mistaken, describing them as "just a speak-o—you know, like a typo".<ref name="just a mistake">{{cite news|title=Jonathan Gruber: 'It Was Just a Mistake'|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118851/jonathan-gruber-halbig-says-quote-exchanges-was-mistake|work=The New Republic|first=Jonathan|last=Cohn|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>

==="Grubergate" videos controversy===
In November 2014, a series of videos emerged of Gruber speaking about the ACA at different events, from 2010 to 2013, in ways that proved to be controversial; the controversy became known in the press as "Grubergate".<ref>{{cite news|title='Grubergate' shows the sad state of debate on Obamacare|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-skocpol-obamacare-gruber-20141210-story.html|first=Theda|last=Skocpol|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> In the first, most widely publicized video, taken at a panel discussion about the ACA at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in October 2013, Gruber said the bill was deliberately written "in a tortured way" to disguise the fact that it creates a system by which "healthy people pay in and sick people get money". He said this obfuscation was needed due to "the stupidity of the American voter" in ensuring the bill's passage. Gruber said the bill's inherent "lack of transparency is a huge political advantage" in selling it.<ref name="YouTube">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G790p0LcgbI|title=GRUBER: "Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage"|publisher=American Commitment|date=October 13, 2013|access-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref> The comments caused significant controversy.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kathleen|last=Parker|date=November 12, 2014|title=Obama and the 'Stupidity of the American Voter|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=November 12, 2014|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-barack-obama-affordable-care-act-stupidity-perspec-1113-jm-20141112-story.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ACA Architect: 'The Stupidity Of The American Voter' Led Us To Hide Obamacare's True Costs From The Public |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/11/10/aca-architect-the-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-led-us-to-hide-obamacares-tax-hikes-and-subsidies-from-the-public|work=Forbes|first=Avik|last=Roy|date=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Jose A.|last=DelReal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/11/11/obamacare-consultant-under-fire-for-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-comment|title=Obamacare consultant under fire for 'stupidity of the American voter' comment|work=Washington Post|access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref>

In two subsequent videos, Gruber was shown talking about the decision (which he attributed to [[John Kerry]]) to have the bill tax insurance companies instead of patients (the so-called "Cadillac tax"), which he called fundamentally the same thing economically but more palatable politically. In one video, he stated that "the American people are too stupid to understand the difference" between the two approaches, while in the other he said that the switch worked due to "the lack of economic understanding of the American voter".<ref>{{cite news|title=Obamacare: Voters, are you stupid?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/14/politics/obamacare-voters-stupid-explainer|work=[[CNN]]|first=Jeremy|last=Diamond|date=November 18, 2014}}</ref>

In another video, taken in 2010, Gruber expressed doubts that the ACA would significantly reduce health care costs, although he noted that lowering costs played a major part in the way the legislation had been promoted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obamacare architect discussed misleading public in 4th newly uncovered video|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/13/politics/tapper-gruber|work=CNN|first=Jake|last=Tapper|date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> In another video, taken in 2011, Gruber again talks about manipulation behind the "Cadillac tax", this time also stating that the tax is designed so that, though it begins by affecting only 8% of insurance plans, it will "over the next 20 years" come to apply to nearly all employer-provided health plans.<ref name="obama promised">{{cite news|title=Obama promised Obamacare wouldn't do exactly what Gruber says it will do|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/18/politics/gruber-obamacare-promises|work=[[CNN]]|first=Jake|last=Tapper|date=November 19, 2014}}</ref> Journalist [[Jake Tapper]] noted that Gruber's description of the "Cadillac tax" directly contradicted a promise that Obama had made before the bill was passed.<ref name="obama promised"/>

After the first of these videos came out, Gruber apologized and conceded he "spoke inappropriately".<ref>{{cite news|title=Jonathan Gruber to MSNBC: My 'Stupidity of the American Voter' Remark was Inappropriate|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jonathan-gruber-to-msnbc-my-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-remark-was-inappropriate|work=Mediaite|first=Eddie|last=Scarry|date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

Some defenders of the ACA, such as [[Jonathan Cohn]], called Gruber's statements about Americans "wrong and inappropriate" while maintaining that the trickery of which Gruber spoke was standard procedure in passing legislation in Washington, D.C., and thus not a cause for scandal.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Jon Gruber's Quotes Really Tell Us About Obamacare—and American Politics|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120311/jonathan-gruber-and-obamacare-what-his-quotes-really-tell-us|first=Jonathan|last=Cohn|work=The New Republic|date=November 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Obamacare Debate Was One of the Most Transparent in Recent Memory|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120251/jonathan-gruber-obamacare-comments-get-aca-history-wrong|first=Brian|last=Beutler|work= [[The New Republic]]|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> Opponents of the Act, on the other hand, were harsher in their criticism: ''[[National Review|National Review Online]]'' editor and conservative commentator [[Rich Lowry]] said the videos were emblematic of "the progressive mind, which values complexity over simplicity, favors indirect taxes and impositions on the American public so their costs can be hidden, and has a dim view of the average American",<ref>{{cite news|title=Thank You, Jonathan Gruber|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/392672/thank-you-jonathan-gruber-rich-lowry|work=National Review|first=Rich|last=Lowry|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> while commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] called the first video "the ultimate vindication of the charge that Obamacare was sold on a pack of lies."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Gruber Confession|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/392644/gruber-confession-charles-krauthammer|work=National Review|first=Charles|last=Krauthammer|date=November 13, 2014}}</ref>

Conservative [[S.E. Cupp]] wrote that the videos showed "willful ignorance" on Gruber's part in thinking that the Act was successfully marketed to voters, stating that "the law has never cracked a 51% favorability rating" and that, in the [[United States elections, 2010|first elections after the ACA passed]], Republicans, who had opposed it, retook the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and gained control of 11 additional state governorships.<ref>{{cite news|title=The guy who thinks voters are 'stupid'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/13/opinion/cupp-gruber-obamacare|first=S.E.|last=Cupp|work=CNN|date=November 15, 2014}}</ref>

[[Nancy Pelosi]], then-Speaker of the House, who successfully shepherded the legislation through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], without a single GOP vote and despite some opposition from pro-life Democrats, stated in a press conference after the Gruber controversy, ''"So I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill"'', a comment [[PolitiFact]] described as "inaccurate".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-she-doesnt-know-who-jonathan-gru |title=Nancy Pelosi says she doesn't know who Jonathan Gruber is |website=PolitiFact.com |access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref>

====Congressional hearing====
In the wake of the controversy, Jonathan Gruber was called to testify before members of [[United States Congress]]. He gave testimony on December 9, 2014, in which he apologized for his remarks, which he called "glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting".<ref name=GruberTestimonyGowdyQuestion>{{cite AV media | people=Gruber, Jonathan| date=9 December 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnXzJm1sJRM| title=Rep.

On December 17, 2014, [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont Governor]] [[Peter Shumlin]] cancelled the [[Vermont health care reform]] plan, on which Gruber had served as a consultant.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vermont bails on single-payer health care|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/vermont-peter-shumlin-single-payer-health-care-113653.html|first=Sarah|last=Wheaton|work=Politico|date=December 17, 2014}}</ref> Although budgetary concerns were cited as the reason for the cancellation, some called Gruber's involvement with the plan a factor as well.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Math, Lawsuits, and Jonathan Gruber Killed Vermont's Single-Payer Health Care Dream|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-18/how-math-lawsuits-and-jonathan-gruber-killed-vermonts-singlepayer-health-care-dream|first=David|last=Weigel|work=Bloomberg|date=December 18, 2014}}</ref>

According to [[Vermont Public Radio|VPR]], Vermont state auditor Doug Hoffer is auditing Gruber's contracts<ref>{{cite news|title=Auditor: Invoices unsupported from Vt.health "expert"|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/23/vt-deal-health-expert-gruber-scrutiny/22222125|first=Dave|last=Gram|work=[[Burlington Free Press]]|date=January 24, 2015}}</ref> for [[Vermont health care reform]], which Gruber "helped Vermont design".<ref>{{cite news|title=State's Contract With Economist Jonathan Gruber Under Scrutiny|url=http://digital.vpr.net/post/states-contract-economist-jonathan-gruber-under-scrutiny|first=Peter|last=Hirschfeld|work=VPR|date=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

===Extent of contributions===
The extent of Gruber's contributions to both Massachusetts and federal health care reform has been the source of significant controversy. In 2014, the Obama administration claimed that Gruber did not have a major role in creating the ACA.<ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015">{{cite news|last=Armour|first=Stephanie|date=June 21, 2015|title=MIT Economist Jonathan Gruber Had Bigger Role in Health Law, Emails Show|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mit-economist-jonathan-gruber-had-bigger-role-in-health-law-emails-show-1434910195?KEYWORDS=Jonathan+Gruber|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|access-date=June 22, 2015|quote=Jonathan Gruber, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose comments about the health-care law touched off a political furor, worked more closely than previously known with the White House and top federal officials to shape the law, previously unreleased emails show.}}</ref>

According to emails released by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|U.S. House Oversight Committee]] to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Gruber met and consulted with various Obama administration officials in charge of writing and developing the law,<ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"/> including [[Peter R. Orszag|Peter Orszag]], who was director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), [[Jason Furman]], an economic adviser to the president, [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], who was then a special adviser for health policy at OMB, [[Jeanne Lambrew]], a top Obama administration health adviser who worked at HHS and the White House, and [[Lawrence Summers]], then a top economic adviser in the administration.<ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"/> In July 2009, he was invited to meet personally with Obama.<ref name="SArmourWSJ06212015"/>

During his December 2014 congressional hearing, in both his written and oral testimony,<ref>{{cite news|title=Written Testimony of Professor Jonathan Gruber before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives|url=http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Gruber-Statement-12-9-ObamaCare1.pdf|work=United States Congress|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> Gruber downplayed his own influence on the Massachusetts and national health care plans, stating: "I did not draft Governor Romney’s health care plan, and I was not the 'architect' of President Obama’s health care plan." The newspaper ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' called this a contradiction of various statements that Gruber had previously made, claiming that at "numerous speeches, lectures and TV interviews in the past four years, Gruber has been introduced as the 'architect' of the Massachusetts law and/or Obamacare".<ref>{{cite news|title=Gruber on ObamaCare: 'I helped write it'|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/226626-jonathan-gruber-on-obamacare-i-helped-write-it|first=Jesse|last=Byrnes|work=The Hill|date=December 10, 2014}}</ref>
