==Academic career==

===Scholarship and teaching===
Slaughter served on the faculty of the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1989â€“1994 and then as J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of International, Foreign, and Comparative Law on the faculty of Harvard Law School from 1994 to 2002. She then moved to Princeton to serve as dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, the first woman to hold that position. She held that post from 2002 to 2009, when she accepted an appointment at the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]]. During the academic year 2007â€“2008, Slaughter was a visiting fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.siis.org.cn/|title=ä¸Šæµ·å›½é™…é—®é¢˜ç ”ç©¶é™¢|last=ä¸‡æˆ·ç½‘ç»œ|website=en.siis.org.cn}}</ref> In 2011, she returned to Princeton as a professor. 

As a scholar, Slaughter has had a focus on integrating the study of international relations and international law, using [[international relations theory]] in [[Approaches to International Law|international legal theory]]. In addition, she has written extensively on [[European Union]] politics, network theories of world politics, transjudicial communication, liberal theories of international law and international relations, American foreign policy, international law, and various types of policy analysis. She has written books: ''International Law and International Relations'' (2000), ''A New World Order'' (2004), ''The Idea that is America: Keeping Faith with our Values in a Dangerous World'' (2007), and ''The Crisis of American Foreign Policy: Wilsonianism in the Twenty-first Century'' (with G. John Ikenberry, Thomas J. Knock, and Tony Smith) (2008), as well as three edited volumes on international relations and international law, and over one hundred extended articles in scholarly and policy journals or books.

At Princeton University, she holds joint appointments with the Politics Department and the Woodrow Wilson School, where she teaches and advises PhD, Masters and undergraduate students.

===Administration===
Slaughter was Director of the International Legal Studies Program at [[Harvard Law School]] from 1994â€“2002, and a Professor at Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]] from 2001â€“2002.

During her tenure as dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton's international relations faculty hired scholars including [[Robert Keohane]], [[Helen Milner]], and [[G. John Ikenberry]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Other hires included [[Aaron Friedberg]] and [[Thomas J. Christensen|Thomas Christensen]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Slaughter was responsible for the creation of several research centers in international political economy and national security, the joint Ph.D. program in Social Policy, the Global Fellows program, and the Scholars in the Nation's Service Initiative.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In late 2005, over 100 Princeton students and faculty signed an open letter to Slaughter and [[President of Princeton University|Princeton president]] [[Shirley M. Tilghman]] criticizing the University in general and the Woodrow Wilson School in particular of biasing selection of invited speakers in favor of those supportive of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].<ref name=open-letter>{{cite web|title=Open Letter to President Shirley Tilghman, Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter, and the Princeton Community |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~dands/letter |access-date=7 May 2013 |date=11 October 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712092917/http://www.princeton.edu/~dands/letter |archive-date=July 12, 2007 }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=March 2021}} Slaughter responded to these claims by pointing to the dozens of public lectures by independent academics, journalists, and other analysts that the Wilson School hosts each academic year.<ref name=wws-events-archive>{{cite web|title=Events â€“ Archive |url=http://wws.princeton.edu/events_archive/index.xml |publisher=Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs |access-date=7 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722083650/http://wws.princeton.edu/events_archive/index.xml |archive-date=22 July 2013 }}</ref> {{Primary source inline|date=March 2021}} Others noted that, with Bush's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] controlling the [[President of the United States|Presidency]] and both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]], many of the most influential people in the federal government, and in the international relations apparatus in particular, were necessarily administration supporters. In 2003 the Woodrow Wilson School hosted an art exhibit titled "Ricanstructions" that opponents of the exhibit claimed was "offensive to [[Catholicism|Catholics]]" and desecrated Christian symbols. Slaughter defended the exhibit.<ref name=LipskyKarasz2003>{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky-Karasz|first1=Daniel|title=Forum looks at controversy over Wilson School exhibit|journal=The Daily Princetonian|date=May 14, 2003|url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2003/05/forum-looks-at-controversy-over-wilson-school-exhibit/|access-date=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928064530/http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2003/05/forum-looks-at-controversy-over-wilson-school-exhibit/|archive-date=28 September 2015}}</ref>

From 2002 to 2004, Slaughter served as president of the [[American Society of International Law]]. She was also one of the early members on the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] international board of directors.

==Career at the State Department==
On 23 January 2009, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] announced the appointment of Slaughter as the new [[Director of Policy Planning]] under the [[Obama administration]].<ref name="statebio" /> Slaughter was the first woman to hold this position.

At the State Department, Slaughter was chief architect of the [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]] whose first iteration was released in December 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0709/071509l1.htm |title=State Department launches quadrennial review |author=Long, Emily |magazine=[[Government Executive]] |date=2009-07-15 |access-date=2009-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226052622/http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0709/071509l1.htm |archive-date=December 26, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="csm-qddr1">{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/1215/Hillary-Clinton-s-vision-for-foreign-policy-on-a-tight-budget |title=Hillary Clinton's vision for foreign policy on a tight budget |author=LaFranchi, Howard |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2010-12-15 |access-date=2011-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119213011/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/1215/Hillary-Clinton-s-vision-for-foreign-policy-on-a-tight-budget |archive-date=19 January 2011  |url-status=live}}</ref> The QDDR provided a blueprint for elevating development as a pillar of American foreign policy and leading through civilian power. Commenting upon the skepticism that often greets such reports, and reiterating Secretary Clinton's strong desire that the QDDR become an essential part of the State Department policy process, Slaughter said: "I'm pretty sure you're thinking, 'I've heard this before,' [a big plan to change the way a government agency works] But this is different."<ref name="csm-qddr1" /> Slaughter received the Secretary's Distinguished Service Award for exceptional leadership and professional competence, the highest honor conferred by the State Department. She also received a [[Meritorious Honor Award]] from the [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] for her outstanding contribution to development policy.

In February 2011, at the conclusion of her two-year public service leave, Slaughter returned to Princeton University. She remains a consultant for the State Department and sits on the Secretary of State's [[Foreign Policy Advisory Board]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thiel |first=Samantha |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2011/02/01/27421/ |title=Slaughter '80 returns to Wilson School |work=The Daily Princetonian |date=February 1, 2011 |access-date=2012-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402215608/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2011/02/01/27421/ |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She has written that she came "home not only because of Princeton's rules (after two years of leave, you lose your tenure), but also because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible."<ref name="Atlantic">{{cite news |last=Slaughter |first=Anne-Marie |title=Why Women Still Can't Have It All |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-can-8217-t-have-it-all/9020/?single_page=true |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=Julyâ€“August 2012}}</ref>

A 2015 article in ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine quoted Hillary Clinton as saying that "other women don't break a sweat" and choose to stay working in stressful government jobs. Since the article discussed Anne-Marie Slaughter in the same paragraph, Slaughter mentioned that she was "devastated" by the idea that Clinton had been referring to her specifically. After hearing confirmation from Clinton that the quotation was taken out of context, Slaughter stated that the two women were still on good terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-emails-slaughter-216285|title=Anne-Marie Slaughter 'devastated' by Clinton's take on her 'have it all' article|first=Rachael|last=Bade|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=2015-11-30|access-date=2015-12-25}}</ref>

==Other policy, public, and corporate activities==
In the 1980s, as a student, Slaughter was part of the team headed by Professor [[Abram Chayes]] that helped the [[Sandinista]] government of [[Nicaragua]] bring suit against the [[United States of America|United States]] in the [[International Court of Justice]] for violations of international law, in the case ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'' (1986).

Since leaving the State Department, Slaughter remains a frequent commentator on foreign policy issues by publishing op-eds in major newspapers, magazines and blogs and curating foreign policy news on Twitter. She appears regularly on [[CNN]], [[BBC]], [[NPR]], and [[PBS]] and lectures to academic, civic, and corporate audiences. She has written a regular opinion column for [[Project Syndicate]] since January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/contributor/anne-marie-slaughter |title=Anne-Marie Slaughter |publisher=Project Syndicate |access-date=2012-06-24}}</ref> She delivers more than 60 public lectures annually. [[Foreign Policy]] magazine named her to their annual list of the Top100 Global Thinkers in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP15818|title=Beyond Work / Life: Changing the Debate % Making Change|publisher=SXSW|date=2013-03-09|access-date=2015-12-25}}</ref>

She has served on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations, including the [[Council on Foreign Relations|Council of Foreign Relations]], the [[New America (organization)|New America Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], the [[National Security Network]] and the [[Brookings Doha Center]]. She is a member of the Advisory Board of the [http://www.cnas.org/ Center for New American Security], [http://trumanproject.org/home/ the Truman Project], and the bipartisan Development Council of the [https://www.csis.org/ Center for Strategic and International Studies].

From 2004â€“2007, she was a co-director of the [[Princeton Project]] on National Security.<ref name=princeton-bio>{{cite web |title=Anne-Marie Slaughter |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~slaughtr/about.html |work=Princeton University |access-date=7 May 2013 |author=Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs}}</ref>

In the private sector, she started her law career at the corporate firm [[Simpson Thacher]] and is currently on the corporate board of [[Abt Associates]], a for-profit [[government contractor]] involved in research, evaluation and implementing programs in the fields of health, social and environmental policy, and international development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abtassociates.com/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|website=Abt Associates|language=en|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref> She was previously on the board of the [[McDonald's]] Corporation and that of the [[Citigroup]] Economic and Political Strategies Advisory Group.<ref name=princeton-bio />

New America, www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/. Accessed 27 September 2017.</ref>

===On the responsibility to protect===

In July 2005, Slaughter wrote in the ''[[American Journal of International Law]]'' about the [[responsibility to protect]] (R2P) that:<ref>[http://www.worldfinancialreview.com/?p=171 Charles H. Camp and Theresa B. Bowman: "The Responsibility to Protect: Reading Ethical Responsibilities Into the Rule of Law"], 20 March 2014</ref>
{{quote|Membership in the United Nations is no longer a validation of sovereign status and a shield against unwanted meddling in a state's domestic jurisdiction... Sovereignty misused, in the sense of failure to fulfill this responsibility [to protect], could become sovereignty denied.}}

In her 2006 Levine lecture at [[Fordham University]], Slaughter called the R2P "the most important shift in our conception of sovereignty since the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648," and founded it in the [[Four Freedoms]] speech by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]].<ref>[http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4171&context=flr lawnet.fordham.edu: "A New U.N. For a New Century"], FLR (2006) 74(6) 2961</ref> She referred to a speech by [[Kofi Annan]], in which he saw that the [[United Nations]] had come to a "fork in the road" and in her words "that it was time to decide how to adapt the institution to not the world of 1945 but the world of 2005".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/24/world/struggle-for-iraq-annan-chirac-s-words-fork-road-call-summit.html nytimes.com: "THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; In Annan and Chirac's Words: 'Fork in the Road' and 'Call a Summit'"], 24 September 2003</ref>

===On Libyan intervention===
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], on the situation in Libya, were adopted on 26 February and 17 March 2011, respectively. Resolution 1970 was the first case where the Security Council authorized a military intervention citing the [[R2P]]; it passed unanimously. One week after the adoption with many absentions of the latter Resolution, Slaughter wrote a strong endorsement of Western military intervention in Libya.<ref name=ftams>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/18cb7f14-ce3c-11e0-99ec-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3DvGEvw40 ft.com: "Why Libya sceptics were proved badly wrong"], 24 August 2011</ref>

In this [[op-ed]], Slaughter states her support for the [[NATO]] use of force in Libya, describing a lack of NATO as an invitation for other regional regimes to increase their repression to remain in power. She frames the conflict as between value-based and interest-based arguments on intervention, stating that they cannot be distinguished from each other, and states her support for the role of President [[Barack Obama]] in helping to form an international coalition to oppose [[Muammar Gadhafi]]. Slaughter states that she supports the Libyan [[Transitional National Council]] draft constitutional charter and states that she supports comparisons to Iraq, arguing they might prevent similar mistakes in Libya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pomed.org/uncategorized/libya-op-eds-bar-too-high-and-challenging-skeptics/|title=Libya Op-Eds: "Bar Too High?" and Challenging Skeptics - Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED)|website=pomed.org|access-date=August 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307073500/http://pomed.org/uncategorized/libya-op-eds-bar-too-high-and-challenging-skeptics/|archive-date=March 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 25 August 2011, she was roundly criticized by [[Matt Welch]], who sorted through many of Slaughter's prior op-eds and concluded that she was a "situational constitutionalist".<ref>[http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/25/anne-marie-slaughters-end-zone reason.com: "Anne-Marie Slaughter's End Zone Dancing and Situational Constitutionalism"], 25 August 2011</ref>

[[Clifford May]] on 15 October 2014 wrote a piece in which he drew a straight line between Annan and Slaughter's R2P "norm", and the failure in Libya. May noted that President Obama had cited the R2P norm as his primary justification for using military force with Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who had threatened to attack the opposition stronghold of [[Benghazi]].<ref>[http://townhall.com/columnists/cliffmay/2014/10/15/draft-n1905592/page/full townhall.com: "The Demise of 'Responsibility to Protect' at The U.N."], 15 October 2014</ref>

On 26 February 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine published a piece by [[Doug Bandow]] which called for Washington policymakers to be held accountable for another war gone bad.  Slaughter was singled out for criticism, for her statement that "it clearly can be in the U.S. and the West's strategic interest to help social revolutions fighting for the values we espouse and proclaim[,]" in an article Bandow characterized as "celebratory" concerning the outcome of NATO intervention in Libya.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2015/02/26/libya-hold-policymakers-accountable-for-another-washington-war-gone-bad/ forbes.com: "Libya: Hold Policymakers Accountable For Another Washington War Gone Bad"], 26 February 2015</ref>

===On Syrian intervention===
In a February 2012 [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Slaughter wrote proposing the overthrow of [[Bashar al-Assad]]:<ref name=nyt12>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/opinion/how-to-halt-the-butchery-in-syria.html |title=How to Halt the Butchery in Syria |last=Slaughter |first=Anne-Marie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=23 February 2012 |access-date=19 May 2020}}</ref> 
{{cquote|Foreign military intervention in Syria offers the best hope for curtailing a long, bloody and destabilizing civil war. The mantra of those opposed to intervention is "Syria is not Libya." In fact, Syria is far more strategically located than Libya, and a lengthy civil war there would be much more dangerous to our interests. America has a major stake in helping Syria's neighbors stop the killing.}}

She proposed that actors such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, "arm the opposition soldiers with anti-tank, countersniper and portable antiaircraft weapons" in order to help the [[Friends of Syria]] group intervene.<ref name=nyt12/> Journalist [[Michael Hirsh (journalist)|Michael Hirsh]] was quick to support her in the ''[[National Journal]]'', writing that "even if the [[U.N. Security Council]] remains paralyzed, the newly empowered [[Arab League]] can provide a cover of legitimacy."<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/getting-serious-about-syria-20120224?mrefid=freehplead_1 nationaljournal.com: "ANALYSIS - Getting Serious About Syria"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 24 Feb 2012</ref>

On 8 June 2012, Slaughter returned to the subject of intervention in Syria, with a rebuttal of a [[Henry Kissinger]] piece,<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/syrian-intervention-risks-upsetting-global-order/2012/06/01/gJQA9fGr7U_story.html washingtonpost.com: "Syrian intervention risks upsetting global order"], 1 Jun 2012</ref> in which he argued that an intervention would imperil the foundation of world order. Citing two situation reports and claiming that [[NATO]] had violated [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970|UNSC 1970]] in Libya, Slaughter imagined an intervention process without widespread destruction:<ref name=wapoams>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/syrian-intervention-is-justifiable-and-just/2012/06/08/gJQARHGjOV_story.html washingtonpost.com: "Syrian intervention is justifiable, and just"], 8 Jun 2012</ref>
{{cquote|These means would include the provision of intelligence and communications equipment, antitank and anti-mortar weapons, and, crucially, air support against Syrian government tanks and troops that seek to enter or overrun a zone. The provision of such support would also require the disabling of Syrian air defenses.}}

Slaughter sought to provide arms to the rebels, calling for bold action in creating a western backed coalition that would provide heavy weapons to rebels that controlled safe zones which admitted foreign journalists to monitor the rebels' actions.<ref name=ft-20120731>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a03392ce-da35-11e1-b03b-00144feab49a.html |title=We will pay a high price if we do not arm Syria's rebels |author=Anne-Marie Slaughter |newspaper=Financial Times |date=31 July 2012 |access-date=3 September 2015}}</ref> She imagined that "this type of action would force the Russian and Chinese governments to come clean about the real motives for their positions," and proceeded to charge [[Vladimir Putin]] with "crimes against humanity, indeed near-genocide... in [[Chechnya]] at the turn of the century". Slaughter admitted that the principle of sovereignty was "enshrined in the United Nations Charter," but pointed to the fact that in 2005, the doctrine of R2P had been adopted by the UN.<ref name=wapoams/>

===On how gender impacts work-family balance===
Slaughter's article titled "Why Women Still Can't Have it All" appeared in the July/August 2012 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]''.<ref name="Atlantic" /> In the first four days after publication, the piece attracted 725,000 unique readers, making it the most popular article ever published in that magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/events/3325-power-luncheon-with-anne-marie-slaughter|title=Power Luncheon with Anne-Marie Slaughter|publisher=Ellevate|date=2013-05-21|access-date=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-october-14-2015-1.3269969/anne-marie-slaughter-on-work-life-balance-without-the-struggle-1.3270039|title=Anne-Marie Slaughter on work-life balance without the struggle|publisher=CBC|date=2015-10-14|access-date=2015-12-25}}</ref> In the same period, it received over 119,000 Facebook "Recommends," making it by far the most "liked" piece ever to appear in any version of the magazine.

====Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family====
{{main|Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family}}
The article in ''The Atlantic'' became the basis of the 2015 book ''[[Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family]]''.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/books/review/anne-marie-slaughters-unfinished-business-women-men-work-family.html|title=Anne-Marie Slaughter's 'Unfinished Business'|author=Blair, Elaine|date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> The book argues that a number of challenges remain for the women's movement in the US. It allows her to expands on her position in the article and respond to her critics. In Unfinished Business, she attempts to create a framework to understand the problems faced by all working parents, not just women.<ref name="Williams, Joan C 2015. pp. 561-563">Williams, Joan C.
