== Contributions ==
Sims has published numerous important papers in his areas of research: [[econometrics]] and macroeconomic theory and policy. Among other things, he was one of the main promoters of the use of [[vector autoregression]] in empirical macroeconomics. However, some of the maintained assumptions in such models have been incorrectly tested (Sims, 1980) using asymptotic distribution theory since it is infeasible to test over 200 restrictions on model parameters using only 60 observations on time series (Sargan, 1961). He has also advocated [[Bayesian statistics]], arguing for its power in formulating and evaluating economic policies.<ref>Sims, Christopher A. "The Role of Models and Probabilities in the Monetary Policy Process". Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2002,  1-62</ref>

Sims has been an outspoken opponent of the [[rational expectations]] revolution in macroeconomics, arguing that it should be thought of as a "cautionary footnote" to econometric policy analysis, rather than "a deep objection to its foundations."<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = Christopher A. | last2 = Goldfeld | first2 = Stephen M. | last3 = Sachs | first3 = Jeffrey D. | year = 1982 | title = Policy Analysis with Econometric Models | journal = Brookings Papers on Economic Activity | volume = 1982 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–164 | jstor = 2534318 | url =  https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1982/01/1982a_bpea_sims_goldfeld_sachs.pdf| doi = 10.2307/2534318 }}</ref> He has been similarly skeptical of the value of [[Real business cycle theory|real business cycle]] models.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = Christopher A. | year = 1996 | title = Macroeconomics and Methodology | journal = [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 105–120 | jstor = 2138286 | doi=10.1257/jep.10.1.105| citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.8675 }}</ref>

He also helped develop the [[fiscal theory of the price level]] and the theory of [[rational inattention]].

== Nobel Memorial Prize and lecture ==
On October 10, 2011, Christopher A. Sims together with [[Thomas J. Sargent]] was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. The award cited their "empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2011/ |title=The Prize in Economic Sciences 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2008-12-10 |access-date=2011-10-10}}</ref> His Nobel lecture, titled "Statistical Modeling of Monetary Policy and its Effects" was delivered on December 8, 2011.<ref>•  http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2011/sims-lecture.html<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; • Sims, Christopher A. (2011).  [http://sims.princeton.edu/yftp/Nobel/NobelLect.pdf " Statistical Modeling of Monetary Policy and its Effects,"] Nobel lecture.</ref>

Translating his work into everyday language, Sims said it provided a technique to assess the direction of causality in central bank monetary policy. It confirmed the theories of monetarists like [[Milton Friedman]] that shifts in the money supply affect inflation. However, it also showed that causality went both ways. Variables like interest rates and inflation also led to changes in the money supply.<ref name="sommer">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/nobel-winners-in-economics-the-reluctant-celebrities.html |title=Good Morning.
