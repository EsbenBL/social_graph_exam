'''Stephen Joseph Harper''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|CC}} (born April 30, 1959) is a Canadian <!--DO NOT add economist before consensus is established at [[Talk:Stephen Harper#Lead: Stephen Harper is a Canadian economist?]] per [[WP:CON]]-->politician who served as the 22nd [[prime minister of Canada]]<!--DO NOT capitalize prime minister, per [[WP:JOBTITLES]]--> from 2006 to 2015. Harper won three mandates during [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|his nearly decade-long tenure]], and is the first and only prime minister to come from the modern-day [[Conservative Party of Canada]], serving as the party's first [[List of Canadian conservative leaders|leader]] from 2004 to 2015.

Harper studied economics, earning a bachelor's degree in 1985 and a master's degree in 1991. He was one of the founders of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] and was first elected in 1993 in [[Calgary West]]. He did not seek re-election in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997 federal election]], instead joining and later leading the [[National Citizens Coalition]], a conservative lobbyist group.<ref>[http://www.harperindex.ca/ViewArticle.cfm?Ref=0010 National Citizens Coalition (NCC)&nbsp;– Harper's presidency was a critical period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.harperindex.ca/ViewArticle.cfm?Ref=0010 |date=March 3, 2016 }}. The Harper Index, May 11, 2007. Retrieved April 16, 2011</ref> In 2002, he succeeded [[Stockwell Day]] as leader of the [[Canadian Alliance]], the successor to the Reform Party, and returned to parliament as [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Official Opposition]]. In 2003, Harper negotiated the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] to form the Conservative Party of Canada and was elected as the party's first leader in March 2004. In the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]], the new party lost its first election to the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] led by [[Paul Martin]]. From 2002 to 2015 as party leader, leader of the Official Opposition, and then prime minister, Harper represented the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Calgary Southwest]] in [[Alberta]]. He represented [[Calgary Heritage]] from 2015 until 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/08/26/stephen-harper-to-resign-as-mp-today.html |title= Former prime minister Stephen Harper resigns as MP|author=Tonda MacCharles |date=August 26, 2016 |work= [[The Toronto Star]]|access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

The [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]] resulted in a [[Minority governments in Canada|minority government]] led by the Conservative Party with Harper becoming the 22nd prime minister of Canada. During his first term, Harper confronted the [[In and Out scandal]], while major legislation passed under Harper's leadership included the ''[[Federal Accountability Act]]'', the [[Québécois nation motion]] and the [[Veterans' Bill of Rights]]. After the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]], in which the Conservative Party won a larger minority, Harper passed the [[2009 Canadian federal budget|Economic Action Plan]] in response to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued Parliament]] to defeat a [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute|non-confidence motion by a potential coalition of opposition parties]] and ordered [[Operation Mobile|military intervention]] during the [[First Libyan Civil War]]. The [[40th Canadian Parliament]] was eventually dissolved in March 2011, after another [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence vote]] over the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Canadian procurement]]. In the [[2011 Canadian federal election|federal election]], the Conservatives won a majority government. During his third term, Harper [[Canada and the Kyoto Protocol|withdrew Canada from the Kyoto Protocol]], launched [[Operation Impact]] in opposition to [[ISIL]], repealed the [[Canadian Firearms Registry|long-gun registry]], passed the ''[[Anti-terrorism Act, 2015]]'', launched [[Canada's Global Markets Action Plan]] and grappled with controversies surrounding the [[Canadian Senate expenses scandal]] and the [[2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal|Robocall scandal]].

In the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], the Conservative Party lost power to the Liberal Party led by [[Justin Trudeau]]. Harper officially stepped down as party leader on October 19, 2015, and [[Rona Ambrose]] was subsequently chosen as [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]] on November 5, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stephen Harper resigns as Conservative leader|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-as-conservative-leader-1.2617950|access-date=October 19, 2015|work=CTV News|date=October 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-to-elect-interim-leader-on-nov-5-1.3289332 |title=Conservatives to elect interim leader on Nov. 5 |website=CBC.ca |date=October 26, 2015 |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> After 2015, Harper slowly began to step away from Canadian politics and took on a number of international business and leadership roles, founding a global consulting firm, appearing on US and British media, and being elected leader of the [[International Democrat Union]].<ref name="iPolitics">{{cite news|date=February 21, 2018|title=Harper elected chairman of the International Democrat Union|work=iPolitics|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2018/02/21/harper-elected-chairman-international-democrat-union/|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref>

Harper attended Northlea Public School and, later, [[John G. Althouse Middle School]] and [[Richview Collegiate Institute]], both in [[Etobicoke]], Toronto.

==Political beginnings==

Harper became involved in politics as a member of his high school's [[Young Liberals of Canada|Young Liberals Club]].<ref name=canadiancontent1>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.canadiancontent.net/people/politics/Stephen-Harper.html|title=Stephen Harper|work=MiniBio|publisher=Canadiancontent.net|access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref> He later changed his political allegiance because he disagreed with the [[National Energy Program]] (NEP) of Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government.<ref>William Johnson, ''Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada'', p. 19</ref> He became chief aide to Progressive Conservative (PC) member of Parliament (MP) [[Jim Hawkes]] in 1985, but later became disillusioned with the party and the government of [[Brian Mulroney]], especially the administration's [[fiscal policy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030214221241/http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/alliance_race/harper1.html |website=CBC News |access-date=9 October 2021 |quote=Harper had been involved with the Progressive Conservative party since 1981 and after graduating he took a job as executive assistant to Jim Hawkes, the Tories' MP for Calgary West.

That lasted until 1986, when Harper experienced what Preston Manning called "profound disillusionment" with the Conservative government in Ottawa, especially their economic and fiscal policy.}}</ref>

He was then recommended by the University of Calgary's economist Bob Mansell to [[Preston Manning]], the founder and leader of the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Right-wing populism|populist]] [[Reform Party of Canada]]. At that time Harper "didn't see himself as a politician", Mansell told CBC News in 2002, adding, "Politics was not his first love."<ref name=cbc-bio>{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Schwartz|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/alliance_race/harper1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030214221241/http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/alliance_race/harper1.html|title=Stephen Harper|work=[[CBC News]]|date=April 4, 2002|archive-date=February 14, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Manning invited him to participate in the party, and Harper gave a speech at Reform's 1987 founding convention in [[Winnipeg]]. He became the Reform Party's chief policy officer, and he played a major role in drafting the 1988 election platform.<ref name=cbc-bio/> The 1988 elections platform otherwise known as the Blue Book, which helped formed the principles and policies of the party. Harper was influenced by his political mentor, [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]] when writing the book.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewalrus.ca/the-man-behind-stephen-harper/|title=The Man behind Stephen Harper|last=McDonald|first=Marci|date=October 12, 2004|website=The Walrus|language=en-US|access-date=November 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://contentdm.ucalgary.ca/digital/collection/reform/id/197/|title=Cover|website=contentdm.ucalgary.ca|language=en|access-date=November 10, 2019|archive-date=November 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110184621/https://contentdm.ucalgary.ca/digital/collection/reform/id/197/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bratt|first=Duane|date=January 2, 2018|title=Implementing the Reform Party agenda: the roots of Stephen Harper's foreign policy|journal=Canadian Foreign Policy Journal|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/11926422.2017.1359195|s2cid=158332437|issn=1192-6422}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tory-candidates-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-an-act-of-self-destruction/article34220404/|title=Tory candidates' anti-immigrant rhetoric an act of self-destruction|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> He is credited with creating Reform's campaign slogan, "The West wants in!"<ref>{{cite news|first=Rex|last=Murphy|url=http://www.cbc.ca/national/rex/2007/03/stephen_harpers_new_priority.html|title=Rex Murphy: Stephen Harper's new priority|publisher=cbc.ca|date=March 22, 2007|access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref>

Harper ran for the House of Commons in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]], appearing on the ballot as ''Steve Harper'' in Calgary West and losing by a wide margin to Hawkes, his former employer. After Reform candidate [[Deborah Grey]] was elected as the party's first MP in a 1989 [[by-election]], Harper became Grey's executive assistant, and was her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993.<ref name="Geoff White 1989">Geoff White, "Ottawa will be hearing from Reform MP", ''Calgary Herald'', April 21, 1989, pg. A5.</ref> He remained prominent in the Reform Party's national organization in his role as policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base, and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements.<ref>Paul Gessell, "The "other' parties are picking up big followings", ''[[Kitchener-Waterloo Record]]'', October 26, 1990, A9.</ref> He delivered a speech at the Reform Party's 1991 national convention, in which he condemned extremist views.<ref>George Oake, "Reform Party tries to avoid appearance of extremism", ''Toronto Star'', April 6, 1991, pg. A12</ref>

Harper's relationship with Manning became strained in 1992, because of conflicting strategies over the [[Charlottetown Accord]]. Harper opposed the Accord on principle for ideological reasons, while Manning was initially more open to compromise. Harper also criticized Manning's decision to hire [[Rick Anderson (political strategist)|Rick Anderson]] as an adviser, believing that Anderson was not sufficiently committed to the Reform Party's principles.<ref>William Johnson, ''Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada'', (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 2005), pp. 179–83</ref> He resigned as the policy chief in October 1992.

Harper stood for office again in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 federal election]], and defeated Jim Hawkes amid a significant Reform breakthrough in Western Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-robson-why-should-maxime-bernier-wait-havent-we-all-waited-long-enough|title=John Robson: Why should Maxime Bernier wait?

D2</ref>

==Reform MP (1993–1997)==
Harper emerged a prominent member of the Reform Party caucus. He was active on constitutional issues during his first parliament, and played a prominent role in drafting the Reform Party's strategy for the [[1995 Quebec referendum]]. A long-standing opponent of centralized [[Canadian federalism|federalism]], he stood with Preston Manning in Montreal to introduce a twenty-point plan to "decentralize and modernize" Canada in the event of a "no" victory.<ref>Neville Nankivell, "Reform's voice will grow louder", ''Financial Post'', October 31, 1995, p. 23</ref> Harper later argued that the "no" side's narrow [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] was a worst-case scenario, in that no-one had won a mandate for change.<ref>"Harris joins other leaders in calling for change", ''Hamilton Spectator'', October 31, 1995, pg. A1</ref>

Though socially libertarian, Harper has expressed some [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] views on certain issues.<ref>{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Dufour|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/jan2006/harp-j20.shtml|title=Who is Stephen Harper, the Conservative poised to be Canada's next prime minister?|work=World Socialist Web Site|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|date=January 20, 2006|access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref> In 1994, he opposed plans by federal Justice Minister [[Allan Rock]] to introduce spousal benefits for same-sex couples. Citing the recent failure of a similar initiative in Ontario, he was quoted as saying, "What I hope they learn is not to get into it. There are more important social and economic issues, not to mention the unity question."<ref>Marta Gold, "Same-sex fight going to Ottawa", ''Hamilton Spectator'', June 10, 1994, pg. A3</ref> Harper also spoke against the possibility of the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] or the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] changing federal policy in these and other matters.<ref>Joan Crockett, "Robinson lays equality complaint", ''Hamilton Spectator'', June 22, 1994, pg. A12</ref>

At the Reform Party's 1994 policy convention, Harper was part of a small minority of delegates who voted against restricting the definition of marriage to "the union of one man and one woman".<ref>[[Edward Greenspon]], "Stephen Harper: a neo-con in a land of liberals", ''Globe and Mail'', March 23, 2002, A17.</ref> He opposed both [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] and mandated benefits for same-sex couples, but argued that political parties should refrain from taking official positions on these and other "issues of conscience".<ref>Johnson, ''Stephen Harper'', p. 222</ref>

Harper was the only Reform MP to support the creation of the [[Canadian Firearms Registry]] at [[second reading]] in 1995, although he later voted against it at [[third reading]] stage. He said at the time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to [[Jean Charest]]'s leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.<ref>Susan Delacourt, "Charest, Manning dismiss reports of parties' merging", ''Globe and Mail'', April 4, 1995, pg. A5</ref>

Despite his prominent position in the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning at a time when other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites.<ref>Geoffrey York, "Reform MPs snarl at party rebuke", ''Globe and Mail'', April 8, 1994, pg. A4</ref> He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs.

These tensions culminated in late 1996 when Harper announced that he would not be a candidate in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|next federal election]]. He resigned his parliamentary seat on January 14, 1997, the same day that he was appointed as a vice-president of the National Citizens Coalition (NCC), a conservative think-tank and advocacy group.<ref>"Stephen Harper named A NCC Vice-President", ''Canada NewsWire'', January 14, 1997</ref> He was promoted to NCC president later in the year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The old Stephen Harper was preferable|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/the-old-stephen-harper-was-preferable/article725045/|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref>

==Out of parliament==
===1997–2000===
Soon after leaving Parliament, Harper and Tom Flanagan co-authored an opinion piece entitled "Our [[Enlightened absolutism|Benign Dictatorship]]", which argued that the Liberal Party only retained power through a dysfunctional political system and a divided opposition. Harper and Flanagan argued that national conservative governments between 1917 and 1993 were founded on temporary alliances between Western populists and [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], and were unable to govern because of their fundamental contradictions. The authors called for an alliance of Canada's conservative parties, and suggested that meaningful political change might require electoral reforms such as [[proportional representation]]. "Our Benign Dictatorship" also commended [[Conrad Black]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain, arguing that his stewardship would provide for a "pluralistic" editorial view to counter the "monolithically liberal and [[feminism|feminist]]" approach of the previous management.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Stephen|last2=Flanagan|first2=Tom|title=Our benign dictatorship|url=http://www.nextcity.com/main/town/6dictat.htm|website=Next City|access-date=October 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980529111958/http://www.nextcity.com/main/town/6dictat.htm|archive-date=May 29, 1998|date=1997}}</ref>

Harper remained active in constitutional issues. He was a prominent opponent of the [[Calgary Declaration]] on national unity in late 1997, describing it as an "appeasement strategy" against Quebec nationalism. He called for federalist politicians to reject this strategy, and approach future constitutional talks from the position that "Quebec separatists are the problem and they need to be fixed".<ref>Susan Delacourt, "Seeds planted for opposition to unity plan", ''Globe and Mail'', September 18, 1997, pg. A1</ref> In late 1999, Harper called for the federal government to establish clear rules for any future Quebec referendum on sovereignty.<ref>Stephen Harper, "Why Chrétien mustn't flag", ''Globe and Mail'', December 2, 1999, pg. A17</ref> Some have identified Harper's views as an influence on the Chrétien government's ''[[Clarity Act]]''.<ref>Chantal Hebert, "Harper takes pragmatic approach to Quebec", ''Toronto Star'', April 26, 2002, pg. A25</ref>

As president of the NCC from 1998 to 2002, Harper launched an ultimately unsuccessful [[Harper v. Canada (Attorney General)|legal battle]] against federal election laws restricting third-party advertising.<ref>Daniel Leblanc, "Groups vow to fight new election bill", ''Globe and Mail'', June 8, 1999, pg. A4; "Gagged by statute", ''National Post'', June 8, 2000, pg. A19</ref> He led the NCC in several campaigns against the [[Canadian Wheat Board]],<ref>National Citizen's Coalition, "NCC To Back New Court Challenge To Wheat Board Monopoly", ''Canada NewsWire'', February 9, 1998, 11:15 report; National Citizen's Coalition, "NCC to blitz prairies with anti-Wheat Board radio ads", ''Canada NewsWire'', August 25, 1999</ref> and supported Finance Minister [[Paul Martin]]'s 2000 tax cuts as a positive first step toward tax reform.<ref>no title, ''Toronto Star'', February 29, 2000, p. 1</ref>

In 1997, Harper delivered a controversial speech on [[Canadian identity]] to the [[Council for National Policy]], a conservative American [[think tank]]. He made comments such as "Canada is a Northern European [[welfare state]] in the worst sense of the term, and very proud of it", "if you're like all Americans, you know almost nothing except for your own country. Which makes you probably knowledgeable about one more country than most Canadians", and "the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]] [New Democratic Party] is kind of proof that the Devil lives and interferes in the affairs of men."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051221045338/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051213/elxn_harper_speech_text_051214/20051214/ Full text of Stephen Harper's 1997 speech], CTV.ca, December 14, 2005</ref> These statements were made public and criticized during the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 election]]. Harper argued that the speech was intended as humour, and not as serious analysis.<ref>Susan Riley, "Harper's suspect evolution", December 16, 2005, pg. A18</ref>

Harper considered campaigning for the Progressive Conservative Party leadership in 1998, after Jean Charest left federal politics. Among those encouraging his candidacy were senior aides to Ontario [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Mike Harris]], including [[Tony Clement]] and [[Tom Long (politician)|Tom Long]].<ref>Jack Aubry, "Battle lines being drawn up for ideological heart of Tories", ''Hamilton Spectator'', April 7, 1998, pg. C3; [[David Frum]] was also mentioned as a possible supporter.</ref> He eventually decided against running, arguing that it would "burn bridges to those Reformers with whom I worked for many years" and prevent an alliance of right-wing parties from taking shape.<ref>Scott Feschuk, "Harper rejects run at Tory leadership", ''Globe and Mail'', April 10, 1998, pg. A1</ref> Harper was sceptical about the Reform Party's [[United Alternative]] initiative in 1999, arguing that it would serve to consolidate Manning's hold on the party leadership.<ref>Rosemary Spiers, "Preston Manning's fork in the road", ''Toronto Star'', February 18, 1999, p. 1; "But who will lead it?", ''Globe and Mail'', February 22, 1999, pg. A10</ref> He also expressed concern that the UA would dilute Reform's ideological focus.<ref>Michael Taube, "United Alternative needs policy, not Reform party lite", ''Hamilton Spectator'', February 25, 1999, pg. A14</ref>

===2000–2001===
When the United Alternative created the Canadian Alliance in 2000 as a successor party to Reform, Harper predicted that Stockwell Day would defeat Preston Manning for the new party's leadership. He expressed reservations about Day's abilities, however, and accused Day of "[making] adherence to his social views a [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] to determine whether you're in the party or not".<ref>Tim Harper, "Bible belts", ''Toronto Star'', June 17, 2000, p. 1</ref> Harper endorsed Tom Long for the leadership, arguing that Long was best suited to take support from the Progressive Conservative Party.<ref>"That sound you hear is the shifting of conservative ground", April 21, 2000, ''Globe and Mail'', pg. A12</ref> When Day placed first on the first ballot, Harper said that the Canadian Alliance was shifting "more towards being a party of the [[Christian right|religious right]]".<ref>Paul Adams, "Front-runner rides tide of religious conservatism", ''Globe and Mail'', June 26, 2000, pg. A1</ref>

After the death of Pierre Trudeau in 2000, Harper wrote an editorial criticizing Trudeau's policies as they affected Western Canada. He wrote that Trudeau "embraced the fashionable causes of his time, with variable enthusiasm and differing results", but "took a pass" on the issues that "truly defined his century".<ref>Stephen Harper, "On second thought", ''National Post'', October 5, 2000, pg. A18</ref> Harper subsequently accused Trudeau of promoting "unabashed socialism", and argued that Canadian governments between 1972 and 2002 had restricted [[economic growth]] through "state corporatism".<ref>Stephen Harper, "Get the state out of the economy", ''National Post'', February 8, 2002, pg. A14</ref>

After the Canadian Alliance's poor showing in the [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000 election]], Harper joined with other Western conservatives in co-authoring a document called the "[[Alberta Agenda]]". The letter called on Alberta to reform publicly funded health care, replace the [[Canada Pension Plan]] with a provincial plan and replace the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] with a provincial police force. It became known as the "firewall letter", because it called on the provincial government to "build firewalls around Alberta" to stop the federal government from redistributing its wealth to less affluent regions.<ref>[https://www.albertaresidentsleague.com/How/AlbertaAgendaLetter.htm Stephen Harper, Tom Flanagan et al., "The Alberta Agenda"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118224309/http://www.albertaresidentsleague.com/How/AlbertaAgendaLetter.htm |date=November 18, 2004 }}, ''National Post'', January 26, 2001, A14.</ref> Alberta [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] [[Ralph Klein]] agreed with some of the letter's recommendations, but distanced himself from the "firewall" comments.<ref>Jill Mahoney, "No 'firewall' needed around Alberta, Klein says", ''Globe and Mail'', February 8, 2001, A9.</ref>

Harper also wrote an editorial in late 2000 arguing that Alberta and the rest of Canada were "embark[ing] on divergent and potentially hostile paths to defining their country". He said that Alberta had chosen the "best of Canada's heritage—a combination of American enterprise and individualism with the British traditions of order and co-operation" while Canada "appears content to become a second-tier socialistic country&nbsp;... led by a second-world strongman appropriately suited for the task". He also called for a "stronger and much more autonomous Alberta", while rejecting calls for [[Alberta separatism|separatism]].<ref>Stephen Harper, "Separation, Alberta-style: It is time to seek a new relationship with Canada", ''National Post'', December 8, 2000, A18.</ref> In the [[2001 Alberta general election|2001 Alberta provincial election]], Harper led the NCC in a "Vote Anything but Liberal" campaign.<ref>National Citizens Coalition, "NCC Ad Campaign Urges Albertans Not to Vote Liberal", ''Canada NewsWire'', February 13, 2001, 11:45 report.</ref> Some articles from this period described him as a possible successor to Klein.<ref>Chantal Hebert, "Alberta, Quebec sing from same complaint book", ''Toronto Star'', February 14, 2001, p. 1.</ref>

Harper and the NCC endorsed a private school [[tax credit]] proposed by Ontario's [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government in 2001, arguing that it would "save about $7,000 for each student who does not attend a [[trade union|union]]-run public school". [[Minister of Education (Ontario)|Education Minister]] [[Janet Ecker]] criticized this, saying that her government's intent was not to save money at the expense of public education.<ref>Richard Mackie, "School tax-credit plan hailed as a money saver", ''Globe and Mail'', June 19, 2001, A5.</ref>

Day's leadership of the Canadian Alliance became increasingly troubled throughout the summer of 2001, as several party MPs called for his resignation. In June, the ''[[National Post]]'' newspaper reported that former Reform MP [[Ian McClelland]] was organizing a possible leadership challenge on Harper's behalf.<ref>Sheldon Alberts, "Harper mounts campaign to lead the right: Behind the scenes", ''National Post'', June 30, 2001, pg. A06</ref> Harper announced his resignation from the NCC presidency in August 2001, to prepare a campaign.<ref>National Citizen's Coalition, "Stephen Harper to Step Down as NCC President", ''Canada NewsWire'', August 13, 2001</ref>

==Canadian Alliance leadership, 2002–2003==
Stockwell Day called a new Canadian Alliance leadership race for 2002, and soon declared himself a candidate. Harper emerged as Day's main rival, and declared his own candidacy on December 3, 2001. He eventually won the support of at least 28 Alliance MPs,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Number 28 for Harper|publisher=Canada NewsWire|date=March 6, 2002}}</ref> including [[Scott Reid (politician)|Scott Reid]], [[James Rajotte]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=Six Alliance MPs declare or reaffirm support for Harper's leadership bid|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=December 7, 2001}}</ref> and [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Five More MPs endorse Harper|publisher=Canada NewsWire|date=February 20, 2002}}</ref> During the campaign, Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec.<ref>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Harper|title=A vision of federalism for all Canadians|newspaper=National Post|date=January 19, 2002|page=A18}}</ref> He argued that "the French language is not imperilled in Quebec", and opposed "special status" for the province in the [[Canadian Constitution|Canadian constitution]] accordingly.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Arpon|last=Basu|title=Alliance candidate Stephen Harper says French not threatened in Quebec|publisher=Canadian Press|date=January 19, 2002}}</ref> He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], and said that he would not co-operate with the Progressive Conservatives as long as they were led by Joe Clark.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Brian|last=Laghi|title=Harper launches campaign|work=The Globe and Mail|date=December 4, 2001|page=A8}}</ref> On social issues, Harper argued for "parental rights" to use [[corporal punishment]] against their children and supported raising the age of sexual consent.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Brian|last=Laghi|title=Harper campaigns on social issues|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 21, 2002|page=A4}}</ref> He described his potential support base as "similar to what [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] tapped".<ref>{{Cite news|first=Ian|last=Hunter|title=The cult of policy|work=The Globe and Mail|date=March 7, 2002|page=A19}}</ref>

The tone of the leadership contest turned hostile in February 2002. Harper described Day's governance of the party as "amateurish",<ref>"No more Mr. Nice Guy in Alliance leadership race", ''Kitchener-Waterloo Record'', February 4, 2002, pg. A3</ref> while his campaign team argued that Day was attempting to win re-election by building a narrow support base among different groups in the religious right.<ref>Robert Fife, "Day accused of courting evangelicals", ''National Post'', February 9, 2002, pg. A06</ref> The Day campaign accused Harper of "attacking ethnic and religious minorities".<ref>Campbell Clark, "Harper attacking minorities, Day leadership camp charges", ''Globe and Mail'', February 12, 2002, pg. A12</ref> In early March, the two candidates had an especially fractious debate on [[CBC Newsworld]].<ref>Brian Laghi, "Harper, Day swap insults in debate", ''Globe and Mail'', March 8, 2002, pg. A4</ref> The leadership vote was held on March 20, 2002. Harper was elected on the first ballot with 55% support, against 37% for Day. Two other candidates split the remainder.

After winning the party leadership, Harper announced his intention to run for parliament in a by-election in Calgary Southwest, recently vacated by Preston Manning. [[Ezra Levant]] had been chosen as the riding's Alliance candidate and declared that he would not stand aside for Harper; he later reconsidered.<ref>Dawn Walton, "Rookie Levant ready to run", ''Globe and Mail'', March 28, 2002, pg. A8; Sheldon Alberts, "'Troubled' Levant lets Harper run", ''National Post'', March 29, 2002, pg. A01</ref> The Liberals did not field a candidate, following a parliamentary tradition of allowing opposition leaders to enter the House of Commons unopposed. The Progressive Conservative candidate, [[Jim Prentice]], also chose to withdraw.<ref>"Alliance leader won't face Tories in byelection bid", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', March 31, 2002, pg. A8</ref> Harper was elected without difficulty over [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrat]] [[Bill Phipps]], a former [[United Church of Canada]] moderator. Harper told a reporter during the campaign that he "despise[d]" Phipps, and declined to debate him.<ref>Jeffrey Simpson, "He makes Harper think uncharitable thoughts", ''Globe and Mail'', May 7, 2002, pg. A19; Phipps later said that he was "shocked" by Harper's language. See Louise Elliott, "NDP candidate slams Alliance leader for personal comment, refusal to debate", ''Canadian Press'', May 9, 2002,</ref>

Harper officially became the [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|leader of the Official Opposition]] in May 2002. Later in the same month, he said that the [[Atlantic Provinces]] were trapped in "a culture of defeat" which had to be overcome, the result of policies designed by Liberal and Progressive Conservative governments. Many Atlantic politicians condemned the remark as patronizing and insensitive. The [[Legislature of Nova Scotia]] unanimously approved a motion condemning Harper's comments,<ref>Brian Laghi, "Motion by MLAs condemns Harper", ''Globe and Mail'', May 31, 2002, pg. A5; The motion was brought forward by Nova Scotia NDP leader [[Darrell Dexter]].</ref> which were also criticized by [[Premier of New Brunswick|New Brunswick premier]], [[Bernard Lord]], federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark and others. Harper refused to apologize, and said that much of Canada was trapped by the same "can't-do" attitude.<ref>Louise Elliott, "Harper calls Canada a nation of defeatists, defends remark about easterners", ''Canadian Press'', May 29, 2002, 17:23 report; Brian Laghi, "Premiers tell Harper his attack was wrong", ''Globe and Mail'', May 30, 2002, pg. A8</ref>

In March 2003, their speeches in favour gaining no traction in Parliament, Harper and Stockwell Day co-wrote a letter to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in which they condemned the Canadian government's unwillingness to participate in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=771117 |title=Edited Hansard * Table of Contents * Number 074 (Official Version) |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Beers|url=http://www.tommydouglas.ca/news/2006/01/24/no-bush-please-were-canadian|title=No Bush, please&nbsp;— we're Canadian|agency=Salon.com|publisher=Tommy Douglas Research Institute|date=January 25, 2006|access-date=February 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602123220/http://www.tommydouglas.ca/news/2006/01/24/no-bush-please-were-canadian|archive-date=June 2, 2008}}</ref>

On January 12, 2004, Harper announced his resignation as the leader of the Official Opposition in order to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Harper was elected the first leader of the Conservative Party, with a first ballot majority against [[Belinda Stronach]] and Tony Clement on March 20, 2004.

===2004 federal election===
{{main|2004 Canadian federal election}}
Harper led the Conservatives into the 2004 federal election. Initially, new Prime Minister Paul Martin held a large lead in polls, but this eroded because of infighting, [[Sponsorship scandal|Adscam]] (a [[scandal]] that came as a result of a [[Government of Canada]] "[[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] program" in the province of Quebec and involving the Liberal Party of Canada) and other scandals surrounding his government. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger.<ref name="nasty2004">{{cite news |last1=Wells |first1=Paul |title=The Inside Story Of Canada's Nastiest Campaign |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/2004/7/12/the-inside-story-of-canadas-nastiest-campaign |access-date=October 22, 2020 |work=Maclean's |date=July 12, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Copps's battle a symptom of Liberal infighting|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/coppss-battle-a-symptom-of-liberal-infighting/article4086237/|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=January 2005|title=2004 General Election|url=https://www.elections.ca/res/eim/pdf/insight_2005_01_e.pdf}}</ref>

This, along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] in Ontario, moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time.<ref name=nasty2004/> However, comments by Conservative MPs, leaked press releases accusing the then prime minister of supporting [[child pornography]], as well as [[attack ad]]s suggesting that the Conservatives had a secret agenda, caused Harper's party to lose some momentum.<ref name="np042111">{{cite news |title=Are MP's remarks like 2004 again for Harper? |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/are-mps-remarks-like-2004-again-for-harper/ |access-date=October 22, 2020 |work=National Post |publisher=Postmedia |date=April 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name="cbc062004">{{cite news |title=Stephen Harper's campaign mistake - CBC Archives |url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/stephen-harpers-campaign-mistake |access-date=October 22, 2020 |date=June 20, 2004 |work=CBC Television |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref name="po030106">{{cite news |last1=Rose |first1=Johnathan |title=The Liberals reap what they sow: why their negative ads failed |url=https://policyoptions.irpp.org/fr/magazines/the-prime-minister/the-liberals-reap-what-they-sow-why-their-negative-ads-failed/ |access-date=October 22, 2020 |work=Policy Options |date=March 1, 2006}}</ref>

The Liberals were re-elected to power with a minority government, with the Conservatives coming in second place. The Conservatives managed to make inroads into the Liberals' Ontario stronghold, primarily in the province's socially conservative central region. However, they were shut out of Quebec, marking the first time that a centre-right party did not win any seats in that province. Harper, after some personal deliberation, decided to stay on as the party leader.<ref name="cbc120319">{{cite news |last1=Barton |first1=Rosemary |author-link1=Rosemary Barton |title=Why Scheer's defenders are pointing to the 2004 election now — and why the argument doesn't hold up |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/andrew-scheer-1.5382443 |access-date=October 21, 2020 |work=CBC News |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=December 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=septembre 1|first1=par Options politiques Originellement publié sur le site Web d'Options politiques|last2=2004|title=What should the Conservatives do next?|url=https://policyoptions.irpp.org/fr/magazines/the-2004-federal-election/what-should-the-conservatives-do-next/|access-date=April 13, 2021|website=Policy Options|language=en}}</ref>

====Agreement with the BQ and the NDP====
Two months after the federal election, Stephen Harper privately met [[Bloc Québécois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] and New Democratic Party leader [[Jack Layton]] in a Montreal hotel.<ref name=gazetteCo-Opposition/> On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], [[Adrienne Clarkson]], stating,

One month later, on October 4, [[Mike Duffy]], who was later appointed as a Conservative senator by Harper, said "It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election", and that some Conservatives wanted Harper to temporarily become prime minister without holding an election. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.<ref name=gazetteCo-Opposition/>

On March 26, 2011, Duceppe stated that Harper had tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP in response to Harper's allegations that the Liberals may form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP.<ref>{{cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=Harper wanted 2004 coalition: Duceppe|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/03/26/cv-kickoff-bloc.html|access-date=March 26, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Leader of the Opposition===
The Conservative Party's first policy convention was held from March 17 to 19, 2005, in [[Montreal]]. Harper had been rumoured to be shifting his ideology closer to that of a [[Blue Tory]], and many thought he'd wanted to move the party's policies closer to the centre. Any opposition to abortion or bilingualism was dropped from the Conservative platform. Harper received an 84% endorsement from delegates in the [[leadership review]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 14, 2012|title=Looking Down From Canada: The Most Important Leader in the Free World: Stephen Harper|url=https://www.ottawalife.com/article/looking-down-from-canada-the-most-important-leader-in-the-free-world-stephen-harper}}</ref>

Despite the party's move to the centre, the party began a concerted drive against same-sex marriage. Harper was criticized by a group of law professors for arguing that the government could override the provincial court rulings on same-sex marriage without using the "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]", a provision of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.<ref name="gm011905">{{cite news |title=Tories to launch anti-gay marriage ads |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/tories-to-launch-anti-gay-marriage-ads/article1113195/ |access-date=October 23, 2020 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=January 19, 2005}}</ref> He also argued, in general, for lower taxes, an elected [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], a tougher stance on crime, and closer relations with the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sarro|first=Douglas|date=2013|title=Breaking the Bargain: A Comment on the Constitutional Validity of Bill C-7, the Proposed Senate Reform Act|url=https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1254&context=clpe}}</ref>

Harper denied any wrongdoing and subsequently filed a civil [[libel]] suit against the Liberal Party.

The Conservatives began the campaign period with a policy-per-day strategy, contrary to the Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched [[2006 Harper attack ads|negative ads targeting Harper]], similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close what had been a ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.<ref>{{cite news|author=CTV.ca News Staff|title=Harper seen as most trusted leader, poll finds|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060111/ELXN_poll_060111/20060111?s_name=election2006&no_ads=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212082550/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060111/ELXN_poll_060111/20060111?s_name=election2006&no_ads=|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2006|work=CTV.ca|date=January 11, 2005|access-date=September 21, 2006}}</ref>

Immediately prior to the Christmas break, in a faxed letter to NDP candidate [[Judy Wasylycia-Leis]], [[commissioner of the RCMP|RCMP commissioner]] [[Giuliano Zaccardelli]] announced the RCMP had opened a criminal investigation into her complaint that it appeared Liberal Finance Minister [[Ralph Goodale]]'s office had leaked information leading to [[insider trading]] before making an important announcement on the taxation of [[income trust]]s. On December 27, 2005, the RCMP confirmed that information in a press release. At the conclusion of the investigation, Serge Nadeau, a top civil servant in the [[Department of Finance (Canada)|Department of Finance]], was charged with criminal breach of trust. No charges were laid against Goodale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/personalfinance/incometrust-probe-faqs.html|title=The Income Trusts Probe: FAQs|publisher=CBC.ca|date=February 15, 2007|access-date=April 10, 2021}}</ref>

The election gave Harper's Conservatives the largest number of seats in the House, although not enough for a majority government, and shortly after midnight on January 24, Martin conceded defeat. Later that day, Martin informed Governor General [[Michaëlle Jean]] that he would resign as prime minister, and at 6:45&nbsp;p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government. Harper was sworn in as Canada's 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.

In his first address to Parliament as Prime Minister, Harper opened by paying tribute to the [[Monarchy of Canada|queen of Canada]], [[Elizabeth II]], and her "lifelong dedication to duty and self-sacrifice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=Hansard&Mee=3&Language=e&Parl=39&Ses=1 |title=39th Parliament, First Session, Edited Hansard, No. 003, Wednesday, April&nbsp;5, 2006 |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |access-date=January 30, 2011}}</ref> He also said before the Canada-UK Chamber of Commerce that Canada and the United Kingdom were joined by "the golden circle of [[the Crown]], which links us all together with the majestic past that takes us back to the [[Tudors]], the Plantagenets, the [[Magna Carta]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', petition of rights, and English [[common law]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1168 |title=Prime Minister Harper introduces Australian counterpart to Parliament |publisher=Pm.gc.ca |access-date=April 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329125220/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1168 |archive-date=March 29, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> Journalist Graham Fraser said in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' that Harper's speech was "one of the most monarchist speeches a Canadian prime minister has given since [[John Diefenbaker]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1155937810919&call_pageid=968332188774&col=Columnist969907621570|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121000/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&c=Article&cid=1155937810919&call_pageid=968332188774&col=Columnist969907621570|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2007|last=Fraser|first=Graham|work=Toronto Star|title=PM shucks Reform roots for a royal connection|date=August 19, 2006|access-date=April 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> An analysis by [[Michael D.

==Prime Minister of Canada (2006–2015)==
{{main|Premiership of Stephen Harper}}
In July 2019, a group of independent academics published an assessment of past prime ministers of Canada based on the number of campaign pledges and promises fulfilled. According to the study, the Harper government kept 85 per cent of complete (including partially-completed pledges). When factoring only completed, realized pledges, the Harper's government, in their last year, kept 77 per cent of promises. The study found that the governments led by Harper, in addition to the government led by his successor, [[Justin Trudeau]], had the highest rates of follow-through for campaign promises of any Canadian government in the last 35 years.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Direction of: Birch, François Pétry |first1=Lisa, François |title=Assessing Justin Trudeau's Liberal Government. 353 promises and a mandate for change |date=July 2019 |publisher=Presses de l'Université Laval |location=Quebec City |isbn=978-2-7637-4443-8 |pages=262 |edition=first |url=https://www.pulaval.com/produit/assessing-justin-trudeau-s-liberal-government |access-date=October 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Blatchford |first1=Andy |title=New book examines Trudeau government's record of living up to pledges |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-book-examines-trudeau-governments-record-of-living-up-to-pledges/ |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=October 13, 2019}}</ref>

On October 14, 2008, after a 5-week-long campaign, the Conservatives increased their seat count in Parliament to 143, up from 127 at the dissolution of the previous Parliament; however, the actual popular vote among Canadians dropped slightly by 167,494 votes.

On December 30, 2009, Harper announced that he would request the governor general to prorogue Parliament again, effective immediately on December 30, 2009, during the 2010 Winter Olympics and lasting until March 3, 2010. Harper stated that this was necessary for Canada's economic plan. Jean granted the request. In an interview with [[CBC News]], [[Prince Edward Island]] Liberal MP [[Wayne Easter]] accused the prime minister of "shutting democracy down".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/pointofview/2009/12/parliament-prorogued-neccessary-move-or-an-insult-to-democracy.html|title=Parliament prorogued: Necessary move or undemocratic?|last=POV|first=CBC News|date=December 30, 2009|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=April 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pm-shutting-democracy-down-says-easter-1.829799|title=PM 'shutting democracy down', says Easter|date=December 31, 2009|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=April 2, 2014}}</ref> Tom Flanagan, Harper's University of Calgary mentor and former chief of staff, also questioned Harper's reasoning for prorogation, stating that "I think the government's talking points haven't been entirely credible" and that the government's explanation of proroguing was "skirting the real issue—which is the harm the opposition parties are trying to do to the Canadian Forces" regarding the [[Canadian Afghan detainee issue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/gov-t-not-credible-on-proroguing-ex-harper-advisor-1.472953|title=Gov't not 'credible' on proroguing: ex-Harper advisor|publisher=CTV News|date=January 12, 2010|access-date=April 10, 2021}}</ref> Small demonstrations took place on January 23 in 64 Canadian cities and towns and five cities in other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/746068|title=Grassroots fury greets shuttered Parliament|last=Delacourt|first=Susan|author2=Richard J.

A poll released by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion|Angus Reid]] on January 7, found that 53 per cent of respondents were opposed to the prorogation, while 19 per cent supported it. 38 per cent believed Harper used the prorogation to curtail the Afghan detainee inquiry, while 23 per cent agreed with Harper's explanation that the prorogation was necessary economically.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prorogation hurtles 'out of dusty law texts into the mainstream'|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/prorogation-has-hit-a-nerve/article1422003|date=January 7, 2010|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Gloria|last=Galloway}}</ref>

===2010 Senate appointments===
Harper, on January 29, 2010, advised the governor general to appoint new Conservative senators to fill five vacancies in the Senate, one each for Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, and two for Ontario. The new senators were [[Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu]], of Quebec; [[Bob Runciman]], of [[Ontario]]; [[Vim Kochhar]], of Ontario; [[Elizabeth Marshall]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]; and [[Rose-May Poirier]], of New Brunswick. This changed the party standings in the Senate, which had previously been dominated by Liberals, to 51 Conservatives, 49 Liberals, and five others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/politics/inside-politics-blog/2010/01/sunday-senatewatch-five-vacancies-why-not-a-bakers-dozen-instead.html|title=SenateWatch: Five vacancies?

===2011 vote of no confidence===
Harper's Cabinet was defeated in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of Parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the governor general to call a [[2011 Canadian federal election|general election]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/03/25/pol-defeat.html Government's defeat sets up election call]. ''CBC News'', March 25, 2011</ref> This was the first occurrence in [[Contempt of Parliament#Contempt citation cases for governments|Commonwealth history]] of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing the confidence of the [[lower house]] on the grounds of contempt of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=5072532&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=40&Ses=3#Div-204 "Business of Supply (Division 204)"]. 40th Parliament, 3rd Session&nbsp;– Edited Hansard, No. 149, March 25, 2011. The motion presented by the Leader of the Opposition was "That the House agree with the finding of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs that the government is in contempt of Parliament, which is unprecedented in Canadian parliamentary history, and consequently, the House has lost confidence in the government."</ref>

===2011 election===
{{main|2011 Canadian federal election}}
On May 2, 2011, after a five-week campaign, Harper led the Conservatives to their third consecutive election victory—the first time a centre-right party has accomplished this in half a century. The Conservatives increased their standing in parliament to 166, up from 143 at the dissolution of the previous parliament. This resulted in the first centre-right majority government since the Progressive Conservatives won what would be their last majority in 1988. The Conservatives also received a greater number of total votes than in 2008. Notably, the Conservatives had a significant breakthrough in southern Ontario, a region where neither they nor the Reform/Alliance side of the merger had done well in the previous two decades. They managed to win several seats in Toronto itself; no centre-right party had won seats in the former [[Metro Toronto]] since 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yan|first=James|title=The GOP Should Take a Page from Canada's Conservative Party|url=https://natoassociation.ca/the-gop-should-take-a-page-from-canadas-conservative-party/|access-date=May 31, 2021|website=NAOC|language=en-CA}}</ref>

The election ended five years of minority governments, made the New Democratic Party the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] for the first time, relegated the Liberals to third place for the first time, brought [[Elizabeth May]] as Canada's first [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] Member of Parliament, and reduced the Bloc Québécois from 47 to 4 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 5, 2011|title=Quebec sovereignty movement anything but dead|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/05/quebec_sovereignty_movement_anything_but_dead.html|access-date=May 31, 2021|website=thestar.com|language=en}}</ref>

After the election, the Conservatives were accused of cheating in the [[Robocall scandal]], mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus polling stations.<ref name=MaherFeb27>{{cite news |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/215004/elections-canada-investigating-robocalls-that-misled-voters/ |title=Elections Canada investigating 'robocalls' that misled voters |access-date=April 10, 2021 |last1=Maher |first1=Stephen |last2=McGregor |first2=Glen |date=February 27, 2012 |publisher=Global News }}</ref> There were complaints in 247 of Canada's 308 ridings, but only one person was charged; Conservative staffer [[Michael Sona]] was convicted and jailed.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Coorsh|first=Karolyn|date=November 19, 2014|title=Robocalls trial: Michael Sona sentenced to 9 months in jail|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/robocalls-trial-michael-sona-sentenced-to-9-months-in-jail-1.2108744|access-date=May 31, 2021|website=CTVNews|language=en}}</ref>

===2015 election===
{{main|2015 Canadian federal election}}
Under the ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'', a general election had to take place no later than October 19, 2015. On August 2, at Harper's request, Governor General David Johnson dropped the writs of election for October 19. In that election, Harper's Conservative Party was defeated by Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and became the Official Opposition, dropping to only 99 seats out of 338. This was mainly because of a collapse of Conservative support in southern Ontario, a region that swung heavily to them in 2011. They lost all of their seats in Toronto, and won only three seats in the Greater Toronto Area. They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada—the first time in decades that there will be no centre-right MPs from that region. Harper was re-elected in Calgary Heritage, essentially a reconfigured version of his former riding.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 25, 2016|title=Former prime minister Stephen Harper will leave federal politics|url=https://www.straight.com/news/704011/former-prime-minister-stephen-harper-will-leave-federal-politics|access-date=May 31, 2021|website=The Georgia Straight|language=en}}</ref>

Hours after conceding defeat on election night, Harper resigned as leader of the Conservative Party and returned to the backbench.<ref>{{cite web|title = Stephen Harper resigns as Conservative leader|url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-as-conservative-leader-1.2617950|website = CTVNews|access-date = October 20, 2015}}</ref> Former Cabinet minister [[Rona Ambrose]] was elected interim leader by the Conservative caucus, pending a formal leadership election.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dehaas|first=Josh|date=November 5, 2015|title=Rona Ambrose elected interim Conservative leader|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/rona-ambrose-elected-interim-conservative-leader-1.2643708|access-date=April 1, 2021|website=CTVNews|language=en}}</ref> Harper resigned as Prime Minister during a meeting with Governor General David Johnston, who accepted the resignation, after which Johnston invited Trudeau to form a government on November 4, 2015.<ref name="thestar.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/10/22/how-justin-trudeau-will-officially-become-prime-minister.html |title=How Justin Trudeau will officially become prime minister &#124; Toronto Star |website=Thestar.com |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> After Andrew Scheer resigned as Conservative leader in 2019, the ''National Post'' criticized Harper, by stating that he "lost in 2015 in a way that left his party struggling to make any sense at all, including on deficits."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-pick-a-philosophy-first-then-a-leader-conservatives|title=NP View: Pick a philosophy first, then a leader, Conservatives {{!}} National Post|date=December 13, 2019|language=en-CA|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>

In December 2015, Harper had set up Harper & Associates Consulting Inc., a corporation that lists him a director alongside close associates [[Ray Novak]] and Jeremy Hunt.<ref name=":0" />

In October 2017, Harper received media attention for criticizing Justin Trudeau's handling of the renegotiation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] started by the United States under President [[Donald Trump]], stating that Trudeau was too unwilling to make concessions to the U.S., sided too closely with Mexico, and tried to advance left-wing policies through the renegotiations.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Panetta | first1=Alexander | title=NAFTA Negotiations 'Going Very Badly,' Stephen Harper Writes in Memo Blasting Trudeau Government | url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/napping-on-nafta-harper-blasts-trudeau-government-handling-of-negotiations | date=October 27, 2017 | publisher=[[National Post]] (from [[The Canadian Press]]) | access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last1=Quinn | first1=Greg | title=Trudeau's Predecessor Says It's Conceivable Trump Will Scrap Nafta | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/trudeau-predecessor-says-it-s-conceivable-trump-will-scrap-nafta | date=October 11, 2017 | publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref>

On February 2, 2018, Harper revealed in a statement that he knew about the [[sexual assault]] allegations against then Conservative MP [[Rick Dykstra]] during the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]] but could not justify removing him as a candidate because the investigation was closed by police a year before the election.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/novak-dykstra-fired-candidate-1.4518095|title=Harper says he could not justify dumping Dykstra in 2015|work=CBC News|access-date=March 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

On November 19, 2018, Harper appeared on a show hosted by [[Ben Shapiro]], where he made comments on issues such as populism, immigration and nationalism. The ''National Post'' noted that they "echo the argument made in his recently released book, ''[[Right Here, Right Now (book)|Right Here, Right Now: Politics and Leadership in the Age of Disruption]]'', which urges conservatives to listen to populist grievances, rather than focus on other priorities like tax cuts for the wealthy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/i-have-no-time-for-illegal-immigration-stephen-harper-says-on-u-s-podcast|title='I have no time for illegal immigration,' Stephen Harper says on U.S. podcast {{!}} National Post|last=Politics|first=Canadian|date=November 19, 2018|language=en-CA|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torontolife.com/city/moments-stephen-harpers-appearance-american-hard-right-podcast/|title=Some moments from Stephen Harper's appearance on an American hard-right podcast|date=November 21, 2018|website=Toronto Life|language=en-US|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref>

On March 11, 2021, during a [[Web conferencing|virtual gathering]] hosted by the [[Conference of Defence Associations Institute]], Harper claimed that the world has entered into a [[Second Cold War]] between the United States and China, and that middle-power countries such as Canada are also a part of the rivalry between the two main powers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=March 13, 2021|title=Former PM Stephen Harper sees new Cold War, this time between U.S. and China|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/former-pm-stephen-harper-sees-new-cold-war-this-time-between-u-s-and-china-1.5346247|access-date=April 8, 2021|website=CTV News|language=en}}</ref>

===Constitutional issues===
After sidestepping the political landmine for most of the first year of his time as prime minister, much as all the post-Charlottetown Accord prime ministers had done, Harper's hand was forced to reopen the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]] debate after the opposition Bloc Québécois were to introduce a motion in the House that called for recognition of Quebec as a "nation".

After the October 2008, election, Harper again named Senate reform as a priority.<ref name=theglobeandmail1 /> By December, he recommended the appointment of 18 senators and, in 2009, provided an additional nine people for appointment as senators. Many of those appointed had close ties with the Conservative Party, including the campaign manager of the Conservative Party, [[Doug Finley]]. Critics accused Harper of hypocrisy (the Liberals coined the term "Harpocrisy").

During Harper's tenure, Canada had budgetary surpluses from 2006 to 2008 of $13.8 and 9.6 billion respectively. Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], Canada ran deficits from 2009–2013. The deficit was $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013.

===2011 Census===
Ahead of the [[Canada 2011 Census]], the government announced that the long-form questionnaire (which collects detailed demographic information) will no longer be mandatory. According to [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]] Tony Clement, the change was made because of privacy-related complaints and after consulting with [[Statistics Canada]].<ref name=":1"/> However, the federal [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada|privacy commissioner]] reported only receiving three complaints between 1995 and 2010, according to a report in the ''Toronto Sun''.<ref name=":2"/>

===Veterans===
Under Harper, the annual budget of [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] increased from $2.85 billion in 2005–2006 to $3.55 billion in 2014–2015, while the quantity of veterans served has declined from 219,152 in 2008–2009 to 199,154 in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|author = Veterans Affairs Canada|title = Veterans Affairs Canada's (VAC) budget has increased as the number of veterans has declined|publisher = Veterans Affairs Canada|url = http://www.veterans.gc.ca/pdf/info-graphics/budget-increase.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author = Veterans Affairs Canada|title = 90% of VAC budget goes to services|publisher = Veterans Affairs Canada|url = http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/news/info-graphics/expenditures}}</ref> Nine Veterans Affairs offices were closed between 2012 and 2015, and 900 positions were phased out from the department since 2009.

In 2009, Harper visited China. During the visit Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] publicly scolded Harper for not visiting earlier, pointing out that "this is the first meeting between the Chinese premier and a Canadian prime minister in almost five years"; Harper in response said that, "it's almost been five years since we had yourself or President [[Hu Jintao|Hu]] in our country."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|title=China publicly scolds Harper for taking too long to visit|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/china-publicly-scolds-harper-for-taking-too-long-to-visit/article4312718/|work=The Globe and Mail|date=December 3, 2009|first=John|last=Ibbitson|access-date=April 10, 2021}}</ref> In 2008, former-prime minister [[Jean Chrétien]] had criticized Harper for missing opening ceremonies for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]];<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|title=Harper has messed up relations with China: Chrétien |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=a63731cf-e839-4438-93f1-fe5d1bc38eb3 |date=August 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215011052/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=a63731cf-e839-4438-93f1-fe5d1bc38eb3 |archive-date=February 15, 2012 }}</ref> in response, [[Dimitri Soudas]], a spokesperson for Harper, called the remarks hypocritical, pointing out that Chrétien "attended one of six Olympic opening ceremonies during his 13{{sic}} years as prime minister".<ref>Tibbets, Janice.

During mid-2015, Harper repeatedly voiced his opinion that Russia should be excluded from association with the G7 group of nations because of Russia's support for Russian-speaking Ukrainian dissidents. On June 8, Harper said,"Mr. Putin ... has no place at the [G7] table, and I don't believe there's any leader who would defend Mr. Putin having a place."<ref>{{cite news|author=Terry Milewski |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-renews-attack-on-russia-s-vladimir-putin-over-ukraine-1.3104202 |title=Stephen Harper renews attack on Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine |publisher=CBC News |date=June 8, 2015 |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

[[Michael Ignatieff]] criticized Harper for cutting foreign aid to Africa by $700 million, falling short of the [[UN Millennium Development Goals]], and cutting eight African countries from the list of priority aid recipients.<ref name=Ignat_foreign/>

===Afghanistan===
On March 11 and 12, 2006, Harper made a surprise trip to [[Afghanistan]], where Canadian Forces personnel [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|had been deployed]] as part of the [[NATO]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] since late 2001, to visit troops in theatre as a show of support for their efforts, and as a demonstration of the government's commitment to reconstruction and stability in the region. Harper's choice of a first foreign visit was closely guarded from the press until his arrival in Afghanistan (citing security concerns), and is seen as marking a significant change in relationship between the government and the military. Harper returned to Afghanistan on May 22, 2007, in a surprise two-day visit which included visiting Canadian troops at the forward operating base at Ma'Sum Ghar, located {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} south of [[Kandahar]], making Harper the first prime minister to have visited the front lines of a combat operation.<ref>{{cite news|title=PM hints Canada may stay in Afghanistan past 2009|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/pm-hints-canada-may-stay-in-afghanistan-past-2009-1.242227|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=May 23, 2007|access-date=April 10, 2021}}</ref>

[[File:Toronto protest banner criticising Harper's Israel-Lebanon response.jpg|thumb|A banner criticizing Harper's response to the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict, Toronto.]]
Harper has shown admiration for [[Israel]] since the early 1990s. Friends and colleagues describe his views as being the product of thinking and reading deeply about the Middle East. Toronto rabbi Philip Scheim, who accompanied Harper to Israel in 2014 said, "I sense that [Harper] sees Israel as a manifestation of justice and a righting of historical wrongs, especially in light of [[the Holocaust]]."<ref>Csillag, Ron.

At the outset of the [[2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict]], Harper defended Israel's "right to defend itself" and described its military campaign in Lebanon as a "measured" response, arguing that [[Hezbollah]]'s release of kidnapped [[Israel Defense Force]] (IDF) soldiers would be the key to ending the conflict.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harper sides firmly with Israel|date=July 13, 2006|work=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060713.wHarper0713/BNStory/Front|agency=Canadian Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718004310/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060713.wHarper0713/BNStory/Front|archive-date=July 18, 2006}}</ref> Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] on July 18, Harper said he wanted "not just a ceasefire, but a resolution" but such a thing would not happen until Hezbollah and [[Hamas]] recognize Israel's right to exist. Harper blamed Hezbollah for all the civilian deaths. He asserted that Hezbollah's objective is to destroy Israel through violence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Neutral stance rejected |first=Mike |last=Blanchfield |date=July 19, 2006 |work=[[National Post]] |access-date=December 6, 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c0ada2ed-6c3d-4690-9317-739c4d97fd16&k=49262 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807141923/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c0ada2ed-6c3d-4690-9317-739c4d97fd16&k=49262 |archive-date=August 7, 2006 }}</ref>

The media noted that Harper did not allow reporters opportunities to ask him questions on his position. Some Canadians, including many Arab and Lebanese Canadians, criticized Harper's description of Israel's response.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harper dodges questions on Israel-Lebanon crisis|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=80518c73-0f2d-43f6-9499-1a8360f8b60e|date=July 17, 2006|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|publisher=[[Canada.com]]|agency=CanWest News Service|access-date=March 5, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628222444/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=80518c73-0f2d-43f6-9499-1a8360f8b60e|archive-date=June 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In December 2008, the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]] recognized Harper's support for Israel with its inaugural International Leadership Award, pointing out Harper's decision to boycott the [[Durban II]] anti-racism conference, and his government's "support for Israel and [its] efforts at the U.N. against incitement and{{Nbsp}}... the [[delegitimization of Israel]]".<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/12/04/1001354/presidents-conference-honors-harper "Presidents Conference to honor Harper"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206024311/http://jta.org/news/article/2008/12/04/1001354/presidents-conference-honors-harper |date=December 6, 2008 }}, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, December 4, 2008</ref>

In March 2009, Harper spoke at a [[Parliament Hill]] ceremony organized by [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] to honour the Jewish victims of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], which included an attack on the [[Nariman House]]. He expressed condolences over the murder at Chabad's Mumbai centre of Rabbi [[Gavriel Holtzberg]] and his wife Rivka. Harper described the killings as "affronts to the values that unite all civilized people". Harper added that the quick instalment of a new rabbi at the Chabad centre in Mumbai as a signal that the Jewish people will "never bow to violence and hatred".<ref name=pernicious>[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/03/13/1003690/harper-anti-semitism-pernicious "Harper: Anti-Semitism 'pernicious{{'"}}], Jewish Telegraphic Agency, March 13, 2009.</ref>

In 2010, Canada lost a bid for a seat on the [[UN Security Council]]. While initially blaming the loss on his rival Ignatieff, Harper later said that it was due to his pro-Israeli stance. Harper then said that he would take a pro-Israeli stance, no matter what the political cost to Canada.<ref name=CBC20101012>{{Cite news|title=Cannon blames Ignatieff for Canada's UN vote loss|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2010/10/12/un-vote012.html|date=October 12, 2010|publisher=[[CBC News]]|series=[[The Canadian Press]]|access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name=unseat>{{cite news|title=Harper Says He'll Support Israel Even If It Hurts Canada Politically |url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/99489--harper-says-he-ll-support-israel-even-if-it-hurts-canada-politically |date=November 9, 2010 |publisher=[[CityNews]] |location=Toronto |access-date=March 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117013606/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/99489--harper-says-he-ll-support-israel-even-if-it-hurts-canada-politically |archive-date=November 17, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitism on the rise here and abroad, PM says|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/887386--pro-israeli-stand-cost-canada-un-seat-harper-says|date=November 8, 2010|work=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=March 30, 2011|first=Richard J.|last=Brennan}}</ref> Ignatieff criticized Harper's stance as a "mistake", saying Canada would be better able to defend Israel through the Security Council than from the sidelines and pointed out that it is the Security Council that will determine if sanctions are imposed on [[Iran]].<ref name=unseat/> Ignatieff also accused Harper of steering the discussion away from implementing the [[two-state solution]], and instead of rendering all discussion into a competition "about who is Israel's best friend".<ref name=Ignat_foreign>{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Delacourt|title=Harper has burned bridges abroad, Ignatieff says|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/884621|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>

===Free trade with EFTA===
On June 7, 2007, the Conservative government announced it had finalized free trade negotiations with the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Under this agreement, Canada increased its trade ties with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and [[Liechtenstein]]. In 2006, the value of trade between these partners was $10.7 billion. Canada had originally begun negotiations with the EFTA on October 9, 1998, but talks broke down because of a disagreement over subsidies to shipyards in Atlantic Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/efta-aele.aspx?lang=en|title=Canada&nbsp;— European Free Trade Association (EFTA)&nbsp;– Free Trade Agreement|access-date=February 6, 2008|date=January 28, 2008|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade|Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520092329/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/efta-aele.aspx?lang=en|archive-date=May 20, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Shortly after being congratulated by George W.

The government received American news coverage during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries]] after the details of a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor [[Austan Goolsbee]], and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian government. The news came at a key time nearing the [[Ohio Democratic primary, 2008|Ohio]] and [[Texas Democratic primary and caucuses, 2008|Texas]] primaries, where perceptions among [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alexander|last=Panetta|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080304.wleakupdate0304/BNStory/Front|title=Harper denies aide leaked Obama document|location=Ottawa|publisher=globeandmail.com|date=March 4, 2008|access-date=February 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116070728/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080304.wleakupdate0304/BNStory/Front|archive-date=January 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Transparency ==
Starting in 2006, the Harper government implemented policies that had the effect of reducing transparency.

During the Harper government, it was not possible for government employed scientists to openly speak about the government policy that prohibited communication with the media. However, following the election of a new government in 2015, several scientists who are or were employed by the government have come forward to confirm the allegations made by anonymous sources during the Harper years.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

The government made drastic cuts to scientific research and data collection. Over 2,000 scientists were dismissed and funding was cut from world renowned research facilities. Cuts were also made to many essential programs, some so deep that they had to shut down entirely, including the monitoring of smoke stack emissions, food inspections, oil spills, water quality, and climate change.<ref name=":7" /> During this time, the long form census was also discontinued as a mandatory part of the census. This was ostensibly due to privacy concerns, however, the number of complaints about privacy proved to be minimal.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|author=LAURA PAYTON, Parliamentary Bureau |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/07/14/14712616.html |title=Few complaints about census: privacy commissioner |work=Toronto Sun |date=July 14, 2010 |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref>
	 
The government closed a number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved. The manner in which it was done received significant criticism because it has resulted in the remaining information being put into a disarray, rendering it inaccessible for research.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" />

==Supreme Court nominations==
Harper chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the governor general:

* [[Marshall Rothstein]] (March 1, 2006 – August 31, 2015)

===Marshall Rothstein===
In keeping with Harper's election promise to change the [[Judicial appointments in Canada|appointment process]], Rothstein's appointment involved a review by a parliamentary committee, following his nomination by the prime minister. Rothstein had already been short-listed, with two other candidates, by a committee convened by Paul Martin's previous Liberal government, and he was Harper's choice. Harper then had Rothstein appear before an ''[[ad hoc]]'' non-partisan committee of 12 [[members of parliament|members of Parliament]]. This committee was not empowered to block the appointment, though, as had been called for by some members of Harper's Conservative Party.<ref>{{Cite news|work=Globe and Mail|format=fee required|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060220.w2harper02201/BNStory/National/home|date=February 20, 2006|access-date=December 6, 2006|title=Committee to judge next Supreme Court appointee|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223083307/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060220.w2harper02201/BNStory/National/home|archive-date=February 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Thomas Cromwell===
On September 5, 2008, Harper nominated Thomas Cromwell of [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal]] to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the departure of [[Michel Bastarache]]. By and large Cromwell's nomination was well received, with many lauding the selection;<ref name=theglobeandmail2>{{Cite news|work=Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080905.wscoc0905/BNStory/National|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090116004823/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080905.wscoc0905/BNStory/National|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 16, 2009|date=September 5, 2008|access-date=September 10, 2008|title=Harper nominates Nova Scotian to Supreme Court}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|work=Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080909.wecromwell09/BNStory/specialComment|date=September 9, 2008|access-date=September 10, 2008|title=No sign of a hidden agenda}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> however, dissent has been noted surrounding the nomination. First, Harper bypassed Parliament's Supreme Court selection panel, which was supposed to produce a list of three candidates for him to choose from.<ref name=theglobeandmail2/> Second, Newfoundland and Labrador [[justice minister|Justice Minister]] [[Jerome Kennedy]] criticized the appointment, citing the [[Government of Newfoundland and Labrador]]'s belief that [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] stipulates that a Newfoundlander should have been named to the court in the rotation of Atlantic Canadian Supreme Court representation.<ref>{{Cite news|work=Globe and Mail |author=Kirk Makin |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/harper-blasted-over-hasty-top-court-nomination/article17971282/ |date=September 9, 2008 |title=Harper blasted over hasty top-court nomination |access-date=April 10, 2021}}</ref>

===Marc Nadon===
On October 3, 2013, Harper announced the nomination of supernumerary [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeals]] judge, [[Marc Nadon]] to the Supreme Court to replace the retiring [[Morris Fish]].<ref name=autogenerated1c>{{cite web|publisher=Prime Minister of Canada |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&featureId=6&pageId=26&id=5714 |title=PM announces appointment of Justice Marc Nadon to the Supreme Court of Canada |access-date=October 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220405/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&featureId=6&pageId=26&id=5714 |archive-date=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> The appointment was challenged by both Ontario lawyer [[Rocco Galati]] and the [[Government of Quebec]] as being contrary to the appointment criteria of section 6 of the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]''. In response, Harper referred the criteria issue to the Supreme Court, as well as the question of whether the government's amendments to the criteria were constitutional. The Supreme Court subsequently ruled in ''[[Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6]]'' that the Nadon appointment was invalid, and that the federal government could not unilaterally amend the ''Supreme Court Act''. Harper subsequently nominated [[Clement Gascon]] to the position instead.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 3, 2014|title=Quebec judge Clement Gascon nominated to Supreme Court|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/quebec-judge-clement-gascon-nominated-to-supreme-court-1.1851430?cache=%3FclipId%3D68596|access-date=April 13, 2021|website=CTVNews|language=en}}</ref>

The awards ceremony was held at the [[Telus Convention Centre]] in Calgary, the same place where he made his victory speech.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Kathleen |last1=Harris |last2=Czekaj |first2=Laura |url=http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1246819 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001002033/http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1246819 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 1, 2011 |title=Conservatives back in minority power |work=[[North Bay Nugget]] |publisher=Sun Media |date=October 14, 2008 |access-date=July 12, 2011 }}</ref>

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] also named him as [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year (Time)|Canada's Newsmaker of the Year]] in 2006. Stephen Handelman wrote "that the prime minister who was once dismissed as a doctrinaire backroom tactician with no experience in government has emerged as a warrior in power".<ref>{{cite news|author=CTV News|title=Time Magazine dubs Harper Cdn. newsmaker of 2006|publisher=CTV|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061217/harper_newsmaker_061217/20061217|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221030639/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061217/harper_newsmaker_061217/20061217|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 21, 2006|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref>

On June 27, 2008, Harper was awarded the Presidential Gold Medallion for Humanitarianism by [[B'nai B'rith]] International.

On July 11, 2011, Harper was honoured by Alberta's [[Kainai Nation|Blood tribe]]. He was made Honorary Chief of the [[Kainai Nation]] during a ceremony, in which they recognized him for making an [[Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission|official apology on behalf of the Government of Canada]] for the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools abuse]]. Harper issued this apology in 2008. The chief of the tribe explained that he believes the apology officially started the healing and rebuilding of relations between the federal and native councils. [[Lester B. Pearson]], [[John Diefenbaker]], and [[Jean Chrétien]] are the only other prime ministers of Canada to have been awarded the same honorary title.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/07/11/harper-ceremonial-chief.html "Harper honoured by Alberta's Blood Tribe"], [[CBC News]], The Canadian Press, July 11, 2011</ref>
