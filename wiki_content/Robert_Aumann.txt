'''Robert John Aumann''' ([[Hebrew name]]: {{Script/Hebrew|ישראל אומן}}, '''Yisrael Aumann'''; born June 8, 1930) is an Israeli-American mathematician, and a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. He is a professor at the Center for the Study of Rationality in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in Israel. He also holds a visiting position at [[Stony Brook University]], and is one of the founding members of the Stony Brook Center for Game Theory.

Aumann received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2005 for his work on conflict and cooperation through [[game theory]] analysis. He shared the prize with [[Thomas Schelling]].

==Early years==
Aumann was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany, and fled to the United States with his family in 1938, two weeks before the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom. He attended the [[Rabbi Jacob Joseph School]], a [[yeshiva]] high school in New York City.

==Academic career==
Aumann graduated from the [[City College of New York]] in 1950 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in mathematics. He received his [[Master's degree|M.Sc.]] in 1952, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Mathematics in 1955, both from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. His doctoral dissertation, ''Asphericity of Alternating Linkages'', concerned [[knot theory]]. His advisor was [[George Whitehead, Jr.]]

In 1956 he joined the Mathematics faculty of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and has been a visiting professor at [[Stony Brook University]] since 1989. He has held visiting professorship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1971, 1985–1986), [[Stanford University]] (1975–1976, 1980–1981), and [[Universite Catholique de Louvain]] (1972, 1978, 1984).<ref>{{cite web|title=CV (Robert J. Aumann)|url=http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/raumann/cv.htm|publisher=Einstein Institute of Mathematics|access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>

===Mathematical and scientific contribution===
[[File:Aumann-1080b.jpg|thumb|left|Aumann at a meeting in 2008.]]
Aumann's greatest contribution was in the realm of [[repeated game]]s, which are situations in which players encounter the same situation over and over again.

Aumann was the first to define the concept of [[correlated equilibrium]] in game theory, which is a type of equilibrium in [[non-cooperative game]]s that is more flexible than the classical [[Nash equilibrium]]. Furthermore, Aumann has introduced the first purely formal account of the notion of [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] in game theory. He collaborated with [[Lloyd Shapley]] on the [[Aumann–Shapley value]]. He is also known for his [[Aumann's agreement theorem|agreement theorem]], in which he argues that under his given conditions, two [[Bayesian theory|Bayesian]] rationalists with common prior beliefs cannot agree to disagree.<ref name="aumann1976">{{Cite journal

Aumann's Ph.D. students include:
[[Bezalel Peleg]], [[David Schmeidler]], [[Shmuel Zamir]], [[Elon Kohlberg]], [[Zvi Artstein]], [[Benyamin Shitovitz]], [[Eugene Wesley]],

===Torah codes controversy===
Aumann has entered the controversy of [[Bible code]]s research. In his position as both a [[Orthodox Judaism|religious Jew]] and a man of science, the codes research holds special interest to him. He has partially vouched for the validity of the "[[Bible code#Rips and Witztum|Great Rabbis Experiment]]" by [[Doron Witztum]], [[Eliyahu Rips]], and Yoav Rosenberg, which was published in ''Statistical Science''. Aumann not only arranged for Rips to give a lecture on Torah codes in the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], but sponsored the Witztum-Rips-Rosenberg paper for publication in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]. The academy requires a member to sponsor any publication in its Proceedings; the paper was turned down however.<ref>{{citation|title=The Secret Life of Numbers: 50 Easy Pieces on how Mathematicians Work and Think|first=George G.|last=Szpiro | author-link= George Szpiro |publisher=National Academies Press|year=2006|isbn=9780309096584|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIXl0kEwrVMC&pg=PA190}}.</ref>

In 1996, a committee consisting of Robert J. Aumann, Dror Bar-Natan, [[Hillel Furstenberg]], Isaak Lapides, and Rips, was formed to examine the results that had been reported by H.J. Gans regarding the existence of "encoded" text in the bible foretelling events that took place many years after the Bible was written. The committee performed two additional tests in the spirit of the Gans experiments. Both tests failed to confirm the existence of the putative code.

After a long analysis of the experiment and the dynamics of the controversy, stating for example that "almost everybody included [in the controversy] made up their mind early in the game" Aumann concluded:

"''A priori'', the thesis of the Codes research seems wildly improbable... Research conducted under my own supervision failed to confirm the existence of the codes – though it also did not establish their non-existence. So I must return to my ''a priori'' estimate, that the Codes phenomenon is improbable".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Aumann, R.H., H. Furstenberg, I. Lapides, and D.

==Political views==
These are some of the themes of Aumann's Nobel lecture, named "War and Peace":<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2005/aumann/lecture/ Robert Aumann's Nobel Prize in Economics lecture], [[Stockholm]], 8 December 2005</ref>
# War is not irrational, but must be scientifically studied in order to be understood, and eventually conquered;
# [[Repeated game]] study de-emphasizes the "now" for the sake of the "later";
# Simplistic peacemaking can cause war, while an arms race, credible war threats and mutually assured destruction can reliably prevent war.

Aumann is a member in the [[Professors for a Strong Israel]] (PSI), a right-wing political group. Aumann opposed [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|the disengagement from Gaza in 2005]] claiming it is a crime against [[Gush Katif]] settlers and a serious threat to the security of Israel. Aumann draws on a case in [[game theory]] called the [[Blackmailer Paradox]] to argue that giving land to the Arabs is strategically foolish based on the mathematical theory.<ref name=Aumann>{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/jw/me/97755479.html |title=Game Theory and negotiations with Arab countries. |date=July 3, 2010 |last=Aumann |first=Robert |work=Aish.com}}</ref> By presenting an unyielding demand, the Arab states force Israel to "yield to [[blackmail]] due to the perception that it will leave the negotiating room with nothing if it is inflexible".

As a result of his political views, and his use of his research to justify them, the decision to give him the Nobel prize was criticized in the European press. A petition to cancel his prize garnered signatures from 1,000 academics worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/4556 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215202811/http://www.ejpress.org/article/4556 |archive-date=2010-12-15 }}</ref>

In a speech to a religious Zionist youth movement, [[Bnei Akiva]], Aumann claimed that Israel is in "deep trouble". He revealed his belief that the anti-Zionist [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Jews might have been right in their condemnation of the original Zionist movement. "I fear the Satmars were right", he said, and quoted a verse from [[Psalm]] 127: "Unless the Lord builds a house, its builders toil on it in vain." Aumann feels that the historical Zionist establishment failed to transmit its message to its successors, because it was secular. The only way that Zionism can survive, according to Aumann, is if it has a religious basis.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3205817,00.html | title=Nobel laureate: Satmars were right about Israel| date=2006-01-24}}</ref>

In 2008, Aumann joined the new political party [[Ahi (political party)|Ahi]] led by [[Effi Eitam]] and [[Yitzhak Levy]].<ref>http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1202246357040 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091246/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1202246357040 |date=2012-01-04 }} http://www.eitam.org.il/info_en.asp?id=2062535187 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626222319/http://www.eitam.org.il/info_en.asp?id=2062535187 |date=2008-06-26 }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Aumann married Esther Schlesinger in April 1955 in Brooklyn. They had met in 1953, when Esther, who was from Israel, was visiting the United States. The couple had five children; the oldest, Shlomo, a student in [[Yeshivat Sha'alvim|Yeshivat Shaalvim]], was killed in action while serving in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. Machon Shlomo Aumann, an institute affiliated with Shaalvim that republishes old manuscripts of Jewish legal texts, was named after him. Esther died of [[ovarian cancer]] in October 1998. In late November 2005, Aumann married Esther's widowed sister, Batya Cohn.<ref>{{Nobelprize|name=Robert J. Aumann}}</ref>
