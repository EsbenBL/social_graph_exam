Dixon has a wide scope in terms of the areas of economics he has researched and published in and he has been described as one of Europe's leading economists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/book.aspx?isbn=9780333760611 |title=Surfing Economics &#124; Huw David Dixon &#124; Macmillan |publisher=Us.macmillan.com |date=2009-12-04 |access-date=2012-03-10}}</ref> The topics include:

# [[Bertrand–Edgeworth model]]s with strictly convex costs. [[Francis Edgeworth]] developed the analysis of the model of [[Bertrand competition]] in a setting where firms had constant [[marginal cost]] up to capacity. Dixon explored how this could be generalized to the case of convex costs. He established the existence of a mixed-strategy [[Nash equilibrium]],<ref>The existence of mixed strategy equilibria in a price-setting oligopoly, Economics Letters, 1984, 16, 205–212</ref> and of an [[Epsilon-equilibrium]] in a large market,<ref>Approximate Bertrand equilibria in a replicated industry, Review of Economic Studies, 1987, 54, 47–62</ref> and in other aspects.<ref>The general theory of household and market contingent demand, The Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies, 1987, 45, 287–304</ref><ref>Bertrand–Edgeworth equilibria when firms avoid turning customers away, Journal of Industrial Economics, 1990, 39, 131–146</ref><ref>The Perfectly competitive outcome as the equilibrium in an Edgeworthian price-quantity game, Economic Journal, 1992, 102, 301–309</ref><ref>Bertrand–Edgeworth Equilibria when firms set discrete prices, Bulletin of Economic Research, 1993, 45, 257–268</ref>
# [[Investment|Strategic investment Models]]. The use of capital to alter the way firms compete in [[oligopoly]] by altering their [[marginal cost]],<ref>Strategic investment in a competitive industry, Journal of Industrial Economics, 1985, 33, 483–500</ref> or [[conjectural variation]]s.<ref>Strategic investment with consistent conjectures, Oxford Economic Papers,1986, (38), 111–128</ref>
# [[Bounded rationality]]. Dixon explored the implications of evolutionary ideas for oligopoly theory and learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/chapter8.pdf|format=PDF|title=DONUT WORLD AND THE DUOPOLY ARCHIPELAGO: SOCIAL LEARNING AND THE EVOLUTION OF COMPETITION|author=Huw Dixon|quotation=Chapter 8 of Surfing Economics|website=Huwdixon.org|access-date=31 October 2021}}</ref> He also developed one of the first models of [[Satisficing|endogenous aspirations]] in economics.<ref>Dixon H (2000) [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeborg/v43y2000i2p223-238.html keeping up with the Joneses: competition and the evolution of collusion], Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organization, volume 43, pp. 223–238</ref>
# [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian Macreconomics]]. Dixon was one of the first economists to examine the effect of [[imperfect competition]] on the effectiveness of fiscal policy in his paper ''A simple model of imperfect competition with Walrasian features''.<ref>A simple model of imperfect competition with Walrasian features, Oxford Economic Papers, 1987, 39, 134–160</ref> This is an idea that was much explored in many other papers by him <ref>Imperfect competition and macroeconomics: a survey" Huw Dixon and Neil Rankin, Oxford Economic Papers, 1994, 46, 171–199</ref> and more recently.<ref>Luís F. Costa and Huw David Dixon (2011) Fiscal Policy under Imperfect Competition with Flexible Prices: An Overview and Survey. Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, Vol. 5, 2011–3</ref> This paper was the first to demonstrate in a simple [[general equilibrium model]] that the [[fiscal multiplier]] could be increasing with the degree of [[imperfect competition]] in the output market. The reason for this is that [[imperfect competition]] in the output market tends to reduce the [[real wage]], leading to the household substituting away from [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] towards [[leisure]]. When [[government spending]] is increased, the corresponding increase in [[Taxation|lump-sum taxation]] causes both leisure and consumption decrease (assuming that they are both a normal good). The greater the degree of imperfect competition in the output market, the lower the [[real wage]] and hence the more the reduction falls on leisure (i.e. households work more) and less on consumption. Hence the [[fiscal multiplier]] is less than one, but increasing in the degree of imperfect competition in the output market.

Other topics include [[imperfect competition]] in [[macroeconomics]], [[nominal rigidity]]. Most of his work is [[New Keynesian]]. Dixon supports the [[High Speed 2]] development for the [[United Kingdom]], and expressed his support in a [[Financial Times]] article on 6 January 2012, along with other leading economists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6242a5a2-36e5-11e1-b741-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ntmKpGYj |title=Push ahead with HS2 plans as soon as possible |publisher=FT.com |date=2012-01-06 |access-date=2012-03-10}}</ref> He has contributed to [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]] multiple times regarding economics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166796&sectioncode=8 |title=Taking stock of the market |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2002-01-25 |access-date=2012-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=169233&sectioncode=8 |title=Oikonomikos grows up |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2002-05-31 |access-date=2012-03-10}}</ref>

==Works==
He has authored a book [http://huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/index.html Surfing Economics], which explores [[New Keynesian economics]], the [[Natural rate of unemployment (monetarism)|Natural Rate]], [[Bounded Rationality]], [[Social learning theory|Social Learning]] and the meaning of [[Economics]].
