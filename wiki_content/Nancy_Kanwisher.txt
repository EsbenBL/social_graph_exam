== Academic background ==
Nancy Kanwisher received her BS in Biology from [[MIT]] in 1980 and her PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from MIT in 1986. After obtaining her PhD working with [[Mary C. Potter]], she then did her post-doctoral work with [[Anne Treisman]] at UC-Berkeley. Before returning to MIT as a faculty member in 1997 in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Kanwisher served as a faculty member at both [[UCLA]] and [[Harvard University]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Q&A with Prof. Nancy Kanwisher '80 (CPW Preview!) {{!}} MIT Admissions|url = http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/qa_with_prof_nancy_kanwisher_8|website = mitadmissions.org|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref>

Kanwisher is a member and associate editor for journals in areas of cognitive science, including [[Cognition]], [[Current Opinion in Neurobiology]], [[Journal of Neuroscience]], [[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]], and [[Cognitive Neuropsychology]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url = http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=FellowsSelectionCommittee.NancyKanwisher|title = Nancy Kanwisher|access-date = 2015-11-11|website = Cognitive Science Society|last = Landau|first = Barbara|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092510/http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=FellowsSelectionCommittee.NancyKanwisher|archive-date = 2016-03-04}}</ref> She has also written on other subjects, including an article in the [[Huffington Post]] and [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 2010 about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Listening to Palestinians|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-kanwisher/listening-to-palestinians_b_796630.html|website = The Huffington Post|date = 14 December 2010|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref>

Kanwisher once shaved her head while teaching a lecture on neuroanatomy to point out the functional regions of the brain so her students could visualize the concepts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = This Badass Scientist Shaved Off Her Hair To Teach Students About Brain Regions|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashaumer/this-badass-scientist-shaved-off-her-hair-to-teach-students|website = BuzzFeed|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref>

== Achievements and awards ==
Kanwisher has received numerous accolades for her academic endeavors. She founded the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT and is now the Walter A. Rosenblith Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. She was awarded the National Academy of Sciences Troland Research Award in 1999, awarded for achievement in investigations regarding relationships of consciousness and the physical world.<ref name=":2" /> She received the MacVicar Faculty Fellow Award in 2002<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title = Brain and Mind|url = http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_events/symposia/brain_mind_bios.html|website = c250.columbia.edu|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref> and the 2016 [[National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award]].<ref>https://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer/Recipients16</ref>

She serves as a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (since 2005), [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (since 2009),<ref>{{Cite web|title = Eight from MIT elected to AAAS|url = https://news.mit.edu/2009/aaas-fellows-0420|website = MIT News|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref> and received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in Peace and International Security (1986). In July 2017, Kanwisher was elected a [[Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elections to the British Academy celebrate the diversity of UK research|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/elections-british-academy-celebrate-diversity-uk-research|website=British Academy|access-date=29 July 2017|date=2 July 2017}}</ref> In January 2021 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[University of York]], UK.<ref name="York-8Dec2020">{{cite web |title=University of York honours three for their contribution to society |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2020/quality/honours-contribution-society/ |website=University of York |access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref>

== Research ==

Kanwisher has training in [[cognitive psychology]], which is investigating how the mind works by observing its outward behavior. She is credited with co-discovering and characterizing the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA) in the human brain,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/media/pdfs/KanwisherMcDermottChunJNeuro97.pdf|title = The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception|last = Kanwisher|first = Nancy|date = 1997-06-01|journal = The Journal of Neuroscience|volume = 17|issue = 11|pages = 4302–4311|doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-11-04302.1997|pmid = 9151747|pmc = 6573547|access-date = 2015-11-11|doi-access = free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/media/pdfs/TongNakayamaMoscovitchWeinribKanwisher2000.pdf|last = Kanwisher|first = Nancy|title = Response Properties of the Human Fusiform Face Area|date = 2000|journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology|doi = 10.1080/026432900380607|pmid = 20945183|volume=17|issue = 1–3|pages=257–280|citeseerx = 10.1.1.208.2920|s2cid = 4831248}}</ref> a region whose function appears to be the recognition of fine distinctions between well-known objects and, in particular, faces. She also co-discovered the [[Parahippocampal gyrus#Scene recognition|parahippocampal place area]] (PPA),<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Russell|last2=Kanwisher|first2=Nancy|date=April 1998|title=A cortical representation of the local visual environment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/33402|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=392|issue=6676|pages=598–601|doi=10.1038/33402|pmid=9560155|bibcode=1998Natur.392..598E|s2cid=920141|issn=1476-4687}}</ref> a region of the brain that recognizes environmental scenes. These two discoveries are now widely discussed in the cognitive field and provide a gold standard for clarity in search for primitives of human cognition.<ref name=":2" /> In her research, she uses [[functional MRI]],<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title = The brain is a Swiss Army knife: Nancy Kanwisher at TED2014|url = http://blog.ted.com/the-brain-is-a-swiss-army-knife-nancy-kanwisher-at-ted2014/|website = TED Blog|access-date = 2015-11-11|language = en-US}}</ref> behavioral methods, and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. She also uses ECOG to study audition, [[Language processing in the brain|language processing]], and social perception. She gave a 2014 [[TED Talks|TED Talk]] entitled "A Neural Portrait of the Human Mind".<ref name=":4" />
