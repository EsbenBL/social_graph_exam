==History==
[[File:Maryland School of Public Policy Atrium.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Van Munching Hall Atrium is most often used as a study area or place to meet other students. It is also used to host school-sponsored events.]] On October 26, 1978, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] President [[John S. Toll]] appointed the Committee on a School of Public Affairs to pursue the question of whether the College Park campus should establish a new school. With the support of the [[Sloan foundation]] and key individuals such as [[U.S. Senator]] [[Joseph Tydings]] and [[Philip Merrill|publisher Philip Merrill]], the Maryland School of Public Affairs was established on the campus of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 1981. By April 1981, Albert Bowker was appointed the first dean of the school and a group of faculty was recruited. The first seven faculty included [[Allen Schick]], [[Robert Pastor]], Catherine Kelleher, Frank Levy, [[Peyton Young]], George Eads and Mark Winer. The school's doors opened in 1982 and degrees were conferred on a dozen students during the school's first graduation exercises in 1984.

The School of Public Affairs changed its name to the School of Public Policy in 2004 in order to better communicate its mission to contribute to the nation and the world through the preparation of current and future leaders committed to public service.

The School of Public Policy expanded to offer an undergraduate program in the Spring of 2017 aimed at developing skills necessary to have a positive impact on the global community.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Undergraduate|url=https://spp.umd.edu/your-education/undergraduate|access-date=2021-08-30|website=UMD School of Public Policy|language=en}}</ref>
