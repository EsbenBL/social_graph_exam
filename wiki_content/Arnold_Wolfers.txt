'''Arnold Oscar Wolfers''' (June 14, 1892{{spnd}}July 16, 1968) was a Swiss-American lawyer, economist, historian, and  international relations scholar, most known for his work at [[Yale University]] and for being a pioneer of [[Classical realism (international relations)|classical international relations realism]].

Educated in his native Switzerland and in Germany, Wolfers was a lecturer at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] in Berlin in the late 1920s and then became its director in the early 1930s.  Initially having some sympathies with the ideas of [[Nazi Germany]], he left that country to become a visiting professor at Yale in 1933, stayed there, and became a U.S. citizen in 1939.  In 1935 he was  co-founder of the influential [[Yale Institute of International Studies]].  As [[Master (college)|master]] of [[Pierson College]] at Yale, he played a significant role during World War II by recruiting for the [[Office of Strategic Services]].  In 1957 he left Yale and became director of the [[Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he served in that role until his retirement in 1965.

Wolfers' two most known works are ''Britain and France Between Two Wars'' (1940), a study of two foreign policies during the [[interwar period]], and ''Discord and Collaboration: Essays on International Politics'' (1962), a collection of papers on [[international relations theory]].

==Early life and education==
Arnold Oskar Wolfers (the spelling of the middle name later changed to Oscar) was born on June 14, 1892,<ref name="uz-matrik"/> in [[St. Gallen, Switzerland]], to parents Otto Gustav Wolfers (1860–1945) and the former Clara Eugenie Hirschfeld (1869–1950).<ref name="whos-66"/><ref name="hg"/> His father was a New York merchant<ref>See for instance {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNIpAAAAYAAJ&q=%22otto+g.+wolfers%22&pg=PA16 | title=Classified Business Lists |  publisher=The Trow City Directory Co. | date=1980 | page=16}}</ref> who emigrated and became a naturalized Swiss citizen in 1905,<ref name="uz-matrik"/> while his mother was from a Jewish family in St. Gallen.<ref name="hg">{{cite web | url=http://www.hohenemsgenealogie.at/en/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I9037 | title=Clara Eugenie Hirschfeld | work=Hohenems Genealogy | publisher=Jüdischen Museums Hohenems | access-date=November 18, 2020 }} English option.</ref> Arnold grew up in St. Gallen<ref name="nyt-obit"/> and attended the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium secondary school]] there, gaining his ''[[Abitur]]'' qualification.<ref name="uz-matrik">{{cite web | url=http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/active/static/24295.htm | title=Wolfers Arnold Oskar | work=Matrikeledition | publisher=Universität Zürich | access-date=November 16, 2020 | language=gsw}} Abbreviations used are [http://www.matrikel.uzh.ch/active/static/abbrev.htm listed here].</ref>

Wolfers studied law at the [[University of Lausanne]], [[University of Munich]], and [[University of Berlin]] beginning in 1912<!--Who's says 1912–17, but PIBv says 1912–13, neither one seems fully likely -->,<ref name="whos-66"/> gaining a certificate (''Zeugnis'') from the last of these.<ref name="uz-matrik"/>  He served as a first lieutenant in the infantry of the [[Swiss Army]],<ref name="whos-66"/> with some of the service taking place from May 1914 to March 1915,<ref name="uz-matrik"/><!-- Who's says 1917–19, but that seems less likely and a worse fit in the timeline --> part of which included [[Switzerland during the World Wars#World War I|Switzerland's maintaining a state of armed neutrality]] during World War I.

Admitted to the bar in Switzerland in 1917, Wolfers practiced law in St. Gallen from 1917 to 1919.<ref name="whos-66"/><ref name="nyt-obit"/>   His observing of the war, and of the difficulties the Geneva-based [[League of Nations]] faced in the aftermath of the war, enhanced his natural Swiss skepticism and led him towards a conservative view regarding the ability of countries to avoid armed conflict.<ref name="fs2-stuart-4">Stuart, "Discord and Collaboration", p. 4.</ref>  On the other hand, his Swiss background did provide to him an example of how a [[Cantons of Switzerland|multi-lingual federation of cantons]] could prosper.<ref name="fs2-stuart-6">Stuart, "Discord and Collaboration", p. 6.</ref>

==Academic career in Germany==
By one later account, Wolfers emigrated to Germany following the conclusion of [[World War I]],<ref name="kaplan-19">Kaplan, ''The Wizards of Armageddon'', p. 19.</ref> while another had him living in Germany starting in 1921.<ref name="edmont-1933"/>  Contemporary newspaper stories published in the United States portray Wolfers as a Swiss citizen through at least 1926.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/62977152/ | title=A Neutral View of Isolation | newspaper=The Baltimore Sun | date=August 11, 1923 | page=8 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name="dayton-1926">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/62977309/ | title=Touring the Old World with Sherwood Eddy | author-first=John S. | author-last=Moore | newspaper=The Dayton Daily News | date=August 22, 1926 | page=12 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> In 1933, stories describe him as Swiss-German<ref name="edmont-1933">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/62977390/ | title=Personal Liberty Vanishes Under Hitler in Germany | author-first=Homer H. | author-last=Ramage | newspaper=Edmonton Journal | date=August 21, 1933 | page= 3 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> or a native Swiss and naturalized German.<ref name="vancou-1933">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/62977547/ | title=Nazi Germany Power for Peace | newspaper=The Vancouver Sun | date=August 29, 1933 | page=7 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> But in 1940 he is described as having been a Swiss before being naturalized as an American,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/62977634/ | title=Bound to be Read | newspaper=The Times and Daily News Leader | location=San Mateo, California | date=May 11, 1940 | page=6 | via=Newspapers.com }}</ref> something that a later historical account also states.<ref name="eisfeld-dp-118"/>

From 1924 to 1930, Wolfers was a lecturer in political science at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] (Institute of Politics) in Berlin.<ref name="whos-66"/><ref name="nyt-master"/>  Headed by [[Ernst Jaeckh]], it was considered Berlin's best school for the study of political behavior.<ref name="kaplan-19"/>  In 1927, he took on the additional duties of being studies supervisor.<ref name="eisfeld-113">Eisfeld, "Émigré Scholars and the Genesis of International Relations", p. 113.</ref> Wolfers was one of the early people in the circle around Lutheran theologian [[Paul Tillich]],<ref name="korenblat-402"/> with he and Doris giving much-needed economic support to Tillich in Berlin during the [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]] period.<ref name="bangor-1982"/> As such Wolfers might have been considered a [[Religious socialism|religious socialist]].<ref name="korenblat-402">Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", p. 402.</ref>  The Hochschule attracted many religious socialists, who were interested in combining spiritual development with social reform in an effort to provide an attractive alternative to [[Marxism]].<ref name="korenblat-402"/>

Wolfers became the director of the Hochschule für Politik from 1930 until 1933, with Jaeckh as president and chair.<ref name="whos-66"/><ref name="eisfeld-113"/>  Wolfers and Jaeckh both gave lecture tours in America, made contacts there, and secured funding for the Hochschule's library and publications from the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref name="eisfeld-113"/> Two endowed visiting lectureships were sponsored by Carnegie, one of which would be held by [[Hajo Holborn]].<ref name="eisfeld-113"/> In a period where there was considerable student unrest, Wolfers led popular classroom discussion sessions regarding the state of world affairs.<ref>Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", p. 426.</ref>

Between 1929 and 1933, Wolfers was a [[privatdozent]] (roughly, assistant professor) in economics at the University of Berlin.<ref name="whos-66"/><ref name="nyt-master"/>  He was active in the [[International Student Service]] and presided over their annual conference in 1931, held in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], at [[Mount Holyoke College]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/08/30/118420321.html?pageNumber=50 | title=Colleges Blamed for Jobless Crisis | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 30, 1931 | pages=1, 2}}</ref>  In his address before them, Wolfers urged more financial help from Great Britain and the United States to Continental Europe: "What Europe needs is not general declarations for peace and cooperation – people are getting sick of them. We need proposals to help overcome concrete pressing difficulties."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/09/04/118228531.html?pageNumber=34 | title=Says Europe's Need Is Concrete Help | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 4, 1931 | page=34}}</ref>

Wolfers, like other German academics, witnessed first-hand the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]].<ref name="eisfeld-114">Eisfeld, "Émigré Scholars and the Genesis of International Relations", p. 114.</ref><ref name="korenblat-413">Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", p. 413.</ref>  While some of the academics perceived immediately the reality of the Nazis, Wolfers, along with Jaeckh, did not.<ref name="eisfeld-114"/>  Wolfers had a belief in the [[great man theory]], extended to the role of great nations, and was drawn to the notion of spectacular actions in international relations; as such he found some Nazi rhetoric appealing.<ref>Stuart, "Discord and Collaboration", pp. 4–5.</ref>  In this manner Wolfers tended to be in agreement with some of the [[Foreign relations of Nazi Germany|foreign policy objectives of the Nazi regime]], especially in the East, thinking that those objectives could play a part in restoring the [[European balance of power]].<ref name="korenblat-414">Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", pp. 414, 429.</ref>  As for other aspects of the Nazis, Wolfers failed to comprehend the amount of racism and authoritarianism essential to Nazi ideology.<ref name="eisfeld-114"/>  In a November 1932 article in the journal ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'', Wolfers prophesized that "Hitler, with all his anti-democratic tendencies, is caught by the fact that he leads a mass movement... He may therefore become, against his own original programme, a force making for democracy. ... The further we go, the more this character of his movement as a safeguard against social reaction is likely to come to the fore."<ref>Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", pp. 413–414.</ref>

Hitler seized control in the [[Machtergreifung]] in January 1933.<!-- Kaplan, ''The Wizards of Armageddon'', p. 20 has got the sequence all wrong, ignore -->   At some point, Wolfers, a "half-Jew" (''Halbjude'') in the language of the [[Third Reich]], was classified as "undesirable" (''unerwünscht'') by the new regime.<ref name="eisfeld-dp-118">{{cite book | title=Ausgebürgert und doch angebräunt: Deutsche Politikwissenschaft 1920–1945 | author-first=Rainer | author-last=Eisfeld | publisher=Nomos | location=Baden-Baden | date=1991 | page=118 | language=de}}</ref>  In late April 1933, Wolfers was offered a position as a visiting professor of international relations at [[Yale University]],<ref name="eisfeld-dp-118"/> and in late May, the appointment was publicly announced by Yale, with Wolfers being assigned to [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|Yale's graduate school]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/05/26/105137289.html | title=Dr. Wolfers of Berlin Named to Yale Chair | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 26, 1933 | page=3}}</ref> where he was to lecture on world economics and European governments.<ref name="nyt-arrival"/>  Also in May, Wolfers served as general rapporteur to that year's [[International Studies Conference]] in London.<ref name="whos-66"/><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/international-academic-cooperation-on-international-relations-in-the-interwar-period-the-international-studies-conference/8B1823EF19874F0FD32F44DABA95A7F0 <!-- haven't seen the full article, just this footnote --> | title=International academic cooperation on international relations in the interwar period: the International Studies Conference | journal=Review of International Studies | author-first=Michael | author-last=Riemens | volume=37 | issue=2 | date=April 2011 | page=n24}}</ref>

==Master at Yale==
Wolfers traveled to the United States on the [[SS Albert Ballin|SS ''Albert Ballin'']], arriving on August 11, 1933.<ref name="nyt-arrival">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/08/12/99838035.html?pageNumber=2 | title=Norlin Sees Nazis Rewriting History | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 12, 1933 | page=2}}</ref>  He commented that Europeans generally felt threatened by U.S. monetary policy, but that people in Germany were sympathetic to U.S. leadership in trying to overcome the Depression.<ref name="nyt-arrival"/>

In a November 1933 address at Yale, Wolfers described Hitler as saying that Germany would return to the League of Nations if reparations-based discrimination against her ended and that France and Germany could be allied against the Bolshevik threat from the east.  Wolfers added, "Hitler's policy is not only an outgrowth of dire necessity. His party's emphasis is on domestic affairs. The 'militant' energies of Germany's soldier-like citizens are at last finding a field of action at home that satisfies all needs."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/11/11/105816131.html?pageNumber=8 | title=Explains Hitler's Stand. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=November 11, 1933 | page=8}}</ref>  In a February 1934 speech before the [[Foreign Policy Association]] in New York, Wolfers said, "The cause of present unrest is France's extravagant demands. ... Germany has lost her territorial cohesion; she has been forced to live in conflict with her Eastern neighbors, and is deprived of the most meager of self-defense."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1934/02/04/94488456.html?pageNumber=69 | title=Roosevelt Called World Peace Hope | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 4, 1934 | page=69}}</ref>  In 1934 the [[Embassy of Germany, Washington, D.C.|German embassy in Washington]] expressed satisfaction with the contents of Wolfers' lectures in the United States.<ref name="korenblat-414"/>

The contradictions inherent in the Nazi government's classification of Wolfers, compared to the Nazis' and Wolfers' somewhat complimentary views of each other at this time, have been noted by the German political scientist [[Rainer Eisfeld]].<ref name="eisfeld-dp-118"/>  Wolfers destroyed his personal and work files several times over the course of his career and thus it is difficult to know if his leaving Germany was for academic or political reasons or exactly what his thinking was at the time.<ref name="eisfeld-dp-118"/>

Intellectually, Wolfers' early work on international politics and economics was influenced by European conflicts and their effect upon the world and revealed something of a ''[[Realpolitik]]'' point of view.<ref name="kaplan-20">Kaplan, ''The Wizards of Armageddon'', p. 20.</ref><ref name="fs2-stuart-4"/>  However he was not as heavily devoted to this perspective as was his colleague [[Nicholas J. Spykman]].<ref>Hilsman and Good, "Introduction", pp. xi–xii.</ref> In terms of economics, Wolfers spoke somewhat favorably of [[New Deal]] initiatives such as the [[National Recovery Administration]] that sought to manage some competitive forces.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/12/31/100815212.html?pageNumber=15 | title=Students Endorse Junior NRA Plan | author-first=Eunice | author-last=Barnard | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 31, 1933 | page=15}}</ref>

In 1935, Wolfers was named as professor of international relations at Yale.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>  In taking the position, Wolfers was essentially proclaiming his lack of desire to return to Germany under Nazi rule.<ref name="haslam-205">Haslam, ''No Virtue Like Necessity'', p. 205.</ref> As part of gaining the position, Wolfers received an honorary [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] from Yale in 1935,<ref name="whos-66"/> a standard practice at Yale when granting full professorships to scholars who did not previously have a Yale degree.<ref>Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 27.</ref>

Also in 1935, Wolfers was appointed [[Master (college)|master]] of [[Pierson College]] at Yale, succeeding [[Alan Valentine]].<ref name="nyt-master">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1935/02/11/88611835.html?pageNumber=17 | title=Heads Pierson College | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 11, 1935 | page=17}}</ref>  The college system had just been created at Yale two years earlier and masterships were sought after by faculty for the extra stipend and larger living environment they allotted.<ref>Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 37.</ref>  A master was expected to provide a civilizing influence to the resident students and much of that role was filled by Doris Wolfers.<ref name="winks-38"/>  She decorated with eighteenth century Swiss furniture, played the host with enthusiasm, and together the couple made the Master's House at Pierson a center for entertaining on the campus second only to the house of the president of the university.<ref name="winks-40-41">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', pp. 40–41.</ref>  When diplomats visited the campus, it was the Wolferses who provided the entertainment.<ref name="winks-40-41"/>
The couple collected art <!--TODO need something from one of the Maine house sources --> and in 1936 loaned some of their modern art to an exhibit at the [[Yale University Art Gallery|Yale Gallery of the Fine Arts]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/03/03/87917582.html?pageNumber=23 | title=Exhibition of Modern Art Is Opened At Yale by Residents of New Haven | newspaper=The New York Times | page=23}}</ref>  Doris Wolfers became a frequent attendee or patroness at [[tea dance]]s and other events to celebrate [[debutante]]s.<ref>See for example {{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9401E7DC1630E13BBC4D51DFB766838D629EDE | title=3 Jackson Sisters Introduced at Tea | newspaper=The New York Times | date=January 25, 1936 | page=19}}; {{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9400E3DD163BEE3ABC4A51DFB6678383629EDE | title=Caroline Woodman Bows in New Haven | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 22, 1938 | page=21}}; {{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9900E0DF1630E43ABC4053DFB566838B659EDE | title=Yale Will Be Host to 1,000 at Prom | newspaper=The New York Times | date=March 8, 1940 | page=24}}; {{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9800E2D6113AE532A25750C2A96F9C946193D6CF | title=Miss Anne Lohmann Has a Garden Debut | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 23, 1940 | page=14}}</ref>  He would accompany her to some university dances.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9E05E5D71330EE32A2575BC2A9649C946694D6CF | title=Round of Dances After Yale Prom | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 28, 1937 | page=82}}</ref>
One former Yale undergraduate later said that he had lived in Pierson and that as head of the hall, Wolfers had been wiser and more useful regarding the practical issues of foreign policy than any of the faculty in political science.<ref>Nitze, "Foreword", p. v.</ref>  Veterans returning after the war would express how much they had missed Doris.<ref name="winks-38">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 38.</ref>

Another development in 1935 was that the [[Yale Institute of International Studies]] was created, with Wolfers as one of three founding members along with [[Frederick S. Dunn]] and [[Nicholas J. Spykman]] with Spykman as the first director.<ref name="kaplan-19"/>  The new entity sought to use a "realistic" perspective to produce scholarly but useful research that would be useful to government decision makers.<ref name="guilhot-parmar"/>  Wolfers was one of the senior academics who gave both the institute and Yale as a whole gravitas in the area and the nickname of the "Power School".<ref name="guilhot-parmar"/>  The members of the institute launched a weekly seminar called "Where Is the World Going?" at which various current issues would be discussed, and from this Wolfers developed small study groups to address problems sent from the [[U.S. Department of State]].<ref name="winks-41"/>    Wolfers traveled to the State Department in Washington frequently and also discussed these matters with his friend and Yale alumnus [[Dean Acheson]].<ref name="winks-41">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 41.</ref>  Wolfers gained campus renown for his lectures on global interests and strategy.<ref name="winks-plate"/>

Politically, Wolfers styled himself a "Tory-Liberal",<ref name="winks-40-41"/> perhaps making reference to the [[Tory Liberal coalition]] in Britain of that time.
Wolfers had a distinctive image on campus:  tall and well-dressed with an aristocratic demeanor and a crisp voice that rotated between people in conversation "rather like a searchlight" in the words of one observer.<ref name="winks-40-41"/>

Whatever appeal the Nazis had held for Wolfers was had ended by the conclusion of the 1930s,<ref name="fs2-stuart-5">Stuart, "Discord and Collaboration", p. 5.</ref>  and in 1939, Wolfers was naturalized as an American citizen.<ref name="nyt-obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/07/17/archives/arnold-wolfers-historian-dead-held-international-relations.html?searchResultPosition=1 | title=Arnold Wolfers, Historian, Dead: Held International Relations Professorship at Yale | newspaper=The New York Times | date= July 17, 1968 | page=43}}</ref>  His 1940 book ''Britain and France Between Two Wars'', a study of the foreign policies of the two countries in the [[interwar period]], became influential.<ref name="winks-42">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 42.</ref>  An assessment in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' by Edgar Packard Dean said that the book was a "substantial piece of work" and that Wolfers handled his descriptions with "extraordinary impartiality" but that his analysis of French policy was stronger than of British policy.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9A01E6DD1530E03ABC4D51DFBE66838B659EDE  | title=Strategies of Peace Since Versailles; The Story of British-French Conflict Between the Two Wars | first=Edgar Packard | last=Dean | newspaper=The New York Times Book Review | date=August 25, 1940 | page=77}}</ref>  Another review in the same publication referred to  ''Britain and France Between Two Wars'' as "a most excellent and carefully documented study" by an "eminent Swiss scholar".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/07/25/83933036.html?pageNumber=58 | title=Some Hurdles to Peace | first=Murray | last=Harris | newspaper=The New York Times Book Review | date=July 25, 1943 | page=58}}</ref>

==World War II involvements==

The masters at Yale served as contact points for recruiting appropriate students into the intelligence services, and according to the historian [[Robin Winks]], none did so more than Wolfers, who made excellent use of his connections in Washington through the Yale Institute of International Studies.<ref>Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', pp. 38–40, 51.</ref>  Overall a disproportionate number of intelligence workers came from Pierson College; in addition to Wolfers, other Pierson fellows who did recruiting included [[Wallace Notestein]] and [[C. Bradford Welles]].<ref name="winks-plate">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', 11th page of plates following p. 230.</ref>  Pierson College residents who later became intelligence figures included [[James Jesus Angleton]], who often spent time in Wolfers' living room listening to poets such as [[Robert Frost]] that Wolfers brought in to read.<ref name="winks-336">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 336.</ref>  Other attendees to these sessions included a future [[United States Poet Laureate|U.S. Poet Laureate]], [[Reed Whittemore]].<ref name="winks-336"/>  Wolfers liked the young Angleton and kept in touch with him in subsequent years.<ref name="winks-336"/>  Another protégé of Wolfers was Robert I. Blum, who became one of the early core members of the [[X-2 Counter Espionage Branch]] of the OSS, which provided liaison with the British in the exploitation of  [[Ultra]] signals intelligence.<ref name="winks-263"/>

Wolfers had worked on a study of American diplomatic communications, including telecommunications and codes and ciphers.<ref name="winks-42"/>  He thus became one of the few people to have a professional-level interest in intelligence matters before the war.<ref name="winks-263">Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', pp. 260–263.</ref>
In addition, Anita Forrer, Doris's sister, became an OSS agent and conducted secret and dangerous operations in Switzerland on behalf of [[Allen Dulles]].<ref name="winks-40-41"/>  Before that, she had been a correspondent of poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].<ref>See {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rRbAAAAMAAJ&q=%22anita+forrer%22+%22arnold+wolfers%22 | title=Germanic Notes | date=1984 | page=13}} and {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRmu9Xy9aqkC&pg=PA462 | title=Life of a Poet: Rainer Maria Rilke | author-first=Ralph | author-last=Freedman | publisher=Northwestern University Press | date= 1998 | page=462 | isbn=9780810115439 }}</ref>

In June 1944, Wolfers was among a group of ten prominent Protestant clergy and laymen organized by the [[Commission on a Just and Durable Peace]] who issued a signed statement advocating a way of dealing with Germany after war.  The statement said that Germany should not be left economically destitute or subjected to excessive reparations, as "an impoverished Germany will continue to be a menace to the peace of the world," and that punishment for German extermination campaigns against Jews and war crimes against those in occupied territories should be limited to those responsible and not extended to those just carrying out orders.<ref name="nyt-cjdp-1944">{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1944/06/01/issue.html | title=Too Harsh A Peace Opposed For Reich | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 1, 1944 | page=2}}</ref>  A month after [[V-E Day]], Wolfers had a letter published wherein he remarked upon "the shocking revelations" of Nazi concentration camps but still recommended "stern but humane rules" for directing the future of the German people.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

[[Image:Prof Wolfers reading list Political Science 37a Fall 1948.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Reading list for Wolfers' "Contemporary Problems in International Relations" political science course, Fall 1948]]

Wolfers was one of the contributors to [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]]'s landmark 1946 volume ''The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order'', which focused on the effect of the new [[atomic bomb]] on U.S.-Soviet relations.<ref>Kaplan, ''The Wizards of Armageddon'',  pp. 29–32.</ref>
He worked with Basil Duke Henning, the master of [[Saybrook College]], on a study of what Soviet leaders would judge American foreign policy options to be if they used the European press for their information.<ref>Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', pp. 460–461.</ref>
Wolfers continued to serve as a recruiter for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] when it was formed after the war.<ref name="guilhot-parmar">Parmar, "American Hegemony, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of Academic International Relations in the United States", pp. 190, 191.</ref> 
He was a strong influence on [[John A. McCone]], who later became [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (1961–65).<ref>Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 325n.</ref>

A distinguishing feature of Wolfers' career was his familiarity with power and his policy-oriented focus, which assumed that academia should try to shape the policies of government.<ref>Hilsman and Good, "Introduction", p. xi.</ref>  A noted American international relations academic, [[Kenneth W. Thompson]], subsequently wrote that Wolfers, as the most policy-oriented of the Yale institute's scholars, "had an insatiable yearning for the corridors of power" and because of that may have compromised his scholarly detachment and independence.<ref name="guilhot-parmar"/> <!--TODO ?? could use original sources for these not the Parmar repeats ... but search for quote turns up empty except for this article -->
Wolfers was a member of the resident faculty of the [[National War College]] in 1947 and a member of its board of consultants from 1947 to 1951.<ref name="whos-66"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0CE0DA1039E53ABC4953DFB266838D659EDE | title=Army, Navy College Widens Curriculum | newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 1, 1946 | page=23}}</ref>  He was a consultant to the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] during 1951<ref name="whos-66"/>      and served as President of the [[World Peace Foundation]] during 1953.<ref name="whos-66"/>   In 1953 he was named a member of the board of the [[Woodrow Wilson Foundation]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/05/18/84402302.html?pageNumber=13 | title=Woodrow Wilson Fund Elects New President | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 18, 1953 | page=13}}</ref>

The Wolferses, who had spent summers in Switzerland in the prewar years, considered moving back to Switzerland after the war, but decided to stay in the United States.<ref name="bangor-1982"/>  
In 1947 the couple commissioned a summer home on a Naskeag Point bluff in [[Brooklin, Maine]].<ref name="portland"/>  Designed by [[Walter Gropius]] and The Architect's Collective, the innovative [[Bauhaus]]-influenced design incorporated a gull-wing roof and large overhangs; the adventuresome design reflected the couple's artistic nature and cosmopolitan outlook.<ref name="portland"/>  The home was featured in ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]]'' magazine in 1948 (and would be featured again in ''[[Portland Magazine|Portland Monthly Magazine]]'' in 2013).<ref name="portland">{{cite news | url=http://www.portlandmonthly.com/pdf/Gropius%20marvel.pdf | title=Mid-Century Marvel | first=Brad | last=Emerson | magazine=Portland Monthly Magazine | location=Portland, Maine | date=February–March 2013 | pages=28–33}}</ref>

Wolfers was named a [[Sterling professor]] of international relations in 1949,<ref name="whos-66"/> which remains Yale's highest level of academic rank.<ref>Winks, ''Cloak & Gown'', p. 29.</ref>  He was, as one author later stated, "a revered doyen in the field of international relations".<ref name="korenblat-413"/> He was also named to direct two new entities at Yale, the Division of Social Sciences and the Social Science Planning Center.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>  He stepped down as master of Pierson College at that time;<ref name="whos-66"/>  President of Yale [[Charles Seymour]] said, "I regret exceedingly that we must take from Pierson College a master who has conducted its affairs with wisdom and understanding for fourteen years."<ref name="nyt-obit"/> The Wolferses continued to reside in New Haven.<ref name="bangor-1981"/>

In 1950 and 1951, the Yale Institute of International Studies ran into conflict with a new President of Yale University, [[Alfred Whitney Griswold|A. Whitney Griswold]], who felt that scholars should conduct research as individuals rather than in cooperative groups<ref name="nyt-1951">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20F1FF83D5A137B93C1AB178FD85F458585F9 | title=Six of Faculty Leaving Yale For Princeton in Policy Split | first=Stanley | last=Levey | newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 23, 1951 | pages=1, 18}}</ref> and that the institute should do more historical, detached analysis rather than focus on current issues and recommendations on policy.  Most of the institute's scholars left Yale, with many of them going to [[Princeton University]] and founding the [[Center of International Studies]] there in 1951, but Wolfers remained at Yale for several more years.<ref name="nyt-1951"/>

In May 1954, Wolfers attended the Conference on International Politics, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation and convened in Washington, D.C., which brought together [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Paul Nitze]], [[Kenneth W. Thompson]], [[Kenneth Waltz]], [[Dean Rusk]], and others.  The conference has since been seen as an attempt to define an international relations theory through [[Classical realism (international relations)|modern realism]].<ref>Williams, "Review: The Invention of International Relations Theory", p. 282.</ref> <!--TODO could use some expansion -->

==Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research==
Wolfers left Yale in 1957, at the age of 65, but retained an emeritus title there.<ref name="whos-66"/>  He was appointed director of the [[Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/>  This was a new institute founded by [[Paul Nitze]], who wanted to create a center within the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|School of Advanced International Studies]] that would join academics and policymakers.<ref name="haslam-207-208">Haslam, ''No Virtue Like Necessity'', pp. 207–208.</ref>  Unsettled by some feuding going on at Yale regarding the future of international relations study there, Wolfers was willing to leave Yale and move to Washington to take on the new position.<ref name="haslam-208">Haslam, ''No Virtue Like Necessity'', p. 208.</ref>

At the Washington Center, Wolfers brought academics and government officials together to discuss national security policy.<ref name="fs2-szabo-240"/> Nitze would later say that Wolfers had been an asset in running discussions wherein members were encouraged to bring forth their ideas and defend them while others kept an open mind.<ref name="nitze-fw-vi">Nitze, "Foreword", p. v–vi.</ref>  Wolfers was willing to question prevailing academic opinions and ideologies and, in Nitze's words, "brought a wind of fresh air to what had been a fairly stodgy and opinionated group. He was a joy to work with."<ref name="nitze-fw-vi"/>  Wolfers' own thoughts at the time still revolved around classical balance of power relationships.<ref name="haslam-207-208"/>  Overall, the directorship of Wolfers added an academic prestige to the center that it had previously not had.<ref name="fs2-szabo-240">Szabo, "Conclusion", p. 240.</ref>

Wolfers consulted for the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] in 1960 and 1961 and was a consultant to the State Department from 1960 on.<ref name="whos-66"/>  He also consulted for the [[U.S. Department of the Army]].<ref name="guilhot-parmar"/>

A 1962 book from Wolfers, ''Discord and Collaboration: Essays on International Politics'', presented sixteen essays on international relations theory, most of which had already been published in some form but some of which were completely new.  Many of the essays had been influential when first published, and the book came to be viewed as a classic.<ref name="scheuerman-6"/>  In a foreword, [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] said that Wolfers was more of political philosopher than a political scientist who nonetheless sought empirical verification of his theories and suppositions.<ref>Niebuhr, "Foreword", ''Discord and Collaboration'', p. viii.</ref>

Wolfers belonged to a number of academic organizations and clubs, including the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (for which he was a member of the international advisory council), the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Century Association]], and the [[Cosmos Club]].<ref name="whos-66"/>

==Final years==
Wolfers retired from the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research in 1965<ref name="nyt-obit"/> but remained affiliated to it with the status of special adviser.<ref name="whos-66"/>
Wolfers destroyed his files on three occasions when undergoing changes of position, in 1949, 1957, and 1966.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&pid=mssa:ms.0634&clear-stylesheet-cache=yes | title=Guide to the Arnold Oscar Wolfers Papers MS 634 | publisher=Yale University Library | access-date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>

Beginning in 1958, the Wolferses spent more time at their Maine house,<ref name="portland"/> even though he officially still lived in Washington.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> They entertained in Maine often, bringing in guests of all different political persuasions and artistic endeavors.<ref name="portland"/>

Encouraged by the Wolferses' acquaintance [[Carl Jung]], who thought that Doris had a greater creative instinct than her role as Arnold's secretary and amanuensis made use of, she had resumed her career as an artist in the early-to-mid 1950s.<ref name="bangor-1982">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63506705/ | title=Artist finds herself, her solace in textile montages | author-first=Robert H. | author-last=Newall | newspaper=Bangor Daily News | date=September 15, 1982 | page=M-6 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  She specialized in embroidery-based textual montages.<ref name="bangor-1981"/><ref name="bangor-1982"/>  Beginning in 1960, she had her work exhibited at galleries in Washington, New York, Rhode Island, and Maine.<ref name="bangor-1981">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63078569/ | title=Textural montages set for exhibition | newspaper=Bangor Daily News | date=August 1–2, 1981 | page=9 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Two [[Festschrift]] volumes were published in tribute to Wolfers.   The first, ''Foreign Policy in the Sixties: The Issues and the Instruments: Essays in Honor of Arnold Wolfers'', edited by [[Roger Hilsman]] and Robert C. Good, came out in 1965 during Wolfers' lifetime.  It largely featured contributions from his former students, including ones from [[Raymond L. Garthoff]], [[Laurence W. Martin]], [[Lucian W. Pye]], [[W. Howard Wriggins]], [[Ernest W. Lefever]], and the editors.   The second, ''Discord and Collaboration in a New Europe: Essays in Honor of Arnold Wolfers'', edited by Douglas T. Stuart and [[Stephen Szabo|Stephen F. Szabo]], came out in 1994 based on a 1992 conference at [[Dickinson College]].  It featured contributions from Martin again, [[Catherine McArdle Kelleher]], [[Vojtech Mastny]], and others, as well as the editors.

In terms of international relations theory, the editors of the second Festschrift characterize Wolfers as "the reluctant realist".<ref>Stuart and Szabo, ''Discord and Collaboration in a New Europe'', Table of Contents.</ref>
Wolfers could be categorized as belonging to "progressive realists", figures who often shared legal training, left-leaning traits in their thinking, and institutionally reformist goals.<ref name="scheuerman-8">Scheuerman, ''The Realist Case for Global Reform'', p. 8.</ref><!--TODO could develop his place in realism even more here -->  Wolfers' focus on morality and ethics in international relations, which he viewed as something that could transcend demands for security depending upon circumstances, is also unusual for a realist.<ref>Stuart, "Discord and Collaboration", pp. 5–6.</ref> Martin views Wolfers as having "swam against the tide" within the realist school, taking "a middle line that makes him seem in retrospect a pioneer revisionist of realism."<ref>Martin, "Arnold Wolfers and the Anglo-American Tradition", p. 13.</ref>  But Wolfers did not subscribe to alternative explanations for international relations, such as [[Behaviouralism (international relations)|behaviorism]] or [[Quantification (international relations)|quantification]], instead preferring to rely upon, as he said, "history, personal experience, introspection, common sense and the gift of logical reason".<ref>Martin, "Arnold Wolfers and the Anglo-American Tradition", pp. 12–13.</ref>

The progressive, democratic reputation that the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik enjoyed for decades became diminished as a result of scholarly research performed in the latter part of the twentieth century which showed that the  Hochschule's relationship with the Nazi Party was not the one of pure opposition that had been portrayed.<ref>Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", pp. 397, 409ff.</ref>  With those findings, Wolfers' reputation in connection to his role there suffered somewhat as well.<ref>Korenblat, "A School for the Republic?", pp. 429–430.</ref>  By one account, it took six decades for any of Wolfers' former students in the United States to concede that Wolfers, even after having left Germany and finding a secure position at Yale, had still during the 1930s shown some ideological sympathies with the Nazi regime.<ref name="eisfeld-114"/>

Two of Wolfers' formulations have often been repeated.  The first provides a metaphor for one model of who the participants are in international relations: states-as-actors behaving as billiard balls that collide with one another.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/the-new-foreign-policy-frontier/242593/ | title=The New Foreign-Policy Frontier | author-first= Anne-Marie | author-last=Slaughter | magazine=The Atlantic | date=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The second provides two components for the notion of national security; Wolfers wrote that "security, in an objective sense, measures the absence of threats to acquired values, in a subjective sense, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked."<ref>{{cite book | url=<!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=TZa7BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58&dq=%22arnold+wolfers%22+%22Security,+in+an+objective+sense%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsovX7gZHtAhWKuVkKHbIeD9EQ6AEwAnoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=%22arnold%20wolfers%22%20%22Security%2C%20in%20an%20objective%20sense%22&f=false -->| title=Security: A Critical Introduction | author-first=Lee | author-last=Jarvis | author2-first=Jack | author2-last=Holland | publisher=Palgrave | location=London | date=2015 | page=58 }}</ref>

Wolfers found composition difficult and his written output was small, with ''Britain and France Between Two Wars'' and ''Discord and Collaboration''      being his two major works.<ref>Martin, "Arnold Wolfers and the Anglo-American Tradition", pp. 11, 15.</ref><ref name="eisfeld-124-125"/>  Much of his influence lay in how he brought people and discussions together in productive ways and bridged gaps between theory and practice.<ref name="eisfeld-124-125">Eisfeld, "Émigré Scholars and the Genesis of International Relations", pp. 124–125.</ref>
But what Wolfers did write found an audience; by 1994, ''Discord and Collaboration'' was in its eighth printing, twenty-five years after his death.<ref name="fs2-stuart-3">Stuart, "Discord and Collaboration", p. 3.</ref> In the introduction to the second Festschrift, Douglas T. Stuart wrote, 
"The book stands the test of time for two reasons. First, the author addresses enduring aspects of international relations and offers insightful recommendations about the formulation and execution of foreign policy. Second, Wolfers's writings are anchored in a sophisticated theory of situational ethics that is valid for any historical period, but that is arguably more relevant today than it was when Wolfers was writing."<ref name="fs2-stuart-3"/>

Nevertheless, Wolfers' name is often not remembered as well as it might.  In a 2008 interview, [[Robert Jervis]], the Adlai E. Stevenson Professor of International Politics at Columbia University, listed international relations scholars who had influenced him, and he concluded by saying, "then there is one scholar who's not as well known as he should be: Arnold Wolfers, who was I think the most sophisticated, subtle, and well-grounded of the early generation of Realists."<ref name="jervis-int">{{cite web | url=http://www.theory-talks.org/2008/07/theory-talk-12.html | title=Theory Talk #12: Robert Jervis: Robert Jervis on Nuclear Weapons, Explaining the non-Realist Politics of the Bush Administration and US Military Presence in Europe | publisher=Theory Talks | date=July 24, 2008}}</ref>  In his 2011 book, political theorist William E. Scheuerman posits three "towering figures" of mid-twentieth century [[Classical realism (international relations)|classical realism]] – [[E. H. Carr]], [[Hans J. Morgenthau]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] – and next includes Wolfers, along with [[John H. Herz]] and [[Frederick L. Schuman]], in a group of "prominent postwar US political scientists, relatively neglected today but widely respected at mid century".<ref name="scheuerman-6">Scheuerman, ''The Realist Case for Global Reform'', pp. 5–6.</ref>

On the other hand, in a 2011 remark the British international relations scholar [[Michael Cox (academic)|Michael Cox]] mentioned Wolfers as one of the "giants" of international relations theory, along with [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Paul Nitze]], [[William T. R. Fox]], and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].<ref>Guilhot, "The Realist Gambit: Postwar American Political Science and the Birth of IR Theory", pp. 145–148, also back cover of volume.</ref>
In the 2011 ''Encyclopedia of Power'', Douglas T. Stuart wrote that "More than 40 years after his death, Arnold Wolfers remains one of the most influential experts in the field of international relations."<ref name="stuart">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Wolfers, Arnold (1892–1968)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Power|last=Stuart|first=Doug|editor-last=Dowding|editor-first=Keith|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=713–714}}</ref>
