==Early life and education==
Michael was born in 1961 and has a B.S. from [[Widener University]] and an M.A. from [[Temple University]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23933918/Professor-Kevin-MacDonalds-Critique-of-Judaism-Legitimate-Scholarship-or-the-Intellectualization-of-AntiSemitism Professor Kevin MacDonald's Critique of Judaism: Legitimate Scholarship or the Intellectualization of Anti-Semitism?], Britannica Online Encyclopedia, April 10, 2010.</ref> He obtained his Ph.D. in public policy from [[George Mason University]] in 2002,<ref name="book"/> where he studied under [[Francis Fukuyama]], with a thesis entitled "The U.S. Response to Domestic Right Wing Terrorism and Extremism: A Government and NGO Partnership."

==Career==
Described by ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' as an expert on political extremism,<ref name="csmonitor1">{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0402/Guardians-of-the-free-Republics-tied-to-Texas-radio-station |title=Guardians of the free Republics tied to Texas radio station / The Christian Science Monitor |date=April 2, 2010 |access-date=April 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="csmonitor3">{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0403/Guardians-of-the-free-Republics-looked-to-Gandhi-King-and-Mandela |title=Guardians of the free Republics looked to Gandhi, King, and Mandela / The Christian Science Monitor|date=April 3, 2010 |access-date=April 20, 2010}}</ref> he was awarded the University of Virginia's "Outstanding Research Award", awarded to a faculty member who "has contributed significantly to published research in his or her discipline".<ref name="virginia1">[http://www.wise.virginia.edu/college_relations/FacultyandStaffNews.pdf.pdf "UVA-Wise Faculty Received Harrison Awards", ''UVA-Wise Magazine'', Faculty and Staff News, accessed April 19, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902035201/http://www.wise.virginia.edu/college_relations/FacultyandStaffNews.pdf.pdf |date=September 2, 2006 }}</ref>

Michael is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]]. As a civilian, he did operations research for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c33aeF0FCGgC&pg=PR1 |title=Confronting right-wing extremism and ... – Google Books |date= 18 June 2004|isbn=9780203563212 |access-date=April 20, 2010|last1=Michael |first1=George }}</ref>

In 2003, he authored ''Confronting Right-wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA'', which discussed domestic terrorists and the threats they pose to U.S. "homeland security."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3702528/Confronting-Right-wing-Extremism-and.html |title=Confronting Right-wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA. &#124; Goliath Business News  |date=February 1, 2005 |access-date=April 20, 2010}}</ref>

''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'' reviewed his 2006 ''The Enemy of My Enemy'', writing that it "explores the connections and possibilities for cooperation between militant Islamic movements and Western right-wing extremism", and that it "provides a good overview of the historical and intellectual wellsprings of these two movements, but ultimately does not provide a case that would justify alarm".<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6974866/The-Enemy-of-My-Enemy.html "The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of Militant Islam and the Extreme Right (Book review)", ''Political Science Quarterly'', March 22, 2007, accessed April 19, 2010]</ref> [[Daveed Gartenstein-Ross]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' also reviewed it. He found it too long, yet lacking in analysis. But he noted its "in-depth study of the on-again, off-again love affair between radical Islam and the extreme right."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/532dxbll.asp?page=2 |title=Strange Allies |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=August 9, 2006 |access-date=April 24, 2010}}</ref>  

His 2008 book ''Willis Carto and the American Far Right'' is about [[Willis Carto]], founder of [[Liberty Lobby]].<ref>[http://www.wise.virginia.edu/college_relations/2008/09/GeorgeMichaelwritesCartobio.html "Biography by UVa-Wise professor George Michael profiles controversial Carto", ''UVA Wise College Relations'', October 10, 2008, accessed April 19, 2010]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>

Michael says that post-9/11, [[underground radio]] stations that traffic in conspiracy theories and incite violence in the U.S. are under greater scrutiny as law enforcement has been given more power to prosecute such speech. He also says that the ''[[American Free Press]]'' newspaper is "the most important newspaper of the radical right."<ref name="csmonitor1"/> He notes that:  "Traditionally, critique of the [[IRS]] has come from the right, such as the [[Christian Patriot movement]], but [[Sovereign citizen movement|sovereign citizen]] movements also invoke a lot of left-wing ideas like [[anti-capitalism]] that are consistent with the times and the downturn in the economy, where people may have property liens against them."<ref name="csmonitor3"/>
