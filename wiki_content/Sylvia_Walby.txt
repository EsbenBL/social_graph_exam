She is also co-organiser of an international network on Gender Globalization and Work Transformation (GLOW).

Walby is the first [[UNESCO]] Chair in Gender Research and coordinates the associated UNESCO Chair in Gender Research Group. She was appointed in 2008.

==Career==
Walby has been Sociology Professor at the [[University of Leeds]], Professor and Head of Department of Sociology at [[Bristol University]]; Reader in Sociology and Director of the Gender Institute at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]]; Lecturer in Sociology and Director of the Women's Studies Research Centre at [[Lancaster University]]; Visiting Associate Professor in Sociology at [[UCLA]] and Honorary Visiting Scholar at the Schlesinger Library, [[Harvard University]].  She was the first President of the European Sociological Association and has been Chair of the Women's Studies Network UK.

Her current research is situated within the tension between general social theory and specific forms of inequality, especially gender. Over the years this led her from theories of patriarchy to a current concern to mainstream difference into social theory. She has an interest in economic matters, a fascination with new political forms, and concern with marginalised groups. Today, all of these issues are framed by globalisation, the understanding of which requires new forms of social theory, especially complexity theories.

She was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |page=13 |supp=y }}</ref> In 2017 her contribution to sociology was recognised by [[Queen's University Belfast]] who awarded her an Honorary Doctorate in Social Sciences (DSSc).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://daro.qub.ac.uk/honorary-graduates-2017- | title=Honorary Graduates 2017 - QUB}}</ref>
