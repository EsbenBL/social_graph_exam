'''Gøsta Esping-Andersen''' ({{IPA-da|ˈjøstæ ˈespe̝ŋ ˈɑnɐsn̩|pron}}; born 24 November 1947)<ref name=Congress>{{cite web |title= Esping-Andersen, Gøsta, 1947– |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n84135803.html |publisher= Library of Congress |access-date= 4 January 2015 |quote= pub. info sheet (b. 11/24/47, Naestved, Denmark; Ph.D., 1978, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, sociology; Dept. of Sociology, Harvard Univ., assoc. prof., Cambrdige, Mass.) }}</ref> is a Danish [[sociologist]] whose primary focus has been on the [[welfare state]] and its place in [[capitalism|capitalist economies]]. [[Jacob Hacker]] describes him as the "dean of welfare state scholars."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hacker|first=Jacob|title=Beyond continuity:institutional change in advanced political economies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|chapter=Policy Drift: The Hidden Politics of US Welfare State Retrenchment}}</ref> Over the past decade his research has moved towards family demographic issues. A synthesis of his work was published as ''Families in the 21st Century'' (Stockholm, SNS, 2016).

Esping-Andersen is [[professor emeritus]] at [[Pompeu Fabra University]] in [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]), and member of the Scientific Committee of the [[Juan March Institute]] and of the Board of Trustees and the Scientific Council at the [[IMDEA]] Social Sciences Institute, both in [[Madrid]] ([[Spain]]). He is a member of the American Academy of Social Sciences and the British Academy. He was awarded an honoris doctor causa from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 2012. He is now a research professor at [[Bocconi University]] in Milan.

==Major works==
His major, most influential and highly cited book titled ''[[The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism]]''<ref>{{cite book | last = Esping-Andersen | first = Gøsta | title = The three worlds of welfare capitalism | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780069028573 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Esping-Andersen | first = Gøsta | doi = 10.1080/15579336.1990.11770001 | title = 4 the Three Political Economies of the Welfare State | journal = International Journal of Sociology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 92–123 | year = 1990 | hdl = 1814/22934 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> was published in 1990 and it laid out three main types of [[welfare state]]s, in which modern developed capitalist nations cluster: 
*Liberal
*Corporatist-Statist
*Social Democratic

It is important to note that these categories have little to do with the contemporary labels of [[American politics]], and rather have much more to do with general [[political theory]]. The traditional examples of the three types of welfare states are the [[United States]] (liberal), [[Germany]] (corporatist-statist) and [[Sweden]] (social democratic).

Other sociologists and political scientists went on to apply his theoretical analysis to the real world. One such example is a book entitled ''[[Real Worlds of Welfare Capitalism]]'', written by [[Robert E. Goodin]], Bruce Headey, Ruud Muffels, and Henk-Jan Dirven.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Goodin | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Headey | first2 = Bruce | last3 = Muffels | first3 = Rudd | last4 = Dirven | first4 = Henk-Jan | author-link1 = Robert E.

In the past decade, his research has moved to demographic issues and in particular to the consequences of women's changing roles. He has developed a multiple equilibrium framework for the understanding of changing family behaviour. See in particular his ''Families in the 21st Century and Esping-Andersen and Billari'' (2015) and ''Retheorizing family demographic change. Population and Development Review (2015)''.

==Criticism==

The evolving nature of welfare states often makes it difficult to categorize. Arguably, many welfare states have components from some or all typologies, making them more akin to points on a continuum rather than rigid typologies, a fact Esping-Andersen acknowledges in his writings.

According to French sociologist, [[Georges Menahem]], Esping-Andersen's "[[decommodification]] index" aggregates both qualitative and quantitative variables for ”sets of dimensions” which fluid, and pertain to three very different areas.  Similarly, Menahem has concerns regarding the validity of the index, and its potential for replication.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Menahem | first = Georges | author-link = Helena Flam | title = The decommodified security ratio: A tool for assessing European social protection systems | journal = [[International Social Security Review]] | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 69–103 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-246X.2007.00281.x | date = October 2007 | s2cid = 64361693 | url = https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00198398/file/ISSR-2007-4-TheDSRatoolforassessing.pdf }}</ref>

In 1996, the Italian Social Scientist [[Maurizio Ferrera]], further developed Esping-Andersen's Worlds of Welfare by identifying a fourth subtype of the welfare state model, the Southern European Model of Welfare.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/095892879600600102|doi=10.1177/095892879600600102|title=The 'Southern Model' of Welfare in Social Europe|year=1996|last1=Ferrera|first1=Maurizio|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|volume=6|pages=17–37|s2cid=154404873}}</ref>
