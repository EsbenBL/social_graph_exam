=== Historical trends and statistics of War and Peace ===
Professor F. A. Beer found that periods of major peace have tended to become longer over time. And the wars are generally getting shorter accordingly, but more serious in terms of their destructive power. On his opinion, these are general tendencies. However, trends and statistics are less clear for a smaller and separate sample of countries, such as Professor F.A. Beer draws on the experience of war and peace in the United States. In this context, examples are given of the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beer|first=Francis A.|date=1983|title=Trends in American Major War and Peace|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/173891|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=27|issue=4|pages=661–686|issn=0022-0027}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Beer|first=Francis A.|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/851206|title=How much war in history: definitions, estimates, extrapolations, and trends|date=1974|isbn=978-0-8039-0476-7|series=Sage professional papers in international studies|location=Beverly Hills, Calif., Sage Publications}}</ref>

=== Alliances as Latent War Communities ===
Francis A. Beer in his publication "''Integration and Disintegration in NATO: Processes of Alliance Cohesion and Prospects for Atlantic Community"'' has shown how geopolitical actors who joined military-political alliances, such as NATO, for example, create local international communities that are essentially both integrative and disintegrative. According to the professor, members of NATO help maintain the internal peace of members, but are ready to wage war against external geopolitical actors. So the Alliance's institutions provide a framework through which members contribute a variety of resources and receive both collective and private benefits.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Annette Baker|date=1972|title=Review of Integration and Disintegration in NATO: Processes of Alliance Cohesion and Prospects for Atlantic Community.; NATO: The Transatlantic Bargain.|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2147831|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=277–279|doi=10.2307/2147831|issn=0032-3195}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Alliances latent war communities in the contemporary world|url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1500073391|access-date=2021-11-28|website=Imperial War Museums|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beer|first=Francis|title=Personal Narrative and Research|url=https://www.academia.edu/7300281/Personal_Narrative_and_Research}}</ref>
