'''Enrico Barone''' ({{IPA-it|baˈroːne|lang}}; 22 December 1859, [[Naples]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] – 14 May 1924, [[Rome]], Italy) was a [[soldier]], [[military historian]], and an [[economist]].

==Biography==
Barone studied the [[classics]] and [[mathematics]] before becoming an army officer. He taught military history for eight years from 1894 at the Officers' Training School.{{where?|date=March 2016}} There he wrote a series of influential historical military works. In these he employed a method of successive approximations to which his study in economics had introduced him. In 1902, he became head of the historical office of the General Staff. He resigned his commission in 1906.

From 1894 he collaborated with [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]] in the ''Giornale degli Economisti''.<ref name="Caffé">F.

He was the first to state conditions under which a [[perfect competition|competitive market]] would be [[Pareto efficient]].<ref>[[William D. Nordhaus]], 1992.

He extended conditions of [[general equilibrium]] in [[Léon Walras|Walrasian theory]], suggesting the feasibility of [[trial and error|trial-and-error]] movement to [[market equilibrium]]. He pioneered the economic theory of [[Index (economics)|index numbers]]. His contributions were made without use of [[utility]] or even [[indifference curve]]s.<ref name="Samuelson">[[Paul A.

Barone has been described as a "founder of the pure theory of a socialist economy."<ref name="Caffé"/> In 1908, he presented a mathematical model for a socialist economy under which certain relations, later identified with [[shadow price]]s, must be satisfied for "maximum collective welfare."<ref>• Enrico Barone, 1908."Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista", ''Giornale degli Economisti'', Sept./Oct., 2, pp.&nbsp;267–93, 392–414, trans. as "The Ministry of Production in the Collectivist State," in [[F.

He stressed that such a result could not be arrived at ''a priori'' but only by experimentation on a large scale with great demands on data collection, even assuming unchanging productive conditions. In this, he suggested that movement toward economic efficiency in a socialist economy was not inconceivable, outlining two types of socialism: a centralized and decentralized model. For such regimes, whatever the [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] rule for output and income adopted by the Ministry of Production, the same economic categories would reappear for prices, salaries, interest, rent, profits, saving, etc., though perhaps with different names. His analysis and the [[Austrian School]] economists' responses, fueled discussion of the [[economic calculation problem]] and [[market socialism]] in the 1930s.<ref name="Caffé"/> His method also anticipated [[Abram Bergson]]'s seminal formulation of a [[Social welfare function#Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function|social welfare function]] three decades later.<ref name="Samuelson"/>
