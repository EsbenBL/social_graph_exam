'''George Ritzer''' (born October 14, 1940) is an American [[sociologist]], professor, and author who has mainly studied [[globalization]], [[metatheory]], patterns of [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]], and modern/postmodern [[social theory]]. His concept of [[McDonaldization]] draws upon [[Max Weber]]'s idea of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] through the lens of the [[fast food]] industry. He coined the term after writing ''The McDonaldization of Society'' (1993), which is among the best selling monographs in the history of American sociology.<ref name="being-nothingness" /> 

Ritzer has written many general sociology books, including ''Introduction to Sociology'' (2012) and ''Essentials to Sociology'' (2014), and modern/postmodern social theory textbooks. Many of his works have been translated into over 20 languages, with over a dozen translations of ''The McDonaldization of Society'' alone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory Ninth Edition|last2=Stepnisky|first2=Jeffrey|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|year=2013|isbn=978-0-07-802701-7|location=New York, NY|pages=v}}</ref>''.'' 

Ritzer is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

== Biography ==

=== Early Life ===

Ritzer was born in 1940 to a Jewish family in upper [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York City.]] Ritzer has one younger brother while his father was a taxi cab driver and his mother was a secretary. Ritzer later described his upbringing as "upper lower class".<ref name=being-nothingness>{{citation|title=Being (George Ritzer) and Nothingness: An Interview

=== Education and Early Employment ===
Ritzer graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1958,<ref name=ritzervitae>{{cite web|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|title=Vitae|url=http://georgeritzer.wordpress.com/vitae/|website=georgeritzer.com|publisher=Word Press|access-date=5 October 2014|date=2012-05-02}}</ref> stating to have "encountered the brightest people I have ever met in my life".<ref name="being-nothingness" /> While at Bronx High School of Science, Ritzer received a New York State Regents Scholarship which would follow him to whichever college he chose to attend.<ref name=being-nothingness />

Ritzer began his higher education at [[City College of New York]], a free college at the time. His scholarship in addition to the free college tuition proved to be a benefit to the economic positioning of the Ritzer family.<ref name=being-nothingness /> While at CCNY, Ritzer initially planned to focus on business, but he later changed his major to accounting.

After graduating from CCNY in 1962,<ref name="ritzervitae" /> Ritzer decided that he was interested in pursuing business again. He was accepted into the M.B.A. program at the [[University of Michigan Ann Arbor]], where he received a partial scholarship. While at Michigan, his official academic interest was human relations; however, he had many other intellectual hobbies, such as reading Russian novels. Ritzer reported that at Michigan, as he was able to grow and improve as a student. However, during his time at Michigan, he remembers being heavily involved in global events occurring at the time. He reports memories of going to the Michigan Union to watch the happenings of the Cuban Missile Crisis.<ref name="being-nothingness"/>

After graduating from [[University of Michigan|The University of Michigan]] in 1964,<ref name=ritzervitae /> Ritzer began working in personnel management for the [[Ford Motor Company]]; however, this proved to be a negative experience for him. His managers mistakenly hired three people, more than was necessary, for the one job, leaving him idle and unoccupied. As he once said: "[i]f we had two hours of work a day, it was a lot."<ref name="being-nothingness"/> Nevertheless, he was always expected to appear busy. He would constantly wander around the factory for hours observing people working, causing many of the workers and foremen to become hostile towards him. Moreover, Ritzer also found problems within the management structure at Ford. Most of the younger people with advanced degrees defied their less educated authorities. Ritzer said, "I'd like to see a society in which people are free to be creative, rather than having their creativity constrained or eliminated."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=George Ritzer|url=http://georgeritzer.com/}}</ref> Furthermore, he found himself constrained and unable to do anything creative while working at Ford, encouraging him to apply to Ph.D. programs.<ref name="being-nothingness"/>

Ritzer enrolled in Cornell University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations Ph.D. program in Organizational Behavior in 1965.<ref name=being-nothingness /> There, his adviser Harrison Trice suggested that he minor in sociology. After a conversation with the head of the department, Gordon Streib, Ritzer realized that he knew nothing about sociology and was then urged to read "Broom and Selznick’s Introduction to Sociology" and found himself enthralled with the subject matter.<ref name=being-nothingness /> He continued to succeed in sociology courses at the graduate level. As a testament to his interest and dedication to the subject, he received an A+ on a 102-page paper he wrote for a course on American society. His professor stated that the paper was "too long not to be good".<ref name=being-nothingness /> This experience as well as out-reading the other sociology students in a small seminar with Margaret Cussler allowed Ritzer to become more confident as a sociology student due to his ability to outwork the competition. He attributed his talent of being able to compete with well-read and experienced sociology students to his work ethic.<ref name="being-nothingness"/>

Ritzer never earned a degree in sociology, but studied psychology and business. As he said in a later interview, "I basically trained myself as a social theorist, and so I had to learn it all as I went."  Despite this challenge, Ritzer found that not being trained in social theory was advantageous for him, because his reasoning was not limited to a particular theoretical perspective.<ref name="being-nothingness"/>

=== McDonaldization ===
George Ritzer wrote ''The McDonaldization of Society. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rojek|first1=Chris|date=23 January 2007|title=George Ritzer and the Crisis of the Public Intellectual|journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies|volume=29|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.1080/10714410600552241|issn=1071-4413|s2cid=145450920}}</ref>''

Ritzer's idea of [[McDonaldization]] is an extension of [[Max Weber]]'s (1864–1920) classical theory of the [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of modern society and culture. Weber famously used the terminology "[[iron cage]]" to describe the stultifying, [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] effects of bureaucratized life,<ref>{{cite book|last=Farganis|first=James|title=Readings in Social Theory, 6th Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0078111556}}</ref> and Ritzer applied this idea to an influential social system in the twenty-first century: [[McDonald's]]. Ritzer argues that McDonald's restaurants have become the better example of current forms of [[instrumental rationality]] and its ultimately irrational and harmful consequences on people<ref>Ritzer, G. ''The McDonaldization of Society''. SAGE Publications, Inc. Thousand Oaks, 1996</ref>
Ritzer shared similar views as Max Weber about the topic of rationalization. While Weber claims that “the most sublime values have retreated from public life”, Ritzer claims that even our food is subject to rationalization, whether it is “the McDonaldized experience or the steak dinner that is subjected to the fact that it contains 2,000 calories and 100 grams of fat."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Kenneth |title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory: Seeing the Social World |date=2010 |publisher=Pine Forge Press }}</ref>”Ritzer identifies four rationalizing dimensions of McDonald's that contribute to the process of McDonaldization, claiming that McDonald's aims to increase:
# [[Efficiency]]: McDonald's delivers products quickly and easily without inputting an excessive amount of money. The "McDonald's model," and therefore the McDonald's operations, follow a predesigned process that leads to a specified end, using productive means.<ref name= McDonaldization20th >{{cite book|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|title=The McDonaldization of Society: 20th Anniversary Edition|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781452226699}}</ref> The efficiency of the McDonald's model has infiltrated other modern day services such as completing tax forms online, easy weight loss programs, [[The Walt Disney Company]] FASTPASSes, and online dating services, [[eHarmony]] and [[match.com]].<ref name=McDonaldization20th /><ref name="Massey 2012 453–455">{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Garth|title=Readings For Sociology, 7th Edition|year=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393927009|pages=[https://archive.org/details/readingsforsocio0005unse/page/453 453–455]|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsforsocio0005unse/page/453}}</ref>
#[[Calculability]]: America has grown to connect the quantity of a product with the quality of a product and that "bigger is better".<ref name=McDonaldization20th /> The "McDonald's model" is influential in this conception due to providing a lot of food for not that much money. While the end products feed into the connection between the quantity and quality of the product, so does the McDonald's production process. Throughout the food production, everything is standardized and highly calculated: the size of the beef patty, the amount of french fries per order, and the time spent in a franchise. The high calculability of the McDonald's franchise also extends over into academics. It is thought that the academic experience, in high school and higher education, can be quantified into one number, the [[GPA]]. Also, calculability leads to the idea that the longer the resume or list of degrees, the better the candidate, during an application process. In addition to academics being affected by the McDonaldization in society, sports, specifically basketball have also been affected. It used to be that basketball was a more laid-back, slow-paced sort of game, yet through the creation of fast-food and McDonald's, a [[shot clock]] was added to increase not only the speed of the game, but also the number of points scored.<ref name=McDonaldization20th /> 
#[[Predictability]]: Related to calculability, customers know what to expect from a given producer of goods or services. For example, customers know that every [[Big Mac]] from McDonald's is going to be the same as the next one; there is an understood predictability to the menu as well as the overall experience. In order to maintain the predictability for each franchise, there has to be "discipline, order, systematization, formalization, routine, consistency, and a methodical operation".<ref name=McDonaldization20th /> The predictability of the McDonald's franchise also appears through the golden arches in front of every franchise as well as the scripts that the employees use on the customers. [[The Walt Disney Company]] also has regulations in place, like dress code for men and women, in order to add to the predictability of each amusement park or Disney operation. Predictability has also extended into movie sequels and TV shows. With each movie sequel, like ''[[Spy Kids 4]]'', or TV show, ''[[Law & Order (franchise)|Law & Order]]'' and its spinoffs, the plot is predictable and usually follow a preconceived model.<ref name=McDonaldization20th />
#[[Control (management)|Control]]: McDonald's restaurants pioneered the idea of highly specialized tasks for all employees to ensure that all human workers are operating at exactly the same level. This is a way to keep a complicated system running smoothly; rules and regulations that make efficiency, calculability, and predictability possible.<ref name="Massey 2012 453–455"/> Oftentimes, the use of non-human technology, such as computers, is used. The McDonald's food is already "pre-prepared", the potatoes are already cut and processed, just needing to be fried and heated, and the food preparation process is monitored and tracked. The computers tell the managers how many hamburgers are needed at the lunchtime rush and other peak times and the size and shape of the pickles as well as how many go on a hamburger is managed and control.<ref name=McDonaldization20th /> The control aspect of McDonaldization has extended to other businesses, [[Sylvan Learning]] and phone operating systems, and even birth and death. Every step of the learning process at Sylvan, the U-shaped tables and instruction manuals, is controlled as well as each step of the birthing process, in modern-day hospitals, and the process of dying.<ref name=McDonaldization20th />

McDonaldization is profitable, desirable, and at the cutting edge of technological advances. Many "McDonald's" aspects of society are beneficial to the advancement and enhancement of human life. Some claim that rationalization leads to "more egalitarian" societies. For example, supermarkets and large grocery stores offer variety and availability unlike smaller farmer's markets from generations past. The McDonaldization of society also allows operations to be more productive, improve the quality of some products, and produce services and products at lower cost.<ref name=McDonaldization20th /> The Internet has provided countless new services to people that were previously impossible, such as checking bank statements without having to go to a bank or being able to purchase things online without leaving the house.<ref>{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Garth|title=Readings For Sociology, 7th Edition|year=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393927009|pages=[https://archive.org/details/readingsforsocio0005unse/page/457 457]|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsforsocio0005unse/page/457}}</ref> These things are all positive effects of the rationalization and McDonaldization of society.

However, McDonaldization also alienates people and creates a disenchantment of the world. The increased standardization of society dehumanizes people and institutions. The "assembly line" feel of fast-food restaurants is transcending many other facets of life and removing humanity from previously human experiences.<ref name="Mann 2007 381–384">{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=381–384}}</ref><ref name="Massey 2012 456">{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Garth|title=Readings For Sociology, 7th Edition|year=2012|publisher=W.W.

''The McDonaldization of Society'' has been translated into over a dozen languages and is arguably one of the best selling monographs in the history of American sociology. 

=== Consumption ===
{{Anti-consumerism |People}}
An early admirer of [[Jean Baudrillard]]’s ''Consumer Society'' (1970),<ref name=consuming-passion>{{citation|title=A Consuming Passion: An Interview with George Ritzer |last1=Dandaneau |first1=Steve P. |last2=Dodsworth |first2=Robin M. |year=2006 |url=http://www.georgeritzer.com/docs/A%20Consuming%20Passion.pdf |access-date=2009-06-28}}</ref> Ritzer is a leading proponent of the study of [[consumption (sociology)|consumption]].  In addition to ''[[The McDonaldization of Society]]'', the most important sources for Ritzer’s sociology of consumption are his edited Explorations in the ''Sociology of Consumption: Fast Food Restaurants, Credit Cards and Casinos'' (2001), ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption'' (2nd edition 2005, 3rd edition 2009), and ''Expressing America: A Critique of the Global Credit-Card Society'' (1995). Ritzer is also a founding editor, with Don Slater, of [[Sage Publications|Sage]]'s ''[[Journal of Consumer Culture]]''.<ref name="Vita: George Ritzer"/>

=== Prosumption ===
First coined by [[Alvin Toffler]] in 1980, the term [[Prosumer|prosumption]] is used by Ritzer and Jurgenson,<ref>{{citation|title=Production, Consumption, Prosumption : The nature of capitalism in the age of the digital 'prosumer'|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture |volume=10 |pages=13–36 |last1=Ritzer |first1=George |last2=Jurgenson |first2=Nathan |year=2010 |url=http://joc.sagepub.com/content/10/1/13.short|doi=10.1177/1469540509354673 |s2cid=145687378 }}</ref> to break down the false dichotomy between production and consumption and describe the dual identity of economic activities. Ritzer argues that prosumption is the primordial form of economic activities, and the current ideal separation between production and consumption is aberrant and distorted due to the effect of both Industrial Revolution and post-WWII American consumption boom. It has only recently become popularly acknowledged that the existence of prosumption as activities on the internet and Web 2.0 resemble prosumption much more so than production or consumption individually. Various online activities require the input of consumers such as Wikipedia entries, Facebook profiles, Twitter, Blog, Myspace, Amazon preferences, eBay auctions, Second Life, etc.
Ritzer argues that we should view all economic activities on a continuum of prosumption with '''prosumption as production''' (p-a-p) and '''prosumption as consumption''' (p-a-c) on each pole.

=== Something vs. Nothing ===
According to Ritzer, "Something" is a locally conceived and controlled social form that is comparatively rich in distinctive substantive content. It also describes things as being fairly unusual. "Nothing" is "a social form that is generally centrally conceived, controlled and comparatively devoid of distinctive substantive content" <ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=396–397}}</ref> "Nothing" usually aims at the standardized and homogenous, while "something" refers to things that are personal or have local flavor. Examples of "nothing" are [[McDonald's]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Starbucks]], credit cards, and the [[Internet]]. Examples of "something" are local sandwich shops, local hardware stores, family arts and crafts places, or a local breakfast cafe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=398}}</ref>
Ritzer believes that things that embody the "nothing" component of this dichotomy are taking over and pushing "something" out of society. He explains the advantages and disadvantages of both "something" and "nothing" in ''The McDonaldization of Society''.<ref name="Massey 2012 456"/>

=== Globalization ===
In Ritzer's research, [[globalization]] refers to the rapidly increasing worldwide integration and interdependence of societies and cultures.<ref name="Ritzer, G 2004">Ritzer, G. ''The Globalization of Nothing'', [[Pine Forge Press]], Thousand Oaks, 2004,</ref> This book presents a sophisticated argument about the nature of globalization in terms of the consumption of goods and services. He defines it as involving a worldwide diffusion of practices, relations, and forms of social organization and the growth of global consciousness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=396}}</ref> The concept of "something" vs. "nothing" plays a large part in understanding Ritzer's Globalization. Society is becoming bombarded with "nothing" and Ritzer seems to believe that the globalization of "nothing" is almost unstoppable <ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=402}}</ref>  Ritzer's aforementioned ''The Globalization of Nothing'' (2004/2007) stakes out a provocative perspective in the ongoing and voluminous globalization discourse. For Ritzer, globalization typically leads to consumption of vast quantities of serial social forms that have been centrally conceived and controlled – one [[McDonald's]] hamburger, i.e., one instance of nothing again and again- dominates social life (Ritzer, George. 2004. ''The Globalization of Nothing''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press).
To better understand globalization, it can be broken down into a few characteristics:
* The beginning of global communication through different media like television and the Internet
* The formation of a "global consciousness"<ref name="Mann 2007 381–384"/>

In addition to ''The Globalization of Nothing'', Ritzer has edited ''The Blackwell Companion to Globalization'' (2007), written ''Globalization: A Basic Text'' (2009), and edited an ''Encyclopedia of Globalization'' (forthcoming). Insight into Ritzer's distinctive approach to globalization is available via a special review symposium in the Sage journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]'' (Number 76, February 2004).<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glocalization.asp Glocalization.] Investopedia.</ref>

=== Grobalization ===
In his book ''The Globalization of Nothing'' (2004), Ritzer quotes that globalization consists of [[glocalization]] and grobalization.<ref name="GoN Xiii">Ritzer, George (2004). The ''Globalization of Nothing.'' Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. Xiii</ref>
Grobalization, a term coined by Ritzer himself, refers to "imperialistic ambitions of nations, corporations, organizations, and the like and their desire, indeed need, to impose themselves on various geographic areas".<ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.73">Ritzer, George (2004). ''The Globalization of Nothing''. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. p.73</ref>
As opposite to glocalization, grobalization aims to "overwhelm local".<ref name="GoN Xiii"/> Its ultimate goal is to see profit grow through unilateral homogenization, thus earning its name ''gro''balization. Capitalism, [[Americanization]], and [[McDonaldization]] are all parts of grobalization.<ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.73"/>

Grobalization involves three motor forces: [[capitalism]], McDonaldization, and Americanization. Grobalization creates a world where:
#Things are more homogenous and ubiquitous.
#Larger forces overwhelm the power of people to adapt and innovate in ways that preserve their autonomy.
#Social processes are coercive, determining the nature of local communities, which have little room to maneuver.
#Consumer goods and the media are key forces that largely dictate the nature of the self and the groups a person joins.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=400}}</ref>

Ritzer provides American textbook as an example of grobalization. In his book, ''The Globalization of Nothing'', he quotes that textbooks are "oriented to rationalizing, McDonaldizing, the communication of information."<ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.175">Ritzer, George (2004). ''The Globalization of Nothing''. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. p.175</ref> Students, rather than evaluating the competing ideas, instead absorb the information given to them. Yet, these textbooks are surprisingly sold out worldwide, only to be slightly revised to reflect local standards.<ref name="Ritzer, George 2004 p.175"/>

=== Glocalization ===
[[Glocalization]] is a combination of the words "[[globalization]]" and "[[localisation (economics)|localization]]" used to describe a product or service that is developed and distributed globally, but is also fashioned to accommodate the user or consumer in a local market, causing the products, or results of glocalization, to vary depending on different locations. The local individuals are able to manipulate their own situation in the world and become creative agents in what products and services are represented in their local environment within the glocalized world.<ref name=Globalization2 /> Ritzer further explains Glocalization as a relatively benign process that is closest to the "something" end of things. It creates variety and heterogeneity within society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Douglas|title=Understanding society : a survey of modern social theory|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9780195421842|pages=399}}</ref>

=== Metatheory ===
[[Metatheory]] can be defined as the attainment of a deeper understanding of theory, the creation of new theory, and the creation of an overarching theoretical perspective. There are three types of metatheorizing: M<sub>u</sub>, M<sub>p</sub>, and M<sub>o</sub>. Through the application of the three subsets of metatheory, Ritzer argues that the field of sociology can create a stronger foundation, experience "rapid and dramatic growth", and generally increase not only the knowledge of metatheory but social theory in general.<ref name= Metatheorizing>{{cite journal | title = Metatheorizing in Sociology | first = George | last = Ritzer | journal = [[Sociological Forum]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 1990 | pages = 3–15 | jstor = 684578 | doi = 10.1007/BF01115134 | s2cid = 189919029 }}</ref>

The first category of metatheory (M<sub>u</sub>), aims at being a means of attaining a deeper understanding of theory. Within the greater category of M<sub>u</sub>, Ritzer establishes four other subsets: internal-intellectual, internal-social, external-intellectual, and external-social. The internal-intellectual sector of M<sub>u</sub> identifies the "schools of thought" and the structure of current sociologists and social theories. The internal-social subtype identifies connections between sociologists and connections between sociologists and society. The last two subsets of M<sub>u</sub> are looking more at the macrolevel of sociology than the other two subsets. The third subtype of M<sub>u</sub> is the external-intellectual view of sociology; it looks at different studies and their concepts, tools, and ideas in order to apply these aspects to sociology. The fourth, and final, subset is external-social where the impact of social theory in a larger societal setting is studied.<ref name= "Metatheorizing" />

The second (M<sub>p</sub>), aims at being a prelude to theory development. New social theory is created due to the complex study and interpretation of other sociologists. For example, [[Karl Marx]]'s theories are based on [[Hegel]]'s theories. The theories of the American sociologist, [[Talcott Parsons]], are based on the theories of [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[Alfred Marshall]].<ref name= "Metatheorizing" />

The last (M<sub>o</sub>), aims at being a source of perspectives that overarch sociological theory.<ref name= "Metatheorizing" /> Influenced by [[Thomas Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), Ritzer has long advocated the view that social theory is improved by systematic, comparative and reflexive attention to implicit conceptual structures and oft-hidden assumptions.<ref name="Ritzer, G. Sociology 1974">Ritzer, G. ''Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science''. [[Allyn and Bacon]], Boston, 1974,</ref>

Key works include ''Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science'' (1975), ''Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm'' (1981), ''Metatheorizing in Sociology'' (1991), and ''Explorations in Social Theory: From Metatheorizing to Rationalization'' (2001). See also Ritzer’s edited ''Metatheorizing'' (1992).

=== Modern and Postmodern Social Theory ===
Ritzer is known to generations of students as the author of numerous comprehensive introductions and compendia in social theory. [[Postmodern]] society is a consumer society that invents new means of consumption, such as [[credit cards]], [[shopping malls]], and [[shopping networks]]. Today, "Capitalism needs us to keep on spending at ever-increasing levels to be and remain capitalism."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=The New Means of Consumption: A Postmodern Analysis|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~s2005.soc.401/ritzer(apr29).pdf|access-date=4 October 2012}}</ref>  As with several of Ritzer's other principal works, many are translated into languages as diverse as Chinese, Russian, Persian, Hebrew and Portuguese.<ref name="Vita: George Ritzer"/>  Key volumes in this genre include ''The Sociological Theory'' (7th edition 2008), ''Classical Sociological Theory'' (5th edition 2008), and ''Modern Sociological Theory'' (7th edition 2008), ''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'' (2 vols. 2005), and ''Postmodern Social Theory'' (1997). For convenient access to many of Ritzer's substantive contributions to modern and postmodern social theorizing, see ''Explorations in Social Theory: From Metatheorizing to Rationalization'' (2001) as well as more recent work often co-authored with his many students, such as (with J.

== Works ==
Ritzer has published many monographs and textbooks. He has edited three encyclopedias, including the ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology''. He has written approximately one hundred scholarly articles in respected journals.<ref name="Vita: George Ritzer"/>

=== ''Sociology: A Multiple Paradigm Science'' (1975, 1980) ===

Based on his original article appearing in the ''American Sociologist'',<ref>''The American Sociologist'', Vol. 10, No. 3, August 1975 (pp.&nbsp;156–167)</ref> this book provides a foundation for Ritzer's other works on [[metatheory]].  The piece applies Thomas Kuhn's idea of scientific [[paradigm]]s to sociology and demonstrating that sociology is a science consisting of multiple paradigms. Ritzer also discusses what implications this has for the field of sociology.<ref name="Ritzer, G. Sociology 1974"/>

=== ''Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm'' (1981) ===

In this book, Ritzer contends that sociology needs an integrated [[paradigm]] in order to add to the extant paradigms noted in ''Sociology:  A Multiple Paradigm Science''. Ritzer proposes an integrated paradigm dealing with the interrelationships between the many levels of social reality.<ref>Ritzer, G. ''Toward an Integrated Sociological Paradigm''. Allyn and Bacon, Boston, 1981,</ref>

=== ''Metatheorizing in Sociology (1991)'' ===
This paper describes and makes the case for sociological metatheorizing, or the systematic study of sociological theory. Three types of metatheorizing are delineated on the basis of their end products: the attainment of a deeper understanding of theory, the creation of new theory, and the creation of an overarching theoretical perspective (a metatheory). The basic problems in metatheorizing are reviewed and it is concluded that the most basic difficulty has been the lack of a clear definition of the subfield. Some thoughts on the future of metatheorizing in sociology are offered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ritzer|first=George|date=1990|title=Metatheorizing in sociology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01115134|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=5|pages=12|via=SpringerLink}}</ref>

=== ''The McDonaldization of Society'' (1993) ===

In this provocative book, George Ritzer explores how Weber's classic thoughts on [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] take on new vitality and meaning when applied to the process of [[McDonaldization]]. He describes this as the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurants are coming to dominate more and more sectors of society in the United States as well as the rest of the world. George Ritzer is most well known for The McDonaldization of Society, which has five different editions and has sold over 175,000 copies as of 2007.<ref name="George Ritzer and the Crisis of the">{{cite journal|last1=Rojek|first1=Chris|date=23 January 2007|title=George Ritzer and the Crisis of the Public Intellectual|journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies|volume=29|pages=3–21|doi=10.1080/10714410600552241|s2cid=145450920}}</ref>

Ritzer shows how Weber's central characteristics of rationalized systems - [[efficiency]], [[predictability]], [[calculability]], substitution of non-human for human [[technology]] and control over uncertainty - have found widespread expression in a broad range of organized human activity, including travel, consumer products and services, education, leisure, politics and religion as well as in the fast food industry.<ref>Ritzer, G.

=== ''The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists'' (2003) ===

Guide to thirteen leading social theorists: [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Social exchange theory#History|Richard M. Emerson]], [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Daniel Bell]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Judith Butler]].<ref name="John Wiley and Sons">{{cite book |last1=Ritzer |first1=George |title=The Blackwell Companion to Major Classical Theorists |date=2003 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}</ref>
During the Introduction of this book, Ritzer writes, “Although any list of theorists covered in a collection such as this one can be read as an official cannon, this book is intended to be used as ‘cannon fodder’ in an open, contestable process of theory construction and reconstruction."<ref name="John Wiley and Sons"/>

=== ''The Globalization of Nothing'', Second Edition (2007) ===
''The Globalization of Nothing'', Second Edition emphasizes the processes of [[globalization]] and how they relate to [[McDonaldization]]. As before, this book is structured around four sets of concepts addressing the issues of: "places/non-places," "things/non-things," "people/non-people," and "services/non-services." By drawing upon salient examples from everyday life, Ritzer invites the reader to examine the nuances of these concepts in conjunction with the paradoxes within the process of the globalization of nothing. Critical questions are raised throughout, and the reader is compelled not only to seek answers to these questions, but also to critically evaluate the questions as well as their answers. The current edition features a greater emphasis on the main topic of [[globalization]]: a new first chapter offers an introductory overview of [[globalization]] and globalization theory, outlining the unique ways in which these topics are addressed throughout the text. It also delves into two subprocesses of globalization — "glocalization" and "grobalization."<ref name="Globalization2">Ritzer, G.

=== ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World'', Third Edition (2009) ===

''Enchanting a Disenchanted World'', Third Edition examines Disney, malls, cruise lines, Las Vegas, the World Wide Web, McDonald's, Planet Hollywood, credit cards, and all the other ways we now consume. The current edition was updated to reflect the recent economic recession and the impact of the [[internet]]. Ritzer continues to explore this book's central thesis: that our society has undergone fundamental change because of the way and the level at which we consume.  The third edition demonstrates how we have created new "cathedrals" of consumption (places that enchant us so as to entice us to stay longer and consume more) while continuing to take [[capitalism]] to a new level. These places of [[consumption (sociology)|consumption]], whether in our homes, the mall, or cyberspace, are in a constant state of "enchanting the disenchanted," luring us through new spectacles because their rational qualities are both necessary and deadening at the same time.  The book also includes a wide range of theoretical perspectives — Marxian, Weberian, critical theory, postmodern theory — as well as a number of concepts such as hyperconsumption, implosion, [[simulation]], and time and space to show the audience how sociological theory can be applied to everyday phenomena.<ref>Ritzer, G.

Written in a highly accessible style, anddrawing on sources both academic and popular, the book adopts adefinition of globalization that emphasizes transplanetary flowsand the structures that both expedite and impede those flows. Driven by a range of theories from imperialism andAmericanization (and anti-Americanism), to neo-liberalism and theneo-Marxian alternatives, as well the major types of culturaltheory, the book examines the key events in the history ofglobalization, and the principle flows and structures produced inthe course of that history. Among the major topics covered are theeconomy, culture, technology, media and the Internet, migration,the environment, global inequalities, and the future ofglobalization. Making extensive use of maps and with a glossary of key terms,this book offers the reader not only a descriptive, but also acritical, analysis of globalization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Globalization: A Basic Text|publisher=Wiley and Sons|year=2009}}</ref>

=== ''The McDonaldization of Society: 20th Anniversary Edition'' (2012) ===
Ritzer's ''McDonaldization of Society'', now celebrating its 20th anniversary, continues to stand as one of the pillars of modern-day sociological thought. By linking theory to 21st-century culture, this book resonates with audiences in a way that few other books do, opening their eyes to many current issues, especially in [[consumption (sociology)|consumption]] and [[globalization]]. As in previous editions, the book has been updated and it offers new discussions of, among others, [[In-N-Out Burger]] and [[Pret a Manger]] as possible antitheses of [[McDonaldization]]. The biggest change, however, is that the book has been streamlined to offer an even clearer articulation of the McDonaldization thesis.  The final chapter also looks at "The DeMcDonaldization of Society", and concludes that while it is occurring on the surface, McDonaldization is alive and well.<ref>Ritzer, G.
