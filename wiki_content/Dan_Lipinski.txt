'''Daniel William Lipinski''' (born July 15, 1966) is an American politician and political scientist who served eight terms as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[Illinois's 3rd congressional district]] from 2005 to 2021. A member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], Lipinski was one of the most socially conservative Democrats in Congress.<ref name=":5" />

A conservative, he did not endorse President [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2012 United States presidential election]]. Lipinski opposed legalized [[abortion]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]] and was one of 39 House Democrats to vote against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].<ref>https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll887.xml</ref> He served a district that became increasingly liberal during his time in Congress,<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" /> leading to his defeat in the Democratic primary for the 2020 election by [[Marie Newman]].<ref name="NewmanWins" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Pearson|first=Bill Ruthhart, Rick|title=End of the Lipinski era: A 45-year political reign on Chicago's Southwest Side comes to a close|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-dan-lipinski-william-chicago-southwest-side-20210102-vfetdanqx5foza5gvsa4nrszpa-story.html|access-date=2021-02-25|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

In the summer of 1992, Lipinski interned at the [[United States Department of Labor]]. He interned for U.S. Congressman [[George E. Sangmeister]] from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996 Lipinski was a legislative staff member for U.S. Congressman [[Jerry Costello]]. He then served on Cook County State's Attorney [[Richard A. Devine]]'s campaign during the 1996 election season, and later on Devine's transition staff. After a short stint on then-U.S. Congressman [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s staff, Lipinski served as a communications staff aide to then-House Minority Leader [[Dick Gephardt]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

From 2000 to 2001, Lipinski taught at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. In 2001, he joined the faculty of the [[University of Tennessee]], where he remained until his election to Congress in 2004.<ref name=":4" />

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2004 Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward—which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd district—he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; since the younger Lipinski had not lived regularly in Illinois since 1989 or run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/IL.phtml|title=The Green Papers: Illinois 2004 General Election|access-date=January 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217223855/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/IL.phtml|archive-date=February 17, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/580-accidental-congressman-lipinski-draws-another-primary-challenge|title='Accidental congressman' Lipinski draws another primary challenge|last=Blake|first=Aaron|date=June 14, 2007|work=TheHill|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110239/http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/580-accidental-congressman-lipinski-draws-another-primary-challenge|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> He then bought a home in [[Western Springs, Illinois|Western Springs]] as his residence in the district. As expected, Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the general election. He went on to win re-election seven times.

In the 2006 Democratic primary Lipinski won 55% of the vote against two opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski defeated Republican Michael Bendas with over 70% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/race_detail/district-2010-IL-03.html?cqp=1|title=Race Detail Display Page : Roll Call|work=rollcall.com|access-date=January 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122225619/http://www.rollcall.com/race_detail/district-2010-IL-03.html?cqp=1|archive-date=January 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
