==History==
===Foundation and early years===
[[File:Robert Maclay Widney ca1885.jpg|left|thumb|Robert M. Widney, founder of the university, photographed in 1885]]
[[File:Widney 1903.jpg|thumb|The Widney Alumni House, the campus's first building]]

The University of Southern California was founded following the efforts of Judge [[Robert M. Widney]], who helped secure donations from several key figures in early Los Angeles history - a Protestant nurseryman, [[Ozro Childs]], an [[Irish Catholic]] former governor, [[John Gately Downey]], and a German Jewish banker, [[Isaias W. Hellman]]. The three donated 308 lots of land to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings. Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that "no student would be denied admission because of race". The university is no longer affiliated with any church, having severed formal ties in 1952.
When USC opened in 1880, tuition was $15.00 per term, and students were not allowed to leave town without the knowledge and consent of the university president. The school had an enrollment of 53 students and a faculty of 10. The city lacked paved streets, electric lights, telephones, and a reliable fire-alarm system. Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of three—two males and female [[valedictorian]] Minnie C. Miltimore.

The colors of USC are cardinal and gold, which were approved by USC's third president, the Reverend [[George W. White (educator)|George W. White]], in 1896. In 1958, the shade of gold, which was originally more of an orange color, was changed to a more yellow shade. The letterman's awards were the first to make the change.{{Ref label|D|d|none}}
[[File:Tommy Trojan at sunset.jpg|left|thumb|"[[Tommy Trojan]]" is a major symbol of the university, though he is not the mascot.]]
USC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the [[Trojan Shrine]], nicknamed "Tommy Trojan", near the center of campus. Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university. During a fateful track and field meet with [[Stanford University]], the USC team was beaten early and seemingly conclusively. After only the first few events, it seemed implausible USC would ever win, but the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin. After this contest, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' sportswriter Owen Bird reported the USC athletes "fought on like the [[Trojan War|Trojans]] of antiquity", and the president of the university at the time, [[George F. Bovard]], approved the name officially.

During [[World War II]], USC was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="usc-v-12">{{cite web |url=http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-62/bio.pdf |title=Alfred S.

USC is responsible for $8 billion in economic output in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]; USC students spend $563 million yearly in the local economy, and visitors to the campus add another $37.9 million.<ref name="USC Has $8 Billion Economic Impact">{{cite web |title=USC Has $8 Billion Economic Impact |publisher=USC |url=http://news.usc.edu/117353/californias-8-billion-economic-engine/ |date=2017-03-09}}</ref>

Recognizing that [[China–United States relations]] would play a great role in shaping the 21st century, in 2006, USC established the USC U.S.-China Institute (USCI). Known for its conferences, speakers series, training programs, publications, and documentaries, USCI works to inform public discussion with policy-relevant research and timely programming. It publishes ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20190430215606/https://uschinatoday.org/ US-China Today]'' and is widely known for its twelve-part ''Assignment:China'' documentary series on how China has been covered by American journalists since the 1940s. In 2010, the U.S. government and the USA Pavilion organizers asked USCI to manage the recruitment, selection, training and supervision of the students selected to staff the pavilion at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo]].

===Concerns and controversies===
{{csection|date=October 2021}}
On May 1, 2014, USC was named as one of many higher-education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights for potential [[Title IX]] violations by [[Barack Obama]]'s [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i |title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|access-date=29 May 2015}}</ref> USC is also under a concurrent Title IX investigation for potential antimale bias in disciplinary proceedings, as well as denial of counseling resources to male students, {{as of|2016|March|8|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3116107-University-of-Southern-California-09-16-2128.html |title=U.S. Department of Education Opens Investigation Against the University of Southern California for Anti-Male Bias|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref> In 2018, USC was ordered to pay $111,965 in legal fees to a male student accused of rape after the Title IX investigation run by Gretchen Means Gaspari was deemed unfair.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sequiera |first1=Kate |title=USC ordered to pay attorney fees after Title IX investigation was deemed unfair |url=https://dailytrojan.com/2018/07/18/usc-ordered-to-pay-attorney-fees-after-title-ix-investigation-was-deemed-unfair/ |website=dailytrojan.com |date=18 July 2018 |publisher=Daily Trojan |access-date=4 July 2020}}</ref> In 2020, USC was penalized for its faulty Title IX processes by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Valbrun |first1=Marjorie |title=Education Dept.

In 2017, the university came into the national spotlight when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published information about [[Carmen A. Puliafito]], the dean of USC's medical school. After accusations of drug use, he resigned from his position as dean in 2016 and was fired from the school the following year after the news stories were published. His medical license was subsequently suspended pending a decision whether it should be terminated.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-usc-dean-suspended-20170925-story.html |title=State suspends medical license of Carmen Puliafito, former USC Keck dean tied to drug use |first1=Paul |last1=Pringle |first2=Adam |last2=Elmahrek |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 25, 2018 |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> On August 17, 2018, his license G 88200 in the State of California was revoked based on discipline orders.<ref>{{cite web |title=DCA - Search Details |url=https://search.dca.ca.gov/details/8002/G/88200/d8dd63f54e672c11946effa314ff086f |website=search.dca.ca.gov |access-date=28 May 2019}}</ref> In 2019, USC lost accreditation for their joint-run fellowship program in cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite web |title=USC medical program loses national accreditation |url=https://apnews.com/e34a286a05a14d2fa172fe43674ce3e5 |website=apnews.com |date=26 April 2019 |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=4 July 2020}}</ref>

To replace Puliafito, USC named [[Rohit Varma]] as dean of [[Keck School of Medicine of USC]], but in 2017, Varma resigned after it came to light that USC had disciplined him for inappropriate behavior 15 years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parvini |first1=Sarah |title=USC medical school dean out amid revelations of sexual harassment claim, $135,000 settlement with researcher |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-usc-dean-harassment-20171005-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=6 October 2017 |access-date=4 July 2020}}</ref>

The following year, the ''Los Angeles Times'' broke another story about USC focusing on [[George Tyndall]], a gynecologist accused of abusing 52 patients at USC. The reports span from 1990 to 2016, and include using racist and sexual language, conducting exams without gloves, and taking pictures of his patients' genitals. ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' noted that  "other incidents in which the university is perceived to have failed to act on misconduct by powerful officials" have occurred,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/05/26/usc-president-will-step-down |title=USC President Will Step Down |first=Scott |last=Jaschick |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 26, 2018 |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> when it reported that the university's president, C. L. Max Nikias, was resigning. Tyndall was fired in 2017 after reaching a settlement with the university. The school did not report him to state medical authorities or law enforcement at the time, though the LAPD is now investigating Tyndall. As of June 1, 2018, 401 people had contacted a special hotline to receive complaints about the doctor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/usc-george-tyndall-lapd-investigation-sexual-misconduct.html|title=LAPD Investigating USC Gynecologist Accused of Sexual Misconduct|last=Aggeler|first=Madeleine|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}</ref> On October 18,  nearly 100 women were reported to have filed new lawsuits against the university, bringing the number of accusations up to over 500 current and former students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/nearly-100-additional-women-sue-usc-over-gynecologists-alleged-sexual-misconduct|title=Nearly 100 additional women sue USC over gynecologist's alleged sexual misconduct|date=2018-10-19|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}</ref> USC agreed to pay $215 million as a settlement after hundreds of women claimed the school did not address their complaints.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/usc-sex-abuse-settlement-george-tyndall.html|title=University of Southern California to Pay $215 Million Over Sex Abuse Scandal|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}</ref> In 2020,  Nikias reportedly received $7.6 million as an exit package, including $194,000 for his wife, Niki Nikias, as "first lady".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamilton, Matt and |first1=Harriet Ryan |title=USC paid former President C.L.

==Campus==
[[File:Doheny.jpg|thumb|[[Doheny Library]]]]
[[File:Bovard Auditorium at dusk, University of Southern California.jpg|thumb|The Bovard Auditorium houses many of USC's administrative offices as well as the auditorium]]
The [[University Park, Los Angeles|University Park]] campus is in the University Park district of Los Angeles, {{convert|2|mi|km}} southwest of [[downtown Los Angeles]]. The campus's boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through-campus vehicle traffic has been either severely restricted or entirely prohibited on some thoroughfares. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the [[Shrine Auditorium]] and [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], which is operated and managed by the University. Most buildings are in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] styles (especially two large [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] dormitories at the campus's northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built-in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. In recent years the campus has been renovated to remove the vestiges of old roads and replace them with traditional university [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]]s and gardens. The historic portion of the main campus was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.

[[File:Zumberge Hall of Science.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zumberge Hall of Science|Zumberge Hall]], one of the original buildings on the University Park Campus]]

Besides its main campus at University Park, USC also operates the Health Sciences Campus about {{convert|2|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. In addition, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles is staffed by USC faculty from the [[Keck School of Medicine]], and is often referred to as USC's third campus. USC also operates an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] center in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] for business, pharmacy, social work, and education, and the [[Information Sciences Institute]], with centers in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], and [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]]. For its science students, USC operates the [[USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies|Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] just {{convert|20|mi|km}} off the coast of Los Angeles, and home to the [[Philip K. Wrigley]] Marine Science Center.

The Price School of Public Policy also runs a satellite campus in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. In 2005, USC established a federal relations office in Washington, DC. A Health Sciences [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] campus holds the Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program.

USC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some 40 years apart. The first was prepared by [[the Parkinsons]] in 1920, which guided much of the campus's early construction and established its Romanesque style and 45-degree building orientation.
[[File:USC VKC building.jpg|thumb|The Center for International and Public Affairs, topped by a {{convert|5500|lb|abbr=on}} globe, is the tallest structure on campus.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chantal |last=Garcia |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |title=VKC: A president's legacy |work=Daily Trojan |date=September 15, 2004 |access-date=May 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802034438/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |archive-date=August 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Built under the second master plan, it reflects a trend towards modernism during that period.]]
The second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President [[Norman Topping]], campus development director [[Anthony Lazzaro (university administrator)|Anthony Lazzaro]], and architect [[William Pereira]]. This plan annexed a great deal of the surrounding city, and many of the older nonuniversity structures within the new boundaries were leveled. Most of the Pereira buildings were constructed in the 1970s. Pereira maintained a predominantly red-brick architecture for the new buildings, but infused them with his trademark technomodernism stylings. More recently under President [[C. L. Max Nikias]], the architectural orientation of the campus has moved towards a Gothic Revival style, taking cues from the scholastic styles of [[Oxford University]] and [[Harvard University]], while underpinning USC's own historic identity that is present in the red-brick construction.

USC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the ''Time/Princeton Review College Guide''.

Roughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in [[South Los Angeles]] amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], are credited for the safety of the university during the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]]. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several [[strip mall]]s in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western security fence.)

===Health Sciences campus===
[[File:Uscmedcenter.jpg|left|thumb|The original Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center]]

Located {{convert|3|mi|km|0|spell=in}} from downtown Los Angeles and {{convert|7|mi|km|0|spell=in}} from the [[University Park, Los Angeles|University Park]] campus, USC's Health Sciences campus is a major center for basic and clinical biomedical research in the fields of [[cancer]], [[gene therapy]], the [[neuroscience]]s, and [[Organ transplant|transplantation biology]], among others. The {{convert|79|acre|ha|adj=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://keck.usc.edu/about-us/visiting-keck-school-of-medicine/|title=Visiting Keck School of Medicine}}</ref> campus is home to the region's first and oldest medical and pharmacy schools, as well as acclaimed programs in [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], and physician assistant (which are respectively ranked No. 1, No. 4, and No. 10 by ''U.S. News & World Report''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Best Graduate Schools|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools|website=U.S. News and World Report}}</ref>) and [[pharmacy]].

In addition to the [[Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center]], which is one of the nation's largest teaching hospitals, the campus includes three patient care facilities: [[USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center]], [[Keck Hospital of USC]], and the USC Eye Institute. USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the internationally acclaimed [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]]. The health sciences campus is also home to the [[USC School of Pharmacy]] and several research buildings such as USC/Norris Cancer Research Tower, Institute for Genetic Medicine, [[Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute]], Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower and Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.

The Keck Hospital of USC is ranked No. 5 out of 411 hospitals in the State of California<ref>{{cite web|url=https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ca |title=Best Hospitals in California}}</ref> and No. 16 in the nation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview |title=U.S. News 2019-20 Best Hospitals Honor Roll}}</ref> by ''U.S. News & World Report.''

In July 2013, the University expanded its medical services into the foothill communities of northern Los Angeles when it acquired the 185 bed Verdugo Hills Hospital in [[Glendale, California]]. USC planned on making at least $30 million in capital improvements to the facility, which was officially renamed USC Verdugo Hills Hospital. This 40-year-old hospital provides the community a 24-hour emergency department, primary stroke center, maternity/labor and delivery, cardiac rehabilitation, and imaging and diagnostic services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.usc.edu/53163/usc-closes-deal-to-purchase-verdugo-hills-hospital/ |title=USC closes deal to purchase Verdugo Hills Hospital|date=2013-07-16}}</ref>

USC physicians serve more than one million patients each year.

===Public transit===
USC is served by several rapid transit stations. The [[E Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro E Line]] [[light rail]] service between [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Monica]] wraps around the south and eastern edges of the University Park campus. The E Line has three stations in the vicinity of the USC main campus: [[Jefferson/USC (LACMTA station)|Jefferson/USC Station]], [[Expo Park/USC (LACMTA station)|Expo Park/USC Station]], and [[Vermont/Expo (LACMTA station)|Vermont/Expo Station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.metro.net/documents/ab0e991c-13e2-47ad-99ee-470f88e49255.pdf|title=Metro Expo Line timetable|date=June 24, 2018|publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=August 12, 2018}}</ref>

The [[J Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro J Line]] bus service serves both the University Park campus at [[37th Street/USC station]] and the Health Sciences campus at [[LA County+USC Medical Center station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.metro.net/documents/288b7a74-5e4d-4e50-a586-93332d91452f.pdf|title=Metro Silver Line timetable|date=June 24, 2018|publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=August 12, 2018}}</ref>

In addition, both campuses are served by several [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] and municipal bus routes.

===Former agricultural college campus===
[[Chaffey College]] was founded in 1883 in the city of [[Ontario, California]], as an agricultural college [[branch campus]] of USC under the name of Chaffey College of Agriculture of the University of Southern California. USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901. In 1906, the school was reopened by the municipal and regional government and thus officially separated from USC. Renamed as Chaffey College, it now exists as a [[community college]] as part of the [[California Community College System]].

==Organization and administration==
[[File:USC-Bovard-1921.jpg|thumb|Bovard Hall, shortly after completion in 1921; the streets later became pedestrian-only]]

USC is a private [[public-benefit nonprofit corporation]] controlled by a [[board of trustees]] composed of 50 voting members and several life trustees, honorary trustees, and trustees [[Emeritus|emeriti]] who do not vote. Voting members of the Board of Trustees are elected for five-year terms. One-fifth of the Trustees stand for re-election each year, and votes are cast only by the trustees not standing for election. Trustees tend to be high-ranking executives of large corporations (both domestic and international), successful alumni, members of the upper echelons of university administration, or some combination of the three.

The university administration consists of a president, a [[Provost (education)|provost]], several vice-presidents of various departments, a treasurer, a [[Chief Information Officer|chief information officer]], and an [[athletic director]].<ref name="Senior Administration of the University of Southern California">{{cite web |url=https://about.usc.edu/administration/ |title= Senior Administration | publisher=USC | access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref> The current president is [[Carol Folt]] who on July 1, 2019 succeeded Board of Trustee member [[Wanda Austin]] who had been appointed the interim president by the Board when the former president [[C.

===Student government===
[[File:Gwynn Wilson Student Union, University of Southern California.jpg|thumb|The Gwynn Wilson Student Union on the University Park campus]]
The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) is the official representative government of the undergraduate students at USC. It consists of a popularly elected president and vice president who lead an appointed executive cabinet, a popularly elected legislative branch, and judicial oversight. The executive cabinet oversees funding, communications, programming, and advocacy work. All USG activities are funded by the student activity fee. In addition to USG, residents within university housing are represented and governed by the Residential Housing Association (RHA), which is divided by residence hall. The Graduate Student Government (GSG) consists of senators elected by the students of each school proportional to its enrollment and its activities are funded by a graduate and professional student activity fee.

The [[USC School of Architecture]] was established in 1916, the first in [[Southern California]]. From at least 1972 to 1976, and likely for a number of years prior to 1972, it was called The School of Architecture and Fine Art. The School of Fine Art (known as SOFA for a number of years after Architecture and Fine Art separated) was eventually named the Roski School of Fine Arts in 2006 during a ceremony to open the then-new Masters of Fine Art building, which occupies the previous and completely refurbished Lucky Blue Jean factory. This small department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. The school has been home to teachers such as [[Richard Neutra]], Ralph Knowles, James Steele, [[A. Quincy Jones]], [[William Pereira]] and [[Pierre Koenig]]. The school of architecture also claims notable alumni [[Frank Gehry]], [[Jon Jerde]], [[Thom Mayne]], [[Raphael Soriano]], [[Gregory Ain]], and [[Pierre Koenig]]. Two of the alumni have become [[Pritzker Prize]] winners. In 2006, [[Qingyun Ma]], a distinguished Shanghai-based architect, was named dean of the school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=41 |title=US-China Institute :: news & features :: Qingyun Ma named dean of the USC School of Architecture |publisher=china.usc.edu |date=2007-01-01 |access-date=2010-05-23}}</ref>

The [[Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC|Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry]] at the University of Southern California was established in 1897 as The College of Dentistry, and today, awards undergraduate and graduate degrees. Headed by Dean Avishai Sadan, D.M.D., the school traditionally has maintained five Divisions: Academic Affairs & Student Life, Clinical Affairs, Continuing Education, Research, and Community Health Programs and Hospital Affairs. In 2006, the [[USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy|USC Department of Physical Therapy and Biokinesiology]], and the USC Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, which both had previously been organized as "Independent Health Professions" programs at the USC College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, were administratively aligned under the School of Dentistry and renamed "Divisions", bringing the total number of Divisions at the School of Dentistry to seven. In 2010, alumnus Herman Ostrow donated $35 million to name the school the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry. In 2013, the school introduced an eighth division, and in 2014, a $20 million gift endowed and named the USC Mrs. T.H. Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.

USC collaborated with [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] to offer the USC (Executive) EMBA program in [[Shanghai]]. USC Dornsife also operates two international study centers in Paris and Madrid.

[[File:Doheny Library interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Doheny Memorial Library]]
The USC Libraries are among the oldest private academic research libraries in [[California]]. For more than a century USC has been building collections in support of the university's teaching and research interests. Especially noteworthy collections include [[American literature]], Cinema-Television including the [[Warner Bros.]] studio archives, European [[philosophy]], [[gerontology]], German exile literature, [[international relations]], [[Korean studies]], studies of Latin America, [[natural history]], [[Southern California]] history, and the University Archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libguides.usc.edu/uscarchives|title=Research Guides: University Archives *: Home|first=Claude|last=Zachary|website=libguides.usc.edu}}</ref>

The USC Warner Bros. Archives is the largest single studio collection in the world. Donated in 1977 to the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts by Warner Communications, the WBA houses departmental records that detail Warner Bros. activities from the studio's first major feature, ''My Four Years in Germany'' (1918), to its sale to Seven Arts in 1968.

Announced in June 2006, the testimony of 52,000 survivors, rescuers and others involved in [[The Holocaust]] is housed in the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences as a part of the [[USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2005/10/21/News/Shoah.Hosts.Holocaust.History.At.Usc-1029410.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070802005739/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2005/10/21/News/Shoah.Hosts.Holocaust.History.At.Usc-1029410.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Shoah hosts Holocaust history at USC – News|date=2 August 2007|archive-date=2 August 2007}}</ref>

The USC Trojans participate in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) as a member of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and have won 123 total team national championships, 97 for men and 26 for women, including non-NCAA championships. Of this total, 80 and 14 are NCAA National Championships for men and women, respectively. The NCAA does not include [[college football]] championships in its calculation. Although there are multiple organizations that name national championships, USC claims 11 football championships. The men's 361 Individual Championships are the second-best in the nation and 53 ahead of third place, [[Texas Longhorns]]. USC's cross-town rival is the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. USC's rivalry with [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] predates the [[UCLA–USC rivalry|UCLA rivalry]] by three years. The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual [[American football|football]] game played between these two universities and is considered one of the greatest rivalries in college athletics.<ref>{{cite news|first=John |last=Walters |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/john_walters/10/12/inside.cfb/index.html |title=Does it get any better than this? |work=Sports Illustrated |date=October 13, 2005}}</ref>

USC has rivalries with multiple schools. Although generally limited to football, USC has a major rivalry with [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uhnd.com/football/usc-notre-dame-football-rivalry/|title=USC – Notre Dame Football Rivalry|website=UHND.com – Notre Dame Football, Basketball, & Recruiting|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref> The annual game is played for the [[Jeweled Shillelagh]]. The rivalry has featured more national championship teams, Heisman trophy winners, All-Americans, and future NFL hall-of-famers than any other collegiate match-up. The two schools have kept the annual game on their schedules since 1926 (except 1942–44 because of World War II travel restrictions) and the game is often referred to as the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football.<ref name=SI101305>John Walters, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/john_walters/10/12/inside.cfb/index.html Does it get any better than this?], SI.com, October 13, 2005, Accessed March 24, 2009.</ref><ref name=ESPN112406>Dave Revsine, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=revsine_dave&id=2674267 Michigan, Ohio State set bar high for other rivalries], ESPN.com, November 24, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2009.</ref><ref name=SI101205>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/2005/10/12/gallery.usc_notredame/content.1.html The Greatest Intersectional Rivalry: Top 10 Moments from Notre Dame-USC], SI.com, October 12, 2005, Accessed March 24, 2009.</ref><ref name=LAT102007>Adam Rose, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/allthingstrojan/2007/10/notre-done-for.html The Color of Misery], LATimes.com, October 20, 2007, Accessed March 24, 2009.</ref><ref name=PAC112006>[http://www.pac-10.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112006aag.html This Week in Pac-10 Football]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Pacific-10 Conference, November 20, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2009.</ref>

USC's most famous rival is UCLA, with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. Both universities are in Los Angeles and approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} apart. Until 1982 the two schools also shared the same football stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The victor of the annual football game takes home the [[Victory Bell (UCLA–USC)|Victory Bell]]. The Trojans and Bruins also compete in a year-long all-sports competition for the [[Lexus Gauntlet Trophy]]. Pranks between [[UCLA]] and USC were commonplace several decades ago. Both universities have cracked down on pranks since a 1989 incident when USC students released hundreds of [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] into the [[Powell Library|main UCLA library]] during finals week.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rajan |last=Menghani |url=http://dailybruin.com/news/articles.asp?ID=35205 |title=Pranks of the past, present |work=The Daily Bruin |date=December 1, 2005 |access-date=November 30, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805210803/http://www.dailybruin.com/news/articles.asp?ID=35205 |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Days before a clash between rivals [[UCLA]] and USC in 2009, the Bruins mascot was vandalized.

"The Ultimate Trojan Experience", Save Tommy Night, the CONQUEST! Bonfire, and all-night vigils by the [[USC Helenes]] and [[Trojan Knights]] to protect the campus from [[UCLA Bruins]].

In addition, USC has rivalries with other Pac-12 schools, particularly the [[Stanford Cardinal]] as they are the only two private universities in the Pac-12 Conference and are situated at opposing regions of California, as well as being the two oldest private research universities in California, 1880 and 1891 respectively. Recently, a rivalry has begun to exist between USC and the University of Oregon because of the two universities' dominant football programs, with each school often serving as the toughest match-up on the opponent's schedule.

===Mascots===
Traveler, a white [[Andalusian horse]], is the university's official mascot. It first appeared at a football game in 1961, was ridden by Richard Saukko, and was known as Traveler I. The current horse is known as Traveler IX.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://usctrojans.com/sports/2018/7/25/usc-history-traditions-traveler-mascot-horse.aspx |title=Traveler, USC's Mascot |website=USC Trojans |access-date=July 28, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Tommy Trojan]], officially known as the Trojan Shrine, is a bronze statue in the model of a Trojan warrior at the center of campus. It is commonly mistaken as the school's official mascot. The statue was modeled after Trojan football players, and the statue is engraved with the ideal characteristics of a Trojan. It is a popular meeting point for students and a landmark for visitors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://usctrojans.com/sports/2018/7/25/usc-history-traditions-tommy-trojan-statue.aspx |title=Tommy Trojan |website=USC Trojans |access-date=2020-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165148/https://usctrojans.com/sports/2018/7/25/usc-history-traditions-tommy-trojan-statue.aspx |archive-date=2019-12-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the 1940s, [[George Tirebiter]], a car-chasing dog, was the most popular unofficial mascot. It gained fame among students after it bit the mascot of the UCLA Bruins, and was kept by the Trojan Knights. The dog was known to chase down cars on Trousdale Parkway, which runs through campus. After the original dog died, three others succeeded it. A statue was built in 2006 to honor the unofficial mascot.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://usctrojans.com/sports/2018/7/25/usc-history-traditions-george-tirebiter.aspx |title=George Tirebiter |website=USC Trojans |access-date=2020-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165154/https://usctrojans.com/sports/2018/7/25/usc-history-traditions-george-tirebiter.aspx |archive-date=2019-12-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Student media===
The ''[[Daily Trojan]]'' has been the student newspaper of USC since 1912 and is a primary source of news and information for the campus. It secured the first interview of President [[Richard Nixon]] after his resignation. The publication does not receive financial aid from the university and instead runs entirely on advertisement revenue. Published from Monday to Friday during the fall and spring semesters, the newspaper turns into the Summer Trojan during the summer term and publishes once a week. It is the paper of record on campus.

KXSC, previously known as KSCR, is the university's student-run [[college radio]] station, which is managed entirely by an unpaid staff of nearly 200 undergraduate and graduate student volunteers. The station gives students hands-on experience in a variety of music industry and broadcast-related positions, including live event promotion, social media management, radio production and [[audio engineering]]. In addition to providing almost 24 hours of daily live programming, the station also hosts live events, bringing local and touring bands to campus. The station's annual KXSC Fest, which began in 2009, has played host to performers such as [[Nosaj Thing]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kxsc.org/blog/2012/2/24/kxsc-fest-2012-nosaj-thing.html|title=KXSC FEST 2012: NOSAJ THING|publisher=KXSC|access-date=2021-01-21|archive-date=2019-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405234326/https://kxsc.org/blog/2012/2/24/kxsc-fest-2012-nosaj-thing.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Muna (band)]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEebuVO2c2I| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/mEebuVO2c2I| archive-date=2021-10-28|title=MUNA - "Promise" - Live at KXSC Fest|publisher=KXSC|date=April 25, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Mika Miko]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.campuscircle.com/review.cfm?r=8363&h=KSCR-Fest-A-Grassroots-Gathering-March-Founder-s-Park-USC|title=KSCR Fest – A Grassroots Gathering: March 29 @ Founder's Park, USC |publisher=Campus Circle|date=April 9, 2009|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Dan Deacon]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dailytrojan.com/2013/03/31/kxsc-fest-encourages-student-interaction/|title=KXSC Fest encourages student interaction|publisher=The Daily Trojan|date=March 31, 2013|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Thee Oh Sees]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/free-music-show-the-entrance-band-three-oh-sees-princeton-at-kscr-fest-2407346|title=Free Music Show!: The Entrance Band, Three Oh Sees, Princeton at KSCR Fest|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=March 25, 2010|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> and [[Flying Lotus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kxsc.org/blog/2011/4/8/kxsc-fest-2011-flying-lotus.html|title=KXSC FEST 2011: FLYING LOTUS|publisher=KXSC|access-date=2021-01-21|archive-date=2019-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405234319/https://kxsc.org/blog/2011/4/8/kxsc-fest-2011-flying-lotus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> KXSC traces its roots to the original [[KUSC]], which was operated by students starting in 1946. When KUSC transitioned to classical programming and moved off-campus in the mid-1970s, a group of students reacted to renewed demand for student-run radio station and founded KSCR in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kxsc.org/about|title=KXSC - About |publisher=KXSC}}</ref> KSCR was broadcast at 1560AM out of a student in the Hancock Foundation Building. In 1984, the University authorized a grant to move KSCR to a new location in Marks Hall. In 2010, KSCR adopted the call letters KXSC in order to be eligible to obtain a new FM license from the FCC, as well as to mark the station's move to a brand-new facility in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

''[[Trojan Vision]]'' (often abbreviated as ''TV8'') is the [[Student television station]] at USC. TV8 was established in 1997 by the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication]], but is now a part of the School of Cinematic Arts. Trojan Vision broadcasts 24/7 from the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts to the University Park Campus on Channel 8.1 and online through their website. Programming is also made available to the greater Los Angeles community on local channel LA36. In addition to a selection of regularly airing shows of many genres, Trojan Vision also broadcasts the shows ''Platforum'', a round-table debate show; ''[[Annenberg TV News]]'', a [[news program]]; and ''CU@USC'', an interview program.<ref>[http://trojanvision.com/?page_id=2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729173535/http://trojanvision.com/?page_id=2|date=July 29, 2012}}</ref>

''El Rodeo'' is USC's student-run [[yearbook]]. One of the oldest student traditions at the university, the first edition was released in 1889 and was originally called ''The Sybil''. The name was changed to ''El Rodeo'' in 1899 to reflect the cowboy-themed events students threw to advertise the yearbook as a "roundup" of the year's events. It was long packaged with the Student Activity Card, which gave students access to all home sports games. Since the card was dissolved in 2007, the yearbook has been sold as a stand-alone item.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Hill |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/29/News/El.Rodeo.Yearbook.Fears.For.Its.Future.After.Cuts-2811940.shtml |title=El Rodeo yearbook fears for its future after cuts |work=Daily Trojan |date=March 29, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802043546/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/29/News/El.Rodeo.Yearbook.Fears.For.Its.Future.After.Cuts-2811940.shtml |archive-date=August 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Greek life===
The [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]] has had a long history on the campus. Centered on a portion of West 28th Street known as "The Row", between [[Figueroa Street]] and Hoover Street just north of campus, USC's Greek system began soon after the school's founding when [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] founded a chapter in 1887.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Today the university sponsors 16 fraternities and 11 sororities in the [[Interfraternity Conference]] (IFC) and [[National Panhellenic Conference|Panhellenic Conference]] (PHC), respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greeklife.usc.edu/chapterrecognition/#greekThree|title=Chapter Recognition {{!}} Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Development {{!}} USC|website=greeklife.usc.edu|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>

Outside the Panhellenic and Interfraternity conferences, the Greek community at USC is very diverse, boasting the Multicultural, Asian, Inter-Fraternity (composed of professional fraternities), and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic]] (historically Black) Councils. Organizations governed by these councils include chapters of some of the oldest Latino and Black Greek organizations in the country and the oldest Asian fraternity in Southern California; while also including established professional business, engineering, and pre-law fraternities and other multiculturally based groups.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|colwidth=80em}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} The alternative name "Southern Cal" frequently appears in sports-related news articles. USC discourages use of "Southern Cal" out of concern the name might suggest a foundational association to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (commonly known as "Cal" in the athletics context), even though the two institutions have no affiliation other than their mutual Pac-12 membership. For several years, USC's [[media guide]]s contained the following request: "Note to the media: In editorial references to athletic teams of the University of Southern California, the following are preferred: USC, Southern California, So. California, Troy and Trojans for men's or women's teams, and Women of Troy for women's teams. PLEASE do not use Southern Cal (it's like calling San Francisco 'Frisco' or North Carolina 'North Car.'). The use of 'Southern Cal' on licensed apparel and merchandise is limited in scope and necessary to protect federal [[trademark]] rights."<ref name=notsoutherncal>[http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/05-mg-sec1.pdf It's Not 'Southern Cal'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624190448/http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/05-mg-sec1.pdf |date=2006-06-24 }}, ''2005 USC Football Media Guide'', USC Athletic Department, p. 3.; For registered trademarks, see [http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&state=vchbsb.1.1 USPTO serial numbers]: 74094678, 73770650, and 73755082.</ref>
