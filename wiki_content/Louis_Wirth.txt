'''Louis Wirth''' (August 28, 1897 – May 3, 1952) was an [[United States|American]] sociologist and member of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] of sociology. His interests included city life, minority group behavior, and mass media, and he is recognised as one of the leading urban sociologists.

He was the first president of the [[International Sociological Association]] (1949–1952)<ref name="presidents">{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/about/presidents/ |title=ISA Presidents |publisher=International Sociological Association|access-date=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org//en/about-isa/history-of-isa/isa-past-presidents/list-of-presidents/louis-wirth|title=Louis Wirth|website=www.isa-sociology.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> and the 37th president of the [[American Sociological Association]] (1947).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asanet.org/about-asa/asa-story/asa-history/past-asa-officers/presidents|title=Presidents|date=2009-05-28|website=American Sociological Association|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>

==Life==
Louis Wirth was born in the small village of [[Gemünden, Rhein-Hunsrück|Gemünden]] in the [[Hunsrück]], [[German Empire|Germany]]. He was one of seven children born to Rosalie Lorig (1868–1948, from Butzweiler/[[Eifel]]) and Joseph Wirth. Gemünden was a pastoral community, and Joseph Wirth earned a living as a cattle dealer. The family was Jewish and both of his parents were religiously active. Louis left Gemünden to live with his older sister at his uncle's home in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1911.  Soon after arriving in the United States, Louis met and married Mary Bolton.<ref>[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.WIRTHMB Biographical note in the Guide to the Mary Bolton Wirth Papers, University of Chicago]</ref> The couple had two daughters, Elizabeth (Marvick) and Alice (Gray).

==Research==
Wirth studied in the United States and became a leading figure in [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School Sociology]]. His interests included [[urban culture|city life]], [no minotary group]] behaviour and [[mass media]] and he is recognised as one of the leading [[urban sociology|urban sociologists]]. Wirth's major contribution to social theory of urban space was a classic essay ''Urbanism as a Way of Life'', published in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' in 1938. In this essay Wirth used Weber’s notion of the ideal type, seeing the urban and the rural as constituting two distinct types of community at opposite ends of a continuum.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|pages=771}}</ref>

His research was mostly concerned with how [[American Jews|Jewish immigrants]] adjusted to life in urban America, as well as the distinct social processes of city life. Wirth was a supporter of [[applied sociology]], and believed in taking the knowledge offered by his discipline and using it to solve real social problems.

Wirth writes that [[urbanism]] is a form of social organisation that is harmful to [[culture]], and describes the city as a ''“Substitution of secondary for primary contacts, the weakening of bonds of kinship, the declining social significance of the family, the disappearance of neighbourhood and the undermining of traditional basis of social solidarity”''.<ref>Wirth, Louis (1938) ''Urbanism as a way of life''</ref> Wirth was concerned with the effects of the city upon family unity, and he believed [[urbanization]] leads to a ‘low and declining urban [[Total fertility rate|reproduction rates]] … families are smaller and more frequently without children than in the country’. According to Wirth, marriage tends to be postponed, and the proportion of single people is growing, leading to isolation and less interaction.

But Wirth also stressed the positive effects of city life: "the beginning of what is distinctively modern in our [[civilization]] is best signalized by the growth of great cities“;<ref>Wirth, Louis (1938) ''Urbanism as a way of life''</ref> "[[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] civilization is without question the best civilization that human beings have ever devised“;<ref>The City. (The City as a Symbol of Civilization.); The Papers of Louis Wirth, The Joseph Regenstein Library, Special Collections/University of Chicago,  Box: 39, Folder: 6</ref> "the city everywhere has been the center of [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] and [[toleration]], the home of [[progress (history)|progress]], of invention, of science, of rationality“<ref>Life in the City. In: Wirth 1956: p. 206–217</ref> or: "the history of civilization can be written in terms of the history of cities“.<ref>Wirth, Louis (1940): The Urban Society and Civilization. In: Wirth, Louis (ed.), Eleven Twenty Six</ref>

The profound social understanding of minority groups that Wirth obtained first-hand as a Jewish immigrant in America, can equally be applied to understanding the problems of other minority groups in society, such as [[ethnic minorities]], the [[disabled]], [[homosexuals]], [[women]] and the [[elderly]], all of whom have also suffered, and/or continue to suffer [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]] and [[disenfranchisement]] from the more numerically dominant members of a host society. It is in this respect that Wirth's path-breaking and insightful work still amply rewards detailed study even today, some seventy years after his original investigations.<ref>Wirth, L: "The Problem of Minority Groups.", page 347 in Ralph Linton (ed.), ''The Science of Man in the World Crisis,'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1945.</ref>

A good example of Wirth's work, which includes a comprehensive bibliography, is ''On Cities and Social Life'', published in 1964.
