Two decades after the College of New Jersey (now known as [[Princeton University]]) was established in 1746 by the New Light Presbyterians, [[minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], seeking autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs in the American colonies, sought to establish a college to train those who wanted to become [[Clergy|ministers]] within the church.<ref name="andthen">[http://www.dailytargum.com/2.8607/and-then-there-was-rutgers-1.1519756 And then there was Rutgers...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807071332/http://www.dailytargum.com/2.8607/and-then-there-was-rutgers-1.1519756 |date=August 7, 2011 }} in ''The Daily Targum'' November 8, 2002.

Like many colleges founded in the U.S. during this time, Rutgers benefited from slave labor and funds derived from purchasing and selling slaves. Research undertaken at the university in the 2010s began to prominently uncover and document these connections, including the university's foundation on land taken from the indigenous [[Lenape]] people.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://scarletandblack.rutgers.edu/ |title=Rutgers Scarlet and Black Project |publisher=Rutgers University |date=2021 |access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref>

===Financial troubles and a benefactor===

In its early years, due to a lack of funds, Queen's College was closed for two extended periods. Early trustees considered merging the college with the College of New Jersey, in Princeton (the measure failed by one vote) and later considered relocating to New York City.<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" /> In 1808, after raising $12,000, the college was temporarily reopened and broke ground on a building of its own, called "[[Old Queens]]," designed by architect [[John McComb, Jr.]]<ref name="paths">[http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/libs/scua/university_archives/historic_ru_paths.shtml Paths to Historic Rutgers: A Self-Guided Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903014416/http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/libs/scua/university_archives/historic_ru_paths.shtml |date=September 3, 2006 }}, at Rutgers University. Retrieved August 9, 2006.</ref> The college's third president, the Rev. [[Ira Condict]], laid the cornerstone on April 27, 1809. Shortly after, the [[New Brunswick Theological Seminary]], founded in 1784, relocated from [[Brooklyn, New York]], to New Brunswick, and shared facilities with Queen's College (and the [[Rutgers Preparatory School|Queen's College Grammar School]], as all three institutions were then overseen by the [[Reformed Church in America]]).<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" /> During those formative years, all three institutions fit into Old Queens. In 1830, the Queen's College Grammar School moved across the street, and in 1856, the seminary relocated to a seven-acre (28,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) tract less than one-half mile (800&nbsp;m) away.<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years"/>

After several years of closure resulting from an economic depression after the [[War of 1812]], Queen's College reopened in 1825 and was renamed "Rutgers College" in honor of [[American Revolutionary War]] hero Colonel [[Henry Rutgers]] (1745–1830). According to the board of trustees, Colonel Rutgers was honored because he epitomized [[Christian values]]. A year after the school was renamed, it received two donations from its namesake: a $200 bell still hanging from the cupola of Old Queen's and a $5,000 bond ({{Inflation|USD|5000|1825|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) which placed the college on sound financial footing.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

===Land-grant college===

Rutgers College became the [[land-grant college]] of New Jersey in 1864 under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act of 1862]], resulting in the establishment of the Rutgers Scientific School, featuring departments of [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], and [[chemistry]].<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" /> The Rutgers Scientific School would expand over the years to grow into the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station (1880) and divide into the [[School of Engineering (Rutgers University)|College of Engineering]] (1914) and the [[School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (Rutgers University)|College of Agriculture]] (1921).<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" /> Rutgers created the [[Douglass College (Rutgers University)|New Jersey College for Women]] in 1918, and the School of Education in 1924.<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" /> With the development of graduate education, and the continued expansion of the institution, the collection of schools became Rutgers University in 1924.<ref name="years" /> Rutgers College continued as a liberal arts college within the university. Later, [[School of Arts and Sciences (Rutgers University)|University College]] (1945) was founded to serve part-time, commuting students and [[Livingston College]] (1969) was created by the Rutgers Trustees, ensuring that the interests of ethnically diverse New Jersey students were met.<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" />

===State university===

Rutgers was designated the state university of New Jersey by acts of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] in 1945 and 1956.<ref name="1956law">[https://archive.today/20121224170401/http://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=16046531&depth=2&expandheadings=off&headingswithhits=on&infobase=statutes.nfo&softpage=TOC_Frame_Pg42 N.J.S.A.] 18A:65–1 et seq. (Public Law 1956, chapter 61) repealing and succeeding P.L. 1945, c.49, p.115. Retrieved August 8, 2006.</ref> Shortly after, the University of Newark (1935) was merged with Rutgers in 1946, as were the college of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School, in 1950. These two institutions became [[Rutgers University–Newark]] and [[Rutgers University–Camden]], respectively. On September 10, 1970, after much debate, the board of governors voted to admit women into Rutgers College.<ref name="sketch" /><ref name="years" />

There were setbacks in the growth of the university. In 1967, the Rutgers Physics Department had a Centers of Excellence Grant from the NSF which allowed the physics department to hire several faculty each year. These faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years, but after that time any faculty hired with the associate or full professor designation would become tenured. The governor and the chancellor forced Rutgers to lose this grant by rejecting the condition that tenure be granted.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

In 1970, the newly formed Rutgers Medical School hired major faculty members from other institutions. In 1971, the governor's office separated Rutgers Medical School from Rutgers University and made it part of [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey|New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry]], and many faculty left the medical school, including the dean of the medical school, Dr. Dewitt Stetten, who later became the director of the National Institutes of Health. As a result of the separation of the medical school from Rutgers University, graduate PhD programs that had been started in the medical center were lost, and students had to seek other institutions to finish their degrees. After the dissolution of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in 2013, the medical school [[#Today|again became]] part of the university.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Although Rutgers is a public university, it retains—as the successor to the private college founded and chartered in 1766—some important private rights and protections from unilateral state efforts to change its fundamental character and mission.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dane|first1=Perry|last2=Stein|first2=Allan|last3=Williams|first3=Robert|year=2014|title=Saving Rutgers-Camden|journal=Rutgers Law Journal 337 (2014)|volume=44|pages=337–412|ssrn=2302826}}</ref>

Prior to 1982, separate liberal arts faculties existed in the several separate "[[residential college]]s" (Rutgers, Douglass, Livingston, University, and Cook colleges) at Rutgers–New Brunswick.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/education/rutgers-chief-said-to-plan-end-to-separate-womens-college.html|title=Rutgers Chief Said to Plan End to Separate Women's College|last1=Jones|first1=Richard Lezin|date=March 7, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 22, 2020|last2=Koblin|first2=John|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 1982, under president [[Edward J. Bloustein]], the liberal arts faculties of these five institutions were centralized into one college, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which itself had no students. The separate residential colleges persisted for students, and while instructors for classes were now drawn from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, separate standards for admission, good standing, and graduation still continued for students, depending on which residential college they were enrolled in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rutgers.edu/about/history/past-presidents/edward-j-bloustein|website=www.rutgers.edu|access-date=January 22, 2020|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426153536/https://www.rutgers.edu/about/history/past-presidents/edward-j-bloustein|archive-date=April 26, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2007, Rutgers, Douglass, Livingston, and University Colleges, along with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were merged into the new "[[School of Arts and Sciences (Rutgers University)|School of Arts and Sciences]]" with one set of admissions criteria, curriculum, and graduation requirements. At this time, the liberal arts components of Cook College were absorbed into the School of Arts and Sciences as well, while the other aspects of that college remained, but as the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences.

===Rutgers–New Brunswick===
{{Main|Rutgers University–New Brunswick}}

The New Brunswick Campus (or Rutgers–New Brunswick) is the largest campus and the site of the original Rutgers College. Spread across six municipalities in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], it lies chiefly in the City of New Brunswick and adjacent Piscataway, and is composed of five smaller campuses and a few buildings in downtown New Brunswick. The historic College Avenue Campus is close to downtown New Brunswick and includes the seat of the university, [[Old Queens]] and other nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century buildings that constitute the [[Queens Campus]] and [[Voorhees Mall]]. Its proximity to New Brunswick's train station and numerous food vendors located downtown, in addition to a large amount of off-campus housing and fraternity and sorority houses make this a popular weekend destination. Across the city, Douglass Campus and Cook Campus are intertwined with each other and are often referred to collectively as the Cook/Douglass Campus. Cook Campus has extensive farms and woods that reach into North Brunswick and East Brunswick. Separated by the Raritan River are [[Busch Campus]], in Piscataway, and Livingston Campus, also mainly in Piscataway but including remote sections of land extending into Edison and the Borough of Highland Park. The Busch Campus is noted as the home of Rutgers' highly ranked Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, as well as the golf course and football stadium. The Livingston campus is home to the RAC, a trapezoidal building which currently acts as home for many sports teams, notably the Men's Basketball Team. Additionally, this campus has undergone many renovations and is regarded as the most "modern" campus. The campus entrance is delineated by the all-glass [[Rutgers Business School – Newark and New Brunswick|Rutgers Business School]] building known as "100 Rock." From this building's fifth floor lounge, one can see the distant skyline of New York City on many clear days. Featuring (arguably) the best dining hall and top notch housing, Livingston attracts many students who may want a quieter city-life experience than the one on College Avenue. [[Rutgers Campus Buses]] transport students between the various campuses.<ref>"Department of Transportation"</ref>

As of 2010, the New Brunswick-Piscataway campuses include 19 undergraduate, graduate and professional schools, including the [[School of Arts and Sciences (Rutgers University)|School of Arts and Sciences]], the [[School of Communication and Information (Rutgers University)|School of Communication and Information]], the [[Edward J.

===Profile===

Established in 1766, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is one of the nine [[Colonial colleges|colonial chartered colleges]] established before the [[American Revolution]]. In 1864, the [[New Jersey Legislature]] selected Rutgers as New Jersey's sole [[Land-grant university|land-grant college]] which expanded the school's offerings in the fields of practical agriculture, science, military science and engineering. The state legislature designated Rutgers to be New Jersey's [[state university]] by acts passed in 1945 and 1956. It is the only university in the United States able to boast all three designations.<ref>Note: Rutgers is the only one of the original nine [[colonial colleges]] to satisfy all three categories. Seven of the colonial colleges remained private institutions (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, Brown, and Dartmouth). Of the two that became state institutions, Rutgers and College of William and Mary, only Rutgers was named a land-grant college.</ref> The university offers more than 100 distinct bachelor, 100 master, and 80 doctoral and professional degree programs across 175 academic departments, 29 degree-granting schools and colleges, 16 of which offer graduate programs of study.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Rutgers University offers a variety of housing options. On the [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]-Piscataway campus, students are given the option of on-campus housing in both traditional [[dorm]]s or apartments. Freshman students, however, are allowed only a dorm, while upperclassmen have a wider array of on-campus housing choices, like apartments, but must apply for on-campus housing through the Rutgers online lottery process. Most students seeking on-campus housing will be accommodated with a space and sophomores are guaranteed housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ruoncampus.rutgers.edu/selection/rising-sophomore-preference/|title=Rising Sophomore Preference for Housing (3-Year Phase)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629155241/http://ruoncampus.rutgers.edu/selection/rising-sophomore-preference/|archive-date=June 29, 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> Many Rutgers students opt to rent apartments or houses off-campus within the city of New Brunswick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/about/facts-figures|title=Facts & Figures|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629155433/https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/about/facts-figures|archive-date=June 29, 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> Similar setups are to be found in Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden, however a substantial portion of the students on those campuses commute and/or are enrolled on a part-time basis.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

===Student organizations and activities===

[[File:Rutgers spelled out in hedge on College Ave campus New Brunswick NJ.JPG|thumb|left|Shrubbery at the College Avenue campus]]

Rutgers University has a student government which controls funding to student groups. The student government is made up of campus councils and professional school councils. Those councils then send representatives to the student assembly as well as the university senate. An example of these campus councils is the University College Council, which represents adult, part-time, and military veteran students.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Rutgers hosts over 700 [[student organization]]s; among the first student groups was the first [[college newspaper]] in the [[United States]]. ''The Political Intelligencer and New Jersey Adviser'' began publication at Queen's College in 1783, and ceased operation in 1785.<ref name="years" /> Continuing this tradition is the university's current college newspaper, ''[[The Daily Targum]]'', established in 1869, which is the second-oldest college newspaper published in the United States, after ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' (1843). Both poet [[Joyce Kilmer]] and economist [[Milton Friedman]] served as editors. Also included are ''[[The Medium (Rutgers)|The Medium]]'', a weekly satirical newspaper billed as Rutgers Entertainment Weekly, ''[[Rutgers Centurion]]'', a conservative newspaper, the ''[[Rutgers University Glee Club]]'', a male [[choral]] singing group established in 1872 (among the oldest in the country).

Rutgers University is home to chapters of [[List of Rutgers University Greek organizations|many Greek organizations]], and a significant percentage of the undergraduate student body is active in Greek life. Several [[fraternities and sororities]] maintain houses for their chapters in the area of Union Street (known familiarly as "Frat Row") in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], within blocks of Rutgers' College Avenue Campus. Chapters of [[Zeta Psi]] and [[Delta Phi]] organized at Rutgers as early as 1845. The Alpha Rho chapter of [[Chi Psi]] fraternity, founded at Rutgers College in 1879, was the first fraternity at Rutgers to own a fraternity house, or "Lodge," purchased in 1887. The fraternity today still owns and occupies the same property at 114 College Avenue. Today, there are over 50 fraternities and sororities on the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, ranging from traditional to historically [[African-American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Multiculturalism|Multicultural]], and [[Asian people|Asian]] interest organizations.<ref>[http://ofsa.rutgers.edu/ Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908070120/http://www.ofsa.rutgers.edu/ |date=September 8, 2006 }} at Rutgers University.

In the late 19th century, the university banned fraternities because of their unusual hazing practices. This caused them to go underground as secret societies. It also sparked the interest of some students to create their own societies. [[Cap and Skull]] was founded at Rutgers before the turn of the 20th century.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Rutgers has four vocal ensembles: Voorhees Choir (the university's women's ensemble), Kirkpatrick Choir (the university's most selective coed ensemble), Glee Club (the university's most esteemed male ensemble), and University Choir (a larger mixed choir).{{cn|date=November 2020}}

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rutgersgreasetrucks.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Students waiting in line at the [[Grease Trucks]]]] -->
The [[Grease Trucks]] are a group of truck-based food vendors located at various locations on the New Brunswick campus. They serve traditional grill fare, Middle-Eastern specialties, and are especially well known for serving "Fat Sandwiches," a sub roll containing various ingredients such as cheesesteak, burgers, pork roll, chicken fingers, French fries, mozzarella sticks, eggs, bacon, gyro meat, and marinara sauce. The Rutgers Grease Trucks were located in a designated lot for nearly two decades until August 2013. Truck owners were forced to relocate due to the construction of an $84-million student apartment complex. Three trucks remain on the College Avenue Campus, while the remaining two were moved to the Cook/Douglass Campus.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The [[Dance Marathon]] is a student-run organization that consists of a year-long series of fundraisers and culminates with the annual Marathon on April 5–6 in the College Avenue Gym. At the Marathon over 400 dancers pledge to raise funds and remain standing for 32 hours without sleeping. The 'Dancers', along with over 500 volunteers and countless visitors, are entertained by live bands, comedians, prize giveaways, games, sports, a mechanical bull, computer and internet access, various theme hours and much more. Rutgers has held this tradition since 1999 and to date has raised in excess of $1.3 million for the Embrace Kids Foundation. In the seventies the Dance Marathon raised funds for the American Cancer Society. In the Eighties it was the Rutger Cancer Research Association.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

'RutgersFest was a day-long cultural event staged variously on either Livingston Campus or Busch Campus. It was designed to promote college spirit through student organization participation with activities and entertainment throughout the day, culminating with a free concert and fireworks at night. The event was free to all students and guests and was funded as part of an elected programming fee paid by all students as part of tuition. Past musical guests have included: [[Kanye West]], [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], [[Sugar Ray]], [[Guster]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Ludacris]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Method Man]] and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Nas|NAS]], [[SR-71 (band)|SR-71]], [[Ok Go]], [[N.E.R.D]] and [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. The event would feature carnival attractions such as bungee bull, bouncy boxing, moon walk, electronic basketball, a recording studio and more. Attendance for the annual event was about 40,000–50,000, topping out at an estimated 65,000 in 2004 at the event which featured [[Kanye West]] and [[Sugar Ray]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rutgers to permanently cancel annual Rutgersfest concert|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_to_cancel_annual_rutge.html|date=April 19, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904051303/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_to_cancel_annual_rutge.html|archive-date=September 4, 2011}}</ref> The event was staged by the Rutgers University Programming Association (RUPA), which used to be known as the Rutgers College Programming Committee (RCPC), as a year-end celebration before the start of the final examination period.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

===Colors, mottos and mascots===

Rutgers University's only school color is [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]]. Students had sought to make [[orange (colour)|orange]] the school color, citing Rutgers' [[Netherlands|Dutch]] heritage and in reference to the [[Prince of Orange]]. The Rutgers student publication ''Targum'' (which would become the ''Daily Targum'') proposed that scarlet be adopted in May 1869, claiming that it was a striking color and because scarlet ribbon was easily obtained. During the [[1869 college football season|first intercollegiate football game]] with [[Princeton University|Princeton]] on November 6, 1869, the players from Rutgers wore scarlet-colored [[turban]]s and [[handkerchief]]s to distinguish them as a team from the Princeton players.<ref name="tradition" /> The board of trustees officially made scarlet the [[school color]] in 1900.<ref name="tradition" />

In its early days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as "The Scarlet" in reference to the school color, or as "Queensmen" in reference to the institution's first name, Queen's College.<ref name="tradition" /> In 1925, the [[mascot]] was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[fable]] ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'' (''Le Roman de Renart'') which was used by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref name="tradition" /> At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called ''Chanticleer'', and one of its early arts editors, [[Ozzie Nelson]] (later of ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926.<ref name="ReferenceA">Scarlet Letter 1924 (Rutgers University yearbook), Special Collections and University Archives, Rutgers University Libraries.</ref> The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against [[Lafayette College]], in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a [[leopard]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with "being [[chicken]]."<ref>[http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~class51/november48.html November 1948] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205004936/http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~class51/november48.html |date=February 5, 2012 }} in ''Fifty Years Ago: Class of 1951'' at published by the Princeton Class of 1951, edited by J.

In 1864, rowing became the first organized sport at Rutgers. Six mile races were held on the Raritan River among six-oared boats. In 1870, Rutgers held its first intercollegiate competition, against the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard, the then top-ranked amateur crew of the time. Since the start in 1864, Rutgers has built a strong crew program consisting of heavyweight and lightweight men. Women's crew was added to the program in 1974. Financial support of the men's crew program was discontinued by the university in 2006, though the crew continues to compete (funded entirely by alumni and private support) at a high level in the prestigious [[Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges]] conference.{{cn|date=November 2020}}
