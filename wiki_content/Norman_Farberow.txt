'''Norman Louis Farberow''' (February 12, 1918 – September 10, 2015) was an American [[psychologist]], and one of the founding fathers of modern [[suicidology]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Suicide Prevention|first=Onja T.|last=Grad|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|pages=17–19|doi=10.1007/0-306-47150-7_5|chapter=2. Meet the Legend|isbn=978-0-306-45815-6}}</ref> He was among the three founders in 1958 of the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, which became a base of research into the causes and prevention of suicide.

==Early life and education==
He was born in 1918 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

After completing his tour of duty in World War II, Farberow enrolled in the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. UCLA’s doctoral program in psychology afforded Farberow an opportunity to study suicide against centuries of shifting attitudes. With few relevant references to draw upon for his 1949 [[dissertation]], Farberow saw the potential for reawakening “interest in a long-neglected, [[taboo]]-encrusted social and personal phenomenon.”<ref name="Faberow">Farberow, N. L. ''My Legacy in Suicide: Professional and Personal''. Unpublished manuscript.</ref> Farberow earned his doctoral degree from UCLA in 1950 while working with veterans in the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] Mental Hygiene Clinic. He helped found the suicide prevention center along with Robert E. Litman.

==World War II==
Farberow served as a World War II Air Force [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]].<ref>Kosky et al. (1998). ''[https://archive.today/20130202232455/http://www.springerlink.com/content/j86wu34r2103k141 Norman Farberow: A Legend in Suicide Prevention]'', ''Suicide Prevention: The Global Context'', SpringerLink.</ref> The war years were a time in the United States of relatively low suicide rates, a wartime phenomenon commonly observed when a nation’s armed forces and citizens unite under feelings of common purpose and mutual goals.<ref name="PHS852">[[Shneidman, E. S.]], Farberow, N. L., & Leonard, C. S. (1961) Some facts about suicide. ''Public Health Service Publication No. 852''. Washington, D. C.: Superintendent of Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office.</ref>

==Career==
In the decade after the war, suicide rates rose quickly as the sense of unity and shared purpose began to disappear.<ref name="PHS852"/> Wrenching social and personal readjustments were often needed, and these needs were further complicated by the emotional distress and mental health problems of returning [[veterans]]. Many expressed their deepening inner turmoil in unhealthy ways, through suicidal impulses and acts. Suicide’s continuing taboo,<ref>Farberow, N. L. (Ed.) (1963). ''Taboo Topics''. New York: Atherton Press.</ref> embedded in cultural and religious condemnations of [[shame]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and cowardice, magnified an underlying sense of worthlessness and hopelessness.

Farberow saw the effects of these dynamics and how they compounded the misery of those who were suffering. His vision for solutions grew to include fundamental and [[humanitarian]] changes to the way in which communities treated the suicidal. Soon his time as a [[psychotherapist]] became eclipsed by his continuing research on suicide with Dr. [[Edwin Shneidman]], a colleague equally passionate about changing the understanding and prevention of self-inflicted death.

During the 1950s, the men worked together at the Veterans Administration (VA) in Los Angeles and sought answers for another jump in suicide rates—the sudden doubling of suicides among the VA’s [[neuropsychiatric]] hospital patients.<ref>[[Shneidman, E. S.]] & Farberow, N. L. (1956). Clues to suicide. ''Public Health Reports'', 71, 109-111.</ref> At the same time, a survey they had conducted of L.A.-area hospitals, clinics, and emergency rooms revealed that no provisions existed for the follow-up care of suicide attempters. Farberow and Shneidman shared their findings with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the VA and proposed the creation of two agencies: a community-based Referral Center for treating the psychological problems of the suicidal, and a Central Research Unit for assessing and investigating suicide among veterans within the VA.

==The scientific investigation of suicide==

===A suicide prevention center===
In 1958, Farberow and Shneidman launched the nation’s first center of its kind, the Los Angeles [[Suicide Prevention]] Center (LASPC)<ref>Litman, R. E., [[Shneidman, E. S.]], & Farberow, N. L. (1961). A suicide prevention center. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', ''117'', 1084-1087.</ref> with the [[psychiatrist]] Robert E. Litman, M.D., as its director. Farberow described Litman as, “a free spirit cloaked in psychoanalytic trappings, always intellectually adventuresome and inquisitive.”<ref name="Faberow"/> Together, the three men developed a scientific, methodologically sound, and professionally conceived organization where a social and professional vacuum had once existed. Farberow described this as a time of “attraction and excitement in the feeling that we were into a relatively unexplored area of vital community concern.”<ref name="Faberow"/> The objective of the agency—to provide a center for the follow-up care of suicidal patients discharged after treatment in the Los Angeles County Hospital—changed in the first year as calls came in from people in crisis. Capitalizing on the opportunity to intervene and avert a suicide attempt broadened the Center’s objective to include crisis intervention<ref>Farberow, N. L., Heilig, S. M., and Litman, R. E. (1968). ''Techniques in Crisis Intervention: A Training Manual''. Los Angeles: Suicide Prevention Center, Inc.</ref> and 24-hour accessibility of professionals or rigorously trained non-professionals.<ref>Heilig, S. M., Farberow, N. L., and Litman, R. E. (1968). "The role of nonprofessional volunteers in a suicide prevention center", ''Community Mental Health Journal'', 414.</ref> These efforts led to the development of the L.A. Scale for Assessment of Suicidal Potential<ref>Litman, R. E., & Farberow, N. L. (1961). Emergency evaluation of self-destructive potentiality. In N. L. Farberow and E. S. Shneidman (Eds.), ''The Cry for Help''. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.</ref><ref>Litman, R. E., Farberow, N. L., Wold, C. I., & Brown, T. R. (1974). "Prediction models of suicidal behaviors", In Aaron Beck, H. L. P. Resnik and Dan J. Lettieri (Eds.), ''Prediction of Suicide''. Bowie, Md.: Charles Press Publishers, Inc., Ch. X, 141-159.</ref> and the [[crisis hotline]].<ref>Litman, R. E., Farberow, N. L., [[Shneidman, E. S.]], Heilig, S. M., and Kramer, J. (1965). "Suicide prevention telephone service", ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 192:1, 21-25.</ref>

As the LASPC’s reputation as an informed referral center grew,<ref>[[Shneidman, E. S.]] & Farberow, N. L.  (1965). "The Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center: A demonstration of feasibilities", ''American Public Health Journal'', January, 25:1, 21-26.</ref> collaboration with the [[coroner]]’s office, [[mental health professionals]], police, probation, schools, and other organizations created the awareness needed to demystify suicide’s taboo and give hope to those who were suffering. Through writing, teaching, training,<ref>Farberow, N. L.  (1969). "Training in suicide prevention for professionals and community agents", ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 125:12, 1702-1705.</ref> and publishing, LASPC directors disseminated their principles for the organization and functioning of a suicide prevention and crisis intervention community agency.  Their principles are still in use today and serve as models in community agencies around the world. The LASPC is now part of a comprehensive mental health facility based in [[Culver City, California]], known as [http://www.didihirsch.org/ Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services].

===CRU for SUD===
The name of the “Central Research Unit for the Study of Unpredicted Death” shows that Farberow and Shneidman at first had to hide the nature of their work.<ref>[[Shneidman, E. S.]] & Farberow, N. L. (Eds.) (1957). ''Clues to Suicide''. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company; (Japanese Translation) Tokyo: Seishin Shobo Company, 1968.</ref> During the 1950s and just after the introduction of [[psychotropic]] drugs, the Veterans Administration became concerned with a sudden doubling of the suicide rate of its neuropsychiatric hospital patients.<ref>[[Shneidman, E. S.]] & Farberow, N. L. (1956). "Clues to suicide", ''Public Health Reports'', 71, 109-111.</ref> The new psychotropics markedly improved symptoms, allowing patients to be released much sooner than usual. But more patients killed themselves either while on leave or shortly after they returned to the hospital. Farberow determined the new psychotropics were “too successful,” controlling disturbed behavior so well that other treatments, such as [[psychotherapy]], were disregarded.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1981). "Suicide prevention in the hospital", ''Hospital and Community Psychiatry'', 32(2):99-104.</ref> In Farberow’s words, “Our research led mental health professionals to accept the fact that the miracle drugs could only do a part of the job and that the psychotropics would have to be integrated into a more comprehensive approach.”

The Unit's analysis of hundreds of veterans’ suicide cases allowed Farberow and Shneidman to determine suicidal factors in specific psychiatric syndromes, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]] and [[dysthymia]],<ref>Farberow, N. L. & Heilig, S. M. (1990). "The suicide prevention center: concepts and clinical functions", in Howard J. Parad and Libby Parad, ''Crisis Intervention''. Baltimore: Charles Publishing Company.</ref> as well as suicidal factors in patients suffering from physical health problems, such as cancer,<ref name="VABulletin9">Farberow, N. L., [[Shneidman, E. S.]], & Leonard, C. S. (1963). "Suicide among general medical and surgical hospital patients with malignant neoplasms", Washington, D. C.: ''Veterans Administration Medical Bulletin'', 9.</ref> cardiorespiratory illnesses,<ref>Farberow, N. L., McKelligott, J. W., Cohen, S., & Darbonne, A. R. (1966). "Suicide among patients with cardiorespiratory illnesses", ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 195:422-428.</ref> and others.

==Other cultural influences==

===The psychological autopsy===
The L.A. County Coroner’s request for psychological information to help determine equivocal cases of suicide led Farberow and Shneidman to create the psychological autopsy<ref>Litman, R. E., Curphey, T. J., [[Shneidman, E. S.]], Farberow, N. L., & Tabachnick, N. D. (1963). Investigations of equivocal suicides. ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 184, 924, 929.</ref> as a procedure for evaluating the critical factor of intention.<ref>Cutter, F., Jorgensen, M., Farberow, N. L., Ganzler, S., & Sapin, D. P. (1968). Ratings of intention in suicidal behavior. ''Veterans Administration Newsletter for Research in Psychology'', May, 10:2, 36-37.</ref> With Farberow and his colleagues based in a city known for its Hollywood luminaries, the coroner often called on the men to use the psychological autopsy in determining whether suicide was the cause of death for such celebrities as [[Marilyn Monroe]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870056,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228075855/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870056,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 28, 2007|title=Medicine: Cries for Help|journal=Time|date=17 August 1962|via=www.time.com}}</ref> [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]], and Marie (The Body) McDonald. The procedure gained international application as Farberow enlisted other international researchers in the study of personality differences in modes of death in [[Finland]]<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1977). "Research in suicide 1971-1973: A review", In Kalle Achte and Jouko Jonnqvist (Eds.), ''Suicide research in Finland 1974-1977''. Psychiatria Fennica Supplementum 1976, 23-47. Helsinki: Psychiatria Fennica.</ref> with comparisons of suicides in Los Angeles, [[Vienna]],<ref>Farberow, N. L., & Simon, M. D. (1969). Suicides in Los Angeles and Vienna: An intercultural study of two cities. ''Public Health Reports'', 84:5, 389-403.</ref> and [[Stockholm]], among others.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (Ed.) (1975). ''Suicide in Different Cultures''. Baltimore, Md.: University Park Press, 286 p.</ref>

===Indirect self-destructive behavior===
As part of his activity in the Central Research Unit for the Study of Unpredicted Death (CRU for SUD) in the Veterans Administration, Farberow identified and characterized his observations of indirect self-destructive behavior,<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1980). Indirect self-destructive behavior: Classification and characteristics. In Norman L. Farberow (Ed.), ''The Many Faces of Suicide''. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.</ref><ref>Berman, A. L. & Farberow, N. L. (2000). Indirect self-destructive behavior. In R. W. Maris, A. L. Berman, & M. M. Silverman (Eds.), ''Comprehensive Textbook of Suicidology''. New York: Guilford Press.</ref> or ISDB, and described a broad range of behaviors ranging from “slight to extreme, from mild smoking to noncompliant [[medical neglect]], from risk-taking, excitement-seeking, depression-averting, denial-mediated aspects of substance abuse addiction to dare-devil flaunting of fate in chasm jumping on a motorcycle.”<ref name="Faberow"/> Farberow considered this body of work integral to understanding the continuum of self-destructive behavior, which he carefully researched and documented in what he called his labor of love, a book entitled ''The Many Faces of Suicide''.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (Ed.) (1980). ''The Many Faces of Suicide''. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.</ref>

===Suicide's depiction in the arts===
“The history of suicide, with its fascinating vagaries, to my view, is seen much more clearly and comprehensively when viewed through its reflection in the paintings of the master artists of their times,” wrote Farberow.<ref name="Faberow"/> While on [[sabbatical]] in Europe and on other trips, Farberow frequently visited museums to see paintings, [[illustrations]], and sculpture that depicted suicide; he became interested in studying the visual arts to chronicle history’s shifting attitudes. Combining slides and posters, he arranged a collection of works that spanned the millennia.  He found a neutral attitude in [[Biblical]] suicides, followed by later ambivalence, and then the cry for help indicative of modern times.<ref>Cutter, F., Farberow, N. L., & Cutter, D. (1968). "Suicide in art", in ''Proceedings: IVth International Conference for Suicide Prevention''. Los Angeles: Suicide Prevention Center, Inc., 345-355.</ref> Farberow’s poster collection is held by the American Association of Suicidology, a research-based organization established by Shneidman in 1968.

==Models for group therapy==

===For suicidal persons===
Of the many calls received by LASPC volunteers on the 24-hour [[crisis hotline]], Farberow noted that approximately one-third were acutely suicidal. In Farberow’s words, “The chronically suicidal people who made up the other two thirds needed more, mostly continuing evidence of caring, interest, and concern.” For Farberow, assisting this population was one of the more gratifying clinical activities to come out of his work at the Center. Several models of group therapy were developed in the effort to meet different needs.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1968). Group psychotherapy with suicidal persons. In H. L. P. Resnick (Ed.), ''Suicidal Behaviors''.  Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 328-340.</ref><ref>Frederick, C. J., & Farberow, N. L. (1970). Group psychotherapy with suicidal persons: A comparison with standard group methods. London: ''International Journal of Social Psychiatry'',  16, 103-111.</ref><ref>Farberow, N. L. (1976). Group psychotherapy for self-destructive persons. In Howard J. Parad, H. L. P. Resnik, & Libbie Parad (Eds.), ''Emergency Mental Health and Disaster Management: A mental health sourcebook''.  Bowie, Md.: Charles Press Publishers, Inc., 169-185.</ref><ref>Farberow, N. L., & Marmor, K. (1984). Short-term group psychotherapy with suicidal patients. In Robert Rosenbaum (Ed.), ''Varieties of Short-Term Therapy Groups''.  New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> At its height, the group therapy program at LASPC included two long-term insight-oriented groups, a post-crisis oriented time-limited group, a drop-in group, a creative expression group using nonverbal expressive procedures, a socialization group focusing on interaction and relationships, and four drug rehabilitation groups meeting once a week. Farberow wrote about the program, hoping to stimulate other centers, but it never achieved the widespread use as a clinical tool for treatment he had envisioned.

===For the bereaved===
Though survivors after a suicide experience the same feelings of loss and grief that are found after any death, they are subject to additional complications because of the taboo aspects of the death and the commonly experienced intense feelings of shame and guilt. As a result, they are often excluded from the comfort and support traditionally offered by family, friends and community at the time of a death.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1998). Shame and guilt in suicide survivors. In D. De Leo, A Schmidtke, & R. F. W. Diekstra, ''Suicide Prevention: A Holistic Approach''. Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers.</ref> This survivor population required a new approach to group therapy: these were not patients seeking to explore conflicts and problems with a therapist trained in traditional models.

These were people who needed a place to address the [[Social stigma|stigma]] of suicide and to talk without guilt or embarrassment. The LASPC introduced this new model in the 1980s<ref>Farberow, N. L., Gallagher, D. E., Gilewski, M. J., & Thompson, L. W. (1987). "An examination of the early impact of bereavement on psychological distress in survivors of suicide", ''The Gerontologist'', 27(5):592-598.</ref><ref>Farberow, N. L., Gallagher-Thompson, D. E., Gilewski, M., & Thompson, L. W. (1992). "Role of social supports in the bereavement process of surviving spouses of suicide and natural deaths", ''Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior'', 22(1), 107-124.</ref> and identified two major aspects: 
*Meetings would be led by a mental health professional and a survivor facilitator, and
*Meetings would be limited to eight weeks with monthly follow-ups for those that wish it.
They determined the meetings would focus on caring, sharing, support, and interactive discussion—not conflict identification and resolution, aspects typically addressed in traditional group therapy.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (2001). "Helping suicide survivors", In D. Lester (Ed.), ''Suicide: Resources for the Millennium''. New York, Taylor & Francis.</ref>

The model for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090408042426/http://www.didihirsch.org/services/emergency/spc/sas Survivors After Suicide] program quickly grew in the United States and Canada.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1992). "",The Los Angeles Survivors-After-Suicide Program: An evaluation", ''CRISIS, The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention'', 13(1), 23-34.</ref> Change came more slowly in Europe,<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1997). Suicide survivor programs in IASP member countries: A survey. In R. J. Kosky, H. S. Eshkevari, R. D. Goldney, & R. Hassan (Eds.), ''Suicide Prevention: The Global Context''. New York, Plenum Press.</ref> where the cultural and religious taboos around suicide were more deeply entrenched. The establishment of the international Farberow Award in the IASP (see below) has helped this therapeutic model gain universal acceptance.

==International collaboration==
Farberow distinguishes Vienna Psychiatrist [[Erwin Ringel]] as a crucial pioneer in the development of suicide prevention in the world. Ringel convened the first European meeting focused on suicide prevention in 1960 in Vienna. The following year, Ringel visited the LASPC and invited Farberow to share his vision. In its infancy, the concept of a new global organization underwent “a classic clash of American vs. European ideas of how an Association was structured.” Farberow wrote, “My approach reflected my experience in U.S. psychology governance while his approach reflected his experience in an autocratic university and European associations.”<ref name="Faberow"/> The commitment to argue through and resolve these issues resulted in a global organization that constitutes an important part of Farberow’s professional legacy, the [[International Association for Suicide Prevention]] (IASP).<ref>Goldney, R., Farberow, N. L., & Retterstol, N. (2001). The International Association for Suicide Prevention. In D. Lester (Ed.), ''Suicide: Resources for the Millennium''. New York, Taylor & Francis.</ref> Today, the IASP consists of a consortium of National Associations, mental health agencies, clinicians, researchers, and survivors of suicide from more than fifty countries.

==Overview==
Farberow rates as the most significant impacts work to be the lessening of the taboos related to suicide, so that the cry for help could be both more readily voiced and more easily heard. While preparing items for inclusion in the bibliography of his first book, ''The Cry for Help'',<ref>Farberow, N. L., & [[Shneidman, E. S.]] (Eds.) (1961). ''The Cry for Help''. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company; (Japanese Translation) Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1968; (Spanish Translation) Mexico City: La Presna Medica Mexicana, 1969.</ref> Farberow noted an average of thirty-five suicide-related journal items per year over a sixty-year period, from 1897 through 1957.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (Ed.) (1969). Bibliography on suicide and suicide prevention: 1897-1957. ''Public Health Service Publication No. 1970''. Washington, D. C.: Superintendent of Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office.</ref> With the opening of the LASPC and the continual documentation of its progress, the long-neglected status of suicide as a significant public, physical, and mental health problem began to change. When Farberow collected citations for a second bibliography nine years later, the number had surged to roughly one hundred per year.<ref>Farberow, N. L. (1970). Ten years of suicide prevention - past and future. ''Bulletin of Suicidology'', No. 6, pp. 6-11. Washington D. C.: Superintendent of Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office.</ref> The awareness created by Farberow, Shneidman, and Litman stimulated a growth in publications on all aspects of suicide.

The conundrum of suicide maintained its challenge. Farberow examined the shifting nature of risk within a variety of subgroups, including police officers,<ref>Farberow, N. L., & [[Shneidman, E. S.]] (1958). "Suicide and the police officer", ''Police'', 2, 51-55.</ref> gay men,<ref>Schneider, S. G., Farberow, N. L., & Kruks, G. N. (1989).

*Farberow’s ingenuity has been influential internationally: in the doctrines of mental health clinics and educational institutions, and in virtually any community that relies on established protocol to address the problem of suicide. Farberow’s penetrating insights, sincere vision, and lifelong perseverance helped turn this once heavily taboo-laden topic into a legitimate health concern, making resources available to people interested in suicide research, treatment, and prevention worldwide.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
