'''Harriet Martineau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|t|ən|ˌ|oʊ}}; 12 June 1802 – 27 June 1876) was an English [[social theorist]] often seen as the first female [[sociologist]].<ref name="autogenerated2002"> Michael R.

==Early life==
[[File:Harriet Martineau's autobiography (1879) (14595668018).jpg|left|thumb|255x255px|The house in which Harriet Martineau was born]]
The sixth of eight children, Harriet Martineau was born in [[Norwich]], England, where her father Thomas was a textile manufacturer. A highly respected [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], he was [[deacon]] of the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich]] from 1797.<ref name="spartacus-educational.com">{{Cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/Wmartineau.htm |title=Harriet Martineau |website=Spartacus Educational |access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Harriet's mother was the daughter of a sugar refiner and grocer.

The [[Martineau family]] was of French [[Huguenot]] ancestry and professed [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] views. Her uncles included the surgeon Philip Meadows Martineau (1752–1829), whom she had enjoyed visiting at his nearby estate, [[Carrow Abbey|Bracondale Lodge]],<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Martineau |first1=Harriet |title=Autobiography |url=https://archive.org/details/autobiography0000mart |url-access=registration |publisher=Broadview Press |date=2007 |page=[https://archive.org/details/autobiography0000mart/page/49 49]|isbn=9781551115559 |editor-first=Linda H. |editor-last=Peterson |access-date=29 September 2013}}</ref> and businessman and benefactor [[Peter Finch Martineau]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ronalds |first=B.F. |date=February 2018 |title=Peter Finch Martineau and his Son|journal=The Martineau Society Newsletter |volume=41 |pages=10–19}}</ref> Martineau was closest to her brother [[James Martineau|James]], who became a philosopher and clergyman in the tradition of the [[English Dissenters]]. According to the writer Diana Postlethwaite, Harriet's relationship with her mother was strained and lacking affection, which contributed to views expressed in her later writing.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> Martineau claimed her mother abandoned her to a [[wet nurse]].

Her ideas on domesticity and the "natural faculty for housewifery", as described in her book ''Household Education'' (1848),<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> stemmed from her lack of nurture growing up. Although their relationship was better in adulthood, Harriet saw her mother as the antithesis of the warm and nurturing qualities which she knew to be necessary for girls at an early age. Her mother urged all her children to be well read, but at the same time opposed female pedantics "with a sharp eye for feminine propriety and good manners. Her daughters could never be seen in public with a pen in their hand". Despite this conservative approach to raising girls, Martineau was not the only academically successful daughter in the family; her sister Rachel ran her own [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Academy with artist [[Bonham Carter family|Hilary Bonham Carter]] as one of her students.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=O'Malley |first1=I. |title=Florence Nightingale, 1820-1856 : a study of her life down to the end of the Crimean war |url=https://archive.org/stream/florencenighting00omal/florencenighting00omal_djvu.txt |access-date=10 September 2019 |quote=Hilary was at a school kept by Miss Rachael Martineau, sister of Harriet.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Cromwell |first1=J. |title=Florence Nightingale - Feminist |date=15 March 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SEiqxGoxmMC&q=hilary+bonham+carter++++academy&pg=PA37 |publisher=McFarland, 25 Feb 2013 |access-date=10 September 2019 |page=37 |isbn=9780786470921 |quote=....Unitarian Academy....}}</ref> Martineau's mother strictly enforced proper feminine behaviour, pushing her daughter to "hold a sewing needle" as well as the (hidden) pen.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/>

Martineau began losing her senses of taste and smell at a young age, becoming increasingly [[deaf]] and having to use an [[ear trumpet]]. It was the beginning of many health problems in her life. In 1821 she began to write anonymously for the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'', a Unitarian periodical, and in 1823 she published ''Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns''.

In 1829, the family's textile business failed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://armitt.com/armitt_website/harriet-martineau-armitt-museum-and-library-cumbri/ |title=Harriet Martineau at The Armitt Museum and Library Cumbria |website=ARMITT MUSEUM & LIBRARY |access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Martineau, then 27 years old, stepped out of the traditional roles of feminine propriety to earn a living for her family. Along with her needlework, she began selling her articles to the ''Monthly Repository'', earning accolades, including three essay prizes from the [[Unitarian Association]]. Her regular work with the ''Repository'' helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.

In Martineau's ''Autobiography'', she reflects on her success as a writer and her father's business failure, which she describes as "one of the best things that ever happened to us". She described how she could then "truly live instead of vegetate".<ref>Harriet Martineau from her "Autobiography", ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature Eighth Edition Volume E: The Victorian Age'', ed. Stephen Greenblatt. New York: Norton, 2006, pp. 1589–1592.</ref> Her reflection emphasizes her experience with financial responsibility in her life while she writes "[her] fusion of literary and economic narratives".<ref name=":0"/>

Her first commissioned book, ''[[Illustrations of Political Economy]]'',<ref>Full text at [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1873&Itemid=27 The Online Library of Liberty]</ref> was a fictional tutorial intended to help the general public understand the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. ''Illustrations'' was published in February 1832 in an edition of just 1500 copies, since the publisher assumed it would not sell well. Yet it very quickly became highly successful, and would steadily out-sell the work of [[Charles Dickens]]. ''Illustrations'' was her first work to receive widespread acclaim, and its success served to spread the free-market ideas of Adam Smith and others throughout the [[British Empire]]. Martineau then agreed to compose a series of similar monthly stories over a period of two years, the work being hastened by having her brother James also work on the series with her.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/>

The subsequent works offered fictional tutorials on a range of political economists such as [[James Mill]], [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], the latter especially forming her view of rent law. Martineau relied on [[Malthus]] to form her view of the tendency of human population to exceed its means of subsistence. However, in stories such as "Weal and Woe in Garvelock", she promoted the idea of [[population control]] through what Malthus referred to as "voluntary checks" such as [[Sexual abstinence#History|voluntary chastity]] and delayed marriages.

==London and the United States==
In the early 19th century, most social institutions and norms were strongly shaped by gender, or the perception of what was appropriate for men versus for women. Writing was no exception; non-fiction works about social, economic and political issues were dominated by men, while limited areas, such as romance fiction, and topics dealing with domesticity were considered to be appropriate for women authors.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Logan |first=Deborah Anne |title=The Hour and the Woman: Harriet Martineau's Somewhat Remarkable Life |year=2002 |publisher=Northern Illinois University Press |location=Dekalb, Illinois |isbn=0-87580-297-4}}</ref> Despite these gendered expectations in the literary world, Martineau strongly expressed her opinions on a variety of topics.

Martineau's frequent publication in the Repository acquainted her with editor Rev. [[William Johnson Fox]] (not William Darwin Fox, see disambiguation). First coming to London around 1830, she joined Fox's social circle of prominent thinkers which also introduced her to [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin]], older brother to Charles Darwin.

In November 1832 Martineau moved to London.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://martineausociety.co.uk/the-martineaus/harriet-martineau/|title=Harriet Martineau (1802-76) – Martineau Society|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Among her acquaintances were: [[Henry Hallam]], [[Harriet Taylor Mill|Harriet Taylor]], [[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], [[Henry Hart Milman]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Monckton Milnes]], [[Sydney Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Sarah Austin (translator)|Sarah Austin]], and [[Charles Lyell]], as well as [[Jane Welsh Carlyle]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. She met [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Charles Dickens]] later on in her literary career.

Until 1834 Martineau was occupied with her brother James on the [[political economy]] series, as well as a supplemental series of ''Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and Illustrations of Taxation'' which was intended to directly influence government policy. About the same time, she published four stories expressing support of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Poor Law]] reforms. These tales (direct, lucid, written without any appearance of effort, and yet practically effective) display the characteristics of their author's style. [[Tory]] paternalists reacted by calling her a [[Malthusian]] "who deprecates charity and provision for the poor", while [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] opposed her to the same degree. Whig [[Upper class|high society]] fêted her.<ref name="bell">{{Cite journal |last=Bell |first=H.I. |title=Letters of Harriet Martineau |journal=The British Museum Quarterley |year=1932|volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=21–22 |doi=10.2307/4421387 |jstor=4421387}}</ref>

In May 1834 [[Charles Darwin]], on his expedition to the [[Galapagos Islands]], received a letter from his sisters saying that Martineau was "now a great Lion in London, much patronized by Ld. Brougham who has set her to write stories on [[English poor laws|the poor Laws]]" and recommending ''Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated'' in [[pamphleteer|pamphlet]]-sized parts. They added that their brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] "knows her & is a very great admirer & every body reads her little books & if you have a dull hour you can, and then throw them overboard, that they may not take up your precious room".<ref name="Letter 224">{{Cite web |title=Letter 224; Darwin, C.

[[File:Harriet martineau portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet Martineau]]

In 1834, after completing the economic series, Harriet Martineau paid a long visit to the United States during which she visited a great many people, some little known, others as famous as [[James Madison]], the former US president, at his home at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]].<ref>McCoy, Drew R.

Press, 1989), p. 252.</ref><ref>[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=%22The+whole+Bible+is+against+Negro+slavery%2C+but+that+the+clergy+do+not+preach+this%2C+and+the+people+do+not+see+it.%22 ''The Westminster Review''] (1837)</ref> She also met numerous abolitionists in Boston and studied the emerging schools for the education of girls.

The two books are considered significant contributions to the then-emerging field of sociology.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In ''Society in America'', Martineau angrily criticised the state of women's education. She wrote,

{{quote|The intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction of... education... As women have none of the objects in life for which an enlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given... The choice is to either be 'ill-educated, passive, and subservient, or well-educated, vigorous, and free only upon sufferance.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> The publication of Harriet Martineau's ''Illustrations of Political Economy'' found public success. So much success that, "by 1834, the monthly sales . . . had reached 10,000 in a decade in which a sale of 2,000 or 3,000 copies of a work of fiction was considered highly successful."<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Banishing panic: Harriet Martineau and the popularization of political economy. |last=Freedgood |first=Elaine |date=1995 |journal=Victorian Studies |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=33–53 |jstor=3829415}}</ref>}}

Her article "The Martyr Age of the United States" (1839), in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', introduced English readers to the struggles of the abolitionists in America several years after Britain had [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished slavery]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/martyrageofunite00martrich Harriet Martineau, "The Martyr Age of the United States"], 1839, Internet Archive. Retrieved 19 May 2012</ref>

In October 1836, soon after returning from the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']], Charles Darwin went to London to stay with his brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]]. He found him spending his days "driving out Miss Martineau", who had returned from her trip to the United States. Charles wrote to his sister, 
<blockquote>Our only protection from so admirable a sister-in-law is in her working him too hard." He commented, "She already takes him to task about his idleness — She is going some day to explain to him her notions about marriage — Perfect equality of rights is part of her doctrine. I much doubt whether it will be equality in practice.<ref name="www.darwinproject.ac.uk">{{Cite web |title=Letter 321; Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, C. S., (9 Nov 1836)|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-321|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |access-date=18 December 2011}}</ref></blockquote>The Darwins shared Martineau's Unitarian background and Whig politics, but their father [[Robert Waring Darwin|Robert]] was concerned that, as a potential daughter-in-law, she was too extreme in her politics. Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece in the ''Westminster Review'' calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote "before he knew it was not [Martineau's], and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers".<ref name="Desmond 1991 205">{{harvnb |Desmond |Moore |1991 |p=205}}</ref> In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book ''Society in America'', including the "grandeur and beauty" of the "process of world making" she had seen at [[Niagara Falls]].<ref name="Desmond 1991 205"/> He remarked in a letter, <blockquote>She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman.<ref name="Letter 325">{{Cite web |title=Letter 325; Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, C. S., (7 Dec 1836) |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-325 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |access-date=18 December 2011}}</ref></blockquote>Significantly, Martineau's earlier popularization of [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Thomas Malthus]]' theories of population control may have helped convince Charles to read Malthus, which provided the breakthrough ideas for his nascent theory of evolution.

In April 1838 Charles wrote to his older sister Susan that<blockquote>Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night: — if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would lose it. — Lyell called there the other day & there was a beautiful rose on the table, & she coolly showed it to him & said 'Erasmus Darwin' gave me that. — How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman.<ref name="Letter 407">{{Cite web |title=Letter 407; Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, S. E., (1 Apr 1838)|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-407|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |access-date=18 December 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Martineau wrote ''Deerbrook'' (1838), a [[three-volume novel]] published after her American books. She portrayed a failed love affair between a physician and his sister-in-law. It was considered her most successful novel.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> She also wrote ''The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance'' (1839), a three-volume novel about the Haitian slave leader [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], who contributed to the island nation's gaining independence in 1804.

==Newcastle and Tynemouth==
[[File:Anne Whitney, Harriet Martineau, 1882, Davis Museum, Wellesley.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Harriet Martineau'', 1882, [[Davis Museum at Wellesley College|Davis Museum]], [[Wellesley College]]]]
In 1839, during a visit to [[Continental Europe]], Martineau was diagnosed with a uterine tumour. She several times visited her brother-in-law, [[Thomas Michael Greenhow]], who was a celebrated doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to try to alleviate her symptoms. On the last occasion she stayed for six months in the Greenhow family house at 28 Eldon Square. Immobile and confined to a couch, she was cared for by her mother until purchasing a house and hiring a nurse to aid her.

She next moved downriver to [[Tynemouth]], where she stayed at Mrs Halliday's boarding-house, 57 Front Street, for nearly five years from 16 March 1840. The establishment is still open as a guest house today, now named the "Martineau Guest House" in her honour.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Martineau Guest House |url=http://www.martineau-house.co.uk/ |access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref>

The critic Diana Postlethwaite wrote of this period for Martineau: <blockquote>Being homebound is a major part of the process of becoming feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... doing these things. They define femininity for her.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/></blockquote>Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.

Martineau wrote a number of books during her illness, and a historical plaque marks this house. In 1841 she published a series of four novels for children, ''The Playfellow'', comprising ''The Settlers at Home'', ''The Peasant and the Prince'', ''Feats on the Fiord'', and ''The Crofton Boys''. In 1844 she published ''Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid,'' an autobiographical reflection on invalidism.<ref>{{Cite book |year=1844 |title=Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid |publisher=Edward Moxon |place=London |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n8/mode/2up |access-date=14 June 2016 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> She wrote ''Household Education'' (1848), the handbook on the "proper" way to raise and educate children. Lastly, she began working on her autobiography. Completed much later, it included some hundred pages on this period. Notable visitors included Richard Cobden and Thomas and Jane Carlyle.

''Life in the Sickroom'' is considered to be one of Martineau's most under-rated works. It upset evangelical readers as they "thought it dangerous in 'its supposition of self-reliance'".<ref name="Winter 1995 597–616">{{Cite journal |author-link1=Alison Winter |last=Winter |first=Alison |title=Harriet Martineau and the Reform of the Invalid in Victorian England |journal=The Historical Journal|date=September 1995 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=597–616 |jstor=264004 |doi=10.1017/s0018246x00019993}}</ref> This series of essays embraced traditional womanhood. Martineau dedicated it to [[Elizabeth Barrett]], as it was "an outpouring of feeling to an idealized female alter ego, both professional writer and professional invalid- and utterly unlike the women in her own family". Written during a kind of public break from her mother, this book was Martineau's proclamation of independence.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/>

At the same time, Martineau turned the traditional patient–doctor relationship on its head by asserting control over her space even in sickness. The sickroom was her space. ''Life in the Sickroom'' explained how to regain control even in illness. Alarmed that a woman was suggesting such a position in the power dynamic, critics suggested that, as she was an invalid, her mind must also be sick and the work was not to be taken seriously. ''British and Foreign Medical Review'' dismissed Martineau's piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness. Instead, the ''Review'' recommended that patients follow "unconditional submission" to the advice of doctors.<ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/> They disagreed with the idea that Martineau might hold any sort of "authority to Britain's invalids".<ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/>

Expecting to remain an invalid for the rest of her life, Martineau delighted in the new freedom of views using her [[telescope]]. Across the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] was the sandy beach "where there are frequent wrecks — too interesting to an invalid... and above the rocks, a spreading heath, where I watch troops of boys flying their kites; lovers and friends taking their breezy walks on Sundays..."<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> She expressed a lyrical view of Tynemouth:

<blockquote>When I look forth in the morning, the whole land may be sheeted with glittering snow, while the myrtle-green sea swells and tumbles... there is none of the deadness of winter in the landscape; no leafless trees, no locking up with ice; and the air comes in through my open upper sash brisk, but sun-warmed. The robins twitter and hop in my flower-boxes... And at night, what a heaven! What an expanse of stars above, appearing more steadfast, the more the Northern Lights dart and quiver!<ref>''Life in the Sick-room: Essays by an Invalid'' by Harriet Martineau (2nd ed., 1844), [https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n72/mode/2up/ pp. 50–51].</ref></blockquote>

During her illness, she for a second time declined a pension on the [[civil list]], fearing to compromise her political independence. After publication of her letter on the subject, some of her friends raised a small [[Life annuity|annuity]] for her soon after.

In 1844 Martineau underwent a course of [[mesmerism]], returning to health after a few months. There was national interest in mesmerism at this time. Also known as 'animal magnetism', it can be defined as a "loosely grouped set of practices in which one person influenced another through a variety of personal actions, or through the direct influence of one mind on another mind. Mesmerism was designed to make invisible forces augment the mental powers of the mesmeric object."<ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/> She eventually published an account of her case in 16 ''Letters on Mesmerism'', which caused much discussion. Her work led to friction with "the natural prejudices of a surgeon and a surgeon's wife" (i.e., her brother-in-law,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3P1K9jmjKNNR4bTVDr4KnQy/harriet-martineau-the-quiet-radical |title=BBC Radio 4 - In Our Time - Harriet Martineau: The quiet radical |website=BBC |access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> [[Thomas Michael Greenhow]] and her sister, [[Martineau family|Elizabeth Greenhow, née Martineau]]).

In 1845 she left [[Tynemouth]] for [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]], where she designed herself and oversaw the construction of the house called ''The Knoll, Ambleside'', where she spent the greater part of her later life.<ref>From Ambleside she made two interesting contributions to ''[[The Zoist|The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology & Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare]]'', relating to [[mesmerism]]: the first, a letter (dated 19 August 1850) describing her mesmeric treatment of one of her cows: "Mesmeric Cure of a Cow",[https://books.google.com/books?id=ueRXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA300 Vol. 8, No. 31 (October 1850), pp. 300–303.]; and the second, also a letter (dated 23 October 1850), describing the angry visit of the veterinarian who had previously tried (in vain) to treat her dangerously ill cow (which was now quite well), on his hearing the news of its recovery: "Distressing effects in a Doctor upon the removal of a Disease from a Cow with Mesmerism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=ueRXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA333#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol. 8, No. 32 (January 1851), pp. 333–37].</ref> In 1845 she published three volumes of ''Forest and Game Law Tales''.

She believed the ultimate goal to be philosophic [[atheism]], but did not explicitly say so in the book. She described ancient tombs, "the black pall of oblivion" set against the [[Paschal cycle|paschal]] "puppet show" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and noted that Christian beliefs in reward and punishment were based on and similar to [[Paganism|heathen]] [[superstition]]s. Describing an [[ancient Egypt]]ian tomb, she wrote, "How like ours were his life and death!... Compare him with a retired naval officer made country gentleman in our day, and in how much less do they differ than agree!" The book's "[[infidel]] tendency" was too much for the publisher [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]], who rejected it. Martineau's biographer, Florence Fenwick Miller, wrote that "all her best moral and intellectual faculties were exerted, and their action becomes visible, at one page or another" of this work.<ref>Fenwick 1884, p. 109</ref> ''Eastern Life, Present and Past'' marked an important chapter in Martineau's life as it documented her move away from Unitarianism towards atheism, which was never fully achieved.<ref>Women's Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718-1918: Sexuality, Religion, and Work by Billie Melman, published 1992 IBSN 0-472-10332-6</ref> This shifting of religiosity can best be seen in her instruction to travel with the hopes of gaining a historical understanding of holy places and in her critiques on [[biblical literalism]], as influenced by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. ''Eastern Life, Present and Past'' is also important historically, as Billie Melman notes, it was the "first feminine travelogue proper that is not an account of a pilgrimage."<ref>Women's Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718-1918: Sexuality, Religion, and Work by Billie Melman, published 1992 IBSN 0-472-10332-6</ref> In her doing so, Martineau's so-called "anti-pilgrimage" became an important point in the growth of female academia, as well as an addition to the growing field of [[Egyptology]].<ref>Women's Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718-1918: Sexuality, Religion, and Work by Billie Melman, published 1992 IBSN 0-472-10332-6</ref> 

Martineau wrote ''[[Household Education]]'' in 1848, lamenting the state of women's education. She believed women had a natural inclination to motherhood and believed domestic work went hand in hand with academia for a proper, well-rounded education. She stated, "I go further than most persons... in desiring thorough practice in domestic occupations, from an early age, for young girls".<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> She proposed that freedom and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the most effectual instruments of education.

Her interest in schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures, addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterward extended to their parents at the request of the adults. The subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the [[History of England|histories of England]] and [[History of North America|North America]], and the scenes of her Eastern travels. At the request of the publisher [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], in 1849 she wrote ''The History of the Thirty Years' Peace, 1816–1846'', an excellent popular history from the point of view of a "philosophical Radical". Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time. She has been described as having an "essentially masculine nature".<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/> It was commonly thought that a "progressive" woman, in being progressive, was improperly emulating the qualities of a man.

Martineau's work included a widely used guide book to the [[Lake District]], ''A Complete Guide to the English Lakes'', published in 1855 and in its 4th edition by 1876.<ref name="guide">{{Cite book |title=A Complete Guide to the English Lakes |last=Martineau |first=Harriet |url=https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoe1855mart#page/n7/mode/2up |date=nd |location=Windermere |publisher=John Garnett |via=Archive.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Westmorland Gazette |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000399/18710708/017/0003 |website=British Newspaper Archive |access-date=11 July 2020 |quote=Miss Martineau stands at the head of local writers of guide books....}}</ref> This served as the definitive guidebook for the area for 25 years, effectively replacing the earlier [[Guide to the Lakes|guide]] by [[William Wordsworth]], and continued in common usage until the publication of [[M. J. B. Baddeley|Baddeley's]] ''Thorough Guide to the English Lake District'' in 1880.

[[File:Harriet Martineau sociologist.jpg|thumb|Martineau in her later years, painted by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]]]]
Martineau edited a volume of ''Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development'', published in March 1851. Its epistolary form is based on correspondence between her and the self-styled scientist [[Henry G. Atkinson]]. She expounded the doctrine of philosophical atheism, which she thought the tendency of human belief. She did not deny a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] but declared it [[Agnosticism|unknowable]]. She and Atkinson thought they affirmed man's [[moral obligation]]. Atkinson was a zealous exponent of mesmerism. The prominence given to the topics of mesmerism and [[clairvoyance]] heightened the general disapproval of the book. Literary London was outraged by its mesmeric [[evolutionism|evolutionary]] atheism, and the book caused a lasting division between Martineau, her beloved brother, James who had become a Unitarian cleric, and some of her friends.

From 1852 to 1866, she contributed regularly to the ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', writing sometimes six leaders a week. She wrote over 1600 articles for the paper in total.<ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/> It also published her ''Letters from Ireland'', written during a visit to that country in the summer of 1852.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofcharlot0001bron|url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/lettersofcharlot0001bron/page/120 120] |quote=Letters from ireland 1852. |title=The Letters of Charlotte Brontë: 1852-1855 |first=Charlotte |last=Brontë |date=7 August 1995 |publisher=Clarendon |isbn=978-0-19-818598-7 |access-date=7 August 2019 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> For many years she was a contributor to the ''[[Westminster Review]]''; in 1854 she was among financial supporters who prevented its closing down.

Martineau believed she had experienced psychosomatic symptoms and later benefits from mesmerism; this medical belief of the times related the uterus to emotions and hysteria. She had symptoms of hysteria in her loss of taste and smell. Her partial deafness throughout life may have contributed to her problems. Various people, including the maid, her brother,<ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/> and Spencer T. Hall (a notable mesmerist) performed mesmerism on her. Some historians attribute her apparent recovery from symptoms to a shift in the positioning of her tumor so that it no longer obstructed other organs. As the physical improvements were the first signs of healing she had in five years and happened at the same time of her first mesmeric treatment, Martineau confidentially credited mesmerism with her "cure".<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/>

She continued her political activism during the late 1850s and 1860s. She supported the Married Women's Property Bill and in 1856 signed a petition for it organised by [[Barbara Bodichon]]. She also pushed for licensed prostitution and laws that addressed the customers rather than the women. She supported women's [[suffrage]]<ref name="auto1"/> and signed Bodichon's petition in its favour in 1866.

In the early part of 1855, Martineau was suffering from [[heart disease]]. She began to write her autobiography, as she expected her life to end.<ref name="WCML">{{Cite web |title=Harriet Martineau |website=WCML |url=https://www.wcml.org.uk/our-collections/activists/harriet-martineau/ |access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref> Completing the book rapidly in three months,<ref name="auto1"/> she postponed its publication until after her death, and lived another two decades. It was published posthumously in 1877.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/>

When Darwin's book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, his brother Erasmus sent a copy to his old flame Harriet Martineau. At age 58, she was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. From her "snow landscape", Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised
<blockquote>the quality & conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness & simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, & the patient power by which it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentous knowledge. I should much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.</blockquote>Martineau supported Darwin's theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, "In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished."<ref name="bell"/> She wrote to her fellow [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] (and atheist) [[George Holyoake]] enthusing, "What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, & Natural (as far as Final Causes & Design are concerned) on the other. The range & mass of knowledge take away one's breath." To Fanny Wedgwood (the wife of [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]]) she wrote,
<blockquote>I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of "The [[Creator God|Creator]]" in the popular sense of the First Cause.... His subject is the "Origin of Species" & not the origin of Organisation; & it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all – There now! I have delivered my mind.</blockquote>

==Economics and social sciences==
Harriet Martineau propounds political economic theories in ''Illustrations of Political Economy''. She is seen as a frontrunner who merges fiction and economy in a time period when "fiction claimed authority over emotional knowledge, while economics claimed authority over empirical knowledge".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation 1830–1864. |last=Poovey |first=Mary |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1995 |pages=132–33}}</ref> Moreover, Martineau's text sets the stage for women to enter into economics. For example, Dalley Lana explains that "by bringing the topic of domestic economy to bear on political economy, Martineau places women more centrally within economic theory and practice. In this context, women – as readers of the ''Illustrations'' and as characters with the tales – are not only rendered a part of larger-scale economics but also (because of their participation) encourage to learn the principles of political economy."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=lana-l-dalley-on-martineaus-illustrations-of-political-economy-1832-34 |title=On Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy, 1832–34 |access-date=30 November 2015 |website=BRANCH: Britain, Representation |last=Dalley |first=Lana L.}}</ref>

As early as 1831, Martineau wrote on the subject "Political Economy" (as the field of economics was then known). Her goal was to popularise and illustrate the principles of ''[[laissez faire]]'' capitalism, though she made no claim to original theorising.

Martineau's reflections on ''Society in America'', published in 1837, are prime examples of her sociological methods. Her ideas in this field were set out in her 1838 book ''[[How to Observe Morals and Manners]]''. She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavour, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[Auguste Comte]] coined the name sociology and published a lengthy exposition under the title of ''Cours de Philosophie Positive'' in 1839. Martineau undertook a concise translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau)''. It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.<ref name="Sociology">{{Cite book |author1=Anthony Giddens |author2=Simon Griffiths |title=Sociology |url=https://archive.org/details/sociology0005gidd |url-access=registration |year=2006 |publisher=Polity |page=[https://archive.org/details/sociology0005gidd/page/20 20]}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:The lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Harriet Martineau's name on the lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery]]
Harriet Martineau died of bronchitis<ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/> at "The Knoll" on 27 June 1876. She was buried alongside her mother in [[Key Hill Cemetery]], [[Hockley, West Midlands|Hockley]], Birmingham. The following April, at Bracondale, her cousin's estate, much of Martineau's extensive art collection was sold at auction.<ref>{{Cite news |work=The San Francisco News Letter and California Advertiser |date=21 April 1877 |department=What the World Says |title=The Late Miss Harriet Martineau |url=http://www.mocavo.com/S-F-News-Letter-1877-Volume-27/299380/275 |access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref>

==Memorial==
Her name is listed on the east face of the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green cemetery]] in [[London]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wakingthedead.org/the-reformers-memorial.html |title=The Reformers Memorial |website=Waking the Dead - The Hidden Histories of Kensal Green Cemetery |access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref>

==Legacy==
She left an autobiographical sketch to be published by the ''Daily News'', in which she wrote:<ref>{{Cite book |author=Harriet Martineau |editor=Maria Weston Chapman |title=Harriet Martineau's Autobiography |publisher=J. R. Osgood |url=https://archive.org/details/harrietmartinea00martgoog |year=1877 |page=[https://archive.org/details/harrietmartinea00martgoog/page/n735 572]}}</ref>
<blockquote>Her original power was nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.</blockquote>

In 1877 her autobiography was published. It was rare for a woman to publish such a work, let alone one secular in nature. Her book was regarded as dispassionate, "philosophic to the core" in its perceived masculinity, and a work of [[necessitarianism]]. She deeply explored childhood experiences and memories, expressing feelings of having been deprived of her mother's affection, as well as strong devotion to her brother [[James Martineau]], a theologian.<ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/>

Anthony Giddens and Simon Griffiths argue that Martineau is a neglected founder of sociology and that she remains important today. She taught that study of the society must include all its aspects, including key political, religious and social institutions, and she insisted on the need to include the lives of women. She was the first sociologist to study such issues as marriage, children, religious life, and race relations. Finally, she called on sociologists to do more than just observe, but also work to benefit the society.<ref name="Sociology"/>

In February 2014, it was reported that London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] held several portraits of Harriet, whose great nephew, [[Lupton family|Francis Martineau Lupton]], was the great–great–grandfather of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], the gallery's patron.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Furness |first=Hannah |title=Duchess of Cambridge visits National Portrait Gallery, home to little-known Middleton family paintings. |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10631996/Duchess-of-Cambridge-visits-National-Portrait-Gallery-home-of-little-known-Middleton-family-paintings.html |date=11 February 2014 |page=3 |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=14 March 2014}}</ref> Harriet was close to her niece [[Frances Lupton]], who worked to open up [[Female education#Modern period|educational opportunities for women]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Edited by Elisabeth Sanders Arbuckle |first1=Harriet Martineau |title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA154 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=150 |date=1 January 1983 |isbn=9780804711463 |access-date=15 May 2015 |quote=(May 1857) My (H.
