Born in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] in 1955, he attended Rosebank Primary School and [[Harris Academy]]. In 1977 he graduated from the [[University of Edinburgh School of Law]] with an LLB (First Class Honours) and, the following year, from [[Sheffield University]] with a postgraduate MA in criminology. In 1984 he completed a PhD in socio-legal studies at the University of Edinburgh. From 1979 until 1997 he taught at the University of Edinburgh's Department of Criminology (which later became the Centre for Law and Society) where he was first a Lecturer, then a Reader, and finally the holder of a Personal Chair in Penology. He has held visiting positions at [[KU Leuven|Leuven University]], Belgium and the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California, Berkeley]]. He was a Shelby Cullom Davis Fellow in [[Princeton University]]'s history department, the 2012/2013 Douglas McK. Brown Chair in Law at the [[University of British Columbia Faculty of Law|University of British Columbia]], and was a visiting global professor in NYU Law School's Global Law program. Since 1997, he has been a member of the [[New York University School of Law]] faculty, where he holds the Arthur T. Vanderbilt professorship, and is also a full professor in the Department of Sociology. In fall 2014 he was the Shimizu Visiting Professor of Law at the London School of Economics and in spring 2018 a Paris Fellow in NYU's Global Research Initiative program. He also holds a professorial fellowship at the [[University of Edinburgh School of Law]].

Garland was the founding editor of the international, interdisciplinary journal ''[[Punishment & Society]]''. He edited the collection ''Mass Imprisonment: Social Causes and Consequences'' (2001) and, with Richard Sparks, he co-edited ''Criminology and Social Theory'' (2000). He is the author of an award-winning series of books on punishment and social control – ''Punishment and Welfare: A History of Penal Strategies'' (1985), ''Punishment and Modern Society: A Study in Social Theory'' (1990); ''The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society'' (2001) and ''Peculiar Institution: America's Death Penalty in an Age of Abolition'' (2010) – as well as a number of articles on the history and character of criminology. In addition, he has written on such topics as postmodernism, governmentality, risk, moral panics, the concept of culture, and the welfare state.

He is a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], the [[British Academy]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[American Society of Criminology]], and a fellow-designate of the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford.
