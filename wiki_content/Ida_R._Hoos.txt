== Biography ==
Born in [[Skowhegan, Maine]], where her Jewish parents had settled as jeweler after emigrating from Russia. She graduated from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1933 and earned a [[master's degree]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1942. While in graduate school, she founded Jewish Vocational Service in Boston to help [[garment worker]]s. After earning her master's, she moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where her husband took a job teaching economics at [[University of California, Berkeley]]. She earned her [[Ph.D.]] there in 1959 with the dissertation ''Automation in the Office: A Social Survey of Occupational and Organizational Changes'', published in book in 1961 as ''Automation in the Office''.

Whilst a research sociologist at the University of California late 1960s she published a series of critiques of the systems approach to social policy <ref name="Book">Systems analysis in social policy, 1969</ref> She criticised [[systems analysis]] for using mathematical formulae and disregarding social factors, especially when analyzing technology and public policy. She reminisced about her work's impact: "Technological advance was evident on every front. The 'dominant paradigm' embraced only the quantitative. What you could not count, did not count. The social and human aspects were systematically avoided in the rush to be 'scientific.'" <ref name="wapoobit">Sullivan, Patricia (May 4, 2007). Ida R.
