==Research==

Zigon is best known for his writing on [[ethics]] and [[political theory]] – most particularly for his conceptions of moral breakdown, moral assemblages, attunement, dwelling, and relational ethics. These writings have primarily addressed the topics of the war on drugs, social and political change, and artificial intelligence/data science.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2002651279_Jarrett_Zigon</ref> Zigon's work has had a major influence on the anthropology of ethics, and critical phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches to ethics and politics.

Zigon is committed to an ongoing conversation between anthropology and philosophy.<ref>https://muse.jhu.edu/book/56994</ref> He is particularly recognized for articulating an anthropology strongly influenced by post-Heideggerian continental philosophy and critical theory, the theoretical articulation of which he describes as critical hermeneutics.

He has contributed several articles to [[openDemocracy]] on addiction, the war on drugs, and political activism.<ref>https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/author/jarrett-zigon/</ref>
