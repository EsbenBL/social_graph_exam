'''Amartya Kumar Sen'''  ({{IPA-bn|ˈɔmortːo ˈʃen|lang}}; born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist and philosopher, who since 1972 has taught and worked in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Sen has made contributions to [[welfare economics]], [[social choice theory]], [[Economic justice|economic]] and [[social justice]], economic theories of [[famine]]s, decision theory, development economics, public health, and measures of well-being of countries.

He is currently a [[Harvard University Professor|Thomas W.

His father Ashutosh Sen was Professor of Chemistry at [[Dhaka University]], Development Commissioner in Delhi and then Chairman of the West Bengal Public Service Commission. He moved with his family to [[West Bengal]] in 1945. Sen's mother Amita Sen was the daughter of [[Kshitimohan Sen|Kshiti Mohan Sen]], the eminent Sanskritist and scholar of ancient and medieval India, who was a close associate of Rabindranath Tagore. K.M. Sen served as the second [[Vice Chancellor]] of [[Visva-Bharati University|Visva Bharati University]] from 1953 to 1954.

Sen began his school education at [[St Gregory's School (Dhaka)|St Gregory's School]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1940. In the fall of 1941, Sen was admitted to [[Patha Bhavana]], Shantiniketan, where he completed his school education. The school had many progressive features, such as distaste for examinations or competitive testing. In addition, the school stressed cultural diversity, and embraced cultural influences from the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen - Biographical |publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> In 1951, he went to [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College, Calcutta]], where he earned a B.A. in Economics with First in the First Class, with a minor in Mathematics, as a graduating student of the [[University of Calcutta]]. While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15% chance of living five years.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Riz Khan interviewing Amartya Sen |date=21 August 2010 |title=One on One - Amartya Sen |medium=Television production |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN5esbvAt-w |access-date=2016-04-26 |time=18:40 minutes in |publisher=Al Jazeera }}</ref> With radiation treatment, he survived, and in 1953 he moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he earned a second B.A. in Economics in 1955 with a First Class, topping the list as well. At this time, he was elected President of the Cambridge [[Majlis]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} While Sen was officially a PhD student at Cambridge (though he had finished his research in 1955–56), he was offered the position of First-Professor and First-Head of the Economics Department of the newly created [[Jadavpur University]] in [[Calcutta]]. He is still the youngest chairman to have headed the Department of Economics. He served in that position, starting the new Economics Department, from 1956 to 1958.

Meanwhile, Sen was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, which gave him four years of freedom to do anything he liked; he made the radical decision to study [[philosophy]]. Sen explained: "The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, [[social choice theory]] makes intense use of [[mathematical logic]] and also draws on [[moral philosophy]], and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own."<ref name=Philosophy>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen – Biographical: Philosophy and economics |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |access-date= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> His interest in philosophy, however, dates back to his college days at Presidency, where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes. One of the books he was most interested in was [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen - Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref>

In Cambridge, there were major debates between supporters of [[Keynesian economics]], and the neo-classical economists who were skeptical of Keynes. Because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both Trinity and Cambridge, Sen chose a different subject for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis, which was on "[[Choice of techniques|The Choice of Techniques]]" in 1959. The work had been completed earlier, except for advice from his adjunct supervisor in India, Professor [[A.K. Dasgupta]], given to Sen while teaching and revising his work at Jadavpur, under the supervision of the "brilliant but vigorously intolerant" [[post-Keynesian]], [[Joan Robinson]].<ref name=Robinson>{{cite web|title= Amartya Sen – Biographical: Cambridge as a battleground |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |access-date= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Quentin Skinner]] notes that Sen was a member of the secret society [[Cambridge Apostles]] during his time at Cambridge.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Professor Quentin Skinner and Alan Macfarlane | title = Interview of Professor Quentin Skinner &nbsp;– part 2 | medium = Video | via = YouTube | location = Cambridge | date = 2 June 2008 | minutes = 57:55 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVdAhzqFLps }}</ref>

During 1960–61, Amartya Sen visited the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], on leave from Trinity College.

==Research work==
[[File:The Nobel Laureate Prof. Amartya Sen delivering the Inaugural Prof. Hiren Mukerjee Memorial Parliamentary Lecture on the theme “Demands of Social Justice”, at Parliament House, in New Delhi on August 11, 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Sen giving inaugural parliamentary lecture at [[Parliament House (India)]].]]

Sen's work on 'Choice of Techniques' complemented that of Maurice Dobb. In a developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation. In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive.
Sen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of [[social choice]], which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist [[Kenneth Arrow]].  Arrow had most famously shown that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), any [[Ranked voting system|ranked order]] [[voting system]] will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms. Sen's contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Benicourt | first = Emmanuelle | title = Is Amartya Sen a post-autistic economist? | journal = Post-Autistic Economics Review | issue = 15 | pages = article 4 | date = 1 September 2002 | url = http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue15/Benicourt15.htm | access-date= 16 June 2014}}</ref> applied, as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice, informed by his interests in [[history of economic thought]] and philosophy.

In 1981, Sen published ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised [[food prices]], thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up.<ref name=Time>{{cite news | last= Sachs | first= Jeffrey | author-link = Jeffrey Sachs | title= The real causes of famine: a Nobel laureate blames authoritarian rulers | url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989405,00.html | access-date= 16 June 2014 | work= Time | date= 26 October 1998 }}</ref>

Sen's interest in famine stemmed from personal experience. As a nine-year-old boy, he witnessed the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which three million people perished. This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded. He presents data that there was an adequate food supply in Bengal at the time, but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like barbers did not have the means to buy food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include acquisitions by the [[British Indian Army|military]], [[panic buying]], hoarding, and [[price gouging]], all of them connected to the war in the region. In ''Poverty and Famines'', Sen revealed that in many cases of famine, food supplies were not significantly reduced. In Bengal, for example, food production, while down on the previous year, was higher than in previous non-famine years. Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution, which led to starvation. His [[capability approach|capabilities approach]] focuses on [[positive liberty|positive freedom]], a person's actual ability to be or do something, rather than on [[negative liberty|negative freedom]] approaches, which are common in economics and simply focuses on non-interference. In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected. However, they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything, they did not have the functioning of nourishment, nor the capability to escape morbidity.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In addition to his important work on the causes of famines, Sen's work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the "[[Human Development Report]]",<ref name=UNDP>{{cite book | contribution = Overview &#124; Celebrating 20 years of human development | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme | title = Human Development Report 2010 &#124; 20th anniversary edition &#124; the real wealth of nations: pathways to human development | page = 2 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780230284456 | quote = ...the first HDR called for a different approach to economics and development – one that put people at the centre.

}} [http://www.simonbatterbury.net/pubs/Senlongversion.htm Draft]</ref> This annual publication that ranks countries on a variety of economic and social indicators owes much to the contributions by Sen among other social choice theorists in the area of economic measurement of poverty and inequality.

Sen's revolutionary contribution to development economics and social indicators is the concept of "[[Capability approach|capability]]" developed in his article ''Equality of What''.<ref name=What>{{Citation | last = Sen  | first = Amartya | contribution = Equality of what? | editor-last = MacMurrin | editor-first = Sterling M. | title = The Tanner lectures on human values | pages = 195–220 | volume = 4 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2010 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0521176415 }} [http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/s/sen80.pdf Pdf version.]</ref> He argues that governments should be measured against the concrete capabilities of their citizens. This is because top-down development will always trump [[human rights]] as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a "right" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a right to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have "functionings". These "functionings" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the [[Polling station|polls]]. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the "capabilities approach" in practice, see [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ''Women and Human Development''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Women and human development: the capabilities approach | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521003858 }}</ref>

He wrote a controversial article in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled "More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing" (see [[Missing women of Asia]]), analyzing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia. Other studies, including one by [[Emily Oster]], had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Oster | first1 = Emily |last2 = Chen | first2 = Gang | author-link1 = Emily Oster |title=Hepatitis B does not explain male-biased sex ratios in China |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=107 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=142–144 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.01.007 | s2cid = 9071877 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w13971.pdf }}</ref>

In 1999, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book ''[[Development as Freedom]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Development as Freedom|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Anchor|year=1998|isbn=978-0385720274|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentasfre00amar}}</ref> Sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim daily labourer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age.

In ''Development as Freedom'', Sen outlines five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development. He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well. In this regard he discusses the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well-educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations etc. A comparison is also drawn between China and India to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms. Both countries were working towards developing their economies, China since 1979 and India since 1991.

Welfare economics seeks to evaluate economic policies in terms of their effects on the well-being of the community. Sen, who devoted his career to such issues, was called the "conscience of his profession". His influential monograph ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'' (1970), which addressed problems related to individual rights (including formulation of the [[liberal paradox]]), justice and equity, majority rule, and the availability of information about individual conditions, inspired researchers to turn their attention to issues of basic welfare. Sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor. For instance, his theoretical work on inequality provided an explanation for why there are fewer women than men in India<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Sen | first = Amartya | title = Many Faces of Gender Inequality | journal = Frontline | volume = 18 | issue = 22 | date = 27 October – 9 November 2001 | url = http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220040.htm}}</ref> and in China despite the fact that in the West and in poor but medically unbiased countries, women have lower [[mortality rate]]s at all ages, live longer, and make a slight majority of the population. Sen claimed that this skewed ratio results from the better health treatment and childhood opportunities afforded boys in those countries, as well as [[sex-selective abortion]]s.

Governments and international organisations handling food crises were influenced by Sen's work. His views encouraged policy makers to pay attention not only to alleviating immediate suffering but also to finding ways to replace the lost income of the poor—for example through public works—and to maintain stable prices for food. A vigorous defender of political freedom, Sen believed that famines do not occur in functioning democracies because their leaders must be more responsive to the demands of the citizens. In order for economic growth to be achieved, he argued, social reforms—such as improvements in education and public health—must precede economic reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Amartya-Sen|title=Amartya Sen {{!}} Indian economist|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>

In 2009, Sen published a book called ''[[The Idea of Justice]]''.<ref name="Sen 2010" /> Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, Sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of [[John Rawls]] or [[John Harsanyi]]. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] or [[David Hume]], and inspired by the philosophical works of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realisations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being equally important. As an alternative to Rawls's [[veil of ignorance]], Sen chose the [[thought experiment]] of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of [[John Stuart Mill]]) and a focus on people's capabilities (an [[capability approach|approach]] that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice.

==Career==
Sen began his career both as a teacher and a research scholar in the Department of Economics, [[Jadavpur University]] as a Professor of Economics in 1956. He spent two years in that position. From 1957 to 1963, Sen served as a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Between 1960 and 1961, Sen was a visiting professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the United States, where he got to know [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Solow]], [[Franco Modigliani]], and [[Norbert Wiener]].<ref name=Calcutta>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen &#124; Biographical: opening paragraph |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher=Nobel Prize |access-date=12 June 2012 }}</ref> He was also a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1964-1965) and [[Cornell University]] (1978-1984).

==Political views==
Sen was critical of Indian politician [[Narendra Modi]] when he was announced as their prime ministerial candidate by the [[BJP]]. In April 2014, he said that Modi would not make a good Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/narendra-modi-is-not-a-good-pm-candidate-amartya-sen-559552|title=Narendra Modi is not a good PM candidate: Amartya Sen|publisher=NDTV}}</ref> He conceded later in December 2014 that Modi did give people a sense of faith that things can happen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/the-biggest-issue-with-this-government-is-social-cohesion/|title=Narendra Modi did give people a sense of faith that things can happen|work=The Indian Express}}</ref> In February 2015, Sen opted out of seeking a second term for the chancellor post of [[Nalanda University]], stating that the Government of India was not keen on him continuing in the post.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/02/20/the-morning-wrap_n_6718028.html|title=Amartya Sen Quits Nalanda}}</ref>

In August 2019, during the clampdown and curfew in [[Kashmir]] for more than two weeks after the [[Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status]], Sen criticized the government and said "As an Indian, I am not proud of the fact that India, after having done so much to achieve a democratic norm in the world – where India was the first non-Western country to go for democracy – that we lose that reputation on the grounds of action that have been taken".<ref>[https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amartya-sen-no-resolution-of-kashmir-without-democracy-2087327 "Not Proud As An Indian...": Amartya Sen's Critique Of Kashmir Move], NDTV, 19 August 2019.</ref><ref>[http://m.thedailynewnation.com/news/226084/kashmir-without-democracy-not-acceptable-amartya Kashmir without democracy not acceptable: Amartya], ''New Nation'', 19 August 2019.</ref> He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as "a classical colonial excuse" to prevent [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|backlash]] against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.<ref>[https://www.ndtv.com/video/shows/left-right-centre/j-k-detentions-a-classic-colonial-excuse-amartya-sen-524819 J&K Detentions "A Classic Colonial Excuse": Amartya Sen], NDTV, 19 August 2019.</ref>

Sen spent much of his later life as a political writer and activist. He was outspoken about Narendra Modi's leadership in India. In an interview with the ''New York Times'', he claimed that Modi's fearmongering among the Indian people was anti-democratic. "The big thing that we know from John Stuart Mill is that democracy is government by discussion, and, if you make discussion fearful, you are not going to get a democracy, no matter how you count the votes." He disagreed with Modi's ideology of Hindu nationalism, and advocated for a more integrated and diverse ideology that reflects the heterogeneity of India.<ref>Chotiner, Isaac, and Eliza Griswold. [http://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/amartya-sens-hopes-and-fears-for-indian-democracy "Amartya Sen's Hopes and Fears for Indian Democracy."] ''The New Yorker'', 6 Oct. 2019.</ref>

Sen also wrote an article for the ''New York Times'' documenting the reasons why India trails behind China in economic development. He advocates for healthcare reform, because low-income people in India have to deal with exploitative and inadequate private healthcare. He recommends India implement the same education policies that Japan did in the late 19th century.  However, he realizes that there is a tradeoff between democracy and progress in Asia because democracy is a near reality in India and not in China.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/opinion/why-india-trails-china.html "Why India Trails China."] ''New York Times'', 20 June 2013.</ref>

In a 1999 article in ''The Atlantic'', Sen recommended for India a middle path between the "hard-knocks" development policy that creates wealth at the expense of civil liberties, and radical progressivism that only seeks to protect civil liberties at the expense of development. Rather than create an entirely new theory for ethical development in Asia, Sen sought to reform the current development model.<ref>''The Atlantic Monthly''; December 1999; "A Third Way for the Third World" – 99.12; Volume 284, No. 6; page 124–129.</ref>

Sen has been married three times.

Sen is an [[atheist]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chanda |first1=Arup| title=Market economy not the panacea, says Sen |url=http://www.rediff.com/business/1998/dec/28sen.htm|access-date=16 June 2014|publisher=Rediff on the Net|date=28 December 1998 |quote=Although this is a personal matter...

{{quote|text=In some ways people had got used to the idea that India was spiritual and religion-oriented.
