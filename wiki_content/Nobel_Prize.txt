'''The Nobel Prize''' ({{IPAc-en|n|oʊ|ˈ|b|ɛ|l}} {{respell|noh|BEL}}; {{lang-sv|Nobelpriset}} {{IPA-sv|nʊˈbɛ̂lːˌpriːsɛt|}}; {{lang-no|Nobelprisen}} {{IPA-no|nʊˈbɛ̀lːˌpriːsn̩|}}) are five separate prizes that, according to [[Alfred Nobel]]'s [[Will and testament|will]] of 1895, are awarded to "those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to Mankind." [[Alfred Nobel]] was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] chemist, engineer, and industrialist most famously known for the invention of [[dynamite]]. He died in 1896. In his will, he bequeathed all of his "remaining realisable assets" to be used to establish five prizes which became known as "Nobel Prizes." Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901.<ref name=":0" />

Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace]] (Nobel characterized the Peace Prize as "to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses").<ref name=":0">

==History==
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photo of a bearded man in his fifties sitting in a chair.|Alfred Nobel had the unpleasant surprise of reading his own obituary, which was titled "The merchant of death is dead", in a French newspaper.]]
[[Alfred Nobel]] ({{Audio|Sv-Alfred Nobel.ogg|listen}}) was born on 21 October 1833 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, into a family of engineers.<ref name="Levinovitz5">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 5</ref> He was a [[chemist]], [[engineer]], and [[inventor]]. In 1894, Nobel purchased the [[Bofors]] iron and steel mill, which he made into a major [[Weapon|armaments]] [[manufacturing|manufacturer]]. Nobel also invented [[ballistite]]. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder [[cordite]]. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a [[patent infringement]] [[lawsuit]] over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth coming from his 355&nbsp;inventions, of which [[dynamite]] is the most famous.<ref name="Levinovitz11">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 11</ref>

In 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own [[obituary]], titled "The merchant of death is dead", in a French newspaper. It was Alfred's brother [[Ludvig Nobel|Ludvig]] who had died; the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his [[Will and testament|will]].<ref name="Time">{{cite news |first=Frederic |last=Golden |title=The Worst And The Brightest |date=16 October 2000 |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,998209,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=15 January 2021}}</ref> On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in [[Sanremo|San Remo, Italy]], from a [[cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]]. He was 63 years old.<ref name="Sohlman13">[[#Sohlman69|Sohlman]], p. 13</ref>

Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died, signing it at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.<ref name="Sohlman7">[[#Sohlman69|Sohlman]], p. 7</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=von Euler |first=U.

Nobel's instructions named a [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] to award the [[Peace Prize]], the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organizations were designated.<!--wouldn't a better word be "designated"? they already existed, did they not?--> These were [[Karolinska Institute]] on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] on 11 June.<ref name="Crawford1">[[#Crawford69|Crawford]], p. 1</ref> The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created [[statute]]s were promulgated by [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]].<ref name="thelocal1"/> In 1905, the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union between Sweden and Norway]] was dissolved.

===Nobel Foundation===
==== Formation of Foundation ====
{{Main|Nobel Foundation}}
[[File:Alfred Nobels will-November 25th, 1895.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A paper with stylish handwriting on it with the title "Testament"|Alfred Nobel's [[Will and testament|will]] stated that 94% of his total assets should be used to establish the Nobel Prizes.]]

According to his will and testament read in Stockholm on 30 December 1896, a foundation established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity. The Nobel Prize was funded by Alfred Nobel's personal fortune. According to the official sources, Alfred Nobel bequeathed most of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation that now forms the economic base of the Nobel Prize.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/about/financial-management/ |title="Financial Management" |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=8 Nov 2021 |website=Nobel Foundation |access-date=8 Nov 2021 |quote=Nobel stipulated in his will that most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 1,794 million) should be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities”.}}</ref>

The [[Nobel Foundation]] was founded as a private organization on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.<ref name="Levinovitz14">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 14</ref> In accordance with Nobel's [[Will and testament|will]], the primary task of the foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. [[Robert Nobel|Robert]] and [[Ludvig Nobel]] were involved in the [[oil business]] in [[Azerbaijan]], and according to Swedish [[historian]] E. Bargengren, who accessed the [[Nobel family]] [[archive]], it was this "decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from [[Baku]] that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/42_folder/42_articles/42_readersforum.html |title=Nobel Prize Funded from Baku |journal=[[Azerbaijan International]] |date=30 April 1996 |access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref> Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the [[Nobel laureates]].<ref name="Levinovitz15">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 15</ref><ref name="Feldman16">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 16</ref> In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an [[investment company]], in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is [[Tax exemption|exempt from all taxes]] in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953).<ref name="Levinovitz17-18">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 17–18</ref> Since the 1980s, the foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628&nbsp;billion Swedish ''kronor'' (c. US$560&nbsp;million).<ref name="Levinovitz15-17">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 15–17</ref>

According to the statutes, the foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board]] is appointed by the Swedish [[Privy Council of Sweden|King in Council]], with the other four members appointed by the [[trustee]]s of the prize-awarding [[institutions]]. An [[Executive director|Executive Director]] is chosen from among the [[board of directors|board members]], a deputy director is appointed by the King in Council, and two [[deputies]] are appointed by the [[trustees]]. However, since 1995, all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the executive director and the deputy director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]), the trustees of these institutions, and [[audit]]ors.<ref name="Levinovitz15-17"/>

==== Foundation capital and cost ====
The capital of the Nobel Foundation today is invested 50% in [[shares]], 20% [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and 30% other [[investments]] (e.g. [[hedge funds]] or [[real estate]]). The distribution can vary by 10 percent.<ref name="dn20121202">{{cite news |title=Rabatter räddar Nobelfesten |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter (Norwegian newspaper)|Dagens Nyheter]] |url-access=subscription |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/rabatter-raddar-nobelfesten |trans-title=Discounts Save the Nobel Party |access-date=18 March 2019 |language=no |date=2 December 2012 |last1=Sjöholm/Tt |first1=Gustav}}</ref> At the beginning of 2008, 64% of the funds were invested mainly in American and European stocks, 20% in bonds, plus 12% in real estate and hedge funds.<ref name="handelsblatt2008">{{cite web |title=Nobel-Stiftung: Noble Sorgen |newspaper=[[Handelsblatt]] |trans-title=Nobel Foundation: Noble Worries |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/journal/nachrichten/noble-sorgen;2106721;0 |access-date=19 March 2019 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704211447/http://www.handelsblatt.com/journal/nachrichten/noble-sorgen;2106721;0 |archive-date=4 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2011, the total annual cost was approximately 120&nbsp;million [[Swedish krona|kronor]], with 50&nbsp;million kronor as the prize money. Further costs to pay institutions and persons engaged in giving the prizes were 27.4&nbsp;million kronor. The events during the Nobel week in Stockholm and Oslo cost 20.2&nbsp;million kronor. The administration, Nobel [[symposium]], and similar items had costs of 22.4&nbsp;million kronor. The cost of the [[Economic Sciences]] prize of 16.5&nbsp;Million kronor is paid by the [[Sveriges Riksbank]].<ref name="dn20121202" />

===Inaugural Nobel prizes===
[[File:Röntgen, Wilhelm Conrad (1845-1923).jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A black and white photo of a bearded man in his fifties sitting in a chair. |[[Wilhelm Röntgen]] received the first Physics Prize for his discovery of X-rays.]]
Once the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place, the [[Nobel Committee]]s began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently, they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.

The Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s discovery of [[X-ray]]s and [[Philipp Lenard]]'s work on [[cathode ray]]s. The Academy of Sciences selected Röntgen for the prize.<ref name="Feldman134">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 134</ref><ref name="Leroy117-118">[[#Leroy|Leroy]], pp. 117–118</ref> In the last decades of the 19th century, many chemists had made significant contributions. Thus, with the Chemistry Prize, the academy "was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize".<ref name="Levinovitz77">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 77</ref> The academy received 20 nominations, eleven of them for [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Jacobus van 't Hoff]].<ref name="Crawford118">[[#Crawford69|Crawford]], p. 118</ref> Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in [[chemical thermodynamics]].<ref name="Levinovitz81">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 81</ref><ref name="Feldman205">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 205</ref>

The Swedish Academy chose the poet [[Sully Prudhomme]] for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected [[Leo Tolstoy]] to be awarded.<ref name="Levinovitz144">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 144</ref> Some, including [[Burton Feldman]], have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the academy members preferred [[Victorian literature]] and thus selected a Victorian poet.<ref name="Feldman69">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 69</ref> The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist [[Emil von Behring]]. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an [[antitoxin]] to treat [[diphtheria]], which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.<ref name="Feldman242-244">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 242–244</ref><ref name="Leroy233">[[#Leroy|Leroy]], p. 233</ref>

The first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] went to the Swiss [[Henry Dunant|Jean Henri Dunant]] for his role in founding the International [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross Movement]] and initiating the Geneva Convention, and jointly given to French pacifist [[Frédéric Passy]], founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization.

===Second World War===
In 1938 and 1939, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] forbade three laureates from Germany ([[Richard Kuhn]], [[Adolf Butenandt|Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt]], and [[Gerhard Domagk]]) from accepting their prizes.<ref name="Levinovitz23">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 23</ref> They were all later able to receive the diploma and medal.<ref name="Wilhelm85">[[#Wilhelm69|Wilhelm]], p. 85</ref> Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War, the prizes were awarded irregularly. In 1939, the Peace Prize was not awarded. No prize was awarded in any category from 1940 to 1942, due to the [[German occupation of Norway|occupation of Norway by Germany]]. In the subsequent year, all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/ |title=All Nobel Laureates |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=15 January 2010}}</ref>

During the occupation of Norway, three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the committee building in [[Oslo]] was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden.<ref name="Abrams23">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 23</ref> These members kept the work of the committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.<ref name="Levinovitz23"/>

===Prize in Economic Sciences===
{{Main|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences}}
[[File:Worldmapnobellaureatesbycountry2.PNG|thumb|Map of Nobel laureates by country]]

In 1968, Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honour of Alfred Nobel. The following year, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were [[Jan Tinbergen]] and [[Ragnar Frisch]] "for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes".<ref name="Feldman343">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 343</ref><ref name="Levinovitz207">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 207</ref> The board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition, it would allow no further new prizes.<ref name="Levinovitz20">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 20</ref>

==Award process==
The award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes, the main difference being who can make nominations for each of them.<ref name="Feldman16-17">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 16–17</ref>

===Nominations===
Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.<ref name="Feldman16-17"/><ref name="Levinovitz26">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 26</ref> The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.<ref name="Abrams15">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 15</ref> The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize.

===Selection===
The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.<ref name="Feldman52">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 52</ref> There are four awarding institutions for the six prizes awarded:
*[[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]
*[[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]]
*[[Swedish Academy]]
*[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]
The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote.<ref name="Levinovitz25-28">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], pp. 25–28</ref> A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.<ref name="Abrams8">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 8</ref>

===Posthumous nominations===
Although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted, individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to [[Erik Axel Karlfeldt]], and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]. Since 1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate, [[William Vickrey]], who in 1996 died after the prize (in [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics]]) was announced but before it could be presented.<ref name="Abrams9">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 9</ref> On 3 October 2011, the laureates for the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] were announced; however, the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, [[Ralph M. Steinman]], had died three days earlier. The committee was debating about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.<ref name="cbc1003"/> The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize "was made in good faith", it would remain unchanged.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph Steinman Remains Nobel Laureate|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/press_releases_archive/2011/steinman.html|access-date=8 October 2012|publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]|date=3 October 2011}}</ref>

===Recognition time lag===
Nobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made "during the preceding year".

The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Laureates in Literature |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |access-date=15 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=15 January 2010}}</ref> The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]] was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2008/index.html |title=Peace 2008 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |access-date=15 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Bryant |title=Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari Wins Nobel Peace Prize |date=10 October 2008 |work=[[Voice of America]] |publisher=International Broadcasting Bureau |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-10/2008-10-10-voa8.cfm |access-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117162443/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-10/2008-10-10-voa8.cfm |archive-date=17 November 2008 }}</ref> However, they can also be awarded for specific recent events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Peace Prize Laureates |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=15 January 2010}}</ref> For instance, [[Kofi Annan]] was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<ref name="Abrams330">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 330</ref> Similarly [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], and [[Shimon Peres]] received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the [[Oslo Accords]].<ref name="Abrams27">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 27</ref>

Awards for physics, chemistry, and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted. Sometimes, this takes decades – for example, [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution.<ref name=currentscience>{{cite journal|last=Vishveshwara|first=S.|title=Leaves from an unwritten diary: S.

Except for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo, Norway, usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events.<ref name="autogenerated5">{{cite web |url=http://news.icm.ac.uk/technology/2009-nobel-prize-award-ceremony-live-online/4893/ |title=2009 Nobel Prize award ceremony live online &#124; IT &#124; ICM Commercial & Business News |publisher=[[Institute of Commercial Management]] |date=10 December 2009 |access-date=16 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209005839/http://news.icm.ac.uk/technology/2009-nobel-prize-award-ceremony-live-online/4893/ |archive-date=9 February 2010  }}</ref><ref name="thelocal2">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/23784/20091210/ |title=Pomp aplenty as winners gather for Nobel gala |work=[[The Local]] |date=10 December 2009 |access-date=16 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215055502/http://www.thelocal.se/23784/20091210/ |archive-date=15 December 2009 }}</ref> The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies' are held at the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]], with the Nobel banquet following immediately at [[Stockholm City Hall]].

===Nobel Banquet===
{{main|Nobel Banquet}}

[[File:Nobel-banquet-table.jpg|thumb|alt=A set table with a white table cloth. There are many plates and glasses plus a menu visible on the table.|Table at the 2005 Nobel Banquet in Stockholm]]

After the award ceremony in Sweden, a banquet is held in the [[Blue Hall]] at the [[Stockholm City Hall]], which is attended by the [[Swedish Royal Family]] and around 1,300 guests. The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] banquet is held in Norway at the [[Grand Hotel (Oslo)|Oslo Grand Hotel]] after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the president of the [[Storting]], on occasion the Swedish prime minister, and, since 2006, the King and Queen of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.

===Nobel lecture===
According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/statutes.html#par9 |title=The Nobel Foundation - Statutes |website=The Nobel Foundation}}</ref> The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format.<ref>[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]],"Nobel Rhetoric, Or Petrarch's Pendulum", in the journal Rhetoric and Philosophy 42(4), 373–400, 2009 {{ISSN|0031-8213}}</ref> These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize, but some have happened even later. For example, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office.<ref name="Abrams18-19">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 18–19</ref> The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/08/jmg-clezio-nobel-lecture |title=Le Clézio uses Nobel lecture to attack information poverty |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 December 2008 |access-date=20 January 2010 |first=Richard|last=Lea |location=London}}</ref>

==Prizes==

===Medals===
The Nobel Foundation announced on 30 May 2012 that it had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Between 1902 and 2010, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by [[Myntverket]] (the Swedish Mint), Sweden's oldest company, which ceased operations in 2011 after 107 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Medalj – ett traditionellt hantverk |website=[[Myntverket]] |url= http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&page=3 |language=sv |access-date=15 December 2007 |trans-title=Medals: A traditional Craft |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218102934/http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang%3Dsv%26page%3D3 |archive-date= 18 December 2007}}</ref>

Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]]. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal.<ref name="Feldman2">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 2</ref> The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.<ref name=Paulingmedal>[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/pictures/nobel-chemistry-medal.html "Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 [[carat (purity)|carat]] gold. Since then, they have been struck in 18 carat [[coloured gold#Green gold|green gold]] plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold, but averages about {{convert|175|g|lb}} for each medal.

After the war, the gold was recovered from solution, and the medals re-cast.<ref name="Feldman397">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 397</ref>

===Diplomas===
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden, or in the case of the peace prize, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.<ref name="Feldman2"/> The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.<ref name="Abrams18">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 18</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/diplomas/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize Diplomas |access-date=12 March 2010 |last=Lemmel |first=Birgitta |year=2009 |website=Nobel Foundation}}</ref>

===Award money===
The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes, in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded.<ref name=Feldman2/> The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s, when the prize money was 880,000 SEK per prize (c. 2.6&nbsp;million SEK altogether, US$350,000 today). In 2009, the monetary award was 10&nbsp;million SEK (US$1.4&nbsp;million).<ref name="Nobel Prize Amounts">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/prize_amounts_14.pdf |title=Prize Amount and Market Value |website=Nobel Foundation |year=2014 |access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2009/10/11/foreman.how.nobel.awarded.cnn?iref=videosearch |title=Video – Breaking News Videos from CNN.com |publisher=CNN |date=11 October 2009 |access-date=15 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831124519/http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2009/10/11/foreman.how.nobel.awarded.cnn?iref=videosearch |archive-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In June 2012, it was lowered to 8&nbsp;million SEK.<ref>{{cite web |title=Committee lowers Nobel Prize by 2 million kronor |url=http://www.thelocal.se/41378/20120611/ |newspaper=The Local |access-date=12 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615172218/http://www.thelocal.se/41378/20120611 |archive-date=15 June 2012 |date=11 June 2012}}</ref> If two laureates share the prize in a category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients.

;Literature Prize

The award of the 2004 Literature Prize to [[Elfriede Jelinek]] drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy, [[Knut Ahnlund]]. Ahnlund resigned, alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused "irreparable damage to all progressive forces, it has also confused the general view of literature as an art". He alleged that Jelinek's works were "a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/who-deserves-nobel-prize-judges-don-t-agree-wbna9665122 |title=Who deserves Nobel prize?

;Science prizes

In 1949, the neurologist [[António Egas Moniz]] received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the [[Lobotomy|prefrontal leucotomy]]. The previous year, [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Dr. Walter Freeman]] had developed a [[Lobotomy#Transorbital lobotomy|version of the procedure]] which was faster and easier to carry out. Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure, Freeman's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern [[medical ethics]]. Endorsed by such influential publications as ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', leucotomy or "lobotomy" became so popular that about 5,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz's receipt of the Prize.<ref name="Feldman286-289">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], pp. 286–289</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Day |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jan/13/neuroscience.medicalscience |title=He was bad, so they put an ice pick in his brain... |work=The Guardian |access-date=31 March 2010 |date=12 January 2008 |location=London}}</ref>

===Overlooked achievements===
[[File:MKGandhi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], although nominated five times, was never awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.]]

Although [[Mahatma Gandhi]], an icon of [[nonviolence]] in the 20th century, was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] five times, in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947, and a few days before he was assassinated on 30 January 1948, he was never awarded the prize.<ref name="Gandhi">{{cite web

In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided to make no award that year on the grounds that "there was no suitable living candidate".<ref name="Gandhi"/><ref name="Abrams147-148">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 147–148</ref>

In 1989, this omission was publicly regretted, when the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was awarded the Peace Prize, the chairman of the committee said that it was "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1989/presentation-speech.html |title= The Nobel Prize in Peace 1989 – Presentation Speech |access-date=24 October 2020 |last= Aarvik |first= Egil |publisher= [[The Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref>

Geir Lundestad, 2006 Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee, said, {{Quote
|text=The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace Prize. Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110915025114/http://www.icrs.ugm.ac.id/wednesday-forum-schedule/111-relevance-of-gandhian-philosophy-in-the-21st-century Relevance of Gandhian Philosophy in the 21st century]. icrs.ugm.ac.id</ref>}}

Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been overlooked. An article in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine identified seven people who "never won the prize, but should have". The list consisted of Gandhi, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], [[Sari Nusseibeh]], [[Corazon Aquino]], and [[Liu Xiaobo]].<ref name="Nobel Also Rans"/> Liu Xiaobo would go on to win the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]] while imprisoned.

In 1965, UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time, Chairman [[Gunnar Jahn]] of the Nobel Peace prize committee, lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to [[UNICEF]]. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/peace/lundestad-review/ |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1901–2000 |website=Nobel Foundation |access-date=25 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=U Thant in New York: A Portrait of the Third Secretary-General of the United Nations |first=Rames |last=Nassif |publisher=Hurst |date=31 December 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdUsAAAAMAAJ&q=Nobel+Prize |isbn=978-1850650454 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Joyce]], one of the controversial omissions of the Literature Prize]]
The Literature Prize also has controversial omissions. [[Adam Kirsch]] has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons.

The strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial.<ref name="Levinovitz61">[[#Levinovitz69|Levinovitz]], p. 61</ref> When a prize is awarded to recognise an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators, one or more will miss out. For example, in 2002, the prize was awarded to [[Koichi Tanaka]] and [[John Fenn (chemist)|John Fenn]] for the development of [[mass spectrometry]] in [[protein|protein chemistry]], an award that did not recognise the achievements of [[Franz Hillenkamp]] and [[Michael Karas]] of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]].<ref name="Spinney">{{cite web |last=Spinney |first=Laura |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/20931 |title=News Analysis: Nobel Prize Controversy |work=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |date=4 December 2001 |access-date=28 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Nicholas|last=Dawidoff |title=The Civil Heretic|date= 25 April 2009|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all/ |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=8 June 2010}}</ref> According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics, the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of [[C.

All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion, albeit from different angles. Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction, or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=James |title=UR prof disappointed in Nobel Prize decision |newspaper=[[Democrat and Chronicle]] |location=Rochester, New York |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2013/10/08/ur-prof-disappointed-in-nobel-prize-decision/2941821/ |access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>

Similarly, the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded. The Economics Prize was not awarded to [[Fischer Black]], who died in 1995, when his co-author [[Myron Scholes]] received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with [[Robert C. Merton]], another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year, the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role.

Political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition. [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]], who co-discovered nuclear fission along with [[Otto Hahn]], may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Crawford |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Lewin Sime |first2=Ruth |last3=Walker |first3=Mark |display-authors=1 |title=A Nobel Tale of Postwar Injustice |journal=Physics Today |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=26–32 |year=1997 |doi=10.1063/1.881933 |bibcode=1997PhT....50i..26C }}</ref> The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognised until years later, when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966 [[Enrico Fermi Award]].

===Emphasis on discoveries over inventions===
Alfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded "to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604155708/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html Excerpt from the Will of Alfred Nobel]. nobelprize.org</ref> He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given "to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics". Nobel did not emphasise discoveries, but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg, in papers published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''Technoetic Arts'', have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/448644c |pmid=17687300 |title=Physics Nobels should favour inventions |date=9 August 2007 |last1=Bartneck |first1=Christoph |last2=Rauterberg |first2=Matthias |journal=Nature |volume=448 |issue=7154 |page=644 |bibcode= 2007Natur.448..644B |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1386/tear.6.1.73_1 |title=The asymmetry between discoveries and inventions in the Nobel Prize in Physics |year=2008 |last1=Bartneck |first1=Christoph |last2=Rauterberg |first2=Matthias |journal=Technoetic Arts: A Journal of Speculative Research |volume=6 |page=73 |url=http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2008/nobel/bartneckTechnoeticArts2008.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.145.8130}}</ref>

=== Gender disparity ===
[[File:The Nobel Prize Gender Gap.jpg|thumb|There have been a total of 57 women Nobel laureates compared to 873 male laureates.

{{See also|List of female Nobel laureates}}
In terms of the most prestigious awards in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, only a small proportion have been awarded to women.

==Specially distinguished laureates==

===Multiple laureates===
[[File:Marie Curie 1903.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white portrait of a woman in profile. |[[Marie Curie]], one of four people who have received the Nobel Prize twice (Physics and Chemistry)]]

Four people have received two Nobel Prizes. [[Marie Curie]] received the Physics Prize in 1903 for her work on [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]] and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure [[radium]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/5715220/Marie-Curie-voted-greatest-female-scientist.html |title=Marie Curie voted greatest female scientist |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 July 2009 |access-date=15 January 2010 |location=London}}</ref> making her the only person to be awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. [[Linus Pauling]] was awarded the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the [[chemical bond]] and its application to the [[Chemical structure|structure]] of complex substances. Pauling was also awarded the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons, making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. [[John Bardeen]] received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the [[transistor]] and in 1972 for the theory of [[superconductivity]].<ref name="Feldman180">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 180</ref> [[Frederick Sanger]] received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the [[insulin]] molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA.<ref name="Shalev78">[[#Shalev69|Shalev]], p. 78</ref><ref name="Feldman222">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 222</ref>

Two organizations have received the Peace Prize multiple times. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] received it three times: in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary.<ref name="Abrams84">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 84</ref><ref name="Abrams149">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], p. 149</ref><ref name="Abrams199-200">[[#Abrams|Abrams]], pp. 199–200</ref> The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has been awarded the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981.<ref name="Feldman313">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 313</ref>

===Family laureates===
The [[Curie Family|Curie family]] has received the most prizes, with four prizes awarded to five individual laureates. [[Marie Curie]] received the prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, [[Pierre Curie]], shared the 1903 Physics prize with her.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/curie_marie.shtml |title=Marie Curie (1867–1934) |work=BBC News |access-date=21 January 2010}}</ref> Their daughter, [[Irène Joliot-Curie]], received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]]. In addition, the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, [[Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr.|Henry Labouisse]], was the director of [[UNICEF]] when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 on that organisation's behalf.<ref name="Feldman405">[[#Feldman|Feldman]], p. 405</ref>

Although no family matches the Curie family's record, there have been several with two laureates. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was won by the husband-and-wife team of [[Gerty Cori]] and [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] in 1947 Prize,<ref name="GrinsteinBiermann1997">{{cite book |last1=Grinstein |first1=Louise S. |last2=Biermann |first2=Carol A. |last3=Rose |first3=Rose K. |title=Women in the Biological Sciences: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |url=https://archive.org/details/womeninbiologica00grin |url-access=registration |access-date=25 December 2012 |year=1997 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-29180-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/womeninbiologica00grin/page/108 108]–110}}</ref> and by the husband-and-wife team of [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]] in 2014 (along with [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014 |access-date=28 January 2015 |website=Nobel Fondation}}</ref> The Physics Prize in 1906 was won by [[J.

Two laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. In 1964, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] was awarded the Literature Prize but refused, stating, "A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honourable form."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holt |first=Jim |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2088648/ |title=Exit, Pursued by a Lobster |journal=Slate |date=22 September 2003 |access-date=21 January 2010}}</ref> [[Lê Đức Thọ]], chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the [[Paris Peace Accords]], declined, stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite news |last=English |first=Jason |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/10/06/mf.nobel.odd.facts/index.html |title=Odd facts about Nobel Prize winners |work=[[CNN]] |date=6 October 2009 |access-date=21 January 2010}}</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] attempted to decline the prize money while accepting the 1925 Literature Prize; eventually it was agreed to use it to found the [[Anglo-Swedish Literary Foundation]].<ref>{{cite ODNB |last1=Weintraub |first1=Stanley |title=Shaw, George Bernard (1856–1950), playwright and polemicist |date=3 October 2013 |id=36047  |language=en}}</ref>

During the Third Reich, [[Adolf Hitler]] hindered [[Richard Kuhn]], [[Adolf Butenandt]], and [[Gerhard Domagk]] from accepting their prizes. All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II. In 1958, [[Boris Pasternak]] declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return, the Swedish Academy refused his refusal, saying "this refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award."<ref name="autogenerated4"/> The academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year, holding it back until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf.<ref name="timesonline-292690">{{cite news |last=Franchetti |first=Mark |title=How the CIA won Zhivago a Nobel |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1292690.ece |work=The Times |date=14 January 2007 |access-date=21 January 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite news |last=Finn |first=Peter |title=The Plot Thickens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012601758.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date= 27 January 2007 |access-date=21 January 2010}}</ref>

Being a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that is recognisable worldwide, the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction. This includes films like ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]'' (1963), ''[[Nobel Son]]'' (2007), and ''[[The Wife (2017 film)|The Wife]]'' (2017) about fictional Nobel laureates, as well as fictionalised accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as ''[[Nobel Chor]]'', a 2012 film based on the [[Rabindranath Tagore#Theft of Nobel Prize|theft of Rabindranath Tagore's prize]].<ref name="nobel film screen">{{cite press release |url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/stockholmvisitorsboard/pressreleases/the-nobel-prize-on-the-film-screen-937364 |title=The Nobel Prize: On the film screen |publisher=Stockholm Business Region |date=5 December 2013 |access-date=31 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102825/http://www.mynewsdesk.com/stockholmvisitorsboard/pressreleases/the-nobel-prize-on-the-film-screen-937364 |archive-date=2 April 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Brodesco |first=Alberto|date=2018 |title=Nobel laureates in fiction: From La fin du monde to The Big Bang Theory |journal=Public Understanding of Science |language=en |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=458–470 |doi=10.1177/0963662518766476 |pmid=29720058 |s2cid=19223540|issn=0963-6625}}</ref>
