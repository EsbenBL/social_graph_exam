'''John August List''' (born September 25, 1968) is an American economist at the [[University of Chicago]], where he serves as [[Kenneth C. Griffin]] Distinguished Service Professor; from 2012 until 2018, he served as Chairman of the Department of Economics. List is noted for his pioneering contributions to [[field experiments]] in [[economics]], with Nobel prize winning economist [[George Akerlof]] and noted law professor [[Cass Sunstein]] scribing that "List has done more than anyone else to advance the methods and practice of field experiments."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/editorial-introduction-field-experiments-and-public-policy/8A1A0FB1C9B63F7C00CB61B8C918D65B|doi=10.1017/bpp.2020.16|title=Editorial Introduction: Field experiments and public policy|year=2021|last1=Akerlof|first1=George|last2=Oliver|first2=Adam|last3=Sunstein|first3=Cass|journal=Behavioural Public Policy|volume=5|page=1|s2cid=229355469}}</ref>  As detailed in his [[popular science]] book, ''The Why Axis'' (co-authored with [[Uri Gneezy]]), List uses [[field experiments]] to offer new insights in various areas of economics research, such as education, private provision of public goods, discrimination, social preferences, [[prospect theory]], [[environmental economics]], marketplace effects on corporate and [[government policy]] decisions, gender and inclusion, corporate social responsibility and [[auctions]].

List received his [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]], and his Ph.D. from the [[University of Wyoming]] in 1996. He had his first teaching position at the [[University of Central Florida]], and he then moved to the [[University of Arizona]] and the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where he still holds an adjunct position, before moving to Chicago. List also spends time at [[Tilburg University]], where he is a distinguished visiting scholar and [[Resources for the Future]], where he is a University Distinguished Scholar.  From May 2002 to July 2003 he served as Senior Economist, President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]]. In 2011 List was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |date=April 20, 2011 |title=American Academy of Arts and Sciences elects nine UChicago scholars |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2011/04/20/american-academy-arts-and-sciences-elects-nine-uchicago-scholars }}</ref>  In 2015 he was elected Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] and, according to [[RePEc]], was the top ranked economist worldwide of the 40,000 economists who graduated in the last 20 years. As of March 2021, RePEc ranks him as the 9th most influential economist in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html|title=Economist Rankings}}</ref>

== Career ==
He attended [[Sun Prairie High School]], graduating in 1987.  He went on to become an Academic All-American in golf at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] in 1990 and 1991, while majoring in Economics, graduating in 1992. He received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Wyoming]] in 1996 under supervision of [[Shelby Gerking]]. He began his career at the [[University of Central Florida]] as an assistant professor in 1996.  He became an associate professor in 2000 at the [[University of Arizona]] where he worked with [[Vernon L. Smith]] on furthering his field experimental methods.  In 2001 he was awarded a full professorship at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].  He held that post until 2004, when he received an appointment as a full professor at the Economics Department of the University of Chicago.  In January 2011, List was awarded an endowed professorship at the University of Chicago's Economics Department for his work in the area of field experiments.

In addition to his university career, List served as the chief economist for taxi company [[Uber]], and later for the similar company [[Lyft]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The man who taught Uber how to say sorry |last=Edmonds |first=David |work=BBC News |date=24 October 2020 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-54613947}}</ref>

== Awards ==
In 2015, List was shortlisted for a Nobel Prize by [[Reuters]] (alongside [[Charles Manski]] and [[Richard Blundell]]). List and Blundell were subsequently odds on favorites to win in betting parlors. List for his work on field experiments and Blundell for labor economics. At age 46, List was the youngest Reuters prediction by nearly 20 years.  In April 2011 List was selected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2012, List was selected to receive the Yrjo Jahnsson Lecture Series prize, given by the Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation. The award, given every 2 years by the Finnish Foundation, recognized List's achievements to society from pioneering the use of field experiments. Ten of the previous Nineteen recipients have gone on to win the Nobel Prize in economics.  In August 2017, List was awarded the Klein Prize [[International Economic Review]] for his work on field experiments.  Six of the twenty recipient have won the Nobel Prize.

In November 2014 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Tilburg University. Tilburg University calls him "a true pioneer in experimental field research," whose innovative work has "finally made it possible to test behavioral economic theory in everyday practice...He has raised this research area to a higher level with his originality, expertise, and impact, and he is an inspiration to many."  In 2016, University of Ottawa bestowed the honorary doctorate to List for his pioneering work in field experiments.  In 2011 List was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[4] In 2015 he was elected Fellow of the Econometric Society.

In 2004, List received the 1st Place Competitive Paper Award for his field experiment titled “Informational Cascades: Evidence from a Field Experiment with Market Professionals.” The paper was picked as the top research study in 2004 within finance by the FMA, which considered hundreds of studies. List received the 2008 Arrow Senior Prize for his field experimental work in the area of testing economic theory from the BE Press. In July 2010, List was awarded the highest honor by the AAEA, the John Kenneth Galbraith prize. The award was given for recognition of List's "breakthrough discoveries in economics and outstanding contributions to humanity through leadership, research, and service. In particular, List's pathbreaking work using field experiments in economics."

== Work ==
His work focuses on [[microeconomic]] issues, and includes over 200 academic publications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~jlist/JLIST_CV.pdf|title = John List – Home Page}}</ref>  Among these articles are field experiments using several different markets to obtain data, including charitable [[fundraising]] activities, the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], Costa Rican CEOs, the new automobile market, [[sports memorabilia]] markets, coin markets, auto repair markets, open air markets located everywhere—from the [[United States]] to [[Morocco]] to [[India]], various venues on the internet, several auction settings, shopping malls, various labor markets, and grammar and high schools.

=== Behavioral economics ===
List's research on [[behavioral economics]] has focused on testing theories like [[gift exchange]], [[social preferences]], and [[prospect theory]]. Traditional tests of these theories relied on recruiting undergraduate students to participate in experiments for a small amount of money. List instead recruited subjects in actual marketplaces to participate in experiments, sometimes unbeknownst to even the subjects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Levitt|first1=Steven D.|last2=List|first2=John A.|title=What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal about the Real World?|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=2007|volume=21|issue=2|pages=153–174|jstor=30033722|doi=10.1257/jep.21.2.153|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00480.pdf}}</ref> List's [[field experiments]] have found that [[gift exchange]] is not as powerful a motivator of labor effort as earlier research found,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gneezy|first1=Uri|last2=List|first2=John A.|title=Putting Behavioral Economics to Work: Testing for Gift Exchange in Labor Markets Using Field Experiments|journal=Econometrica|date=2006|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1365–1384|jstor=3805928|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00707.x|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12063.pdf}}</ref> that [[social preferences]] are not as pronounced as prior research found,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=John A.|title=The Behavioralist Meets the Market: Measuring Social Preferences and Reputation Effects in Actual Transactions|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=2006|volume=114|issue=1|pages=1–37|doi=10.1086/498587|jstor=10.1086/498587|citeseerx=10.1.1.599.9754|s2cid=5759503}}</ref> and that the divergence between Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept often called the [[endowment effect]], predicted by [[prospect theory]], disappears with market experience.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=J.

List's recent work in [[behavioral economics]] has found that framing can induce increased worker productivity.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danariely.com/2010/11/04/new-economists-worth-knowing/|title=New Economists worth knowing|date=4 November 2010}}</ref> and has been picked up by several corporations around the world.

=== Environmental economics ===
List has published research on the impact of environmental regulation on economic production<ref>{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=John A.|last2=Millimet|first2=Daniel L.|last3=Fredriksson|first3=Per G.|last4=McHone|first4=W.

=== Charitable giving ===
List has also brought [[social preferences]] and value of [[public goods]] to the marketplace by testing determinants of charitable giving. List has found that a number of the traditional techniques in the philanthropy world are not well understood. For example, the higher the announced [[seed money]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=John A.|last2=Lucking‐Reiley|first2=David|title=The Effects of Seed Money and Refunds on Charitable Giving: Experimental Evidence from a University Capital Campaign|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=1 February 2002|volume=110|issue=1|pages=215–233|doi=10.1086/324392|issn=0022-3808|citeseerx=10.1.1.399.3430|s2cid=2606544}}</ref> the more people give. Also, [[matching funds|matching grants]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Karlan|first1=Dean|last2=List|first2=John A.|title=Does Price Matter in Charitable Giving? Evidence From a Large-Scale Natural Field Experiment|date=June 2006|doi=10.3386/w12338 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 12338 |doi-access=free}}</ref> increase giving, but it doesn't matter if the match is 1:1 or 3:1.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Holly|title=Bigger Matching Gifts Don't Produce More Donors|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~jlist/press/CofPhilanthropy61406.pdf|publisher=University of Chicago}}</ref> List has also found that giving is easily influenced by incentives that discount the importance of altruism in motivating giving. For example, List has found that beauty<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Landry|first1=Craig|last2=Lange|first2=Andreas|last3=List|first3=John A.|last4=Price|first4=Michael K.|last5=Rupp|first5=Nicholas G.|title=Toward an Understanding of the Economics of Charity: Evidence from a Field Experiment|date=September 2005 |doi=10.3386/w11611 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 11611 |doi-access=free}}</ref> and [[social pressure]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DellaVigna|first1=S.|last2=List|first2=J. A.|last3=Malmendier|first3=U.|title=Testing for Altruism and Social Pressure in Charitable Giving|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=1 February 2012|volume=127|issue=1|pages=1–56|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr050|pmid=22448394|language=en|issn=0033-5533|citeseerx=10.1.1.153.2431|s2cid=8389271}}</ref> are important motivators for giving.

Some of his field experimental work on charitable fundraising were highlighted in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes People Give? |date=March 9, 2008 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/magazine/09Psychology-t.html |first=David |last=Leonhardt}}</ref> In a 2009 [[Crain's Chicago Business]] article, List is referred to as a "rock star" in the area of philanthropy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20090822/ISSUE02/100032329/cracking-the-fundraising-code |title=Cracking the fundraising code |last=Le Beau |first=Christina |date=2009-08-22 |work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]] |access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref>

=== Education ===
List's recent research focuses on increasing educational achievement. In 2008 he worked with [[Chicago Heights, IL]] to design cash incentives for ninth graders and their parents to increase academic performance.<ref>{{cite news|url-access=subscription |last1=Staley|first1=Oliver|title=Chicago Economist's 'Crazy Idea' Wins Ken Griffin's Backing|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-23/chicago-economist-s-crazy-idea-for-education-wins-ken-griffin-s-backing|work=Bloomberg.com|date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> In 2009 he won a $10 million grant from the [[Kenneth C. Griffin#Philanthropy|Griffin Foundation]] to study the returns to pre-school education by founding a pre-school called The Griffin Early Childhood Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.griffincenter.org/|title=Welcome griffincenter.org - BlueHost.com|website=www.griffincenter.org}}</ref> and to test the impact of performance pay for teachers in [[Chicago Heights, IL]].<ref>{{cite web |date=October 8, 2009 |title=Anne and Kenneth Griffin Provide $10 Million for Multi-Year Study on School Improvement |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2009/10/08/anne-and-kenneth-griffin-provide-10-million-multi-year-study-school-improvement }}</ref>

List's recent education research was recently discussed in [[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/chicago-economist-s-crazy-idea-for-education-wins-ken-griffin-s-backing.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Oliver | last=Staley | title=Chicago Economist's 'Crazy Idea' Wins Ken Griffin's Backing | date=February 23, 2011}}</ref>

List co-founded and co-directs the Thirty Million Words Center for Early Learning and Public Health along with [[Dana L. Suskind]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tmwcenter.uchicago.edu/tmwcenter/who-we-are/leadership/|title=Leadership|website=TMW|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>

=== Other research ===
List has studied the economics of discrimination, finding that discrimination in marketplaces is [[Statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimination]], rarely motivated by animus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=John A.|title=The Nature and Extent of Discrimination in the Marketplace: Evidence from the Field|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=2004|volume=119|issue=1|pages=49–89|jstor=25098677|doi=10.1162/003355304772839524|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00299.pdf}}</ref> He has also investigated gender differences in competition and wages, finding that men are more likely to apply for jobs that offer incentive pay than women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/DyeHard/men-crave-competition-women-work-play/story?id=12641830|title=Why Do Women Shy From Competitive Jobs?|first=Lee|last=Dye|date=19 January 2011|website=ABC News}}</ref>  He has also researched the role of gender in competition in [[matrilineal]] and [[patriarchal]] societies, finding that women in matrilineal societies opt to compete at similar levels to men in patriarchal societies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gneezy|first1=Uri|last2=Leonard|first2=Kenneth L.|last3=List|first3=John A.|title=Gender Differences in Competition: Evidence from a Matrilineal and a Patriarchal Society |date=January 2008 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 13727 |doi=10.3386/w13727 |doi-access=free}}</ref> List has also used experiments to test ideas in [[finance]]. He has tested the options model,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=John A.|last2=Haigh|first2=Michael S.|title=Investment under Uncertainty: Testing the Options Model with Professional Traders|date=2010|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w16038|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|doi=10.3386/w16038}}</ref> [[information cascades]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alevy|first1=Jonathan E.|last2=Haigh|first2=Michael S.|last3=List|first3=John A.|title=Information Cascades: Evidence from a Field Experiment with Financial Market Professionals|journal=The Journal of Finance|date=2007|volume=62|issue=1|pages=151–180|jstor=4123459|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01204.x|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldexperiments-papers2/papers/00116.pdf}}</ref> and the [[equity premium puzzle]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haigh|first1=Michael S.|last2=List|first2=John A.|title=Do Professional Traders Exhibit Myopic Loss Aversion?

Many of these ideas were advanced by List when he taught at the Finnish School of Finance in 2007 on field experiments in Finance.

== Personal life ==
List married surgeon Dana L. Suskind in 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/1/15/thirty-million-words-co-directors-say-two/|title=From 'Thirty Million Words' to Just Two: I Do|website=www.chicagomaroon.com|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> and resides with his eight children in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]].
