The '''National Academy of Public Administration''' is an academic institution that was founded by [[James E. Webb]], then-administrator of [[NASA]], and other leading public administration practitioners in 1967 and [[congressional charter|chartered]] under [[Title&nbsp;36 of the United States Code]] in 1984 under {{USPL|98|257}}. The Academy is a [[nonprofit]], [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] organization focused on analyzing emerging trends in governance and public administration. It is one of the two organizations (the other being the National Academy of Sciences) chartered by Congress in this manner.  Though the Academy's funding comes primarily from studies that are Congressionally requested or mandated, it is not considered a government agency. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]] The group established the Louis Brownlow Book Award in 1968.<ref>https://www.napawash.org/about-us/award-programs/the-louis-brownlow-book-award</ref>

==Background==
The Academy's studies are directed by a group of over 850 peer-elected fellows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.napawash.org/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=www.napawash.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605095055/http://www.napawash.org/about-us.html|archive-date=2017-06-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> Election to the National Academy is one of the highest honors for those engaged in the study or practice of public administration.  The fellows are responsible for establishing the organization's policies and priorities and serving as advisers on panels, convened for each study, which issue the studies findings and recommendations.

Webb's impetus in forming the Academy was to create an organization that would provide independent, nonpartisan and neutral advice to government leaders and agencies on all levels of government. The Academy provides advice to a variety of organizations including:

* [[United States congressional committee|Various U.S. Congressional Committees]]
* [[U.S. Department of Energy]]
* [[U.S. Government Printing Office]]
* [[U.S. Office of Management and Budget]]
* [[U.S. Department of Defense]]
* [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]
* [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]
* [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]
* [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]]
* [[National Weather Service]]
* [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]
* [[Small Business Administration]]
* [[Federal Aviation Administration]]
* [[University of California]]

To this end, the Academy's Congressional Charter calls on it to:</blockquote>
# Evaluate the structure, administration, operation, and program performance of governments; anticipate, identify, and analyze significant problems; and suggest timely correct action;
# Foresee and examine critical issues in governance; and formulate practical approaches to their resolution;
# Assess the effectiveness, structure, administration, and implications for governance of present or proposed public programs, policies, and processes; and recommend specific changes;
# Advise on relationship of federal, state, regional, and local governments; increase public officials', citizens', and scholars' understanding of requirements and opportunities for sound governance and how these can be effectively met;
# Demonstrate by the conduct of its affairs a commitment to the highest professional standards of ethics and scholarship; and
# Investigate, experiment, and report upon any subject of government whenever called upon by Congress or the federal government.

==Fellows==

The Academy's over 850 fellows are current and former public managers and scholars, business executives and labor leaders, Cabinet officers, members of Congress, governors, mayors, state legislators, and diplomats who provide insight and experience as they oversee Academy projects and provide general guidance. Fellows are also the Academy's primary vehicle for addressing emerging issues and contributing to the intellectual and popular discourse on government. Fellows elect new members of the Academy each year. The principal criterion for selection is a sustained and outstanding contribution to the field of public administration through public service or scholarship.
