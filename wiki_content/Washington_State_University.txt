'''Washington State University''' ('''Washington State''', '''WSU''', or '''Wazzu''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]] in [[Pullman, Washington]]. Founded in 1890, WSU is one of the oldest [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] universities in the American West.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/washington-state-3800/academics|title = Washington State University- Academic life}}</ref> With an undergraduate enrollment of 24,470 and a total enrollment of 29,686, it is the second largest institution for higher education in Washington state behind the [[University of Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://wsac.wa.gov/sites/default/files/KeyFacts2012.pdf|title = Key Facts about Higher Education in Washington|date = 2012|access-date =June 30, 2015|website = Washington Student Achievement Council|publisher = Washington Higher education coordinating board}}</ref> It is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".<ref name="Carnegie">{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=236939 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref> The WSU Pullman campus is perched upon a hill, characterized by open spaces, views, deep green conifers, and a restrained red brick and basalt material palette—materials originally found on site. The university is nestled within the rolling topography of the [[Palouse]] in rural eastern Washington and remains intimately connected to the town, the region, and the landscape in which it sits.<ref>J. Philip Gruen, “Washington State University” [Pullman, Washington], ''SAH Archipedia'', eds. Gabrielle Esperdy and Karen Kingsley, Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012—, http://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/WA-01-075-0008.</ref>

The university also operates branch campuses across Washington known as [[Washington State University Spokane|WSU Spokane]], [[Washington State University Tri-Cities|WSU Tri-Cities]], and [[Washington State University Vancouver|WSU Vancouver]], all founded in 1989. In 2012, WSU launched an Internet-based [[Washington State University Global Campus|Global Campus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalcampus.wsu.edu |title=globalcampus.wsu.edu |publisher=globalcampus.wsu.edu |access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref> which includes its online degree program, WSU Online. In 2015, WSU expanded to a sixth campus, known as [[Washington State University Everett|WSU Everett]]. These campuses award primarily bachelor's and [[master's degrees]]. Freshmen and sophomores were first admitted to the Vancouver campus in 2006 and to the Tri-Cities campus in 2007. Enrollment for the four campuses and WSU Online exceeds 29,686 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wsu.edu/about/facts/|title=Quick Facts - Washington State University}}</ref> This includes 1,751 international students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wsu.edu/about/facts|title=International students come from many different countries|publisher=Wsunews.wsu.edu |access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref>

WSU's athletic teams are called the [[Washington State Cougars|Cougars]] and the [[school colors]] are crimson and gray. Six men's and nine women's varsity teams compete in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] in the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. Both men's and women's indoor track teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

==History==
===Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science===
[[File:Palouse - American Tuscany.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Palouse at [[Steptoe Butte]]]]
Washington State College was established by the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] Legislature on March 28, 1890, less than five months after [[statehood]] as a [[land-grant]] college created under the [[Morrill Act]], signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862.<ref name =WSU1>{{cite web | last = Tate| first = Cassandra| title = Washington State University, Part 1| work = Essay 5701| publisher = HistoryLink| date = February 22, 2004| url = https://historylink.org/File/5701| access-date = June 9, 2019}}</ref>  For the government, the stated mission of land-grant colleges was to teach practical disciplines “related to agriculture and the mechanic arts” for the nations industrial and working classes was supplemented by the [[Hatch Act of 1887]] which called for the establishment of federally-supported [[Agricultural experiment station|agriculture experiment stations]]. In light of this goal, the Washington legislature passed an act for the creation of the ''Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington'' on March 28, 1890 and then was signed into law by the Governor, [[Elisha P. Ferry]].<ref name =WSU1/> However, a second act of legislature expanded the school educational mission to include general arts and sciences. The university and the experiment station would aid enterprise by improving farm management, conducting research, and teaching the skills needed to be better farmers.<ref>{{cite book| last = Stratton| first = David H.| title =Spokane and the Inland Empire: An Interior Pacific Northwest Anthology| publisher = Washington State University Press| location = Pullman, Washington | page= 8| year = 2005| isbn = 978-0-87422-277-7}}</ref> WSU's role as a statewide institution became clear in 1894 with the launch of its first [[agricultural experiment station]] west of the [[Cascade Mountains]] near [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Chesley| first = Frank| title = Washington State Legislature approves the Puyallup Agricultural Experiment Station on March 9, 1891.| work = Essay 8378| publisher = HistoryLink| date = November 25, 2007| url = https://www.historylink.org/File/8378| access-date = June 9, 2019}}</ref>

The site of the land-grant college was to be determined by a three-member committee appointed by the governor according to the legislation, and it stipulated that the site must be located in the southeast corner of the state. After an exhaustive examination of bidding towns such as [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and other towns on the [[wheat]]-growing Palouse region, the state's new land-grant college opened to 59 students in Pullman on January 13, 1892, offering three major courses of study: agriculture, engineering, and domestic science.<ref name =WSU1/> Pullman was possibly selected because of a generous land gift by the city and its railroad connections to Spokane and [[Portland, Oregon]]. A five-member Board of Regents was appointed with [[George W. Lilley]] acting as the school's first President.<ref name =WSU1/> The school started out with a faculty of five, with a student-body largely consisting of children from the surrounding community, who, if they were residents of Washington would have attended tuition-free. The year 1897 saw the first graduating class of seven men and women.<ref>[http://www.wsu.edu/WSU-history/1890.html History by Decade 1890–1899] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721010805/http://www.wsu.edu/WSU-history/1890.html |date=July 21, 2009 }} for Washington State University</ref>

====The Bryan years====
[[Enoch Albert Bryan]], appointed July 22, 1893 and serving for 22 years, was the first influential president of WSU and considered by many as the true founder of the university.<ref name =WSU1/> Bryan previously served as the president of [[Vincennes University]] in Indiana and was an alumnus of [[Indiana University]] and held a graduate degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. When Bryan learned he was nominated for the presidency by a friend in Oregon, he had never even heard of the college. Before Bryan's arrival, the fledgling university suffered through significant organizational instability. Under Bryan's term as president, the curriculum included both a practical and liberal arts component, where chemistry, mathematics as well as history, English literature and two foreign languages were core courses, required for graduation regardless of major.<ref name =WSU1/> Under Bryan, music and art held importance too, in 1905 he gained the approval of the Board of Regents for a School of Music. Bryan guided the college toward respectability and is arguably the most influential figure in the university's history. The landmark clock tower in the center of campus is his namesake. As the college approached the end of its first decade of existence, Bryan and others tried to garner the necessary support to change the name of the school, which resulted in the introduction of a bill to change the school name to “Washington State College” in 1899. This and similar efforts in 1901 and 1903 were defeated with strong opposition for attempting to create another state university which would undermine the clout of the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle. However, in 1905 the school was finally able to officially change its name to the “State College of Washington” or more informally as ''Washington State College'' (WSC).<ref name =WSU1/>

===Washington State College===
[[Ernest O. Holland]] succeeded Enoch Bryan as President of the Washington State College in 1915.<ref name =WSU1/> That same year, a close friend of his whom he shared a room with while studying at Columbia University, [[Henry Suzzallo]], became the President of the University of Washington. Holland's early years as president and friendship with Suzzallo would be challenged during his tenure as president. In 1909, the institutional rivalry between WSC and UW worsened when state legislators, the majority of which held seats in western Washington, were dismayed to find a foreign language department, an English Department headed by a Harvard-educated PhD, a school of architecture, and many departments with graduate students. The legislative committee promptly advised demoting the college to “trade school” status, an idea which Suzzallo supported.<ref name =WSU1/> Suzzallo penned a letter to Holland promising to make WSC “the greatest school of agriculture in the world” only if Holland agreed to abandon all other disciplines to UW; Suzzallo's proposal specifically sought to shut down WSC's schools of architecture and pharmacy.<ref name =WSU1/> After years of wrangling, the Washington legislature decided against limiting the academic mission and scope of WSC.<ref name =WSU1/> The two presidents and their respective institutions would continue to have a row over curriculum and state appropriations until Suzzallo  was relieved of his position in 1926 due to the influence of Washington governor, [[Roland H. Hartley]].<ref name =WSU1/> In trying to outdo his former peer at UW, Holland wanted to build a library that rivaled the grandness of the newly built [[Suzzallo Library|library]] at UW that bears Suzzallo's name. Funding for the Holland Library was delayed by the state however until 1950.

[[File:WSU 1925 thompson-bryan halls.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Thompson and Bryan Halls in 1925]]

Budgetary woes hit WSC in the [[Great Depression]] years starting in the 1930s. The budget, faculty, salaries, and enrollment slumped dramatically. Enrollment didn't reach pre-Depression levels until 1936 and salaries until 1937 in nominal terms.<ref name =WSU1/> With the start of [[World War II]], the Washington State College was contracted by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to house and train the [[Army Signal Corps]] where they were given pre-flight school training and lessons in [[Japanese language]]. The college hosted as many as 1,900 military personnel in the vacated dormitories and fraternities.<ref name =WSU2>{{cite web | last = Tate| first = Cassandra| title = Washington State University, Part 2| work = Essay 5704| publisher = HistoryLink| date = May 26, 2004| url = https://historylink.org/File/5704| access-date = June 9, 2019}}</ref> It was during this time in 1944 however, when WSC saw the exciting introduction of the [[Cougar Gold cheese|Cougar Gold]] brand of sharp white cheddar cheese from the campus creamery. The cheese was developed and gets its namesake from dairy bacteriologist Dr. N.S. Golding who was studying molds for cheese production.<ref name =WSU2/> After the war ended and the passing of the [[G.I. Bill]], the college went from having virtually no men on campus to being inundated with them. The school had to scramble to accommodate the former servicemen by buying migrant housing and using temporary housing units provided by the federal government.<ref name =WSU2/> The campus became so crowded, that President [[Wilson Compton (academic)|Wilson Compton]] mulled moving the college to Spokane, but in 1947, he ultimately figured that it would be too impractical.

===Washington State University===

On September 1, 1959, the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] passed a bill unopposed that officially changed the name to ''Washington State University''.<ref name =WSU2/><ref name=nrokffn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JP1XAAAAIBAJ&pg=5907%2C481257 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=New name for WSC near O.K. |date=February 4, 1959 |page=2}}</ref><ref name=nnfsc >{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1gFYAAAAIBAJ&pg=5197%2C1025216 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=New name near for State College |date=August 5, 1959 |page=18 }}</ref> The maturing university partly owed the success of this to the establishment of the WSU Honors College, which is one of the oldest in the nation and a highly respected university program for gifted students.<ref name =WSU2/> The university joined the [[Athletic Association of Western Universities]] in 1962, which included the University of Washington, and four other universities in California at the time.<ref name =WSU2/> In an effort to improve the graduate program and research credentials of WSU, a low-grade nuclear reactor was constructed, funded by [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] grants, and new doctoral programs were introduced.

By the 1970s, WSU's enrollment quadrupled from its level in the 1940s to 14,000 students with an influx from the [[Baby Boom Generation]]. President [[Glenn Terrell]] took steps to increase funding for undergraduate and graduate education amid the nationwide recession of the mid 1970s. Terrell didn't make any major cuts to the athletics department however, which didn't go unnoticed and was a cause for anger about his leadership among some of the faculty.<ref name =WSU2/>

====State-wide university====
Beginning with the start of [[Samuel H. Smith (educator)|Samuel H. Smith]]’s term as President in 1985, marked a large period of growth for WSU. In 1989, WSU gained branch campuses in [[Spokane]], the [[Tri-Cities of Washington|Tri-Cities]], and [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] with established extension offices and research centers in all regions of the state, with facilities in [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]] and [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]].<ref name =WSU2/><ref>{{cite web | last = Gibson| first = Elizabeth| title = Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center, WSU Prosser| work = Essay 7684| publisher = HistoryLink| date = April 18, 2006| url = https://www.historylink.org/File/7684| access-date = June 9, 2019}}</ref> Smith proved to be a consummate fundraiser, with about $760 million raised during his term, thanks in some part to [[Microsoft]] co-founder and alumnus [[Paul Allen]].<ref name =WSU2/> In the 1990s Smith began to clamp down and take action regarding [[Alcohol abuse among college students|student alcohol abuse]] and disciplinary issues after some high-profile incidents on campus in an effort to improve the university's image. The efforts seemed to have paid off when WSU lost its rank and was completely excluded from ''[[The Princeton Review]]''’s [[party school]] list in August 2000.<ref name =WSU2/> Improving the quality of education was the defining goal of the university under [[V. Lane Rawlins]], who raised admission requirements and sought to improve the academic profile of the school with improved curricula and research facilities. After Rawlins retired in 2006, [[Elson Floyd]] succeeded him as president. Under Floyd's leadership, increasing the diversity of the student body and continuing to raise the stature and reach of the university were a focus. In his eight years as president, WSU enrollment figures went up by 17 percent, including a 12.5 percent increase in the number of students of color, the amount of research grants awarded to WSU tripled to $600 million a year, and he led expansions in all of WSU's branch campuses-most notably successfully campaigning for the creation of the public medical school that now bears his name at [[Washington State University Spokane|WSU - Spokane]], the [[Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite news| last = Long| first = Katherine| title = At WSU, superstar president has fourth-highest salary for nation's public colleges| newspaper = The Seattle Times| date = June 7, 2015| url = https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/at-wsu-superstar-president-has-highflying-salary-fourth-in-nation-states-highest/| access-date = June 9, 2019}}</ref> The second public medical school in Washington, and only one of three in the state, is seen as key to the university's organizational mission as a state land-grant university and its ambitions as a research university.

==Campus==
[[File:Washington State University.jpg|thumb|250px|WSU campus from the northwest]]
The [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] campus of Washington State University is {{convert|620|acre|km2}} and is in the [[Palouse]] region. The average [[elevation]] of the campus is approximately {{convert|2500|ft|-1}} above [[sea level]], and is {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} west of the [[Idaho]] border and [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], home of the [[University of Idaho]], also a land-grant institution. The university communities are connected by [[Washington State Route 270|Highway 270]] and the [[Bill Chipman Palouse Trail]].

The Palouse is defined by its unique rolling hills that were created by wind-blown soil, which supports one of the world's most productive dry-land agricultural regions. The main crops are wheat, [[peas]], [[barley]], and [[lentils]]. Evenings are often highlighted by a spectacular blue-pink sunset, which the first Board of Regents decided to use as the college's colors (later changed to the current crimson and gray colors). Perched atop College Hill (one of the four main hills in Pullman), the campus overlooks downtown Pullman.

===Built environment===
[[File:WSU Thompson hall.jpg|Thompson Hall (1894), known as the Administration Building<br />until renamed in 1972<ref name=wsubldghist>{{cite news|url=http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/MASC/buildings.html|publisher=Washington State University Libraries|title=History of WSU buildings|access-date=August 22, 2012|archive-date=February 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222045402/http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/masc/buildings.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>|thumb]]
Campus architecture is diverse, but its prevailing image is perhaps best characterized by a handful of red-brick buildings in the older campus core designed in a neo-Georgian or Renaissance Revival mode, many of which were constructed between the world wars.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://research.libraries.wsu.edu/xmlui/handle/2376/5280|title=Historic Resource Survey and Analysis|first1=Weddell|last1=James|first2=Washington State University. Task Force for Historic Preservation on the Historic Core of The Washington State|last2=University|date=February 12, 1985}}</ref>  Yet WSU was hardly immune to modernist, "international style" trends of the post-[[World War II]] period, and features some notable examples of the type, particularly the [[Regents Hill]] dormitory complex, designed by [[Paul Thiry (architect)|Paul Thiry]], on the north side of campus. By the 1990s, the university began to encourage eye-catching designs, including a 1994 addition to the old Holland Library (now called Terrell Library), by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now [[ZGF Architects LLP]]) with a curving sweep of windows and a cone-shaped skylight above its atrium; an amenity-filled recreation center with a massive jacuzzi and fireplace in 2001; and the Samuel H. Smith Center for Undergraduate Education, or "CUE," named for WSU president Smith, who served from 1985–2000.  The latter two buildings were designed by Yost Grube Hall of Portland.

The busiest part of campus is the [[Glenn Terrell]] Friendship Mall, referred to as "the mall" by students. This walkway, which prior to the 1970s was a road with parking available along the sides, was named after  Terrell, WSU's president from 1967 to 1985. His secretary was known to set meetings ten minutes behind schedule to make up for the time he would spend talking to students along the way. The library complex (Terrell and Holland Libraries), the student union (Compton Union Building),<ref name=expcub>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=77RWAAAAIBAJ&pg=7421%2C3037192 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |title=Expanded CUB reopens on campus |date=January 10, 1969 |page=10}}</ref> and three academic buildings surround the mall. The new crimson-colored cube that distinguishes the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art is slated to open in the spring of 2018, just across from the club seating entrance to the football stadium.

The [[Washington State Cougars football|football]] venue, [[Martin Stadium]], named after Governor [[Clarence D.

The first project, called the Southside Project,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpd.wsu.edu/CapitalProjects/MartinStadium/ProjectDetails.aspx?Value=8 |title=The Cougar Football Project &#124; Capital Planning and Development |publisher=Cpd.wsu.edu |date=November 26, 2012 |access-date=June 19, 2013 |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124162753/http://www.cpd.wsu.edu/CapitalProjects/MartinStadium/ProjectDetails.aspx?Value=8 |url-status=dead }}</ref> would replace the old press box on the south stands with a new structure that includes a new press box, club seats, loge boxes, luxury suites and a club room. The Southside Project is now finished and was completed in November 2012. The second project, originally called the "West End-Zone Project" and now the Football Operations Building, provides a home for the Cougar football program, and includes new weight, locker, equipment. and training rooms for players, in addition to meeting rooms and coaches' offices. It also features a WSU Football heritage area along the west side and a game-day home for Gray W former letter winners.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Other notable buildings include Thompson Hall (1895), Stevens Hall (1896), the Math Learning Annex (1908), and [[Bryan Hall (Washington State University)|Bryan Hall]] (1909),<ref name=his74fto>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ou9LAAAAIBAJ&pg=6989%2C4430755 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=(photo) |title=Historic buildings at Washington State University retain original appearance |date=December 29, 1974 |page=1 }}</ref> the university's oldest surviving buildings which help enclose a sloping quadrangle featuring a massive oak tree planted from a seedling brought more than a century ago from [[New England]]. Thompson Hall, with its distinctive turrets and its resemblance to a chateau in the Loire Valley of France, was the original administration building, and "Administration Building" is still carved above the original west-facing entrance. Today, Thompson Hall is home to the foreign language department and also provides the administrative offices for the College of Arts and Sciences. Bryan Hall is perhaps the most noticeable building on campus, with its tall four-sided tower enclosing a carillon and displaying a clock that lights up neon-red in the evening. Stevens Hall is an all-women's dormitory pitched with many gables. Stevens Hall and Thompson Hall are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and both were designed by the Seattle firm of Stephen & Josenhans.<ref name=wsubldghist/>

Also significant are the Lewis Alumni Centre and the Webster Physical Science Building. The alumni center is an old beef cattle barn dating from the 1920s that was thoroughly transformed in the 1980s into event space and offices for the WSU Alumni Association. Rooms in the alumni center include the Board of Regents' Boardroom, Lighty Library, the Athletics Hall of Fame, the Alumni Presidents' Room, and the "Great Hall" for large social events on the second floor. Webster Hall, completed in 1974 and designed by the Seattle-based architectural firm of Naramore, Bain, Brady, and Johanson [[(NBBJ)]] is the tallest building on campus with twelve above-ground floors of offices and an expansive view of the region from a lounge on the northwest side of the top floor.

From 1911 to 1923, [[Rudolph Weaver]] was the first chairman of the architecture department. He designed seven buildings on the WSU campus, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/holland/masc/finders/ua239.htm |title=History of Office of University Architect |publisher=Wsulibs.wsu.edu |date=June 1, 1935 |access-date=January 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Residential campus===
[[File:StimsonHallWSU.jpg|thumb|right|Stimson Hall (1922)<ref name=wsubldghist/>]]
WSU is a residential campus. Many freshmen live in residence halls, while some live in fraternity and sorority houses or in off-campus housing. After their first year, many students move to apartments, several owned by WSU. Most apartments are less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|1|adj=on}} <!-- {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|adj=on|spell=in}} --> from campus. Off-campus housing is broken into two sections that are commonly known by students: College Hill and Apartment Land.  College Hill houses many members of the Greek community who no longer live-in their fraternity/sorority houses, and are commonly known as "live-outs".

===Residence halls===
A number of the residence halls are [[coed|co-ed]], but there are single-gender living environments as well as a variety of other living options that include age-restricted housing, a mix of domestic and international students, and a global learning community. All of the residence halls, except for McEachern, are part of the [[Residence Hall Association|RHA]] (Residence Hall Association).

Residence halls on campus include:
*The Hill Halls: Community/Duncan-Dunn, [[Elmina White Honors Hall|Honors]], [[Virgil T. McCroskey|McCroskey]], Wilmer-Davis and Stevens
*The Northside Halls: [[Regents Hill]], [[Scott/Coman Hall|Scott/Coman]], Streit-Perham, Northside, and Global Scholars (opened in fall of 2015)
*The South Central Halls: Gannon-Goldsworthy, Stimson and Waller
*The Upper Division Halls: Rogers, Orton and McEachern
*The Complex: Stephenson East, Stephenson North and Stephenson South

Each hall has its own government which organizes events, manages its budget, and acts as a forum for student involvement. These halls range in size from the exclusive Stevens Hall (approximately 70 residents), to the massive Stephenson Complex (approximately 1200 residents total). The highlight of the year for the residence halls is often [[Homecoming]] Week when the residence halls, off-campus students, and [[Fraternities and sororities|Greeks]] compete in various events. Events such as the chariot race determine the winner of Homecoming Week. In the past decade, the winner of Homecoming Week has most often been a residence hall team. In 2008, the Residence Halls swept Homecoming. Waller/Wilmer-Davis/Stevens took first, Scott-Coman took second and Stimson/Regents took third.

===Greek life===
There are currently 27 [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]] in the Interfraternity Council, 14 sororities in the Panhellenic Council, 14 fraternities and sororities in the United Greek Association, and 10 fraternities and sororities in the National Panhellenic Council at Washington State University. There are 26 primarily residential fraternities and 14 primary residential sororities that are located on College Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/how-to-join/ |title=How to Join &#124; Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life at WSU |publisher=Gogreek.wsu.edu |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> [[Kappa Sigma]] is the oldest national fraternity at WSU with a founding date in 1909 and [[Alpha Delta Pi]] was the first sorority at WSU with a founding date in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wsm.wsu.edu/ourstory/index.php?title=A_Century_of_Greek_Life_at_WSU |title=A Century of Greek Life at WSU - Our Story |publisher=Wsm.wsu.edu |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> The average chapter size of the community organizations is 64 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/our-community/facts-and-figures/ |title=Facts and Figures &#124; Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life at WSU |publisher=Gogreek.wsu.edu |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Between 25-30 percent of undergraduate students are in the [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]] annually.<ref>[http://cub.wsu.edu/myFiles/CUB_community_guide4.pdf CUB Community Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531193330/http://cub.wsu.edu/myFiles/CUB_community_guide4.pdf |date=May 31, 2010 }} "Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life," pages 8–9</ref> Greek affiliates have the highest GPA on WSU's campus, averaging 3.2 for sorority women and 2.97 for fraternity men based on figures from Spring 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/media/429252/wsu-fall-2018-grade-report.pdf |title=Listing |website=gogreek.wsu.edu |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Individuals join houses by going through recruitment, often a week at the beginning of one or both semesters where chapter members hold events to meet potential new members. Washington State University has a zero tolerance policy on [[hazing]] both potential new members and current members. Each year Greek chapters submit 6 Pillars of Excellence, each pillar representing a value of Greek Life at WSU, and do reports at the end of the year as a self-evaluation for each chapter. Washington State University "recognizes the right of each fraternity and sorority to create policies and regulations of internal governance, as long as said policies do not conflict with those described in this document or any of its appendices."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogreek.wsu.edu/current-students/relationship-agreements/ |title=Relationship Agreements &#124; Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life at WSU |publisher=Gogreek.wsu.edu |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>

===College Hill===
Greek Row is situated on College Hill just downhill from Bryan Hall and the Hill Halls (the historic single-gender dormitories) on the WSU campus, and among the homes of faculty, Greek live-outs, and apartment buildings. The Greek Row and College Hill area is a diverse community of students, faculty members, and families. College Hill is also home to the President of WSU, [[Kirk Schulz]]. College Hill is supported by The College Hill Association, whose mission envisions a vibrant, diverse, and improving community that welcomes all residents and values the historic character of the neighborhood. Restaurants, thrift stores and various bars line Colorado Street, the main street on College Hill.  The bars on College Hill include Cougar Cottage (informally, the Coug), currently in its 87th year of operation, Valhalla (informally, V-Hall), and Stubblefield's (informally, Mike's); all boast a large number of customers on the weekends as well as many themed weekdays.

===Recreation and the outdoors===
The university has the {{convert|160000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Student Recreation Center (SRC), which was the largest student recreation center in the United States when it was opened in 2001.<ref>Brailsford & Dunlavey [http://www.facilityplanners.com/portfolio//wash_state_u/recreation97/ Washington State University Recreation Center Feasibility Analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113160600/http://www.facilityplanners.com/portfolio/wash_state_u/recreation97/ |date=November 13, 2007 }} Retrieved on November 27, 2007</ref> The SRC contains a {{convert|1/8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} elevated indoor track, four basketball courts, two volleyball courts, roller hockey rink, four racquetball courts, swimming pool, 50-person jacuzzi, free weights, weight machines, cardio equipment, exercise instruction rooms, outdoor sand volleyball courts, and a low to high ropes course. The campus also has several other basketball courts, dance rooms, a climbing wall, and the Outdoor Recreation Center where students can check out equipment or register for various events and trips. The {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} [[Bill Chipman Palouse Trail]] links [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] with [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] and links to the Latah Trail to [[Troy, Idaho|Troy]], {{convert|22|mi}} from WSU. Another bike trail wraps around the Pullman campus (about {{convert|8|mi|km|disp=or|spell=in}} long). The school has an intramural program, and club sports are also very popular on campus. The university also has The Chinook, a 69,000 square foot space designed for students. It features fitness facilities, study spaces, social spaces for events, and Freshens Fresh Food Studio.

The campus added a {{convert|7305|yd|adj=on}} championship golf course in 2008; Palouse Ridge, a $12.3 million project, opened on August 29. It intends to improve the school's golf teams, provide a laboratory for students in turf grass courses, and give boosters and alumni a new reason to visit the campus. From the back tees (Crimson), the course rating is 75.9 with a slope rating of 140.<ref name=prslope>{{cite web|url=http://ncrdb.usga.org/NCRDB/courseTeeInfo.aspx?CourseID=3894|title=Course Rating and Slope Database™ Palouse Ridge|access-date=August 22, 2012}}</ref> It replaces a sub-standard 9-hole course that was built in 1923 and was mostly unimproved. It closed in 2006 for the redesign to create Palouse Ridge, on the same site and adjacent land. The [[University of Idaho Golf Course|UI Golf Course]] in Moscow also offers student rates. It opened in 1937 and added its second nine in 1970; the back tees are at {{convert|6637|yd}}, with a course rating of 72.4 and a slope rating of 135.<ref name=usgaui>{{cite web|url=http://ncrdb.usga.org/NCRDB/courseTeeInfo.aspx?CourseID=3976|publisher=USGA|title=Course Rating and Slope Database™: UIGC|access-date=August 22, 2012}}</ref>

Within {{convert|35|mi}}, many students have the option to hike at [[Kamiak Butte]] and [[Steptoe Butte]]. Moscow Mountain, at {{convert|4983|ft}} in the Palouse Range in Idaho, provides opportunities for hiking and mountain biking. For aquatic adventures, students can cliff jump or boat at the [[Snake River]]. Farther out, white-river rafting, downhill skiing, and hiking in the nearby foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] are available. WSU formerly operated its own alpine ski area in Idaho, the [[North-South Ski Bowl]], which was sold in the early 1980s.

===Arboretum and Botanical Garden===
The WSU Arboretum Committee continues to develop an Arboretum and Botanical Garden on a hilltop adjacent to the Lewis Alumni Center. In addition, about {{convert|95|acre|ha}} on the east edge of campus has been identified for a more expansive Arboretum and Botanical Garden, including a wildlife center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arboretum.wsu.edu/resources_assets/WSU%20Arboretum%20Proposal.pdf |title=WSU Arboretum Proposal, retrieved November 2009 |access-date=November 20, 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531184042/http://www.arboretum.wsu.edu/resources_assets/WSU%20Arboretum%20Proposal.pdf |archive-date=May 31, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> Students interested in contributing to the development of the WSU Arboretum are working with the Native Plant & Landscape Restoration Nursery to help establish tree plantings, future habitat restoration sites, or native plant displays that may be part of a campus green belt design.

===Environmental record and sustainability initiatives===

====Energy use on campus====

WSU has one LEED-silver certified building on campus, and two more buildings that meet LEED-silver standards but are not certified. The university has also encouraged the use of energy efficient lighting, energy management systems, and insulating steam lines, to reduce wasted power.<ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card">{{cite web|last=The College Sustainability Report Card|title=Washington State University- Green Report Card 2011|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/washington-state-university|access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref>

====Energy profile====

WSU's energy is generated in part by an on-campus steam plant, powered by natural gas with diesel fuel back-up.  This accounts for 38% of carbon emissions, or 53,922 metric tonnes eCO2 out of 136,166 metric tons total.  The remaining carbon emissions is predominantly the result of purchased electricity (52%), with less than 10% the result of commuting, air travel, refrigerant leaks, and waste incineration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington State University|title=Climate Action Plan|url=http://sustainability.wsu.edu/File/WSU_PullmanClimateActionPlan.pdf|access-date=April 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116185742/http://sustainability.wsu.edu/File/WSU_PullmanClimateActionPlan.pdf|archive-date=January 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The university has committed to lowering carbon emissions 36% below 2005 levels by 2035, though thus far emission levels have remained relatively flat.<ref>{{cite web|last=American College and University President's Climate Commitment|title=Progress Report for Washington State University- Pullman|url=http://rs.acupcc.org/progress/272/|access-date=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928094439/http://rs.acupcc.org/progress/272/|archive-date=September 28, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

WSU is active in clean energy research,<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington State University|title=Clean Technology|url=http://cleantech.wsu.edu/}}</ref> though the campus does not currently have any renewable energy installations.<ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card"/>

====Energy investments====

WSU does not currently commit to establishing a committee or policy that supports climate and sustainability shareholder proposals at companies where the endowment funds are invested.<ref>{{cite web|last=American College and University President's Climate Challenge|title=Implentation Profile for Washington State University|url=http://rs.acupcc.org/ip/779/|access-date=April 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928094437/http://rs.acupcc.org/ip/779/|archive-date=September 28, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The university is exploring investing in renewable energy, but otherwise is focused on optimizing investment returns. Proxy voting is not possible due to the fact the endowment fund is entirely invested in comingled investment vehicles.<ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card"/>

====Sustainability====

The university promotes on-campus sustainability primarily though the Sustainability and Environment Committee<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington State University|title=Campus Sustainability|url=http://sustainability.wsu.edu/|access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> and the ASWSU Environmental Task Force.  Undergraduates who have an idea to improve campus sustainability can apply for funding from the Cougar Green Fund, which is funded by an optional $5 student fee. WSU also provides a free [[Bicycle sharing system|bikeshare]] system through its Greenbike program.

===Museums and collections===

===Research===
[[File:Homer J. Dana Hall - Washington State University - IMG 7040.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Homer J. Dana Hall (1948),<ref name=wsubldghist/><br />College of Engineering and Architecture]]

According to the [[National Science Foundation]], WSU spent $360 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 71st in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Table 20. Higher education R&D expenditures, ranked by FY 2018 R&D expenditures: FYs 2009–18 |url=https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/herd/2018/html/herd18-dt-tab020.html |website=ncsesdata.nsf.gov |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref>

Research and scholarship at WSU is rooted in agriculture, natural for a land-grant university. The institution's first leader, [[George W. Lilley]] (1891–1892), was both president of the then-named Washington Agricultural College and School of Science and director of the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station. Subjects taught by the first five faculty members included agriculture, botany, horticulture, forestry, and veterinary science.

In 1894, the sixth faculty member, [[William Jasper Spillman]], arrived to teach plant science and mathematics and serve as the first wheat [[plant breeding|breeder]].<ref>[http://www.cahe.wsu.edu/overview/cahnrs-history.pdf College History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530160441/http://cahe.wsu.edu/overview/cahnrs-history.pdf |date=May 30, 2010 }} WSU College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences</ref> The WSU wheat research and breeding program continues to serve the Washington wheat industry, the sixth largest industry in the nation in 2008–2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admin.aghost.net/images/E0177801/2008WF4WebSmHomepage.pdf |title=Washington Wheat Facts 2008–2009 |access-date=January 28, 2012}}</ref> The state's wheat growers work closely with WSU researchers on development of new wheat varieties that meet their needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/reportertools/news/2007/wheat-directions-2007-07.html |title=Wheat Variety Development at Washington State University |publisher=cahnrsnews.wsu.edu |date=July 12, 2007 |access-date=January 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/reportertools/news/2009/wheat-vars-2009-04.html|title=CAHNRS News - Washington State University|website=cahnrsnews.wsu.edu}}</ref>

The university's food and agriculture research helps sustain the state's annual $29 billion food industry. Faculty partnered with agriculture interests to create today's $3&nbsp;billion a year [[Vitis vinifera|wine grape]] business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winegrapes.wsu.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981212022231/http://winegrapes.wsu.edu/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 1998 |title=Viticulture and Enology at Washington State University |publisher=Winegrapes.wsu.edu |access-date=January 28, 2012 }}</ref> The Apple Genome Project draws collaboration from scientists worldwide to map the apple genome, research aimed at supporting the apple industry.

Food science is another long-time research field at WSU. Work in the 1940s on types of cheese suitable for storing in cans or tins led to creation of now award-winning [[Cougar Gold cheese]], a white [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] produced at the WSU Creamery with milk from the university's dairy herd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/creamery/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011082757/http://www.wsu.edu/creamery/history.htm|title=History of WSU Creamery and Cougar Gold cheese|archive-date=October 11, 2007}}</ref> In 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the use of microwave energy for producing pre-packaged, low-acid foods, and WSU professor Juming Tang led development of the technology by university, industry and U.S. military scientists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsutoday.wsu.edu/Pages/Publications.asp?Action=Detail&PublicationID=16621&PageID= |title=FDA approves researcher's food-preserving process |publisher=Wsutoday.wsu.edu |date=October 29, 2009 |access-date=June 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624010219/http://wsutoday.wsu.edu/Pages/Publications.asp?Action=Detail&PublicationID=16621&PageID= |archive-date=June 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In terms of productivity, WSU plant sciences faculty rank No.&nbsp;2 in the nation, animal sciences faculty rank fourth, and food science faculty rank sixth according to Academic Analytics' 2007 ''Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index''.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/stats/productivity/ "Top Research Universities Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index,"] ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', January 12, 2007, vol. 53, Issue 19, page A12</ref> In addition, WSU agricultural studies have helped shape U.S. public policy by showing how [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices sidestep the environmental hazards of conventional agriculture. The Climate Friendly Farming project helps farmers adopt methods that mitigate global climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cff.wsu.edu/ |title=Climate Friendly Farming at Washington State University |publisher=Cff.wsu.edu |access-date=January 28, 2012}}</ref> Research in agriculture is a strength for WSU, where the university has led in research and development funding from the US Department of Agriculture.<ref>{{cite news| last = Weaver| first = Matthew| title =  WSU tops nation in USDA research funding| newspaper = Capital Press| date =March 19, 2019| url = https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/research/wsu-tops-nation-in-usda-research-funding/article_4e4dbc60-4765-11e9-89f1-9b5908dcc6d5.html | access-date = June 9, 2019}}</ref>

Veterinary medicine and animal health are also important research areas at WSU. In 2008, a $25&nbsp;million grant from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] funded a large share of the cost for a research facility for a new WSU School for Global Animal Health. Its scientists address global infectious disease challenges by detecting diseases within animal populations and controlling their transmission. The Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at WSU works closely with the [[US Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to develop and deploy diagnostic tests for livestock diseases.

In the area of [[clean technology|clean technologies]], university researchers work to raise the efficiency and reliability of the nation's [[electrical power grid]], improve air quality forecasting in the Northwest, and conduct cooperative research projects under the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI). Scholars are developing an algae-based [[biofuel]] that consumes [[greenhouse gas]]es in its production and are working to patent nanospring technology that would fit into an ordinary gas tank, solving the problem of [[hydrogen storage]]. In 2001, WSU professor M. Grant Norton and [[University of Idaho]] physics professor David McIlroy were the first scientists to create nanosprings.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1400079| bibcode = 2001ApPhL..79.1540M| title = Nanosprings| journal = [[Applied Physics Letters]]| volume = 79| issue = 10| page = 1540| year = 2001| last1 = McIlroy | first1 = D.

WSU is also home to one of the few remaining nuclear research reactors in the country. The Nuclear Radiation Center is a 1&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] TRIGA conversion reactor built in 1961 during [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's]] [[Atoms for Peace]] initiative. It is a very potent research tool utilized by WSU's [[radiochemistry]] graduate program, as well as providing education on the nuclear industry to the public through talks and facility tours.

Other recent research highlights include studies of the effects of sleep and sleep loss on human cognitive functioning, work to advance shock compression science with contracts awarded to the WSU Institute for Shock Physics by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and the department of energy, and a program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] that trains doctoral students to analyze evolutionary processes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Reproductive biologist Patricia A. Hunt was named one of the top 50&nbsp;researchers of 2007 by ''[[Scientific American]]'' for her work showing a potential threat to human health posed by [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), a component of the polycarbonate plastics used to make food and beverage containers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Alan |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sciam-50-2007 |title=SciAm 50, Scientific American January 2008 |publisher=Scientificamerican.com |date=December 15, 2008 |access-date=January 28, 2012}}</ref>

Over the years, WSU research and scholarship included the 1968 discovery of the [[Marmes Man]] at the Marmes Rockshelter in southeastern Washington, the nation's oldest human remains at that time; the development of [[Orville Vogel|high-yielding dwarf wheat]]; discovery of insect resistance to pesticides; and creation of a method to store cheese in tins, which led to the university's well known and still produced Cougar Gold Cheese.<ref>[http://wsm.wsu.edu/s/index.php?id=789 Big Ideas from WSU], ''Washington State Magazine'', Summer 2010</ref> WSU fruit breeders have developed many varieties for the state including, in 1952, the sweet, yellow [[Rainier cherry]], and in 2010 an apple specifically for Washington, named [[Cosmic Crisp]].<ref>[http://wsm.wsu.edu/s/index.php?id=803 WSU Big Ideas, Discoveries, Creations], ''Washington State Magazine'', Summer 2010</ref>

Student life on WSU's Pullman campus is influenced by a variety of student organizations and their committees. Open to all students, they create educational, entertaining and cultural programming for WSU students and the local community. Committees include Asian Pacific American Student Coalition (APASC), Black Student Union (BSU), Environmental Sustainability Alliance (ESA), Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), International Students' Council (ISC), Ku Ah Mah, KZUU Radio, Middle Eastern Students Association (MESA), Movimiento Estudianti Chicano de Aztian (MEChA), Student Legal Services (SLS), Veteran's Student Committee, and GIVE on the Pullman Campus. There are also more than 300 registered student organisations (RSOs) that cover many interests. All ASWSU committees are members of "Committee Squared," the coalition of all ASWSU Committee leaders. ASWSU also consists of the President and Vice President who oversee the Executive Staff. The staff consists of a variety of directors and assistant directors advancing student causes via student life, diversity affairs, campus life, and others. The 23-member Senate represents students via academic colleges as well as the Honors College and Freshman class. The Senate meets weekly to debate legislation, hear reports from the Executive Staff, and appoint the various officers of ASWSU. The Senate also provides financial support to the nearly 400 registered student organizations on campus via the Senate Finance Committee. Finally, the Election Board and the Judicial Board complete the association.

There are several other influential student organizations. Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, the United Greek Council, and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] are governmental bodies for university-recognized Greek social organizations. The Residence Hall Association is a government body for students in the residence halls, governing all of the residence halls on campus excluding McEachern and Stimson Halls. It is the second biggest registered student organization at Washington State, representing about 4,700 on-campus resident students.

The board of directors of the Students' Book Corporation has a total of nine directors. Five are students at WSU, two are faculty and two are administrative directors. These people oversees the non-profit campus bookstore separate from WSU.<ref name="sbcboard.wsu.edu">{{cite web|url=https://sbcboard.wsu.edu/faq/|title=faq {{!}} SBC Board {{!}} Washington State University|website=sbcboard.wsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> The Students' Book Corporation provides a 10% point of sale discount. On average the dividend total has been about $85,000. This is then received at ASWSU organizations at each campus to be distributed to various groups and activities.<ref name="sbcboard.wsu.edu"/> The Compton Union Board (CUB) oversees the management of the [[Student activity center|student union]] building and its services. The University Recreation Board oversees the management of university recreation. The Student Alumni Connection hosts several major campus events.

The Student Entertainment Board (SEB) is a student-led board composed of undergraduate students. Positions on the board include: Spotlight, Films, Up All Night, Lectures, CUB Gallery, Concerts, VPLAC (Visual, Performing, and Literary Arts Committee), Special Event (Homecoming and Springfest), Associate Director, and Director. They are responsible for bringing diverse arts & entertainment to campus.

The Coalition for Women Students provides much of the multicultural programs on campus, including the annual Women of Color symposium, the Week Without Violence, and [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] rally and march. CWS is made up of Association for Pacific and Asian Women, Black Women's Caucus, Mujeres Unidas, Native American Women's Association, and the [[YWCA]] of WSU. The organization also funds the all-volunteer Women's Transit, a safe door-to-door transportation program for women who would otherwise walk alone at night.

===Student government===
WSU has two representative [[student body]] organizations: the Associated Students of Washington State University (ASWSU) founded in 1915 and the Graduate and Professional Students Association (GPSA) founded about 1970.

In recent years, the student body completed several major projects on campus. In addition to passing a $15 transportation fee to increase Pullman Transit's service, the student body also voted to remodel the Compton Union Building. The building closed in May 2006 and re-opened in August 2008. In March 2006, ASWSU voted to support the renovation of [[Martin Stadium]], adding $25 per semester to undergraduate student fees.

====Associated Students of Washington State University====
{{main|Associated Students of Washington State University}}
ASWSU's organizational framework is similar to that of most American governments complete with an appointed and confirmed judiciary, elected representatives (from districts) to a senate, and an annually elected president and vice-president team. The president also has a paid staff led by the chief of staff ranging in size from 6–12 members, depending on the year.

====Graduate and Professional Students Association====
GPSA is similar, but differs in that it lacks a judiciary or a paid staff. The GPSA is centered on the senate which is composed of a large number of senators that represent different graduate and professional programs. The GPSA also has an executive Council that consists of the (GPSA) President, Vice-Presidents, and nine District Representatives elected from the nine colleges of WSU.

Washington State's biggest rival is the [[University of Washington]] [[Washington Huskies|Huskies]]. Strong rivalries also exist between WSU and the other Pac-12 teams of the Pacific Northwest: the [[University of Oregon]] [[Oregon Ducks|Ducks]] and [[Oregon State University]] [[Oregon State Beavers|Beavers]]. WSU's closest geographic rival is the [[University of Idaho]] [[Idaho Vandals|Vandals]], a fellow land-grant school only {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} east of Pullman across the state line in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]]. Conference rivals until 1959, their rivalry football game, the "[[Battle of the Palouse]]", was played on an annual basis from 1901 until 1978 when the NCAA Division I split. After Idaho returned to Division I-A, a renewed series lasted a decade, from 1998 until [[2007 Washington State Cougars football team|2007]]. The renewed series was dropped from the schedule due to the Cougars' continued dominance of the [[Idaho Vandals football|Vandals]] in the series, and each school's ability to generate more revenue by playing other opponents. Vandal head coach [[Robb Akey]], a former WSU defensive coordinator, preferred the game as an occasional rather regular attraction. On hiatus for five seasons, it returned for one year in [[2013 Washington State Cougars football team|2013]].<ref name=bop2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050112aaa.html|publisher=Washington State University Athletics|title=Cougars add Idaho to 2013 football schedule|date=May 1, 2012|access-date=August 22, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105113101/http://www.wsucougars.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050112aaa.html|archive-date=January 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
