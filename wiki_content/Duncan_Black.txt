'''Duncan Black''' (23 May 1908 – 14 January 1991) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[economist]] who laid the foundations of [[social choice theory]]. In particular he was responsible for unearthing the work of many early [[political scientist]]s, including [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]], and was responsible for the '''Black electoral system''', a [[Condorcet method]] whereby, in the absence of a Condorcet winner (e.g. due to a cycle), the [[Borda count|Borda]] winner is chosen.<ref>[[Eamonn Butler]], ''Public Choice: A Primer'', London: [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], 2012, p. 32 [http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/IEA%20Public%20Choice%20web%20complete%2029.1.12.pdf]</ref>

==Biography==
Black was born in [[Motherwell]], [[Scotland]], an industrial town south east of Glasgow, to a working-class family. He graduated from the [[Dalziel High School]] in Motherwell and  then studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He then enrolled for a degree in economics and politics which he finished with first class honours in 1932.  He started teaching at the newly formed Dundee School of Economics (later part of the  [[University of Dundee]]). There Black was influenced by his colleague [[Ronald Coase]], originator of the [[Theory of the Firm]]. He later taught at the University College of North Wales (now [[Bangor University]]) and Glasgow.

Black also had visiting positions in the [[United States]], at the universities of [[University of Rochester|Rochester]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]]. These occurred after [[William H. Riker]] reviewed his work in 1961.<ref>W.
