== Biography ==
Gilpin received his B.A. from the [[University of Vermont]] in 1952 and his M.S. from [[Cornell University]] in 1954. Following three years as an officer in the [[U.S. Navy]], Gilpin completed his Ph.D. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], earning his doctorate in 1960. He joined the Princeton faculty in 1962 and earned tenure in 1967.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} He was a faculty associate of the [[Center of International Studies]], and the [[Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination]].

Gilpin was a [[Guggenheim fellow]] in 1969, a [[Rockefeller fellow]] from 1967 to 1968 and again from 1976 to 1977, and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was a member of the [[American Political Science Association]] for which he served as vice president from 1984 to 1985, and he was a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. Early in his career, Gilpin focused on conflict and national security, in particular nuclear weapons policy.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=32–35|language=en}}</ref> Over time, his focus shifted to international political economy.<ref name=":9" />

Gilpin described his view of international relations and international political economy from a "[[political realism|realist]]" standpoint. He characterized himself as a "soft" realist.<ref name=":0" /> He explained in his book ''Global Political Economy'' that he considered himself a "state-centric realist" in the tradition of prominent "[[classical realism (international relations)|classical realists]]" such as [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]].<ref>Gilpin, Robert (2001). ''Global Political Economy - Understanding the International Economic Order''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. pp. 15–23.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Copeland|first=Dale C.|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztkw2|title=Economic Interdependence and War|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-16159-4|location=|pages=30|jstor=j.ctt7ztkw2|quote="realist scholars a Robert Gilpin"}}</ref> He has described Morgenthau, Carr and [[Hedley Bull]] as influences on his thinking,<ref name=":0" /> as well as [[Susan Strange]], [[Raymond Vernon]] and [[Richard Cooper (academic)|Richard Cooper]].<ref name=":9" />  

An important figure in the field of International Political Economy, Gilpin's scholarship pushed back on claims made by liberal institutionalists such as [[Robert Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye]] on the declining importance of state power in international economic affairs amid complex interdependence.<ref name=":9" /> Gilpin argued that states were still the key actors in the realm of economic relations and that security interests remained a key determinant of state behavior in economic affairs.<ref name=":9" /> Non-state actors were still fundamentally dependent on what states did.<ref name=":9" /> Gilpin was a strong influence on [[Stephen D. Krasner]].<ref name=":9222">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Political_Economy.html?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=99|language=en}}</ref>

Within IPE, Gilpin proposed an influential framework for organizing schools of political thought on the relationship between politics and economics into three: Mercantilism, Liberalism, and Marxism.<ref name=":9" />

In his 1975 book ''US Power and the Multinational Corporation'', Gilpin warned that multinational corporations could facilitate a rapid spread of advanced technologies away from the leading states to rising states, thus facilitating more rapid power transitions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brooks|first=Stephen G.|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sjz7|title=Producing Security: Multinational Corporations, Globalization, and the Changing Calculus of Conflict|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13031-6|location=|pages=54–55|jstor=j.ctt7sjz7}}</ref> Gilpin has described ''War and Change In World Politics'' (1981) as the work of his that he is most pleased with.<ref name=":0" />

In the final years of his career, Gilpin focused his research interests in the application of realist thinking to contemporary American policies in the [[Middle East]]. Gilpin was openly critical of the politics surrounding the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] in his essay "War is Too Important to Be Left to Ideological Amateurs."<ref>Gilpin, Robert (2005).{{cite web|url=http://ire.sagepub.com/content/19/1/5.full.pdf+html|title=War is Too Important to Be Left to Ideological Amateurs}}''International Relations'' vol. 19, no. 1 5–18.</ref>
