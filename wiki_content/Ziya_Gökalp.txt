'''Mehmet Ziya Gökalp''' (23 March 1876 – 25 October 1924) was a Turkish [[Sociology|sociologist]], writer, poet, and politician. After the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] that [[Second Constitutional Era|reinstated constitutionalism]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], he adopted the pen name Gökalp ("sky hero"), which he retained for the rest of his life. As a sociologist, Ziya Gökalp was influential in the negation of [[Islamism]], [[pan-Islamism]], and [[Ottomanism]] as ideological, cultural, and sociological identifiers. In a 1936 publication, sociologist [[Niyazi Berkes]] described Gökalp as "the real founder of [[sociology in Turkey|Turkish sociology]], since he was not a mere translator or interpreter of foreign sociology."<ref name="Berkes, Sociology in Turkey">{{cite journal|last1=Berkes|first1=Niyazi|title=Sociology in Turkey|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|date=1936|volume=42|issue=2|pages=238–246|jstor=2768789|doi=10.1086/217392|s2cid=145804422}}</ref>

Gökalp's work was particularly influential in shaping the [[Atatürk's Reforms|reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]; his influence figured prominently in the development of [[Kemalism]], and its legacy in the modern [[Republic of Turkey]].<ref>Parla, Taha.

==Early life==
Muhammad Ziya was born in [[Diyarbakır]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on 23 March 1876 to Muhammad Tefvik Bey and Zeliha Hanım. He was the second son of the family.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Uzer|first=Umut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ3jjgEACAAJ|title=An Intellectual History of Turkish Nationalism: Between Turkish Ethnicity and Islamic Identity|date=2016|publisher=[[University of Utah Press]]|isbn=978-1-60781-465-8|pages=63–66|language=en}}</ref> His father would be an Ottoman bureaucrat and responsible for publishing the [[Salname]] of Diyarbakir.<ref name=":1" /> The house where he was born has been converted into the [[Ziya Gökalp Museum]] in 1956.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jongerden|first=Joost|title=Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915|date=3 August 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23227-3|editor-last=Verheij|editor-first=Jelle|pages=68|language=en|editor-last2=Jongerden|editor-first2=Joost}}</ref> He had a close relationship with his uncle, who would have liked to have seen Ziya marry his daughter.<ref name=":1" /> His uncle was religious and opposed Ziyas interactions with the Kurdish atheist [[Abdullah Cevdet]].<ref name=":1" /> Diyarbakır was a "cultural frontier", having been ruled by [[Arabs]] and [[Persian Empire|Persians]] until the 16th century, and featuring "conflicting national traditions" among the local populations of Turks, [[Kurds]], and [[Armenians]].<ref name=Parla10>Parla, Taha. ''The Social and Political Thought of Ziya Gökalp''. 1980, page 10.</ref> This cultural environment has often been suggested to have informed his sense of national identity; later in his life, when political detractors suggested that he was of [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurdish]] extraction, Gökalp responded that while he was certain of [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] Turkish racial heritage, this was insignificant:  "I learned through my sociological studies that nationality is based solely on upbringing."<ref name=Parla10 />

Gökalp would attempt suicide in early 1895 after an existential crisis caused by his discovery of materialism.{{Sfn|Kieser|2018|p=100}} Cevdet, who was a doctor rescued him, which he would lament later as Gökalp became a Turkist ideologue.<ref name=":1" /> After attending primary and secondary education in Diyarbakır, he settled in Istanbul, in 1895.<ref>Joost Jongerden (2012), p.68</ref> There, he attended [[veterinary school]] and became involved in underground revolutionary nationalist politics<ref name=":1" /> for which he served ten months in prison.<ref name=Parla12>Parla, Taha.

==Career==
The revolutionary currents of [[Constantinople]] at the time were extremely varied; the unpopularity of the [[Abdul Hamid II]] regime had by this time awakened diverse revolutionary sentiment in Constantinople. He inaugurated the first CUP office in Diyarbakır in July 1908.<ref name=":02222">{{Cite book|last=Üngör|first=Uğur Ümit|title=Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915|publisher=Brill|year=2012|isbn=9789004225183|editor-last=Jorngerden|editor-first=Joost|pages=272|editor-last2=Verheij|editor-first2=Jelle}}</ref> In September 1909 he moved to [[Thessaloniki|Selanik]], where he became a member of the [[CUP central committee]] in 1910.

It was also during his stay in Selanik, in which he began using the then still  pen-name Gökalp and his future role within the CUP was to be determined.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kieser|first=Hans-Lukas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhtEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR11|title=Talaat Pasha: Father of Modern Turkey, Architect of Genocide|date=26 June 2018|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8963-1|pages=98–99|language=en}}</ref> In 1912, he moved back to Constantinople, as also did the CUP.<ref>Kieser, Hans-Lukas (2018), p.99</ref>

After [[World War I]], he was arrested for his involvement in the Committee of Union and Progress,<ref name="chalk">Chalk, Frank and Jonassohn, Kurt. ''The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies''. page 249</ref> and [[Malta exiles|exiled to Malta]] for two years between 1919 and 1921.<ref>Jongerden (2012), p.72</ref>

While exiled on Malta, he continued to write and consolidate his ideas and drafted his ''Principles of Turkism'' published in 1923. He returned to Turkey in the spring of 1921, but was not given back his chair at the University of Istanbul. He settled in his hometown of Diyarbakır where he taught sociology and psychology at a secondary school and teacher's seminary.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63weAAAAIAAJ&q=Ali&pg=PA16 | title=The Social and Political Thought of Ziya Gökalp: 1876-1924| isbn=978-9004072299| last1=Parla| first1=Taha| date=1 January 1985}}</ref> He began publishing a small weekly newsletter, ''Küçük Mecmua'', which slowly became influential and led to contributions in the major daily newspapers of Istanbul and Ankara. At the end of 1922, Gökalp was invited to direct the department of publication and translation at the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of Education]]. He was selected to serve as a member of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] of Turkey until his death in 1924, and he served on the Committee for Education<ref>{{Cite book|title=Between Two Empires: Ahmet Agaoglu and the New Turkey|last=Shissler|first=Ada Holland|date=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=186064855X|pages=23|language=en}}</ref> which reformed the school system, curriculum and textbooks according to his guidance.

Ziya Gökalp was the owner of land which included 5 villages in the northeast of Diyarbakır.<ref>Joost Jongerden (2012), p.69</ref>

== Ideology ==
Gökalp's work, in the context of the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]], was instrumental in the development of Turkish national identity, which he himself referred to even then as ''[[Turkishness]]''. He believed that a nation must have a "shared consciousness" in order to survive, that "the individual becomes a genuine personality only as he becomes a genuine representative of his culture".<ref name="moad" /> He believed that a modern state must become homogeneous in terms of culture, religion, and national identity.<ref name="akcam">Akcam, Taner. ''A Shameful Act''. 2006, page 88.</ref> This conception of national identity was augmented by his belief in the primacy of Turkishness, as a unifying virtue. In a 1911 article, he suggested that "Turks are the '[[Übermensch|supermen]]' imagined by the German philosopher [[Nietzsche]]".<ref name="akcam" />[[File:Ziya Gökalp.jpg|thumb|200px|The grave of Gökalp in Istanbul]]His major sociological work was interested in differentiating ''Avrupalılık'' ("Europeanism", the mimicking of Western societies) and ''Modernlik'' ("Modernity", taking initiative); he was interested in [[Japan]] as a model in this, for what he perceived to be its having modernized without abandoning its innate cultural identity. Gökalp suggested that to subordinate "culture" (non-utilitarianism, altruism, public-spiritedness) to "civilization" (utilitarianism, egoism, individualism) was to doom a state to decline:  "civilization destroyed societal solidarity and morality".<ref name="Parla31">Parla, Taha. ''The Social and Political Thought of Ziya Gökalp''. 1980, page 31.</ref>

Informed by his reading of [[Émile Durkheim]], Gökalp concluded that Western liberalism, as a social system, was inferior to [[Corporatism#Corporate solidarism|solidarism]], because liberalism encouraged individualism, which in turn diminished the integrity of the state.<ref name="Parla31" /> Durkheim, whose work Gökalp himself translated into [[Turkish language|Turkish]], perceived religion as a means of unifying a population socially, and even "religion as society's worship of itself".<ref name="yilmaz">Yilmaz, Ihsan. ''Muslim Laws, Politics And Society In Modern Nation States''. 2005, page 101.</ref> Durkheim's assertion that the life of the group was more important than the life of the individual, this was a concept readily adopted by Gökalp.<ref name="yilmaz" /> A well-known newspaper columnist and political figure, Gökalp was a primary ideologue of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]]. His views of "nation", and the ways in which they have informed the development of the modern Turkish state, have made for a controversial legacy.  Many historians and sociologists have suggested that his brand of nationalism contributed to the [[Armenian genocide]].<ref name="chalk" /><ref name="hov">Hovannisian, Richard G. ''The Armenian Genocide in Perspective''. 1986, page 77.</ref> His conception of nation was of a "social solidarity" that necessitated "cultural unity".<ref name="Parla36">Parla, Taha. ''The Social and Political Thought of Ziya Gökalp''. 1980, page 36.</ref> "Geographic nationalism", in which everyone living under one political system was a part of the nation, was unacceptable to Gökalp, who conceived of a nation as linguistically and culturally unified.<ref name="Parla36" /> Finally, merely to believe one was a part of a nation, this was not enough, either; one cannot choose to belong to the nation, in his view, as membership in the nation is involuntary.<ref name="Parla36" />

===''The Principles of Turkism''===
His 1923 ''The Principles of Turkism'', published just a year prior to his death, outlines the expansive nationalist identity he had long popularized in his teachings and poetry. The nationalism he espouses entails "a nation [that] is not a racial or ethnic or geographic or political or volitional group but one composed of individuals who share a common language, religion, morality, and aesthetics, that is to say, who have received the same education."<ref name="Landau">Landau, Jacob M. ''Pan-Turkism: From Irredentism to Cooperation''. page 38</ref>

He proceeds to lay out the three echelons of pan-Turkist identity that he envisions:
* the Turks in the Republic of Turkey, a nation according to cultural and other criteria;
* the [[Oghuz Turks]], referring also to the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]s of [[Azerbayjan]], [[Iran]] and [[Khwarizm]] who... essentially have one common culture which is the same as that of the Turks of Turkey—all these four forming Oghuzistan;
* more distant, Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the [[Yakuts]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Kipchaks]] and [[Tatars]], possessed of a traditional linguistic and ethnic unity, having affinity—but not identity—with the Turkish culture.<ref name="Landau" />

The second stage was "Oghuzism", and the final stage would be the "[[Turanism]]" that he and other nationalist poets had been promoting since before World War I. While this broad conception of "Turkishness", of pan-Turkism, often embraced what Gökalp perceived to be ethnic commonality, he did not disparage other races, as some of his pan-Turkist successors later did.<ref name="Landau184">Landau, Jacob M. ''Pan-Turkism: From Irredentism to Cooperation''. page 184</ref>

===Sufism===

Alp Eren Topal, a scholar from [[Bilkent University]], while trying to showcase the originality of Gökalp, and not as someone who only "repeated" European ideas, also talks of the much-neglected influence of [[Sufism]] on the thinker : being "a big influence throughout his education and growth", he lauded its "military" lexicon and came to admire the solidarity found in the [[Sufi orders]], "particularly the [[Naqshbandiyya]]", which not only had spiritual influence, but also a role in the modernization of the Ottoman Empire, while he also appreciated the [[metaphysics]] of medieval Andalusian thinker [[Ibn 'Arabi]], saying that his [[idealism]], as system of thought, was superior to that of [[George Berkeley]] or [[Immanuel Kant]] - who, he says, recycled ideas already known to Ibn 'Arabi, but without taking them too far -, and, far from being "[[Gnosticism]]-[[mysticism]] or [[pantheism]]", his ideas were pretty contemporary, resonating with those of moderns like [[Alfred Fouillée]], [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[William James]], concluding that "in all its progression idealist philosophy has not surpassed 'Arabî’s absolute and perfect idealism."<ref>Alp Eren Topal, "Against Influence: Ziya Gökalp in Context and Tradition" in ''[[Journal of Islamic Studies]]'' '''28''' (3):298-299 (2017)</ref>

===Poetic works===
In addition to his sociological and political career, Gökalp was also a prolific poet. His poetic work served to complement and popularize his sociological and nationalist views. In style and content, it revived a sense of pre-[[Islamic]] Turkish identity. The protagonist in his ''Kızılelma'', the "ideal woman",<ref name=karpat>Karpat, Kemal H. ''Ottoman Past and Today's Turkey''. 2000, page 235.</ref> suggests:  "The people is like a garden, / we are supposed to be its gardeners! / First the bad shoots are to be cut / and then the scion is to be grafted."<ref name=gen /> She is the teacher at ''Yeni Hayat'' ("New Life"), where Eastern and Western ideals meet and form a "new Turkish World".<ref name=karpat />

His poetry departs from his more serious sociological works, though it too harnesses nationalist sentiment: "Run, take the standard and let it be planted once again in [[Pleven|Plevna]] / Night and day, let the waters of the [[Danube]] run red with blood...."<ref>Akcam, Taner. ''A Shameful Act''. 2006, page 117.</ref> Perhaps his most famous poem was his 1911 ''Turan'', which was first published in ''Genç Kalemler'' and served to complement his [[Turanist]] intellectual output:  "For the Turks, Fatherland means neither Turkey, nor [[Turkestan]]; Fatherland is a large and eternal country--[[Turan]]!"<ref name=landau37>Landau, Jacob M. ''Pan-Turkism: From Irredentism to Cooperation''. page 37</ref> During the First World War, his ''Kızıl Destan'' ("Red Epic") called for destroying [[Russia]] in the interest of pan-Turkism.<ref name=landau37/>

==Legacy==
Ziya Gökalp has been characterized as "the father of Turkish nationalism",<ref name=melson>[[Robert Melson|Melson, Robert]]. ''Revolution and Genocide''. 1996, page 164.</ref> and even "the Grand Master of Turkism".<ref name="kaya">Kaya, Ibrahim. ''Social Theory and Later Modernities: The Turkish Experience''. 2004, page 61.</ref> His thought figured prominently in the political landscape of the [[Republic of Turkey]], which emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire around the time of his death. His influence resonated in diverse ways. For instance, his ''Principles of Turkism'' had contended that [[Ottoman classical music]] was [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] in origin; this led to the state briefly banning Ottoman classical music from the radio in the 1930s, because [[Turkish folk music]] alone "represented the genius of the nation".<ref>Houston, Christopher. ''Islam, Kurds and the Turkish Nation State''. 2001, page 39.</ref>

For popularizing [[pan-Turkism]] and [[Turanism]], Gökalp has been viewed alternately as being racist and expansionist, and anti-racist and anti-expansionist.<ref name=Parla126>Parla, Taha. ''The Social and Political Thought of Ziya Gokalp''. 1980, page 126–7.</ref> These opposite readings of his legacy are not easily divisible into proponents and detractors, as nationalist elements in Turkey (such as the "[[Nationalist Action Party]]") have appropriated his work to contend that he supported a physical realization of Turanism, rather than a mere ideological pan-Turkist kinship.<ref name=Parla126 /> Some readings of Gökalp contend, to the contrary, that his Turanism and pan-Turkism were linguistic and cultural models,<ref name=Parla126 /> ideals from which a post-Ottoman identity could be derived, rather than a militant call for the physical expansion of the Republic of Turkey.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Although he often held quite different ideas, Arab nationalist [[Sati al-Husri]] was profoundly influenced by Gökalp.<ref name=moad />

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk has said “Father of my meat and bones is Ali Riza Efendi and father of my thought is Ziya Gokalp.<ref>Kemal, Hasan Huseyin, “Ezberbozan Aciklamalar”</ref><ref>Limoncuoglu, Alihan "The evolution of Turkish nationalism between 1904 and 1980"</ref>

Gökalp's opinion of the [[Armenian genocide]] was that "there was no Armenian massacre, there was a Turkish-Armenian arrangement. They stabbed us in the back, we stabbed them back". This view was widely held among the Young Turks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suny |first1=Ronald Grigor |author1-link=Ronald Grigor Suny |title=Armenian Genocide |journal=[[1914-1918-online]] |date=2015 |doi=10.15463/ie1418.10646 |url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/armenian_genocide}}</ref>
