{{Main|History of Stanford University}}

Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr, their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm.

Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]. Stanford was referred to as the "Cornell of the West" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates (professors, alumni, or both), including its first president, [[David Starr Jordan]], and second president, [[John Casper Branner]]. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Margo Baumgartner |last2=Nilan |first2=Roxanne |title=The Stanford Album: A Photographic History, 1885–1945 |date=1989 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1639-0 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0qpzomMwkC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref>

From an architectural point of view, the Lelands, particularly Jane, wished to see their university look different from the eastern universities, which had often sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 Nov 1885|title=Founding Grant with Amendments|url=https://wasc.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10311/f/foundinggrant.pdf}}</ref> that the buildings should "be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles". This guides the campus buildings to this day. The Lelands also hired renowned landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] to design the campus who previously designed the Cornell campus.

When Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.<ref>{{cite book | title=Stanford: The Story of a University | author=Mirrielees, Edith R. | year=1959 | publisher=G.

=== Central campus ===
The academic central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]], Stanford Avenue, Jane Stanford Way, and [[Sand Hill Road]]. The [[United States Postal Service]] has assigned it two [[ZIP Codes]]: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for [[Post-office box|P.O. box]] mail. It lies within [[area code 650]].

=== Non-central campus ===
Stanford currently operates in various locations outside of its central campus.

On the founding grant:
* [[Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research.
* [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest [[linear particle accelerator]] in the world, {{convert|2|mi|km}} on {{convert|426|acre|ha}} of land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.slac.stanford.edu/AboutSLAC.aspx | title=About SLAC |access-date= April 4, 2011}}</ref>
* Golf course and a seasonal lake: The university also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake ([[Lake Lagunita]], actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]]. As of 2012 [[Lake Lagunita]] was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/12/05/lake-lag-feels-brunt-of-adverse-weather/ |title=University monitors Lake Lagunita after fall storms |access-date=December 20, 2013 |date=December 5, 2012 |author=Julia Enthoven |publisher=[[The Stanford Daily]]}}</ref>

Off the founding grant:
* [[Hopkins Marine Station]], in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]], California, is a [[marine biology]] research center owned by the university since 1892.
* Study abroad locations: unlike typical [[Student exchange program|study abroad]] programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a "mini-Stanford."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/bosp/teach/faculty-residence | title =Faculty-in-Residence : Bing Overseas Study Program | access-date=December 20, 2013}}</ref>

* Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in [[Redwood City, California]], a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, {{convert|35|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by [[The Great Recession]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/07/29/redwood-city-campus-remains-undeveloped/ |title=Redwood City campus remains undeveloped |publisher=The Stanford Daily |date=July 29, 2010 |access-date=April 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Chesley|first1=Kate|title=Redwood City approves Stanford office building proposals |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/redwood-city-development-091013.html|access-date=July 27, 2014|work=Stanford Report|publisher=Stanford University|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref> In 2015 the university announced a development plan<ref name=redwood-dec2015>{{cite news|last1=Kadvany|first1=Elena|title=Stanford's Redwood City campus moves closer to reality|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2015/12/10/stanfords-redwood-city-campus-moves-closer-to-reality|access-date=December 19, 2015|agency=Palo Alto Weekly|date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=University |first1=Stanford |title=Stanford Redwood City campus evokes warmth of university |url=https://news.stanford.edu/2020/01/31/visited-stanford-redwood-city/ |access-date=19 September 2020 |work=Stanford News |date=31 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Faculty residences ===
Many Stanford faculty members live in the "Faculty Ghetto," within walking or biking distance of campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Faculty Staff Housing|url=http://fsh.stanford.edu/index.shtml|access-date=December 20, 2013}}</ref> The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a [[condominium]], the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the "Ghetto" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall [[Silicon Valley]] values.

=== Other uses ===
Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] and the [[Stanford Research Park]]. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the [[Palo Alto Unified School District]] for several schools including [[Palo Alto High School]] and [[Gunn High School]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Breitrose|first1=Charlie|title=SCHOOLS: District wants Stanford land for school|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/1998_Dec_2.LAND.html|access-date=January 24, 2016|newspaper=Palo Alto Weekly|date=December 2, 1998}}</ref> El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park (established 1914), is also on Stanford land.<ref>{{cite web|title=El Camino Park|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=105&TargetID=14|publisher=City of Palo Alto|access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>

=== Landmarks ===
Contemporary campus landmarks include the [[Main Quad (Stanford University)|Main Quad]] and [[Stanford Memorial Church|Memorial Church]], the [[Iris & B.

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s 1937 [[Hanna–Honeycomb House]] and the 1919 [[Lou Henry Hoover House]] are both listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. [[White Memorial Fountain]] (also known as "The Claw") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of "fountain hopping"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by [[Aristides Demetrios]] after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N.

== Administration and organization ==

[[File:Marc Tessier-Lavigne at Rally for Medical Research.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Marc Tessier-Lavigne]] is the president of Stanford University.]]

Stanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a [[corporate trust]] governed by a privately appointed [[board of trustees]] with a maximum membership of 38.<ref name="stanford_facts_admin" />{{refn|group=note|The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s the board decided that 15 members was not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee ''ex officio''.<ref name="FoundingGrant" /> The last original trustee, [[Timothy Hopkins]], died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D.

* [[Internet]]—Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. [[Vint Cerf]] led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn ([[Bob Kahn]]) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.
* [[Frequency modulation synthesis]] – [[John Chowning]] of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to [[Yamaha Corporation]].

* [[RISC]] – [[DARPA|ARPA]] funded [[VLSI project]] of [[microprocessor]] design. Stanford and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The [[Stanford MIPS]] would go on to be commercialized as the successful [[MIPS architecture]], while [[Berkeley RISC]] gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the [[SPARC]]. Another success from this era were [[IBM]]'s efforts that eventually led to the [[IBM POWER instruction set architecture]], [[PowerPC]], and [[Power ISA]]. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the [[Unix workstation]] market as well as [[embedded processor]]s in [[laser printer]]s, [[router (computing)|routers]] and similar products.<ref name="coinrisk">{{cite book|title=Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology|url=https://archive.org/details/milestonesincomp0000reil|url-access=registration|last=Reilly|first=Edwin D.|year=2003|isbn=1-57356-521-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/milestonesincomp0000reil/page/50 50]}}</ref>

Stanford enrolled 6,996 undergraduate<ref name="CDS" /> and 10,253 graduate students<ref name="CDS" /> as of the 2019–2020 school year. Women comprised 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.<ref name="CDS" /> In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%.

Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.<ref name="CDS" /> The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.<ref name="CDS" /> The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or "coterm") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/highest-grad-rate |title=Best Colleges—Education |work=U.S. News & World Report |date=August 19, 2009 |access-date=July 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314054424/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/highest-grad-rate |archive-date=March 14, 2009}}</ref>

Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshman, sophomores, or upperclass students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male [[fraternity|fraternities]], three are all-female [[sorority|sororities]], and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/rde/shs/ugrad/wilbur.htm#junipero |archive-date=October 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151009205734/https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/#junipero |url-status=dead|title=Stanford University—Student Housing—Tour Undergraduate Housing |publisher=Stanford.edu |access-date=July 9, 2010 }}</ref>

Several residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include [[Freshman-Sophomore College]] (Academic Focus), [[Branner Hall]] (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and [[Toyon Hall|Toyon]] (Sophomore Priority).<ref name="ugradres" /> Theme houses predating the current "theme" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://resed.stanford.edu/residences/find-house/columbae |title=Columbae House |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=April 10, 2012 }}</ref> and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/synergy/ |title=Synergy House |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

[[housing cooperative|Co-ops]] or "Self-Ops" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial [[LGBT]] house),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/coop/cgi-bin/public/wiki.php?wikiid=1&pagename=Terra|title=About Terra|work=ResEd|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=February 8, 2016}}</ref> and Synergy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/resed/Staff/StaffResources/StudentMgmt/CoOps.html |title=Residential Education—Cooperative Houses |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.<ref>This chapter had voiced concern that women were being treated unfairly due to the campus ban on sororities.

=== Traditions ===
* {{anchor|Hail, Stanford, Hail!}}"Hail, Stanford, Hail!" is the Stanford Hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various University singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in Economics and later became associate professor of Sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=39027 |title=Century at Stanford |author=Karen Bartholomew |publisher=Alumni.stanford.edu |date=March–April 2002 |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.stanford.edu/Assets/StanfordHymn.pdf|title=Hail, Stanford Hail! |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095506/http://music.stanford.edu/Assets/StanfordHymn.pdf|archive-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref>
* [[Big Game (American football)|Big Game]]: The central football rivalry between Stanford and [[California Golden Bears football|UC Berkeley]]. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.
* The [[Stanford Axe]]: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899, when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford campus is named "The Axe and Palm" in reference to the Axe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stanford Stories from the Archives: Student Traditions |date=<!--undated exhibit--> |publisher=Stanford Libraries |url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/stanford-stories/feature/student-traditions |access-date=August 20, 2021}}</ref>

=== Religious life ===
Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is "to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.
[[Stanford Memorial Church]], in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the "Protestant Ecumenical Christian" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.<ref>{{cite web| title = University Public Worship
| work = Office for Religious Life| publisher = Stanford University| url = https://web.stanford.edu/group/religiouslife/cgi-bin/wordpress/memorial-church/university-public-worship/
| access-date = October 5, 2013}}</ref> In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over 20 years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.

In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, [[Bahá’í]], Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.<ref>{{cite web| title = Stanford Associated Religions| work = Office for Religious Life | publisher = Stanford University

=== Greek life ===
Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the university first opened. In 1944, University President [[Donald Tresidder]] banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stanford.kappa.org/chapter-history |title=Kappa Kappa Gamma - Beta Eta Deuteron History |publisher=kappakappagamma.org |date= |access-date=11 May 2021 }}</ref> However, following [[Title IX]], the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/chiomega/cgi-bin/history.php|title=Chi Omega – Nu Alpha – History|website=Cgi.stanford.edu|access-date=September 19, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120104456/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/chiomega/cgi-bin/history.php |archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.<ref name="greek-faq">{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://resx.stanford.edu/news-values/faq/recruitment-and-intake/frequently-asked|website=Stanford Residential Education|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=12 May 2021}}</ref>

As of 2016 Stanford had 31 Greek organizations, including 14 sororities and 16 fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, [[Sigma Chi]], in their own house, although the land is owned by the University<ref name="daily-summer-chi">{{cite news|last1=Soong-Shiong|first1=Nika|title=Life at Summer Chi |url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/08/23/life-at-summer-chi/|access-date=June 17, 2016|work=Stanford Daily|date=August 23, 2013}}</ref>).

=== Student groups ===
As of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://admission.stanford.edu/student/communities/index.html | title=Campus Communities & Service Opportunities: Student Organizations | publisher=Stanford University | access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref> Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include "special fees," which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations.
