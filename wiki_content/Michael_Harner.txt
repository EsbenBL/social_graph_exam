His doctoral dissertation, "Machetes, Shotguns, and Society: An Inquiry into the Social Impact of Technological Change among the Jivaro Indians" (U California-Berkeley 1963), became the basis for his book, ''The Jívaro: People of the Sacred Waterfalls''.<ref name="jivaro">Harner, Michael J. (1972) ''The Jívaro: People of the Sacred Waterfalls.'' New York: Natural History Press. Second edition 1984, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.</ref>

In 1960-61 he experimented with the Amazonian plant medicine [[ayahuasca]] with the [[Conibo]] people of the Peruvian Amazon,<ref name="Wallis03"/> which he wrote about in the articles "The Sound of Rushing Water" (1968)<ref name="rushing-water">Harner, Michael J.

In 1966, having taught at UC-Berkeley and served as associate director of the Lowie Museum of Anthropology, Harner became a visiting professor at [[Yale]] and [[Columbia University]] and in 1970 joined the graduate faculty of  [[The New School for Social Research]] in New York City. He co-chaired the Anthropology Section of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="haviland">Haviland, William A., Harald E. L. Prins, Bunny McBride and Dana Walrath (2013).

In 1983, Harner founded the Center for Shamanic Studies, which is today known as the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.<ref name="Wallis03"/> In 1987 Harner left academia to devote himself full-time to the Foundation for Shamanic Studies. Walsh and Grob note in their book, ''Higher Wisdom: Eminent Elders Explore the Continuing Impact of Psychedelics'', "Michael Harner is widely acknowledged as the world's foremost authority on shamanism and has had an enormous influence on both the academic and lay worlds.... What [[Yogananda]] did for [[Hinduism]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] did for [[Zen]], Michael Harner has done for shamanism, namely bring the tradition and its richness to Western awareness."<ref name="walsh-grob">Walsh, Roger, and Charles S. Grob, eds.

He died on February 3, 2018 at the age of 88.<ref>[http://shamanism.org/news/in-memoriam-michael-j-harner-1929-2018/ In Memoriam: Michael J. Harner (1929-2018)]</ref>

==Development of Core Shamanism==
After traveling to the Amazon where he ingested the hallucinogen [[ayahuasca]], Harner began experimenting with monotonous drumming. In the early 1970s he started giving training workshops to small groups in Connecticut. In 1979 he founded the Center for Shamanic Studies in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]]. In 1980, Harner published ''The Way of the Shaman: a Guide to Power and Healing.''<ref name=Harner1/> Students in the United States and Europe began to take his classes in what he was now calling "[[Neoshamanism|core shamanism]]"<ref>Harner, Michael (2005) "The History and Work of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies," ''Shamanism'' 18: 1&2, p. 7.</ref> (as differenced from traditional, [[Evenks|Evenk]] [[shamanism]], or other [[ethnic religion|indigenous]] and historical practices that have been referred to as "shamanism" in anthropological texts).

Anthropologist Joan Townsend has distinguished Harner's core shamanism from [[neoshamanism]].<ref>Townsend, Joan B. (2004) "Individualist Religious Movements: Core and Neo-shamanism" ''Anthropology of Consciousness'' vol. 15(1), pp. 1-9. {{DOI|10.1525/ac.2004.15.1.1}}</ref> However, most authors in the field, especially Harner's critics, consider Harner's core shamanism to be the primary influence on, and foundation of, the Neoshamanic movement.<ref name="noel"/><ref name="Hobson">Hobson, G. "The Rise of the White Shaman as a New Version of Cultural Imperialism." in: Hobson, Gary, ed. ''The Remembered Earth''. Albuquerque, NM: Red Earth Press; 1978: 100-108.</ref><ref name="Aldred">Aldred, Lisa, "[[Plastic Shaman]]s and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' issn.24.3 (2000) pp.329-352.

Harner later integrated his Center for Shamanic Studies into the nonprofit Foundation for Shamanic Studies. The Foundation received financial support primarily from the Core Shamanism courses and workshops he taught, supplemented by private donations. From the early 1980s onward, he invited a few of his students to join an international faculty to reach an ever-wider market. In 1987, Harner resigned his professorship to devote himself full-time to the work of the foundation.<ref name="harner-2005">Harner, Michael (2005) "The History and Work of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies", ''Shamanism'' 18: 1&2, p. 5.</ref> He largely ceased publishing, except for occasional articles in the publication "Shamanism."<ref name="primer">Harner, Michael, and Sandra Harner (2000) "Core Practices in the Shamanic Treatment of Illness".
