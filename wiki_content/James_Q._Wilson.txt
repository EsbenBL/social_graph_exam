'''James Quinn Wilson''' (May 27, 1931 – March 2, 2012) was an American [[American conservatism|conservative]] academic, [[political scientist]], and an authority on [[public administration]]. Most of his career was spent as a professor at [[UCLA]] and [[Harvard University]]. He was the chairman of the Council of Academic Advisors of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], member of the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]] (1985–1990), and the [[President's Council on Bioethics]]. He was Director of [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Joint Center for Urban Studies]] at [[Harvard]]-[[MIT]].

He was the former president of the [[American Political Science Association]] and a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], [[American Philosophical Society]] and [[Human Rights Foundation]]. He also was a co-author of a leading university textbook, ''[[American Government (textbook)|American Government]]'', and wrote many scholarly books and articles, and op-ed essays. He gained national attention for a 1982 article introducing the [[broken windows theory]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. In 2003, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by US President [[George W. Bush]].

== Career ==
He completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at the [[University of Redlands]] in 1952, and he was its national collegiate debate champion in 1951 and 1952. He completed an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1957) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1959) in [[political science]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. From 1961 to 1987, he was the Shattuck Professor of Government at [[Harvard University]]. 

His 1975 book ''Thinking About Crime'' put forward a novel theory of incapacitation as the most effective explanation for the reduction in crime rates observed where longer prison sentences were the norm. Criminals might not be deterred by the threat of longer sentences, but repeat offenders would be prevented from further offending, simply because they would be in jail rather than out on the street.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kAdRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lMEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6723,2110719|title=The case for jailing crooks|author=John D. Lofton Jr.|newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald|date=14 April 1975|page=4}}</ref>

Wilson and [[George L. Kelling]] introduced the [[broken windows theory]] in the March 1982 edition of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. In an article titled "Broken Windows", they argued that the symptoms of low-level crime and disorder (e.g. a broken window) create an environment that encourages more crimes, including serious ones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/_atlantic_monthly-broken_windows.pdf |author=James Q.

From 1987 to 1997, he was the James Collins Professor of Management and Public Policy at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]] at [[UCLA]]. From 1998 to 2009, he was the Ronald Reagan Professor of Public Policy at [[Pepperdine University]]'s [[Pepperdine School of Public Policy|School of Public Policy]].<ref name="pepperdine">[http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/academics/faculty/default.htm?faculty=james_wilson "James Q.

Wilson authored the university text ''[[American Government (textbook)|American Government]]'', and coauthored later editions with [[John DiIulio|John J. DiIulio, Jr.]]. The text has been widely sold, though its use became controversial in later years after universities alleged it to have inaccuracies and "right-wing bias".<ref>Associated Press (8 April 2008).

Wilson was a former chairman of the White House Task Force on Crime (1966), of the National Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse Prevention (1972–1973) and a member of the Attorney General's Task Force on Violent Crime (1981), the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]] (1985–1990), and the [[President's Council on Bioethics]]. He was a former president of the [[American Political Science Association]]. He served on the [[board of directors]] for the New England Electric System (now [[National Grid plc#USA|National Grid USA]]), Protection One, [[RAND]], and [[State Farm Mutual Insurance]].

He was the chairman of the Council of Academic Advisors of the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. He was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[American Philosophical Society]], and the International Council of the New York-based [[Human Rights Foundation]].

== Political views ==
Although as a young professor he "voted for [[John F. Kennedy|John Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] and worked in the last's presidential campaign,"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204488304574424752913834312|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=A Life in the Public Interest|first=James Q.|last=Wilson|date=September 21, 2009}}</ref> Wilson was later recognized as a leading conservative scholar, as indicated by his advisory position to the [[American Enterprise Institute]].

Wilson was a staunch advocate for perseverance in the [[War on Drugs]]:

<blockquote>Even now, when the dangers of drug use are well understood, many educated people still discuss the drug problem in almost every way except the right way. They talk about the "costs" of drug use and the "socioeconomic factors" that shape that use. They rarely speak plainly—drug use is wrong because it's immoral and it is immoral because it enslaves the mind and destroys the soul.<ref>Quoted in [[William J. Bennett]], ''Body Count'' (New York: 1996), pp. 140–141</ref></blockquote>

Wilson also pioneered the idea that public administration was increasingly replete with political calculations and concerns:

<blockquote>This is because our constitutional structure and our traditions afford individuals manifold opportunities not only to bring their special interests to the attention of public officials but also — and this the important thing — to compel officials to bargain and to make compromises. The nature of the governmental system gives private interests such good opportunities to participate in the making of public decisions that there is virtually no sphere of 'administration' apart from politics.<ref>[http://contemporarythinkers.org/jq-wilson/introduction/ "An Introduction to the Work of James Q. Wilson"], ''contemporarythinkers.org''.</ref></blockquote>

Wilson studied conflict between "amateur" and "professional" participants in politics, especially in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the 1960s. He argued that professional politicians, parties, [[political machine]]s and informal power structures were essential to the functioning of the government and its formal power structures. In 1962, he wrote that "If legal power is badly fragmented among many independent elective officials and widely decentralized among many levels of government, the need for informal methods of assembling power becomes great."<ref>James Q. Wilson, The Amateur Democrat: Club Politics in Three Cities (University of Chicago Press, 1962); reprinted with a new preface in 1966.</ref>

== Personality ==
Wilson was described as being courteous and gentle in demeanor but also intellectually tough and firm with his opinions. As a former student of Wilson, former American Enterprise Institute President [[Christopher DeMuth]] said, "He was sociable, amiable, he loved the [[Red Sox]]. He kept up on the [[NCAA]] brackets. He knew all about all of those things. He was interested in music and cooking and food, he was very companionable. But... he was intellectually tough as nails and he would be very agreeable in explaining to you that your intuitions about something actually weren't correct."<ref>[http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/transcript/christopher-demuth-transcript/ "Christopher Demuth transcript: IV) James Q. Wilson], ''conversationswithbillkristol.org'', taped March 19, 2014.</ref>

== Death ==
Wilson died in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on March 2, 2012 from complications with leukemia.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-james-q-wilson-20120303,0,3338917.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=James Q.
