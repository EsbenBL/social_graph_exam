'''Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn''', known as '''Pim Fortuyn''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpɪɱ fɔrˈtœyn|lang|Pim Fortuyn.ogg}}; 19 February 1948&nbsp;– 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, author, civil servant, businessman and academic who founded the party [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002.<ref name="Margry">Margry, Peter Jan: ''The Murder of Pim Fortuyn and Collective Emotions.

Fortuyn worked as a professor at the [[Erasmus University of Rotterdam]] and became prominent in the Netherlands as a press columnist. Initially a [[Marxist]] who was sympathetic to the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]], and later a member of the Dutch [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] in the 1970s, Fortuyn's beliefs began to shift to the right in the 1990s, especially related to the immigration policies of the Netherlands. Fortuyn criticised [[Multiculturalism in the Netherlands|multiculturalism]], [[immigration to the Netherlands|immigration]] and [[Islam in the Netherlands]]. He called Islam "a backward culture", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants.<ref name="controversy">{{cite web |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws/denhaag/1013147690985.html |title=''Volkskrant'' newspaper interview (summary) |access-date=12 February 2002 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212063049/http://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws/denhaag/1013147690985.html |archive-date=12 February 2002 |language=nl}}</ref> Fortuyn also supported tougher measures against crime and opposed state [[bureaucracy]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/07/qanda.thefarright|last=Oliver|first=Mark|title=The shooting of Pym Fortuyn|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 May 2002|access-date=27 May 2019|archive-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526202317/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/07/qanda.thefarright|url-status=live}}</ref> wanting to reduce the Dutch financial contribution to the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/14/andrewosborn.theobserver|last=Osborn|first=Andrew|title=Dutch fall for gay Mr Right|date=14 April 2002|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=5 June 2019|archive-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526202312/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/14/andrewosborn.theobserver|url-status=live}}</ref> He was labelled a [[Far right|far-right]] [[populism|populist]] by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1966979.stm|title=Cf. this BBC interview|date=4 May 2002|access-date=21 July 2007|archive-date=20 October 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021020203934/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1966979.stm }}</ref> Fortuyn was [[Coming out|openly]] gay and a supporter of gay rights.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/15/thefarright.gayrights|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|title=Queering the pitch|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 May 2002|location=London|access-date=5 June 2019|archive-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526202316/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/15/thefarright.gayrights|url-status=live}}</ref>

Fortuyn explicitly distanced himself from "far-right" politicians such as the Belgian [[Filip Dewinter]], Austrian [[Jörg Haider]], or Frenchman [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] whenever compared to them. While he compared his own politics to centre-right politicians such as [[Silvio Berlusconi]] of Italy and [[Edmund Stoiber]] of Germany, he also admired former Dutch Prime Minister [[Joop den Uyl]], a social democrat, and Democratic U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]. Fortuyn also criticised the [[polder model]] and the policies of the outgoing government of [[Wim Kok]] and repeatedly described himself and [[Pim Fortuyn List|LPF]]'s ideology as [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and not [[populism|populistic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODW8uQTbhGw|title=Interview with Belgium news agency|access-date=27 February 2021|archive-date=8 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708162030/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODW8uQTbhGw|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2002, his newly created LPF became the largest party in Fortuyn's hometown [[Rotterdam]] during the Dutch municipal elections held that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/07/thefarright.uk1|last=The Guardian|title=Dutch election to go ahead|date=7 May 2002|location=London|access-date=5 June 2019|archive-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526202313/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/07/thefarright.uk1|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Fortuyn was born on 19 February 1948 in [[Driehuis]], as the third child to a middle class Catholic family. His father worked as a salesman and his mother was a housewife. As a youth, Fortuyn initially wanted to train as a priest, but in 1967 he began to study sociology at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and transferred after a few months to the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in Amsterdam. In 1971 he ended his study with the [[Academic degree]] [[Doctorandus]]. In 1981 he received a doctorate in sociology at the [[University of Groningen]] as a Doctor of Philosophy.

==Career==
===Professional career===

Fortuyn worked as a lecturer at the [[Nyenrode Business Universiteit]] and as an associate professor at the [[University of Groningen]], where he taught [[Marxist]] sociology. He was also an employee of the Groningen University Newspaper for which he wrote columns. He was a Marxist at the time and sympathized with the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]] (CPN), although he never became a full member.<ref>[http://www.nu.nl/boek/2783454/cpn-weigerde-fortuyn-lidmaatschap.html "CPN weigerde Fortuyn lidmaatschap"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116083200/https://www.nu.nl/boek/2783454/cpn-weigerde-fortuyn-lidmaatschap.html |date=16 January 2021 }}, nu.nl, 10 april 2012</ref> Later, he joined the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]].

In 1989 Fortuyn became director of a [[Politics of the Netherlands|government]] organisation administering student transport cards and worked as an advisor to the [[Social and Economic Council]] (SER). In 1990 he moved to [[Rotterdam]]. From 1991 to 1995, he was an extraordinary professor at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], appointed to the Albeda-chair in "employment conditions in public service" and ran an education consultancy business.

When his contract ended, he made a career of public speaking, writing books and press columns, and worked as a weekly columnist for ''[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]].'' He gradually involved himself in politics through regularly appearing on televised debate shows and became a familiar public figure for his charismatic and flamboyant speaking style.<ref>https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79990&page=1</ref> Fortuyn was openly gay, and said in a 2002 interview that he was Catholic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.katholieknieuwsblad.nl/actueel19/kn1920a.htm|first=Mark | last=Eyck|title=Interview: Pim Fortuyn|work=[[Katholiek Nieuwsblad]] (Catholic Newspaper)|date=15 February 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020306021624/http://www.katholieknieuwsblad.nl/actueel19/kn1920a.htm|archive-date=6 March 2002|url-status=dead}} <br />" Question: U beschouwt zichzelf nog wel als katholiek?

[..] Question: But in spite of your homosexuality you still call yourself a Catholic. Answer: I ''am'' a Catholic. I have, after all, been baptised!  I don't call myself one, I am one!'')</ref>

===Political career===
[[File:Pim Fortuyn 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Pim Fortuyn in 1991]]
Fortuyn was initially a Marxist due to an aversion to the Dutch political establishment which he saw as dominated by [[pillarization]] and a "[[Regenten|regent]] mentality." In the 1970s he joined the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and became a [[social democrat]]. In 1986, his views shifted towards [[neoliberalism]] in the hope that the [[free market]] would lead to further individual emancipation, ending a perceived oppression by state [[bureaucracy]]. In 1991, he proposed firing half of all civil servants and promoted [[privatisation]] and [[decentralisation]].<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 150</ref> In 1992, Fortuyn wrote ''Aan het volk van Nederland'' ("To the people of the Netherlands"), in which he declared himself to be the spiritual successor of the charismatic but controversial 18th-century Dutch [[Patriottentijd|patriot]] politician [[Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol]]. The book urges the already culturally emancipated citizen to use the free market to also liberate himself economically, from the [[welfare state]].<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 200</ref> In 1989, Fortuyn left the Labour Party and during the 1990s became a member of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] and was briefly a political consultant to the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the early 2000s.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1966979.stm {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref>

Though on economic matters Fortuyn would largely remain a neoliberal,<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 154</ref> culturally he soon became strongly influenced by the [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] chief editor of the weekly ''Elsevier'' [[Hendrik Jan Schoo]] who made him a columnist in 1993.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 164</ref> Schoo deplored that a progressive [[new class]] would have promoted multiculturalism, founding an anti-racist [[civil religion]] on article 1 of the Dutch constitution, forbidding discrimination.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 180-182</ref> Whereas in the early 1990s Fortuyn had had liberal views on immigration, this changed under the influence of Schoo.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 183</ref>

Dutch neocons understood that in the evermore [[secularisation|secularising]] Netherlands a change on the lines of the [[Reagan Revolution]] had become highly improbable. Women's rights, gay rights, abortion and euthanasia had been generally accepted. In his 1995 book ''De verweesde samenleving'' ("The orphaned society"), Fortuyn claimed that the progressive movement of the 1960s had eroded traditional norms and values. Both the roles of the "symbolic father" and the "caring mother" had been lost, leaving an orphaned population without guidance, to live out a meaningless decadent existence.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 217</ref> However, Fortuyn did not propose a return to old socially conservative or Dutch iconoclastic values and argued that the media, schools and artists should provide a moral leadership, explicitly promoting and defending the new values of modern Western society, constantly recreating the Dutch identity.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 218</ref> Fortuyn consistently retained a liberal stance on matters such as LGBT rights throughout his political career.

Adopting the philosophical analysis by [[Carl Schmitt]], it was assumed that such an identity could only be defined in [[antithesis]] to some actually existing concrete enemy. Inspired by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]'s ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]'', Dutch ethnicity was to be re-invented by identifying that enemy as Islam.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 219</ref> In his 1997 book ''Tegen de islamisering van onze cultuur'' ("Against the islamisation of our culture"), Fortuyn proposed that after the [[fall of communism]] a new adversary would be found in Muslim culture.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 220</ref> Fortuyn explained the global fundamentalist wave of the 1990s as a backlash against the insecurities caused by [[globalisation]]. The Dutch should counter [[Islamic fundamentalism]] by promoting and defending their own ''fundament'', Dutch culture, especially [[modernism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 221</ref> These should not yet be imposed on the Dutch population as a whole, with the exception of immigrants.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 222</ref> Whereas American neoconservatives promoted [[hard power]] policies in relation to the Muslim world, Dutch neocons favoured a [[soft power]] approach.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 214-215</ref> Shortly before the [[September 11 attacks]], Fortuyn called for a [[Cold War]] against Islam, meaning a non-military defensive enmity.<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 215</ref> The attacks and the [[War on Terror]] made Islam a main issue in Dutch politics for the first time.

Fortuyn announced his intention to run for parliament in a television interview in 2001, although he did not specify which party he would seek to stand as a candidate with. Although he was already in contact with the newly formed [[Livable Netherlands]] (LN) party, he also considered running for the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] which he had worked as a consultant for, or even creating his own [[Electoral list|list]]. Livable Netherlands founder [[Jan Nagel]] subsequently invited him to run as party leader and Fortuyn was elected "[[lijsttrekker]]"  ([[lead candidate]]) by a large majority of party members at the LN conference on 26 November 2001, prior to the [[2002 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2002]]. In his leadership bid and general election campaign, Fortuyn attacked the mainstream parties on multiculturalism, immigration and law & order. He also called for less government interference and for a reform of the Dutch public health and education systems.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/07/guardianobituaries.thefarright|title=Pim Fortuyn – obituary|work=The Guardian|date=7 May 2002|access-date=19 August 2019|first=Lang|last=Kirsty|archive-date=19 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819184342/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/07/guardianobituaries.thefarright|url-status=live}}</ref> He concluded his acceptance speech by saying the words in English that would become his slogan; "At your service!"<ref name=rvh45>{{harvnb|Rydgren|van Holsteyn|2005|p=45}}</ref> Support for LN rose dramatically during Fortuyn's brief leadership, climbing from 2% in opinion polls to about 17%.<ref name=m211>{{harvnb|Mudde|2007|p=211}}</ref>

On 9 February 2002, Fortuyn gave an interview to ''[[Volkskrant]]'', a Dutch newspaper (see below) regarding his beliefs on immigration and Islam. His statements were considered so controversial that LN dismissed him as ''lijsttrekker'' the next day. During the interview, Fortuyn had said that he favoured closing borders to Muslim immigrants and if possible he would abolish the "peculiar article" of the Dutch constitution forbidding discrimination (at the time it was generally assumed that he referred to Article 1, the [[equality before the law]]; it has been argued, however, that Fortuyn and the interviewer had confused this with Article 137 of the Penal Code, incitement to hatred).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/gs-b4919d81|title=Strafbare belediging|first=Marjolijn|last=Februari|date=16 February 2002|website=de Volkskrant}}</ref>

===Founding the LPF===
Having been rejected by Livable Netherlands, Fortuyn founded his own party [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (LPF) on 11 February 2002, taking many former LN members and supporters with him.

Heading the list of the [[Livable Rotterdam]] party, considered to be the local counterpart of the LPF, he achieved a major victory in the [[Rotterdam]] municipal council elections in early March 2002. The new party won about 36% of the seats, making it the largest party in the council. For the first time since the [[Second World War]], the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] was out of power in [[Rotterdam]].

Fortuyn's victory made him the subject of hundreds of interviews during the next three months, and he made many [[News release|statements]] about his [[political ideology]]. In March he released his book ''The Mess of Eight Purple Years'' (''[[De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars]]''), which criticised the current political system in the Netherlands and was used as his [[political agenda]] for the upcoming [[2002 Dutch general election|general election]]. Purple is the colour to indicate a coalition government consisting of left parties (red) and conservative-liberal parties (blue). The Netherlands had been governed by such a coalition for eight years at that time.

On 14 March 2002, Fortuyn was [[pieing|pied]] by a left-wing activist from the [[Biotic Baking Brigade]] in The Hague. As a result, Fortuyn began to express a fear of being injured or assassinated and accused members of the Dutch political establishment of encouraging violence against him.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.expatica.com/nl/news/country-news/Fortuyn-smeared-with-cake_125856.html |title=The Complete Expat Guide to the Netherlands &#124; Expatica |access-date=9 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142637/https://www.expatica.com/nl/news/country-news/Fortuyn-smeared-with-cake_125856.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{main|Assassination of Pim Fortuyn}}
On 6 May 2002, at age 54, Fortuyn was [[Assassination of Pim Fortuyn|assassinated]] by gunshot in [[Hilversum]], [[North Holland]], by [[Volkert van der Graaf]]. The attack took place in a parking lot outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview. This was nine days before the [[2002 Dutch general election|general election]], for which he was running.

The assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. Various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn's murder and deeply affected Dutch politics and society.<ref>* Jelle van Buuren: ''Holland's Own Kennedy Affair. Conspiracy Theories on the Murder of Pim Fortuyn''. = ''[[Historical Social Research]]'', Vol. 38, 1 (2013), pp. 257–85.</ref> Politicians from all parties suspended campaigning. After consultation with LPF, the government decided not to postpone the elections. As Dutch law did not permit modifying the ballots, Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The [[Pim Fortuyn List|LPF]] made an unprecedented debut in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] by winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). The LPF joined a cabinet with the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], but conflicts in the rudderless LPF quickly collapsed the cabinet, forcing new elections. By the following year, the party had lost support, winning only eight seats in the [[2003 Dutch general election|2003 elections]]. It won no seats in the [[2006 Dutch general election|2006 elections]], by which time the [[Party for Freedom]], led by [[Geert Wilders]], had emerged as a successor.

During the last months of his life, Fortuyn had become closer to the Catholic Church. To the surprise of many commentators and Dutch TV hosts, Fortuyn insisted on Fr. Louis Berger, a [[curate|parish priest]] from [[The Hague]], accompanying him in some of his last TV appearances. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Berger had become his "friend and [[sacrament of penance|confessor]]" during the last weeks of his life.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/world/rightist-candidate-in-netherlands-is-slain-and-the-nation-is-stunned.html|title=Rightist politician is slain and the Nation is stunned|last=Simons|first=Marlise|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 May 2002|access-date=19 February 2017|archive-date=28 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228101612/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/world/rightist-candidate-in-netherlands-is-slain-and-the-nation-is-stunned.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Fortuyn was initially buried in [[Driehuis]] in the Netherlands. He was re-interred on 20 July 2002, at [[San Giorgio della Richinvelda]], in the [[province of Pordenone]] in Italy, where he had owned a house.

==Views on Islam and immigration==
When asked about his opposition to Muslim immigration, Fortuyn explained that, "I have no desire to go through the emancipation of women and homosexuals all over again."<ref name=BedellBookReview>{{cite news|last1=Bedell|first1=Geraldine|title=To face the facts beyond the veil|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/29/biography.islam|access-date=27 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 October 2006|archive-date=3 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203035025/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/29/biography.islam|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 2001, Fortuyn was quoted in the ''Rotterdams Dagblad'' newspaper saying, "I am also in favour of a [[cold war]] with Islam.

I see Islam as being an exceptional threat, as a society hostile to ours".'')</ref> In the TV program ''Business class'', Fortuyn said that Muslims in the Netherlands did not accept Dutch society; he believed that the religion of Islam was fundamentally intolerant and incompatible with Western values.<ref name="douglasmurray">{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Douglas|title=The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=978-1472942241|edition=Kindle}}</ref> He said that Muslims in the Netherlands needed to accept living ''together'' with the Dutch, and that if this was unacceptable for them, then they were free to leave. His concluding words in the TV program were "...&nbsp;I want to live together with the Muslim people, but [[wikt:it takes two to tango|it takes two to tango]]." Fortuyn also maintained that he did not object to Muslim immigrants because of their race or ethnicity, and was not against a multi-racial society, but opposed what he saw as lack of integration and unwillingness to adapt to Dutch standards of modernity and [[social liberalism]] within Muslim communities.<ref name="auto"/>

On 9 February 2002, additional statements made by him were carried in the ''[[Volkskrant]]''.<ref name=controversy/> He said that the Netherlands, with a population of 16 million, had enough inhabitants, and the practice of allowing as many as 40,000 asylum-seekers into the country each year had to be stopped.

Fortuyn proposed that all people who already resided in the Netherlands would be allowed to stay, provided the immigrants adopted the Dutch society's consensus on human rights as their own.<ref name=dl120510>{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/05/10_years_after_pim_fortuyn_was_1.php|title=10 years after Pim Fortuyn was murdered: what the papers say|date=10 May 2012|newspaper=Dutch News|archive-date=9 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509000309/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/05/10_years_after_pim_fortuyn_was_1.php|url-status=dead}}</ref> He stated: "not integrating means leaving" and "the borders have to be hermetically closed".<ref>Oudenampsen (2018), p. 188</ref> He said "If it were legally possible, I'd say no more Muslims will get in here", claiming that the influx of Muslims would threaten freedoms in the liberal Dutch society. He thought Muslim culture had never undergone a process of modernisation and therefore still lacked acceptance of democracy and women's, gays', lesbians' and minorities' rights.

When asked by the Dutch newspaper ''[[Volkskrant]]'' whether he hated Islam, he replied:

<blockquote>I don't hate Islam. I consider it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Protestants]]. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like to keep it that way, thank you very much.<ref>Original quote in Dutch: "Ik haat de islam niet. Ik vind het een achterlijke cultuur. Ik heb veel gereisd in de wereld. En overal waar de islam de baas is, is het gewoon verschrikkelijk. Al die dubbelzinnigheid. Het heeft wel iets weg van die oude gereformeerden. Gereformeerden liegen altijd. En hoe komt dat? Omdat ze een normen- en waardenstelsel hebben dat zo hoog ligt dat je dat menselijkerwijs niet kunt handhaven. Dat zie je in die moslimcultuur ook. Kijk dan naar Nederland. In welk land zou een lijsttrekker van een zo grote beweging als de mijne, openlijk homoseksueel kunnen zijn? Wat fantastisch dat dat kan. Daar mag je trots op zijn. En dat wil ik graag effe zo houden".</ref></blockquote>

Fortuyn used the word ''achterlijk'', literally meaning "backward", but commonly used as an insult in the sense of "[[Retard (pejorative)|retarded]]". After his use of "achterlijk" caused an uproar, Fortuyn said he had used the word with its literal meaning of "backward".<ref name="douglasmurray" />

Fortuyn wrote  ''Against the Islamization of Our Culture'' (1997) (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]).<ref>''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/9022983382 Tegen de islamisering van onze cultuur: Nederlandse identiteit als fundament]'', A.W. Bruna, 1997, {{ISBN|90-229-8338-2}}</ref>

===Fortuynism<!--'Fortuynism' redirects here-->===
The ideology or political style that is derived from Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called '''Fortuynism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged [[elitism]] and bureaucratic style of the Dutch [[Purple (government)#The Netherlands and Belgium|purple coalitions]] or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one "of openness, directness and clearness", [[populism]] or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just ''one'' ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and [[nationalism]].<ref name=m213214>{{harvnb|Mudde|2007|pp=213&ndash;214}}</ref>

[[File:Pim Fortuynplaats 2015.jpg|thumb|''Pim Fortuynplaats'' square in Rotterdam which was named after Fortuyn]]

During the 2002 campaign, Fortuyn was accused by some of being on the "extreme right", although others saw only certain similarities.<ref>{{harvnb|Rydgren|van Holsteyn|200|pp=48–49}}</ref> While he employed anti-immigration rhetoric, he considered himself neither a radical [[nationalism|nationalist]] nor a defender of traditional authoritarian values. On the contrary, Fortuyn claimed he wanted to protect the socio-culturally liberal values of the Netherlands, women's rights and sexual minorities (he was openly homosexual himself), from the "backward" Islamic culture.<ref name=rvh49>Rydgren; van Holsteyn, 2005, p. 49.</ref> He held liberal views favouring the [[drug policy of the Netherlands]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|same-sex marriage]], [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]], and related positions. Fortuyn was also a member of the [[Republican Society]], and favoured a US-style system with an elected president, elected mayors and police commissioners. He also expressed support for the state of [[Israel]] throughout his political career.

The LPF also won support from some ethnic minorities; one of Fortuyn's closest associates was of Cape Verdean origin, and one of the party's MPs was a young woman of Turkish descent.

His ideology comprised the following positions:<ref name="Andeweg, R p.49">[[Rudy Andeweg|Andeweg, R.]] and G. Irwin ''Politics and Governance in the Netherlands'', Basingstoke (Palgrave) p.49</ref>

* [[Civil liberties]]

==Criticism==
[[File:RotterdamGWBurgerPlein060502.png|thumb|Anti-Fortuyn poster of the [[International Socialists (Netherlands)|International Socialists]] with the slogan "Stop de Hollandse Haider" (English: "Stop the Dutch [[Jörg Haider|Haider]]") near Fortuyn's house in Rotterdam on 6 May 2002]]
Fortuyn was compared with the politicians [[Jörg Haider]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in the foreign press. These comparisons were often referred to by Dutch reporters and politicians. An explicit comparison with Le Pen was made by [[Ad Melkert]], then ''[[lijsttrekker]]'' of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], who said in [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]] on 24 April 2002: "If you flirt with Fortuyn, then in the Netherlands the same thing will happen as happened in France. There they woke up with Le Pen, soon we will wake up with Fortuyn."<ref>{{in lang|nl}}: "Als je flirt met Fortuyn, dan gebeurt er in Nederland straks hetzelfde als in Frankrijk. Daar zijn ze wakker geworden met Le Pen, straks worden wij wakker met Fortuyn." quote from article in [[Het Financieele Dagblad]], 25 April 2002.</ref>

On 5 May, the day before the assassination, Fortuyn in a debate with Melkert organized by the ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'' newspaper claimed that he was [[demonization|demonized]]. In it he said that he often had to tell journalists that the image created of him in the media was incorrect.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} {{YouTube|kCupE2LlFoo|"Het laatste debat"}} Nova, 18 juni 2002</ref>

Fortuyn often responded to criticism by stating that his views were misunderstood or distorted by the media, and in turn rejected comparisons and expressed his personal distaste for radical far-right politicians in other European countries. He explicitly distanced himself from Jean-Marie Le Pen and criticised some of his policies, including Le Pen's downplaying of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1966979.stm|title= At home with 'Professor Pim'|last= Lang|first= Kirsty|date= 4 May 2002|website= BBC News|publisher= BBC|access-date= 20 February 2020|archive-date= 23 September 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070923022602/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1966979.stm|url-status= live}}</ref> In domestic politics, Fortuyn also distanced his views from hard-right Dutch politicians such as [[Hans Janmaat]] and [[Joop Glimmerveen]] (who called for the mass expulsion of foreigners from the Netherlands) by maintaining that if he came to power, he would pardon existing illegal immigrants if they had lived in the Netherlands for over five years and offer them a path to citizenship if they could be assimilated into society.

In an interview on the Dutch talk show ''Jensen!'' that was broadcast shortly before his death, Fortuyn accused members of the Dutch government and political establishment of putting his life in danger through repeatedly demonizing him and his beliefs.<ref>{{YouTube|id=B4Sl4CvmjfE|title=Pim Fortuyn: "If Something Were to Happen..."}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Beeld Pim Fortuyn Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Pim Fortuyn monument in [[Rotterdam]]]]
Fortuyn changed the Dutch political landscape.<ref>See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1974184.stm BBC impression] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823202724/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1974184.stm |date=23 August 2007 }} for an early evaluation Retrieved July 2007.</ref> The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn's death, were marked by large losses for the liberal [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and especially the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the [[Pim Fortuyn List]], and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) whose leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] went on to become Prime Minister. Some commentators in the mainstream political class speculated that Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, hence that party's brief surge to 17% of the electoral vote and 26 of the 150 seats in the Dutch Parliament. Others opined that voters who would have otherwise supported the LPF had Fortuyn not been murdered voted for the CDA as Balkenende had not joined in with other party leaders in attacking Fortuyn. Balkenende later claimed to have shared some of Fortuyn's opinions and pledged to implement some of his policy ideas. Although the LPF was able to form a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], it was bereft with internal strife and quickly lost steam. The [[coalition government|coalition]] cabinet of [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] fell within three months, due to infighting within the LPF. In the following elections, the LPF was left with only eight seats in parliament (out of 150) and was not included in the new government. Many of the LPF's successive leaders were not regarded as charismatic as Fortuyn and as the next cabinet under Balkenende continued many of the former coalition's policies, it became harder for the LPF to present an alternative image to the government. However, political commentators speculated that discontented voters might vote for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was at hand. Later, the right-wing [[Party for Freedom]], which has a strong stance on immigration, proposing to deport criminal, unemployed or not assimilated non-western immigrants, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and peaked at 24 in 2010.

The Netherlands has made its asylum policy more strict. Opponents of [[Fortuynism]], such as [[Paul Rosenmöller]], [[Thom de Graaf]], and [[Ad Melkert]] (all labelling Fortuyn as a right-wing extremist),<ref name="documentary">[Documentary] "A Democracy in Shock" (2002).

Contemporary Dutch politics is more polarized than it has been in recent years, especially on the issues for which Fortuyn was best known. People debate the success of their [[multiculturalism|multicultural society]], and whether they need to better [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilate]] newcomers. The government's decision in 2004 to more strictly expel asylum seekers whose applications had failed was controversial. Fortuyn had advocated for a one-time amnesty for those asylum seekers who had resided in the Netherlands for an extended period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3494627.stm|title=Dutch MPs approve asylum exodus|work=BBC News|date=17 February 2004|access-date=26 July 2005|archive-date=21 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121163053/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3494627.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2004, in a TV show, Fortuyn was chosen as [[De Grootste Nederlander]] ("Greatest Dutchman of all-time"), followed closely by [[William I of Orange|William of Orange]], the leader of the independence war that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news|language=nl|url=http://www.planet.nl/planet/show/id=106882/contentid=525037/sc=5ce917|title=Greatest Dutchman|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310014512/http://www.planet.nl/planet/show/id%3D106882/contentid%3D525037/sc%3D5ce917|archive-date=10 March 2005}}</ref> The election was not considered representative, as it was held by viewers' voting through the internet and by phoning in. [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] had been murdered a few days before by a Muslim, which likely affected people's voting in the TV contest for Fortuyn. The program later revealed that William of Orange had received the most votes, but many could not be counted until after the official closing time of the television show (and the proclamation of the winner), due to technical problems. The official rules of the show said that votes counted before the end of the show would be decisive, but it was suggested that all votes correctly cast before the closing of the vote would be counted. Following the official rules, the outcome was not changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/443284/pim-fortuyn-toch-niet-de-grootste-nederlander.html|title=nu.nl/algemeen &#124; 'Pim Fortuyn toch niet de Grootste Nederlander'|date=16 November 2004|publisher=Nu.nl|access-date=13 June 2010|archive-date=10 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610210756/http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/443284/pim-fortuyn-toch-niet-de-grootste-nederlander.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
