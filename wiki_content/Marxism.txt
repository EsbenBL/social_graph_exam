'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that uses a [[materialist]] interpretation of historical development, better known as [[historical materialism]], to understand [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] as well as a [[dialectic]]al perspective to view [[social transformation]]. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. As Marxism has developed over time into various branches and [[schools of thought]], there is currently no single definitive [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff, Richard, and Stephen Resnick|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|date=August 1987|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]]]]
Marxism seeks to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society by analyzing the material conditions and [[Economics|economic activities]] required to fulfill human material needs. It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics and ideologies. These social relations, together with the economic system, form a [[base and superstructure]]. As [[forces of production]] (i.e. [[technology]]) improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. [[Karl Marx]] wrote: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of [[social revolution]]."<ref>[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]]. 1859. "Introduction." ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.</ref>

These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society which are, in turn, fought out at the level of [[Class conflict|class struggle]].<ref name="ComparingEconomic">Gregory, Paul R., and Robert C. Stuart. 2003. "Marx's Theory of Change." In ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (7th ed.). {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 62.</ref> Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority who own the [[means of production]] (the [[bourgeoisie]]) and the vast majority of the population who produce goods and services (the [[proletariat]]). Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs as result of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who contradict one another, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a [[socialist]] society, [[private property]]—as the means of production—would be replaced by [[co-operative]] ownership. A [[socialist economy]] would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[production for use]]. [[Friedrich Engels]] explained that "the capitalist mode of appropriation, in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the products that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production — on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment."<ref>[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]] (1882). [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm "Historical Materialism"]. Part 3 in ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]''.</ref>

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as [[Economic stability|economically unsustainable]] and incapable of improving the [[Standard of living|living standards]] of the population due to its need to compensate for [[falling rate of profit]] by cutting employees' wages and [[Welfare|social benefits]] while pursuing military aggression. The [[socialist mode of production]] would succeed [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] as humanity's [[mode of production]] through [[revolution]] by workers. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], socialism is not an inevitability but an economic necessity.<ref>''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' (1852). [[Free will]], non-[[predestination]] and non-[[determinism]] are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history."</ref>

=== Etymology ===
The term ''Marxism'' was popularized by [[Karl Kautsky]], who considered himself an ''[[orthodox Marxist]]'' during the dispute between the orthodox and ''[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]]'' followers of Marx.<ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19">[[Georges Haupt|Haupt, Georges]], Peter Fawcett, and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. 2010. ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871–1914: Essays by Georges Haupt'' (paperback ed.). Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].</ref>{{rp|18–19}} Kautsky's revisionist rival [[Eduard Bernstein]] also later adopted use of the term.<ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"/>{{rp|18–19}}

Engels did not support the use of the term ''Marxism'' to describe either Marx's or his own views.<ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"/>{{rp|12}} He claimed that the term was being abusively used as a rhetorical [[Grammatical modifier|qualifier]] by those attempting to cast themselves as real followers of Marx while casting others in different terms such as ''[[Lassallians]]''.<ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"/>{{rp|12}} In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed Marxist [[Paul Lafargue]] by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered Marxist, then "one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist."<ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"/>{{rp|12}}

Marxism uses a [[materialist]] methodology, referred to by Marx and Engels as the materialist conception of history and later better known as historical materialism, to analyse the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways in which humans make their living.<ref>Evans, p. 53.</ref> Marx's account of the theory is in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845)<ref>Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich (1932) [1845].

Retrieved 11 July 2020 – via Marxists Internet Archive.</ref> All constituent features of a society ([[social class]]es, political pyramid and [[ideologies]]) are assumed to stem from economic activity, forming what is considered as the [[base and superstructure]]. The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx, the "sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base.<ref>Chambre, Henri; [[David McLellan (political scientist)|McLellan, David T.]] (2020) [1998]. "Marxism". [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Marxism#ref35144 "Historical materialism"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved 11 July 2020.</ref>

The base includes the material [[forces of production]] such as the [[Means of labor|labour]], [[means of production]] and [[relations of production]], i.e. the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of [[social consciousness]]" that derive from the economic base that conditions both the superstructure and the [[dominant ideology]] of a society. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes [[social revolution]]s, whereby changes to the economic base leads to the [[social transformation]] of the superstructure.<ref>Marx, Karl. [1859] 1977. "[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface]." ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.

This relationship is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]], in that the base initially gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of [[social organization]]. Those newly formed social organizations can then act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that rather than being static, the relationship is [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. [[Freedmen's Bureau|Freeman]] and [[Slavery|slave]], [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[Plebs|plebeian]], [[Feudal lord|lord]] and [[Serfdom|serf]], [[guild]]-master and [[journeyman]], in a word, [[Oppressors–oppressed distinction|oppressor and oppressed]], stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes."<ref>[[Marx, Karl]], and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marx considered recurring class conflicts as the driving force of human history as such conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct [[Transition economy|transitional]] stages of development in [[Western Europe]]. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:
# [[Primitive communism]]: co-operative [[tribal]] societies.
# [[Slavery|Slave society]]: development of tribal to [[city-state]] in which [[aristocracy]] is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the [[ruling class]] while [[merchant]]s evolve into the [[bourgeoisie]].
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the [[proletariat]].

While historical materialism has been referred to as a materialist theory of history, Marx did not claim to have produced a master-key to history and that the materialist conception of history is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche générale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself."

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{further|Anti-capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
According to the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary socialist [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine."<ref>[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.</ref> Marx believed that the capitalist [[bourgeoisie]] and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are ... one and the same." He believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.<ref>[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].</ref>

[[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]] is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour performed beyond what is received in goods. Exploitation has been a [[socioeconomic]] feature of every [[class society]] and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of other classes. Under capitalism, the [[labour theory of value]] is the operative concern, whereby the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under such condition, [[surplus value]]—the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer—is synonymous with the term ''surplus labour'' and capitalist exploitation is thus realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In [[Pre-industrial society|pre-capitalist economies]], exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical [[coercion]]. Under the capitalist mode of production, those results are more subtly achieved because workers do not own the means of production and must "voluntarily" enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the voluntary nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory; it is production, not circulation, that causes exploitation. Marx emphasised that capitalism ''per se'' does not cheat the worker.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] (German: ''Entfremdung'') is the estrangement of people from their humanity, and a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers. In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.<ref>"Alienation". ''A Dictionary of Sociology''.</ref>

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Class conflict|Classless society|Social class|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria, i.e. ownership of means of production and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[T]he class of modern [[wage labour]]ers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|author-link1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref> The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions that enable the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat as the worker's labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the worker's [[wages|wage]].
** [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society, such as the criminals, [[Vagrancy|vagabonds]], [[Begging|beggars]], or [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in national, let alone [[International economics|international]], economic affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* Bourgeoisie: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]]: those who work and can afford to buy little labour power (i.e. [[Small business|small business owners]], [[peasant]]s [[landlord]]s and trade workers). Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the [[middle class]] to the proletariat.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and farmers: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.
Class consciousness denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses as well as its capacity to rationally act in their best interests. Class consciousness is required before a social class can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining ''[[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]]'',<ref>McCarney, Joseph. 2005.

Blunden. Archived from the [http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm original] on 9 May 2013.</ref> Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces."<ref>Engels, Friedrich.

London: [[International Publishers]].</ref>

Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (i.e. the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''[[The German Ideology]]'', Marx says that "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=The German Ideology. Karl Marx 1845|website=Marxists.org}}</ref> The term ''[[political economy]]'' initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

This new way of thinking was invented because [[socialists]] believed that [[common ownership]] of the means of production (i.e. the [[Industry (economics)|industries]], land, wealth of nature, trade apparatus and wealth of the society) would abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the [[State (polity)|state]] (which Marxists saw as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and (by implementing a commonly owned, democratically controlled workplace) create the society of [[communism]] which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labour is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labour costs by paying the workers less and figuring out how to use cheaper equipment. This allows the employer to extract the largest amount of work and therefore potential wealth from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society, in that one small group of society exploits the larger group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Through [[common ownership]] of the means of production, the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is the property of the society as a whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, as the state has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, it will [[Withering away of the state|wither away]] as its conditions of existence have disappeared.<ref name="Origins of the Family- Chapter IX">{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="ZhaoDickson2001">{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

=== Communism, revolution and socialism ===
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Left-wing protester wielding a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both symbols of revolutionary socialism]]
According to ''The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx'', "Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist society—positive humanism, socialism, Communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that 'socialism' and 'Communism' are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death."<ref>Hudis, Peter; Vidal, Matt, Smith, Tony; Rotta, Tomás; Prew, Paul, eds.

According to [[orthodox Marxist]] theory, the overthrow of [[capitalism]] by a [[socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity. Marxists argue that a [[socialist]] society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: "The [[Socialization as a process|socialization of production]] is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society. ... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour."<ref>[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. pp. 35–36.</ref> The failure of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], along with the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of [[World War I]], led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a [[theory of imperialism]].<ref>Kuruma, Samezo. 1929.

== Schools of thought ==
=== Classical ===
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
Classical Marxism denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. As [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "Marxism is always open, always critical, always self-critical." Classical Marxism distinguishes ''Marxism'' as broadly perceived from "what Marx believed." In 1883, Marx wrote to his son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]] and French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle. From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase, "If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist." Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and "of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')."<ref>Marx, Karl; Guesde, Jules (1880).

American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: "There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike."<ref>Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].</ref>

=== Libertarian ===
{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}
Libertarian Marxism emphasizes the [[anti-authoritarian]] and [[libertarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism such as [[left communism]] emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]].<ref>[[Herman Gorter|Gorter, Herman]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], and [[Otto Rühle]]. 2007. ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black.</ref>

Libertarian Marxism is often critical of [[reformist]] positions such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'';<ref>[[Ernesto Screpanti|Screpanti, Ernesto]]. 2007. ''Libertarian Communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom''. London: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].</ref> emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] to mediate or aid its liberation.<ref>[[Hal Draper|Draper, Hal]]. 1971. "[https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333 The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels]."

Libertarian Marxism includes currents such as [[autonomism]], [[council communism]], [[De Leonism]], [[Letterist International|Lettrism]], parts of the [[New Left]], [[Situationism]], [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] and [[workerism]].<ref name="map">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map |title=A libertarian Marxist tendency map |publisher=Libcom.org |access-date=2013-10-11}}</ref> Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchy|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[C. L. R.

=== Humanist ===
{{main|Marxist humanism}}
Marxist humanism is an international body of thought and political action rooted in an interpretation of the works of [[Karl Marx]]. It is an investigation into "what human nature consists of and what sort of society would be most conducive to human thriving"{{sfn|Alderson|2017|p=17}} from a critical perspective rooted in [[Marxist philosophy]]. Marxist humanists argue that Marx himself was concerned with investigating similar questions.{{sfn|Smith|1998}}

Marxist humanism was born in 1932 with the publication of Marx's ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and reached a degree of prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. Marxist humanists contend that there is continuity between the early philosophical writings of Marx, in which he develops his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], and the structural description of [[capitalist]] society found in his later works such as ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]''.{{sfnm |1a1=Fromm |1y=1966 | 1pp=69-79 |2a1=Petrović |2y=1967 |2pp=35–51}} They hold that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to understand his later works properly.{{sfn|Marcuse|1973|pp=1–48}}

Contrary to the official [[dialectical materialism]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and to interpretations of Marx rooted in the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], Marxist humanists argue that Marx's work was an extension or transcendence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] [[humanism]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Spencer |first=Robert |date=17 February 2017 |title=Why We Need Marxist-Humanism Now |url=https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/marxist-humanism-now/ |location=London |publisher=Pluto Press |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref> Where other Marxist philosophies see Marxism as a [[natural science]], Marxist humanism reaffirms the doctrine of "man is the measure of all things"&nbsp;– that humans are essentially different to the rest of the [[Natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] and should be treated so by Marxist theory.{{sfn|Edgley|1991|p=420}}

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|[[V. Gordon Childe]], an Australian archaeologist and one of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics]]
According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of [[social science]] professors and 5.0% of [[humanities]] professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |author1-link=Neil Gross |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |chapter=The Social and Political Views of American College and University Professors |pages=19–50 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1vCAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19 |editor1-last=Gross |editor1-first=Neil |editor2-last=Simmons |editor2-first=Solon |title=Professors and Their Politics |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-1-4214-1335-8 |doi=10.1353/book.31449 }}</ref>

=== Archaeology ===
{{main|Marxist archaeology}}
The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture"; within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of General Secretary [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.<ref>[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.</ref>

These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]], who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.<ref>[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.</ref>

=== Sociology ===
{{main|Marxist criminology|Marxist sociology}}
Marxist sociology, as the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective,<ref name="black">Johnson, Allan G. 2000.

Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

=== Economics ===

Marxian economics is a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}</ref> Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]] such as [[creative destruction]] have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

=== Education ===
Marxist education develops Marx's works and those of the movements he influenced in various ways.

=== Historiography ===
{{main|Marxist historiography}}
Marxist historiography is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism, the chief tenets of which are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' about the [[German Peasants' War]] which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''[[History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)]]'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

While some members of the group, most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]], left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R.

=== Literary criticism ===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
Marxist literary criticism is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[dialectic]] theories. Marxist criticism views [[Literature|literary works]] as reflections of the [[Institution|social institutions]] from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable Marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]], and [[Fredric Jameson]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

=== Aesthetics ===
{{main|Marxist aesthetics}}
Marxist aesthetics is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art and beauty, among others. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Ernst Fischer (writer)|Ernst Fischer]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Raymond Williams]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Friedrich Engels]] in 1877]]
Marx addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."<ref>''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.</ref>

Together with Marx, Engels co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)—analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

[[File:Lenin and stalin.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]]]
With the [[October Revolution]] in 1917 the [[Bolsheviks]] took power from the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. The Bolsheviks established the first [[socialist state]] based on the ideas of [[soviet democracy]] and [[Leninism]]. Their newly formed federal state promised to end Russian involvement in [[World War I]] and establish a revolutionary worker's state. Following the October Revolution the Soviet government was involved in a struggle with the [[White Movement]] and several independence movements in the [[Russian Civil War]]. This period is marked by the establishment of many socialist policies and the development of new socialist ideas mainly in the form of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

In 1919, the nascent Soviet Government established the [[Communist Academy]] and the [[Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute]] for doctrinal Marxist study as well as to publish official ideological and research documents for the Russian Communist Party. With Lenin's death in 1924, there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] in the form of the [[Right Opposition]] and [[Left Opposition]] respectively. These struggles were based on both sides different interpretations of Marxist and Leninist theory based on the situation of the [[Soviet Union]] at the time.<ref>History.com Staff (2020) [2009].

{{quote box|quote=The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable. We should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action. Studying it is not merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-Leninism as the science of revolution.

At the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and more widely [[World War II]], the Chinese Communist Revolution took place within the context of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The [[Chinese Communist Party]], which was founded in 1921, was in conflict with the [[Kuomintang]] over the future of the country. Throughout the Civil War [[Mao Zedong]] developed a theory of Marxism for the Chinese historical context. Mao found a large base of support in the peasantry as opposed to the Russian Revolution which found its primary support in the urban centers of the Russian Empire. Some major ideas contributed by Mao were the ideas of [[New Democracy]], [[mass line]] and [[people's war]]. The [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was declared in 1949. The new socialist state was to be founded on the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.<ref>

From Stalin's death until the late 1960s, there was increasing conflict between China and the Soviet Union. [[De-Stalinization]], which first began under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and the policy of [[detente]], were seen as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] and insufficiently Marxist. This ideological confrontation spilled into a wider global crisis centered around which nation was to lead the international socialist movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm|title=1964: On Khrushchov's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>

Following Mao's death and the ascendancy of [[Deng Xiaoping]], Maoism and official Marxism in China was reworked. This new model was to be a newer dynamic form of Marxism–Leninism and Maoism in China. Commonly referred to as socialism with Chinese Characteristics this new path was centered around Deng's [[Four Cardinal Principles]] which sought to uphold the central role of the Chinese Communist Party and uphold the principle that China was in the [[primary stage of socialism]] and that it was still working to build a communist society based on Marxist principles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schram |first1=Stuart |year=1989 |title = The Thought of Mao Tse-Tung |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn = 9780521310628 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/dengxp/vol2/text/b1290.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827102126/http://en.people.cn/dengxp/vol2/text/b1290.html |archive-date=27 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly socialist, upon victory Castro ascended to the position of prime minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.<ref>[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].</ref><ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]].</ref> One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), although the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He posthumously went on to become an internationally recognised icon.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

In the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to purge Chinese society of capitalist elements and achieve socialism. Upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]], many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in Western politics championed by United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] led the West to take a more aggressive stand towards the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]], led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/12/resources/5037?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&pid=mssa:ms.0650&query=&clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&hlon=yes&big=&adv=&filter=&hitPageStart=&sortFields=&view=all|title=Collection: Cuban revolution collection &#124; Archives at Yale|website=Archives.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>D'Encausse, Helene Carrere. 1993.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]"; dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Stalinist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist [[Gianni Vattimo]] and [[Santiago Zabala]] in their 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply."<ref>Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala.

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection. ... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars."<ref>[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.</ref>

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|year=1975|orig-year=1973|title=The Mirror of Production|translator=Mark Poster|location=New York|publisher=Telos Press|isbn=9780914386063}}</ref> Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]].

=== General ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles." Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense"; he believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.<ref>{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.<ref>M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.</ref>

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.<ref>See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.</ref> [[Andrew Kliman]] argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.<ref name=":0">Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', 20 & 27 Oct. 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."</ref>

=== Epistemological and empirical ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.<ref>Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref>

=== Socialist ===
[[Democratic socialism|Democratic socialists]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.<ref name=Bakunin1872>{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|author-link=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm|website=Marxists.org}}</ref> The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].<ref name="Sperber_2013">{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W.

[[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]] "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas. While acknowledging the latent authoritarianism in Marx, Chomsky also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. His commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings.{{fact|date=July 2020}}

Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,<ref>V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press</ref> [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907<ref>Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.</ref> and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.<ref>M. C. Howard and J. E. King.

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/what-we-can-know-about-world|title=What We Can Know About the World|date=1 December 2009|website=Mises.org|access-date=4 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=von Mises |first1=Ludwig |title=Omnipotent Government |date=2008 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4437-2646-7 |url=https://mises.org/library/omnipotent-government-rise-total-state-and-total-war }}{{pn|date=July 2020}}</ref> During the [[Marginal utility#Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined{{according to whom|date=October 2020}} the British cost theories of value.{{Fact|date=October 2020}} The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. [[Gottfried Haberler]] has regarded his criticism as "definitive", arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so "thorough and devastating" that he believes that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haberler |first1=Gottfried |author1-link=Gottfried Haberler |editor1-last=Drachkovitch |editor1-first=Milorad M. |editor1-link=Milorad M.

This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]."<ref name="Mises">{{cite book |title=Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth |date=18 August 2014 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=978-1-61016-454-2 |url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf }}{{pn|date=July 2020}}</ref>

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=1 February 2015 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=3–28 |doi=10.1257/jep.29.1.3 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766 |hdl=1721.1/113636 |s2cid=14001669 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>
