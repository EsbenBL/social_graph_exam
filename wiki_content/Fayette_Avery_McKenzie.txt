[[File:Society of American Indians, 1911.png|thumb|[[Society of American Indians]], 1911.]]
In 1911, he was a European-American co-founder and a leader of the [[Society of American Indians]] (SOI), which was formed at [[Ohio State University]]. He was a professor there from 1905 to 1914. McKenzie, who encouraged the growth of the organization to one that was one that was operated by Native Americans,<ref name="SOI Mission">{{Cite web |title=An Urgent Mission  |url=https://carmencollection.osu.edu/story/urgent-mission |access-date=2021-12-01 |website=Carmen Collection, Ohio State University |language=en}}</ref> invited six Native American intellectuals—professionals, activists, clergy, speakers, writers, and entertainers—to a meeting at Ohio State University in April 1911.<ref name="SOI Mission" /><ref name="Oxford" /> The attendees of the first annual conference included Dr. [[Charles Eastman]], ([[Santee Dakota]]), physician; Dr. [[Carlos Montezuma]], ([[Yavapai people|Yavapai]]-[[Apache]]), physician; [[Thomas L. Sloan]], ([[Omaha people|Omaha]]), attorney; [[Charles Edwin Dagenett]], ([[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria]]), Bureau of Indian Affairs supervisor; [[Laura Cornelius Kellogg]], ([[Oneida people|Oneida]]), educator; and [[Henry Standing Bear]], ([[Oglala Lakota]]), educator.<ref> {{citation|first1=Christopher L. |last1=Nicholson|title=To Advance a Race: A Historical Analysis of the Personal Belief, Industrial Philanthropy and Black Liberal Arts Higher Education in Fayette McKenzie's Presidency at Fisk University, 1915–1925"| publisher= Loyola University | location=Chicago |date= May 2011 | page= 64}}</ref> There were also representatives of the offices of the National Office of Indian Affairs, Ohio governor, Columbus mayor, and the university.<ref name="OSU Ancient Modern" /> 

The group founded the American Indian Association. Later renamed the Society of American Indians it was created to fight against restrictive governmental policies against Native Americans.<ref name="SOI Mission" /><ref name="Oxford">{{Cite web |last=Lomawaima |first=K.

For the period between 1911 and 1923, SOI conducted annual conferences; networked with allies, critics, and reformers; lobbied the [[Office of Indian Affairs]] (OIA) and [[United States Congress|Congress]]; offered legal assistance to Native individuals; and published a journal.<ref name="Oxford" /> It sought to “bring together all progressive Indians and friends of Indian progress for the purpose of promoting the highest interests of the race and the individual."<ref name="SOI Mission" /> To do so meant to appreciate time-honored cultural traditions, except those practices that kept Native Americans from succeeding in a modern world. It sought to ensure equal rights and opportunities as those afforded to the whites.<ref name="SOI Mission" />

The society was challenged, though, by the number of varying cultures of Native American peoples across the country, as they tried to negotiate unified goals and positions.<ref name="Oxford" /> The organization dissolved in 1923, but one year later the Native Americans received birthright citizenship in the United States with the [[Indian Citizenship Act]], tempered by continued wardship status. The [[Indian Claims Commission]] was created in 1946 to mediate claims out of court that could result in monetary damages. They could not regain lands as part of this process.<ref name="Oxford" />

He was a member of a number of civic organizations throughout his career and retirement. In 1910, he worked on the census with [[Roland B. Dixon]]. For three years beginning in 1912 he served the State Conference of Charities and Correction as chairman of Universities and Social Welfare section.<ref name="TN papers" /> In 1931, he was the director for Huntingdon's Community Center Work.
