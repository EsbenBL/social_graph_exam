'''Adil Abdul-Mahdi al-Muntafiki''' ({{lang-ar|عادل عبد المهدي المنتفكي}}, born 1 January 1942) is an [[Iraq|Iraqi]] [[politician]]  who served as [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] from October 2018 until May 2020. Abdul-Mahdi is an [[economist]] and was one of the [[Vice President of Iraq|vice presidents of Iraq]] from 2005 to 2011. He formerly served as [[Ministry of Finance (Iraq)|minister of finance]] in the [[Iraqi Interim Government|Interim government]] and Oil Minister from 2014 to 2016.{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Abdul-Mahdi is a former member of the powerful Shi'a party the [[Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council]], or SIIC.<ref name=sfc/> Long based in neighboring [[Iran]], the group opposed a [[United States]] administration while holding close ties with the other, U.S.-backed, groups that opposed [[Saddam Hussein]], including the [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]] and the [[Iraqi National Congress]].

== Background ==
Mahdi was born in Baghdad in 1942, the son of a Shiite [[cleric]], Abdul-Mahdi, originally from [[Dhi Qar Governorate]], who was the Minister of Education in Iraq's [[monarchy]]. He attended high school at [[Baghdad College]], an elite American Jesuit secondary school. After graduating, he attended [[Baghdad University]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]] in 1963. He worked as a secretary for the Iraqi foreign ministry in 1965 and was an early supporter of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Ba'ath Party]], but left due to ideological disagreements. In 1969, he moved to [[France]] where he worked for French [[think tank]]s and edited magazines in French and Arabic. In 1972 he obtained another [[Master of Arts]] degree in political economy from the [[University of Poitiers]]. He later obtained a PhD in economics.<ref>[https://eng.majalla.com/node/47586/adil-adbul-mahdi-iraq%E2%80%99s-new-prime-minister Adil Adbul Mahdi Iraq’s New Prime Minister].</ref>

== Political career ==
{{further|Government of Iraq from 2006}}

In the 1970s, Abdul-Mahdi was a leading member of the [[Iraqi Communist Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/03102018|title=Abdul-Mahdi: The man tasked with forming Iraq's new government|publisher=Rudaw|date=3 October 2018|access-date=4 October 2018}}</ref> The party split into two separate factions, the ICP-Central Committee, which was more accommodating of the military governments that had ruled Iraq since 1958, and the ICP-Central Leadership, which rejected all forms of cooperation of what it regarded as anti-progressive regimes, in 1967. Abdul-Mahdi joined the ICP-Central Leadership, and continued being active until it gradually disappeared by the early 1980s. By that time, Abdul-Mahdi adopted [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Islamic]] ideas, eventually merging with the Islamists when [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] eradicated the communists and other liberal opposition groups in [[Iran]]. Abdul-Mahdi continued his association with Iran and gradually amalgamated his group within the ICP-Central Leadership with the Iranians, rejecting his [[Marxist]] past and devoting all his group's time to propagating Khomeini's ideas in [[France]], where he lived at the time. He eventually was made a member of the [[Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq]], an exiled opposition party and militia that was formed by Iran in Tehran in 1982 but composed exclusively of Iraqi exiles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ismail |first=Tariq |title=The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |page=239 |isbn=978-0-521-87394-9 }}</ref>

In 2006, Abdul-Mahdi, outgoing Vice President in the [[Iraqi Transitional Government|transitional government]], unsuccessfully ran for the [[United Iraqi Alliance]]'s nomination for Prime Minister against incumbent [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]]. He lost by one vote. He was reportedly considered to be a possibility for Prime Minister once again until [[Nouri al-Maliki]] became the [[National Iraqi Alliance|UIA]] nominee. Subsequently, Abdul-Mahdi was re-elected as [[Vice President of Iraq]]. He exerted his limited authority in that role by delaying the first meeting of the National Assembly in March. He resigned from his position as vice-president on 31 May 2011.<ref>[http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/168077/معاون-اول-رئیس-جمهور-عراق-استعفا-داد]</ref>

In December 2006, the Associated Press reported that Abdul-Mahdi could be the next Prime Minister of Iraq if a new multi-sectarian coalition succeeded in toppling the government of [[Nouri al-Maliki]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Talks Under Way to Replace Iraq PM|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/10/AR2006121000633.html|access-date=27 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 December 2006|author=Hamza Hendawi|author2=Qassim Abdul Zahra|agency=AP|location=Baghdad}}</ref>

On 26 February 2007, he survived an assassination attempt that killed ten people. He had been targeted two times prior.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sly|first=Liz|title=VP survives assassination try in Iraq|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-02-27/news/0702270273_1_bomb-baghdad-ministry-sciri|access-date=27 December 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=27 February 2007|location=Baghdad}}</ref>

In 2009, his bodyguards were the perpetrators of a bloody bank robbery in Baghdad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/world/middleeast/03iraq.html?pagewanted=all|title=In Bank Killings, Highs and Lows of Iraq Justice|author1=Rod Nordland|author2=Riyadh Mohammed|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=4 October 2018|date=2 September 2009}}</ref>

In July 2013, Abdul-Mahdi announced his decision to give up his retirement pensions as a former vice president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iraqinews.com/baghdad-politics/adil-abdul-mahdi-gives-up-his-pensions/|title=Adil Abdul Mahdi gives up his pensions|last=Hussein|first=Ahmed|date=30 July 2013|website=Iraqi News|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref>

On 2 October 2018, Iraqi president [[Barham Salih]] selected Abdul-Mahdi to be the Prime Minister of Iraq. Mahdi had 30 days to form a new government.<ref name=sfc/> On 25 October 2018, Abdul Mahdi was sworn into office, five months after the [[2018 Iraqi parliamentary election|2018 elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/24102018|title=Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi sworn in with 14 ministers, so far|publisher=Rudaw}}</ref>

In April 2019, Abdul-Mahdi met with [[Germany|German]] [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] in [[Berlin]]. He announced a $14 billion plan to upgrade Iraq's electricity infrastructure, with likely cooperation with German company [[Siemens]]. Merkel also pledged to strengthen economic and security cooperation between the two countries, and to continue German support for reconstruction efforts in Iraq.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/merkel-germany-supports-territorial-integrity-of-iraq/1466466#|title=Merkel: Germany supports territorial integrity of Iraq|last=Şimşek|first=Ayhan|date=30 April 2019|website=Anadolu Agency|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

== Resignation ==
On 29 November 2019, after [[2019 Iraqi protests|weeks of violent protests]], Mahdi stated that he would resign from his post.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/29/iraq-pm-resign-protests-abdul-mahdi-al-sistani Iraqi PM says he will resign after weeks of killing protests] - Guardian(29 November 2019)</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50600495 Iraq unrest: PM Abdul Mahdi to resign after bloodiest day in protests] - BBC(29 December 2019)</ref> The Iraqi parliament approved his resignation on 1 December 2019.
