'''Steve William Fuller''' (born 12 July 1959) is an American [[social philosophy|social philosopher]] in the field of [[science and technology studies]].  He has published in the areas of [[social epistemology]], [[academic freedom]], and the subjects of [[intelligent design]] and [[transhumanism]].

==Biography==

Fuller attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite book|access-date=4 August 2014|last=Fuller|first=Steve |title=Science vs. Religion? Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution |page=9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1P22AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |date= 2007|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=9780745673493}}</ref> Admitted as a John Jay Scholar to [[Columbia University]], he majored in History and Sociology and graduated summa cum laude in 1979. Awarded a Kellett Fellowship, he studied at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], and received an M.Phil. in History and Philosophy of Science in 1981. He earned his Ph.D. in the same subject from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985, where he was an Andrew Mellon Pre-Doctoral Fellow. Fuller's doctoral dissertation, "Bounded Rationality in Law and Science", explored the implications of the views of [[Herbert A. Simon]] for political theory and philosophy of science.

Fuller held assistant and associate professorships at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1994, he was appointed to the chair in sociology and social policy at the [[University of Durham]], [[England]]. He moved in 1999 to the [[University of Warwick]], England. In July 2007 Fuller was awarded a [[D. Litt.]] by Warwick in recognition of "published work or papers which demonstrate a high standard of important original work forming a major contribution to a subject".<ref>[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/warwickpeople/higher_doctorates_for/  Higher Doctorates for Warwick People], [[University of Warwick]]</ref> In 2008, Fuller served as President of the Sociology section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In that capacity, he staged a play, "Lincoln and Darwin—Live for One Night Only!", at the BA's annual Festival of Science in Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403503 |title=On stage, On the Origin ... author endures a dramatic trial of faith |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= 2008-09-10|access-date=1 September 2012}}</ref> The play was later produced as a podcast in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |title=Lincoln and Darwin for one night only |publisher=Sci Phi Journal |date=11 February 2009 |access-date=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215015/http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |archive-date=26 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Work==
Fuller is most closely associated with [[social epistemology]] as an interdisciplinary research program. Social [[epistemology]] is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences. Fuller founded the first journal (1987)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=tsep20#.VJ6H3V4gMA | title=Social Epistemology}}</ref> and wrote the first book (1988)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the end of knowledge|date=1993|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|page=xii}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-jJmvfREmQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Social+Epistemology%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K4qeVPCNAo3sasbwgrAF&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20Epistemology%22&f=false ]</ref> devoted to this topic. The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach, already present in his 1988 book, is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of [[scepticism]].

Along with 21 books, Fuller has written 65 book chapters, 155 academic articles and many minor pieces. He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses, and has presented to academic and non-academic audiences throughout the world, including over 100 media interviews. His works have been translated into fifteen languages. 23 academic symposia have been published on his work. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1994, the year he organized a conference in Durham on "Science's Social Standing".<ref name="CV"/>

Since moving to the UK, Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression, including television, radio and internet, which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology. Two of his books have been recognised in this regard. ''[[Kuhn vs. Popper]]'' was Book of the Month for February 2005 in the US mass circulation magazine, ''Popular Science''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mone |first=Gregory |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=13 July 1965 |access-date=1 September 2012}}</ref> However, [[Rupert Read]] wrote: "I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless. ...

===Academic freedom===

Fuller believes (modeled on what he takes to be the German model) that [[academic freedom]] is a freedom reserved for academics, not a special case of freedom of speech.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = Steve | last2 = Haworth | first2 = Alan | title = Academic freedom | journal = [[The Philosophers' Magazine]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–77 | doi = 10.5840/tpm20073864 | date = 2007 }} Debating the [http://www.afaf.org.uk/afaf-statement/ "statement of academic freedom"] made by Academics for Academic Freedom (AFAF).</ref> This includes the right to "cause reasoned offence", if within the terms of reason and evidence appropriate to the academic profession.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/against-the-grain-it-is-an-academics-right-to-cause-reasoned-offence-455905.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109223024/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/against-the-grain-it-is-an-academics-right-to-cause-reasoned-offence-455905.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=9 November 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Against the grain: It is an academic's right to cause 'reasoned' offence | first=Nick | last=Jackson | date=5 July 2007 | access-date=24 May 2010}}</ref> He believes it important for academics to be able to express intellectual opinions for further debate which can result in progress. He also argues that students are equally entitled to academic freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410297 |title=A clear and present danger |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= 2010-02-11|access-date=1 September 2012}}</ref>

===Intelligent design===
Fuller has made many statements about his support for the teaching of [[intelligent design]] (ID) and authored two books on the subject. In 2005, in the case of ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', he testified on behalf of a local school system in the United States that required the teaching of intelligent design. The decision of the U.S. District Court held that intelligent design was a form of [[creationism]] and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]]. The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position. Some of Fuller's critics within the [[Science and Technology Studies]] community described his participation in the trial as "naive" and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Lynch | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist) | title = From Ruse to Farce | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–826  | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067897 | date = December 2006 | s2cid = 143851225 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmond | first1 = Gary | last2 = Mercer | first2 = David | title = Anti-social epistemologies | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 843–853 | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067900 | date = December 2006| s2cid = 145069147 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/897465 }}</ref>

Fuller has said that he does not support intelligent design "but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money{{'"}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=Steve Fuller: Designer trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/31/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|work=The Guardian |location=London|date=1 February 2006}}</ref> In his book ''Dissent over Descent'', he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=8–9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200538&sectioncode=26 Schools for the Enlightenment or epiphany?: Steve Fuller], [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]], 25 December 2005</ref> Critics have called his views on science [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], though others characterise them as more closely related to [[Social constructionism#Postmodernism|social constructionism]].<ref>[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf Brief for Amicus Curiae, Scipolicy Journal of Science and Health Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204245/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''</ref><ref>[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Fuller.cfm Steve Fuller and The Hidden Agenda of Social Constructivism], Norman Levitt, Talk Reason</ref>

On 21 February 2007, Fuller debated [[Lewis Wolpert]] at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] on whether evolution and intelligent design should be accorded equal status as scientific theories. Fuller supported the proposition. Fuller endorsed a work in support of Intelligent Design, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s textbook ''[[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism]]'' (2007).<ref>[http://exploreevolution.com/endorsements.php Endorsements], [[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism|Explore Evolution]] website</ref>

Appearing in the 2008 film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', Fuller told an interviewer:<ref name=expelled>''Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed'' (2008 film). Rocky Mountain Pictures. Directed by Nathan Frankowski.</ref>
{{quote|If you take seriously that evolution has to do with the transition of life forms, and that life and death are just natural processes, then one gets to be liberal about abortion and euthanasia. All of those kinds of ideas seem to me follow very naturally from a Darwinian perspective – a deprivileging of human beings, basically. And I think people who want to endorse Darwinism have to take this kind of viewpoint very seriously.}}

Fuller openly acknowledges that while some people simply do not like or accept either 'design in nature' or that human beings were created "in the image and likeness of God" (''imago Dei''), many people do and that it has been a consistent fixture in the progress, development and motivation for doing modern science.<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ51gVtJAw | first=Steve | last=Fuller |title="Why some people like the idea of design in nature and others don't" |work=University of Cambridge |date=14 July 2012 |access-date= 19 April 2015}}</ref>

===Transhumanism===
Much of his work focuses on questions around technological enhancements and how they can improve the capacities of human beings.<ref>[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/bio/fuller/ Steve Fuller]. Ieet.org. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.</ref> Fuller argues that the pursuit for enhancements is based on a need ″to create some distance between ourselves and the other animals.″ <ref>{{cite news  | first=Kevin | last=Holmes | title = Talking to the future humans – Steve Fuller | url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/talking-to-the-future-humans-steve-fuller-transhumanism | work=Vice Media | date= 29 September 2011 | access-date= 15 February 2015 }}</ref> For Fuller, transhumanism offers humanity the prospect "to re-engineer the human body to enable us to live longer so as to work and play harder."<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Humanity 2.0|url=https://archive.org/details/humanitywhatitme00full|url-access=limited|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230233423|page=[https://archive.org/details/humanitywhatitme00full/page/n250 242]}}</ref>

==Principal works==

===''Science Vs Religion?''===
In 2007, Fuller wrote ''Science Vs Religion?: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution''. In addition to introductory and conclusionary chapters, it has chapters on the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]], the thesis that modern science has its basis in an attempt by humanity to transcend itself and reach God, how Fuller believes complexity distinguishes ID from "other versions of creationism", legal issues, and the future of "[[Darwinism]]".<ref name=Sarkar>[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=13887 Review of ''Science Vs Religion?''], Sahotra Sarkar, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', 7 August 2008</ref>

Professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University]], [[Norman Levitt]] in a review described it as "a truly miserable piece of work, crammed with errors scientific, historical, and even theological".<ref name="2007Levitt">{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature | title=Norman Levitt Deconstructs Steve Fuller's Postmodernist Critique of Evolution  | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)]] |date=19 December 2007  | first=Norman | last= Levitt   | access-date =10 October 2008 }}</ref> Levitt took issue with the following points:<ref name="2007Levitt"/> 
*Fuller's acceptance at face value of [[William Dembski]]'s claims on complexity and randomness, and his failure to come to grips with the wealth of results that this field has generated and with the trenchant criticism of Dembski's claims (or even to describe these claims accurately);
*Fuller's disparagement of [[evolutionary biology]], without doing "serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself" on which to base it;
*Fuller's misrepresentation of [[Isaac Newton]]'s religious beliefs in order to make a point that is in fact antithetical to Newton's views;
Levitt infers that Fuller's views arise from an "animosity to science as such and to its cognitive authority [that] still pervades academic life outside the dominion of the science faculty".<ref>[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature The Painful Elaboration of the Fatuous], Norman Levitt, eSkeptic, [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic magazine]]</ref>
Fuller later responded to these points, accusing Levitt of axe-grinding and questioning his understanding of the book, which Fuller claimed was less a defense of contemporary intelligent design theory than a demonstration of its rootedness in the history of science. Fuller also claims that Levitt misquotes one of the three passages Levitt cites from the book, making it mean the opposite of the original.<ref>[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-01-16.html#feature Steve Fuller Responds to Norman Levitt's Review of ''Science v.

Philip Johnson"; and other scientific errors.<ref name="2008Sarkar"/>

===''Dissent Over Descent''===
In 2008 Fuller's book on the intelligent design controversy, ''Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism'' was published. Steven Poole of [[The Guardian]] wrote: "book is an epoch-hopping parade of straw men, incompetent reasoning and outright gibberish, as when evolution is argued to share with astrology a commitment to "action at a distance", except that the distance is in time rather than space. It's intellectual quackery like this that gives philosophy of science a bad name."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview7 | title=Trivial pursuits Steve Fuller's Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism  | work=The Guardian |date=12 July 2008  | first=Steven | last=Poole | access-date =10 October 2008 | location=London}}</ref> [[Michael Ruse]], Philosopher of Science at [[Florida State University]] wrote in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that Fuller's book "is completely wrong and is backed by no sound scholarship whatsoever.

For the record, Charles Darwin set out to provide a cause, what he called—following his mentors like William Whewell (who in turn referred back to Newton)—a true cause or ''vera causa''.
