'''Sir Thomas Gresham the Elder''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|ɛ|ʃ|ə|m}}; c. 1519{{snd}}21 November 1579), was an [[English people|English]] [[merchant]] and [[financier]] who acted on behalf of [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] (1547–1553) and Edward's half-sisters, [[queen regnant|queens]] [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1553–1558) and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603).

In 1565 Gresham founded the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in the [[City of London]].

==Origins==
Born in [[London]] and descended from an old [[Norfolk]] [[genealogy|family]], Gresham was one of two sons and two daughters of [[Richard Gresham|Sir Richard Gresham]], a leading [[merchant|merchant mercer]] and [[Lord Mayor of London]], who was knighted by [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] for negotiating favourable loans with foreign merchants.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Education==
Gresham was educated at [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]].  After this, although his father wanted Thomas to become a merchant, Sir Richard first sent him to university at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|GRSN530T|Thomas Gresham}}</ref> He was concurrently apprenticed in the Mercers' Company to his uncle [[John Gresham|Sir John Gresham]], founder of [[Gresham's School]], while he was still at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

==Agent in the Low Countries==
In 1543 the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|Mercers' Company]] admitted the 24-year-old Gresham as a [[liveryman]], and later that year he left England for the [[Low Countries]], where, either on his own account or that of his father or uncle, he both carried on business as a [[merchant]] whilst acting in various matters as [[Foreign agent|agent]] for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. In 1544 he married Anne Ferneley, widow of the London merchant Sir William Read, but maintained residence principally in the [[Low Countries]], basing his headquarters at [[Antwerp]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} in present-day [[Belgium]] (then the [[Spanish Netherlands]]), where he became renowned for his adept [[Financial market|market-play]].

==Financial acumen==

===Rescues the pound===
When in 1551 the mismanagement of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, had caused the English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods—highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair—for raising the value of the [[pound sterling]] on the [[The Belgian bourse of Antwerp|Antwerp bourse]] which proved so successful that in just a few years [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Later services to the Crown===
On the accession of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] in 1553 Gresham fell out of favour at [[Court of St James's|Court]] for a short time with [[Alderman]] [[William Dauntsey]] displacing him. But Dauntsey's financial operations proved unsuccessful and Gresham was soon re-instated; and as he professed his zealous desire to serve the Queen, and manifested great adroitness both in negotiating loans and in smuggling money, arms and foreign goods, not only were his services retained throughout her reign (1553–1558), but besides his salary of twenty shillings ''per diem'' he received grants of [[church lands]] to the yearly value of 200 pounds. Under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s reign (1558–1603), besides continuing in his post as financial agent of the Crown, Gresham acted as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the [[Royal court|Court]] of [[Margaret of Parma|Duchess Margaret of Parma]], [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor of the Netherlands]], and was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1559 prior to his departure. The unsettled times preceding the [[Dutch revolt]] compelled him to leave [[Antwerp]] on 10 March 1567; but, though he spent the remainder of his life in London, he continued his business as merchant and government financial agent in much the same way as he had always done.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His enterprises made him one of the richest men of his generation in England.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Queen Elizabeth also found Gresham's abilities useful in a variety of other ways, including acting as [[gaoler]] to [[Lady Mary Grey]] (sister of [[Lady Jane Grey]]), who, as a punishment for marrying [[Thomas Keyes]] the sergeant-porter, was imprisoned in his house from June 1569 to the end of 1572.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Founding of the Royal Exchange===
In 1565 Gresham made a proposal to the [[City of London]]'s [[Court of Aldermen]] to build, at his own expense, a [[Exchange (organized market)|bourse]] or [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]—what became the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], modelled on the [[The Belgian bourse of Antwerp|Antwerp bourse]]—on condition that the [[Corporation of London|Corporation]] provided for this purpose a suitable location. In this proposal he seems to have had a good eye for his self-interest as well as for the general good of the City's merchants, for by a yearly rental of £700 obtained for the shops in the upper part of the building he received more than sufficient return for his trouble and expense.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The foundation of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] is the background of [[Thomas Heywood]]'s play: ''[[If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody]] part 2'', in which a [[Lord]] extols the quality of the building when asked if he has ever seen "a goodlier frame":

:"Not in my life; yet I have been in [[Venice]]... In the [[Rialto]] there, called [[St Mark's Basilica|Saint Mark]]'s; 'tis but a bauble, if compared to this. The nearest, that which most resembles this, is the great [[Exchange (organized market)|Burse]] in [[Antwerp]], yet no comparable either in height or wideness, the fair cellarage, or goodly shops above. Oh my [[Lord Mayor]], this Gresham hath much graced your City of London; his fame will long outlive him."<ref>Heywood, Thomas, ''The Dramatic Works of Thomas Heywood'', 6 volumes, ed. J. Payne Collier, London: The Shakespeare Society, 1851.</ref>

==Marriage and progeny==
In 1544 he married Anne Ferneley, widow of Sir William Read, a London merchant. By his wife he had an only son who predeceased him. He also had an illegitimate daughter who married Sir Nathaniel Bacon (''c.'' 1546–1622), half-brother of [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Albans]], becoming ''Anne, Lady Bacon''.

==Death and burial==
Gresham died suddenly, apparently of [[apoplexy]], on 21 November 1579 and was buried at [[St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate]] in the [[City of London]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64144 Memorials of the Institutions – St Helen's Bishopgate]</ref>

==Bequest for the foundation of Gresham College==
Apart from some small sums to various charities, Gresham bequeathed the bulk of his property (consisting of estates in London and around England giving an income of more than 2,300 pounds a year) to his widow and her heirs, with the stipulation that after her death his own house in Bishopsgate Street and the rents from the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] should be vested in the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] and the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|Mercers Company]], for the purpose of instituting a college in which seven professors should read lectures, one each day of the week, in [[astronomy]], [[geometry]], [[medicine|physic]], law, [[divinity]], [[rhetoric]] and music.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Thus, [[Gresham College]], the first institution of higher learning in London, came to be established in 1597.

==Gresham's Law==
[[Gresham's Law]] (stated simply as: "Bad money drives out good") takes its name from him (although others, including the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], had recognised the concept for years) because he urged Queen Elizabeth to restore the debased currency of England. However, Sir Thomas never formulated anything like ''Gresham's Law,'' which was the 1857 conception of [[Henry Dunning Macleod]], an economist with a knack for reading into a text that which was not written.<ref>Roover, Raymond de, Gresham on Foreign Exchange, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1949</ref>

==The Gresham grasshopper==
The Gresham family [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] is: ''On a Mount Vert a Grasshopper Or'',<ref>Burke's Armorials, 1884</ref> (a golden grasshopper on a green mound); it is displayed by [[Gresham College]], which he founded, and also forms the [[weathervane]] on the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] in the [[City of London]], also founded by him in 1565. The [[Faneuil Hall]] at [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], has also borrowed this [[Heraldry|heraldic device]]. The Gresham [[coat of arms]] is blazoned: ''Argent, a Chevron Erminés between three Mullets pierced Sable''.<ref>Burke's Armorials, 1884</ref>

According to ancient legend, the founder of the family, Roger de Gresham, was a foundling abandoned as a new-born baby among long grass in [[Norfolk]] during the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. Although a beautiful story, it is more likely that the grasshopper is simply a [[Canting arms|canting]] [[Heraldry|heraldic]] [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] playing on the sound "grassh-" and "Gresh-". The Gresham family uses as its [[motto]] ''Fiat Voluntas Tua'' ('Thy will be done').<ref>[[H. D. G. Leveson Gower|Granville William Gresham Leveson Gower, JP, DL, FSA]], ''Genealogy of the family of Gresham'' (1883) p. 27</ref>
