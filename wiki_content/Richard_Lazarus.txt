[[File:Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]
'''Richard S. Lazarus''' (March 3, 1922 – November 24, 2002) was an American psychologist who began rising to prominence in the 1960s, when [[behaviorism|behaviorists]] like [[B. F. Skinner]] held sway over psychology and explanations for human behavior were often pared down to rudimentary [[Motivation|motives]] like reward and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Lazarus as the 80th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell III |first9=John L. |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle|s2cid=145668721 }}</ref>

He was well renowned for his theory of cognitive-mediational theory within emotion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Scherer|first1=Klaus R.|title=Appraisal Processes in Emotion: Theory, Methods, Research|last2=Schorr|first2=Angela|last3=Johnstone|first3=Tom|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-19-535154-5|location=Oxford|pages=23|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from [[City College of New York]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]], Lazarus joined the faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite news|title=Psychologist Richard Lazarus dies|date=December 6, 2002|newspaper=Marysville Appeal Democrat|location=California|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/obituary-clipping-dec-06-2002-1530850/}}{{free access}}</ref>

During the 1970s, Lazarus worked with PhD student [[Susan Folkman]] studying stress and coping. In her doctoral thesis, Folkman coined the terms "problem-focused coping" and "emotion-focused coping."<ref name = "book">{{cite book |author1=Alan J.

==Research==

Lazarus advocated the importance of emotion, especially what he described as the marriage between emotion and thought.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sierhuis|first=Freya|title=Passions and Subjectivity in Early Modern Culture|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4724-1364-2|location=Oxon|pages=2}}</ref> His views put him at odds not only with behaviorism but also with a movement that began toward the end of his career: attempts to explain all human behavior by looking at the structure of the brain.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}  He was very opposed to [[reductionism|reductionist]] approaches to understanding human behavior.

Lazarus' cognitive-mediational theory maintained that the interaction between emotion-eliciting conditions and coping processes affect the cognitions that drive emotional reactions.<ref name=":0" /> For example, the degree of a perceived threat affects an individual's emotional and psychological response to such life event in the future.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gohary|first=Osmo Otto Paivio Hanninen; Mustafa Atalay; B. P. Mansourian; A. Wojtezak; S. M. Mahfouz; Harry Majewski; Elaine Elisabetsky; Nina L. Etkin; Ralph Kirby; T. G. Downing and M. I. El|title=MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES - Volume V|publisher=EOLSS Publications|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84826-835-7|location=London|pages=64}}</ref> At the heart of Lazarus's theory was what he called [[appraisal theory|appraisal]]. Before emotion occurs, he argued, people make an automatic, often unconscious, assessment of what is happening and what it may mean for them or those they care about. From that perspective, emotion becomes not just rational but a necessary component of survival. According to Lazarus, there are two kinds of appraisal: ''primary appraisal'', which is aimed at establishing the significance of an event's meaning to the organism; and, ''secondary appraisal'', which assesses the ability of the organism to cope with the consequences of the event.<ref name=":0" />

Lazarus worked on topics such as hope and gratitude. He was perhaps best known for his work on [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], gaining attention for studies that showed that patients who engaged in denial about the seriousness of their situation did better than those who were more
"realistic." He also found that stress often had less to do with a person's actual situation than with how the person perceived the strength of his own resources.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0212&L=psyaging-l&T=0&P=1925 | title=LISTSERV 16.0 - Archives - Error}}</ref>

===Emotion definition===

Lazarus (1991) defines emotions according to '[[core relational theme]]s' which are intuitive summaries of the 'moral appraisals' (e.g. of relevance, goal conduciveness) involved in different emotions. These themes help define both the function and eliciting conditions of the emotion. They include:

*Anger - a demeaning offense against me and mine.
*Fear - facing an immediate, concrete, and overwhelming physical danger.
*Sadness - having experienced an irrevocable loss.
*Disgust - taking in or being too close to an indigestible object or idea (metaphorically speaking).
*Happiness - making reasonable progress toward the realization of a goal.
