In [[economics]], '''industrial organization''' is a field that builds on the [[theory of the firm]] by examining the structure of (and, therefore, the boundaries between) firms and [[market (economics)|market]]s. Industrial organization adds real-world complications to the [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] model, complications such as [[transaction cost]]s,<ref>• [[Ronald H. Coase|R. H.

There are different approaches to the subject. One approach is descriptive in providing an overview of industrial organization, such as measures of competition and the size-[[concentration ratio|concentration]] of firms in an industry. A second approach uses [[microeconomic]] models to explain internal firm organization and market strategy, which includes internal research and development along with issues of internal reorganization and renewal.<ref>• Frederic M.

The extensive use of [[game theory]] in industrial economics has led to the export of this tool to other branches of [[microeconomics]], such as [[behavioral economics]] and [[corporate finance]]. Industrial organization has also had significant practical impacts on [[antitrust law]] and [[competition policy]].<ref>Exemplified in such advanced textbooks as [[Jean Tirole]], 1988,  ''The Theory of Industrial Organization'', MIT Press, [https://archive.org/details/theoryofindustri00jean description] and chapter-preview [https://archive.org/details/theoryofindustri00jean links.]</ref>

==Market structures==
The common [[market structure]]s studied in this field are the following:
*[[Perfect competition]]
*[[Monopolistic competition]]
*[[Duopoly]]
*[[Oligopoly]]
*[[Oligopsony]]
*[[Monopoly]]
*[[Monopsony]]

==Areas of study==
Industrial organization investigates the outcomes of these market structures in environments with
*[[Price discrimination]]
*[[Product differentiation]]
*[[Durable good]]s
*[[Experience good]]s
*[[Secondary market]]s, which can affect the behaviour of firms in primary markets.
*[[Collusion]]
*[[Signalling (economics)|Signalling]], such as warranties and advertising.
*[[Mergers and acquisitions]]
*[[Entry (economics)|Entry]] and [[Exit (economics)|Exit]]

==History of the field==
A 2009 book ''Pioneers of Industrial Organization'' traces the development of the field from [[Adam Smith]] to recent times and includes dozens of short biographies of major figures in Europe and North America who contributed to the growth and development of the discipline.<ref name="“bazar1">Henry W. de Jong and William G.
