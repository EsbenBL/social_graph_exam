==Major works==
Fung's dissertation looked at the impact of the participatory involvement of Chicago's residents, police officers, teachers, and community groups to reform education. This research was published in Fung's first book ''Empowered Participation: Reinventing Urban Democracy'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Empowered participation: reinventing urban democracy | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781400835638 }}</ref> The book details Fung's concept of [[accountable autonomy]].

Fung's research took an in-depth approach understanding local governance as both an examination of a specific case but also as a model for understanding urban participatory democracy.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Wright | first2 = Erik Olin | author-link2 = Erik Olin Wright | title = Deepening democracy: institutional innovations in empowered participatory governance | publisher = [[Verso Books|Verso]] | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781859844663 }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=September 2021}} A review of ''Empowered Participation'' in the journal ''[[Environment and Planning C]]'' noted its "rigorous theoretical framework" but called it "marked by some contestable normative and political assumptions" and said: "From an empirical perspective Fung's qualitative approach remains insufficiently explored."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Talpin |first=Julien D. |date=October 2005 |title=Review: ''Empowered Participation: Reinventing Urban Democracy'' |journal=[[Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy]] |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=785–786 |doi=10.1068/c2305rvw}}</ref>

Fung's second book ''Full Disclosure: The Perils and Promise of Transparency'' was co-authored with [[Mary Graham (writer)|Mary Graham]] and David Weil in 2007.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mary | last3 = Weil | first3 = David | title = Full disclosure : the perils and promise of transparency | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780521699617 }}</ref> ''Full Disclosure'' examines transparency as a regulatory tool for protecting the public interest through the lens of eighteen major policies, including those designed to improve car safety and restaurant hygiene. This work introduces the notion of targeted transparency – where the disclosure of information serves to bridge a gap in knowledge that otherwise contributes to public risk or service failures. The theoretical underpinning of targeted transparency is the "transparency action cycle" whereby disclosers provide information to the public in a format that responds to users' will and capacity to process and use that information at the point of decision-making.

The themes of enabling citizens to be more efficacious within their political system is evident in the other books, projects, and articles Fung has either written or contributed to. These include a 2000 book with Bradley Karkkainen and [[Charles Sabel]] entitled ''Beyond Backyard Environmentalism''<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Sabel | first2 = Charles | last3 = Karkkainen | first3 = Bradley | author-link2 = Charles Sabel | title = Beyond backyard environmentalism | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780807004456 | url = https://archive.org/details/beyondbackyarden00char }}</ref> and ''Can We Put an End to Sweatshops'', a 2001 book written with Dara O'Rourke and [[Charles Sabel]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fung | first1 = Archon | last2 = Sabel | first2 = Charles | last3 = O'Rourke | first3 = Dara | author-link2 = Charles Sabel | title = Can we put an end to sweatshops | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston, Mass | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780807047156 | url = https://archive.org/details/canweputendtoswe00arch_0 }}</ref> Fung has published numerous articles on these topics ranging from more theoretical pieces such as a 2005 article in ''[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]'' entitled "Deliberation Before the Revolution: Toward an Ethics of Deliberative Democracy in an Unjust World"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Deliberation before the revolution: toward an ethics of deliberative democracy in an unjust world | journal = [[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 397–419 | doi = 10.1177/0090591704271990 | date = June 2005 | s2cid = 55250563 }}</ref> to a 2007 article appearing in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' entitled "Democratic Theory and Political Science: A Pragmatic Method of Constructive Engagement" which bridges theory and practice.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Fung | first = Archon | title = Democratic theory and political science: a pragmatic method of constructive engagement | journal = [[American Political Science Review]] | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 443–458 | doi = 10.1017/S000305540707030X | date = August 2007 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.690.6288 | s2cid = 53343031 }} [http://archonfung.net/docs/articles/2007/FungAPSA0708.pdf Pdf version.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210102539/http://archonfung.net/docs/articles/2007/FungAPSA0708.pdf |date=2014-12-10 }}</ref>

Fung has engaged in current politics, having published a piece for ''[[The American Prospect]]'' in May 2010, entitled "A Tea Party for Obama".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fung|first1=Archon|title=A tea party for Obama|url=http://prospect.org/article/tea-party-obama-0|access-date=5 November 2014|work=[[The American Prospect]]|date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Additionally, Fung serves on the national advisory board of [[AmericaSpeaks]] and is a consultant for various organizations including the [[Open Society Institute]] and the [[World Bank]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

As an indicator of Fung's personal and professional commitment to the ideals of transparency he has published a "Conflict Statement" on his personal website, which outlines his engagement with outside organizations: "First, as someone who seeks to understand the worlds of democratic reform and public policy, it is important to see things from the perspective of practitioners which is very different from the perspective of scholars. Working closely with practitioners is one way – the best way I know of – to gain that understanding."{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Fung's more recent research focuses broadly on the realms of [[Transparency in government|transparency]] in public and private [[governance]] as well as [[participatory democracy]] with a focus on [[Deliberative democracy|deliberative forms of governance]]. His projects have examined democratic reform initiatives in electoral reform, urban planning, public services, ecosystem management, transnational governance, and the role of technology within the area of transparency and governance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In September 2009, Fung launched Participedia, a website developed with Mark Warren of the [[University of British Columbia]], aimed at strengthening democracy with its user-generated library of examples and methods of participatory governance, public deliberation, and collaborative public action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/articles/ash-fung-participedia-aug10 |last=Engelman |first=Jessica |date=August 17, 2010 |title=Professor Archon Fung Launches Participedia |website=www.hks.harvard.edu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819041528/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/articles/ash-fung-participedia-aug10 |archive-date=2010-08-19}}</ref>
