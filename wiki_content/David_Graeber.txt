'''David Rolfe Graeber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|eɪ|b|ər}}; February 12, 1961{{spnd}}September 2, 2020) was an American [[anthropologist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] activist. His influential work in [[economic anthropology]], particularly his books ''[[Debt: The First 5,000 Years]]'' (2011) and ''[[Bullshit Jobs]]'' (2018), and his leading role in the [[Occupy movement]], earned him recognition as one of the foremost anthropologists and left-wing thinkers of his time.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|author=Cain, Sian|date=September 3, 2020|title=David Graeber, anthropologist and author of Bullshit Jobs, dies aged 59|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/03/david-graeber-anthropologist-and-author-of-bullshit-jobs-dies-aged-59|url-status=live|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903155214/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/03/david-graeber-anthropologist-and-author-of-bullshit-jobs-dies-aged-59|archive-date=September 3, 2020}}</ref><ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Roos|first=Jerome|date=September 4, 2020|title=The anarchist: How David Graeber became the left's most influential thinker|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/09/anarchist-how-david-graeber-became-lefts-most-influential-thinker|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-11|website=New Statesman|language=en}}</ref>

<!-- Early life, education, academic career -->
Born in New York to a working-class Jewish family, Graeber studied at [[Purchase College]] and the [[University of Chicago]], where he conducted [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] research in [[Madagascar]] under [[Marshall Sahlins]] and obtained his doctorate in 1996. He was an assistant professor at [[Yale University]] from 1998 to 2005, when the university controversially decided not to renew his contract before he was eligible for [[tenure]]. Unable to secure another position in the United States, he entered an "academic exile" in England, where he was a [[lecturer]] and [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] from 2008 to 2013, and a professor at the [[London School of Economics]] from 2013.

<!-- Scholarship -->
In his early scholarship, Graeber specialized in [[value theory|theories of value]] (''[[Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value]]'', 2002), [[Social hierarchies|social hierarchy]] and political power (''[[Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology]]'', 2004, ''Possibilities'', 2007, ''On Kings'', 2017), and the ethnography of Madagascar (''[[Lost People]]'', 2007). In the 2010s he turned to [[historical anthropology]], producing his most well known book ''Debt'' (2011), an exploration of the historical relationship between [[debt]] and social institutions, as well a series of essays on the origins of [[social inequality]] in prehistory. In parallel, he developed critiques of [[bureaucracy]] and [[managerialism]] in [[contemporary capitalism]], published in ''[[The Utopia of Rules]]'' (2015) and ''Bullshit Jobs'' (2018). He coined the concept of [[bullshit job]]s in a 2013 essay that explored the proliferation of "paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Graeber|first=David|date=2018-05-04|title='I had to guard an empty room': the rise of the pointless job|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/04/i-had-to-guard-an-empty-room-the-rise-of-the-pointless-job|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-11|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

<!-- Activism -->
Although exposed to radical left politics from a young age, Graeber's direct involvement in activism began with the [[global justice movement]] of the 1990s. He attended protests against the [[3rd Summit of the Americas]] in [[Quebec City]] in 2001 and the [[World Economic Forum]] in New York in 2002, and later wrote an ethnography of the movement, [[Direct Action: An Ethnography|''Direct Action'']] (2009). In 2011, he became well known as one of the leading figures of [[Occupy Wall Street]] and is credited with coining the slogan "[[We are the 99%]]". His later activism included interventions in support of the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria|Rojava revolution]] in Syria, the [[Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn|British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn]] and [[Extinction Rebellion]].

<!-- Death, legacy, personal life -->
Graeber was married to artist Nika Dubrovsky. He died unexpectedly in September 2020, while on vacation in [[Venice]]. His last book, ''[[The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity]]'', co-written with archaeologist [[David Wengrow]], was published posthumously in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Graeber Memorial Lectures |url=https://www.ciis.edu/academics/graduate-programs/anthropology-and-social-change/david-graeber-memorial-lectures |website=California Institute of Integral Studies |access-date=13 May 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Graeber's parents, who were in their forties when Graeber was born, were self-taught working-class intellectuals in New York.<ref name=businessweek/> Graeber's mother, Ruth Rubinstein, had been a garment worker, and played the lead role in the 1930s musical comedy revue ''[[Pins & Needles]]'', staged by the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].<ref name=businessweek/><ref name=mother/> Graeber's father Kenneth, who was affiliated with the [[Young Communist League USA|Youth Communist League]] in college, participated in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] in Barcelona and fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=father/> He later worked as a plate stripper on offset printers.<ref name=businessweek/> Both his parents were Jewish. Graeber grew up in [[Penn South]], a union-sponsored [[housing cooperative]] in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]],<ref>{{Cite news|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=September 4, 2020|title=David Graeber, Caustic Critic of Inequality, Is Dead at 59|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/books/david-graeber-dead.html|access-date=September 5, 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=September 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907234627/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/books/david-graeber-dead.html|url-status=live}}</ref> described by ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine as "suffused with radical politics."<ref name=businessweek/>

Graeber had his first experience of political activism at the age of seven, when he attended [[peace march]]es in New York's [[Central Park]] and [[Fire Island]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Lateu|first=Jo|date=January 1, 2014|title=David Graeber on acting like an anarchist|url=https://newint.org/columns/finally/2014/01/01/david-graeber|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820133427/https://newint.org/columns/finally/2014/01/01/david-graeber|archive-date=August 20, 2020|magazine=New Internationalist|issue=January–February 2014|language=en|access-date=September 5, 2020}}</ref> He was an anarchist from the age of 16, according to an interview he gave to ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in 2005.<ref name="vv" />

Graeber graduated from [[Phillips Academy Andover]] in 1978 and received his B.A. from the [[State University of New York at Purchase]] in 1984. He received his master's degree and doctorate at the [[University of Chicago]], where he won a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] fellowship to conduct 20 months of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] [[field research]] in [[Betafo]], [[Madagascar]], beginning in 1989.<ref name="Berrett">{{cite news |last=Berrett |first=Dan |title=Intellectual Roots of Wall St. Protest Lie in Academe |date=October 16, 2011 |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Intellectual-Roots-of-Wall/129428/ |access-date=February 19, 2013 |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407092538/https://chronicle.com/article/Intellectual-Roots-of-Wall/129428/ |url-status=live }}</ref> His resulting Ph.D. thesis on magic, slavery, and politics was supervised by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and entitled ''The Disastrous Ordeal of 1987: Memory and Violence in Rural Madagascar''.<ref name=arenson/><ref name="YaleBio">{{cite web |last=Graeber |first=David |title=David Graeber |website=Yale University Department of Anthropology |publisher=Yale University |year=2004 |url=http://www.yale.edu/anthropology/people/dgraeber.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040222235548/http://www.yale.edu/anthropology/people/dgraeber.html |archive-date=February 22, 2004}}</ref>

== Academic career ==

=== Yale University (1998–2005) ===
In 1998, two years after completing his PhD, Graeber became assistant professor at [[Yale University]], then associate professor.<ref name=arenson/> In May 2005, the Yale anthropology department decided not to renew Graeber's contract, preventing consideration for [[academic tenure]], which was scheduled for 2008. Pointing to Graeber's anthropological scholarship, his supporters (including fellow anthropologists, former students and activists) said the decision was politically motivated. More than 4,500 people signed petitions supporting him, and anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Laura Nader]], [[Michael Taussig]], and [[Maurice Bloch]] called on Yale to reverse its decision.<ref name=arenson/> Bloch, who had been a professor of anthropology at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[Collège de France]], and a writer on Madagascar, praised Graeber in a letter to the university.<ref name="blochletter" />

The Yale administration argued that Graeber's dismissal was in keeping with Yale's policy of granting tenure to few junior faculty. Graeber suggested that Yale's decision might have been influenced by his support of a student of his who was targeted for expulsion because of her membership in [[Graduate Employees and Students Organization|GESO]], Yale's [[graduate student union]].<ref name=arenson/><ref name=inside/><ref name=silenced/>

In December 2005, Graeber agreed to leave Yale after a one-year paid sabbatical. That spring he taught two final classes: "Introduction to Cultural Anthropology" (attended by more than 200 students) and a seminar, "Direct Action and Radical Social Theory".<ref>{{cite news |last=Marsden |first=Jessica |title=Graeber agrees to leave University |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=December 9, 2005 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2005/12/09/graeber-agrees-to-leave-university/ |access-date=May 5, 2015 |archive-date=August 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830013757/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2005/12/09/graeber-agrees-to-leave-university/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== "Academic exile" and London (2005–2020) ===
On May 25, 2006, Graeber was invited to give the [[Malinowski Lecture]] at the [[London School of Economics]]. Each year, the LSE anthropology department asks an anthropologist at a relatively early stage of their career to give the Malinowski Lecture, and only invites those considered to have made significant contributions to anthropological theory. Graeber's address was called "Beyond Power/Knowledge: an exploration of the relation of power, ignorance and stupidity".<ref name=malinowski/> It was later edited into an essay, "Dead zones of the imagination: On violence, bureaucracy and interpretive labor".<ref name=deadzones/> The same year, Graeber was asked to present the keynote address in the 100th anniversary Diamond Jubilee meetings of the [[Association of Social Anthropologists]].<ref name=asa/> In April 2011, he presented the anthropology department's annual Distinguished Lecture at Berkeley,<ref name=berkeley/> and in May 2012 delivered the second annual [[Marilyn Strathern]] Lecture at Cambridge (the first was delivered by Strathern).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Strathern Lecture|url=https://www.socanth.cam.ac.uk/about-us/the-strathern-lecture|access-date=September 4, 2020|work=Department of Social Anthropology|date=November 28, 2017|publisher=University of Cambridge|archive-date=September 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909120751/https://www.socanth.cam.ac.uk/about-us/the-strathern-lecture|url-status=live}}</ref>

After his dismissal from Yale, Graeber was unable to secure another position at an American university.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Nader|first=Laura|date=January 22, 2019|title=Unravelling the Politics of Silencing|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/puan/1/1/article-p81_81.xml|journal=Public Anthropologist|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81–95|doi=10.1163/25891715-00101006|s2cid=213081453|issn=2589-1707|access-date=September 5, 2020|archive-date=September 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909120543/https://brill.com/view/journals/puan/1/1/article-p81_81.xml|url-status=live}}</ref> He applied for more than twenty, but despite a strong track record and letters of recommendation from several prominent anthropologists, never made it past the first round.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Graeber|first=David|date=January 22, 2019|title=It Wasn't a Tenure Case – a Personal Testimony, with Reflections|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/puan/1/1/article-p96_96.xml|journal=Public Anthropologist|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=96–104|doi=10.1163/25891715-00201009|s2cid=214299282|issn=2589-1707|access-date=September 5, 2020|archive-date=September 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909120543/https://brill.com/view/journals/puan/1/1/article-p81_81.xml|url-status=live}}</ref> At the same time, a number of foreign universities approached him with offers.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> In an article on his "academic exile" from the United States, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' interviewed several anthropology professors who agreed that Graeber's political activism could have played a role in his unsuccessful search, describing the field as "radical in the abstract" (in the words of [[Laura Nader]]) but intolerant of direct political action. Another factor suggested by the article was that Graeber had acquired a reputation as being personally difficult or "uncollegial", especially in light of allegations of poor conduct made by Yale during the dispute over his dismissal.<ref name=":1" /> Graeber himself interpreted his exclusion from American academia as a direct result of his dismissal from Yale, likening it to "[[Blackballing|black-balling]] in a social club", and arguing that the charge of "uncollegiality" glossed a variety of other personal qualities, from his political activism to his working-class background, that marked him as a trouble-maker within the academic hierarchy.<ref name=":3" /> Laura Nader, reflecting on Graeber's case amongst other examples of "academic silencing" in anthropology, speculated that the real reasons could have included Graeber's growing reputation as a public intellectual,<ref name=":2" /> and his tendency to "write in English" rather than jargon.<ref name=":1" />

From 2008 to 2013, Graeber was a lecturer and a reader at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmith's College]] of the [[University of London]]. In 2013, he accepted a professorship at the London School of Economics.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Shea|first=Christopher|date=April 15, 2013|title=A Radical Anthropologist Finds Himself in Academic 'Exile'|newspaper=Chronicle of Higher Education|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Radical-Anthropologist-Finds/138499/|url-status=live|access-date=April 17, 2013|archive-date=April 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417105924/http://chronicle.com/article/A-Radical-Anthropologist-Finds/138499/}}</ref><ref name="WNYC: Occupying Democracy" />

Graeber was a founding member of the Institute for Experimental Arts in Greece. He gave a lecture with the title "How social and economic structure influences the Art World" in the International MultiMedia Poetry Festival organized by the Institute for Experimental Arts supported by the Department of Anthropology of the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Graeber|first=David|date=September 4, 2019|title=How social and economic structure influences the Art World|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCF-8OQj0RE|url-status=live|access-date=September 4, 2020|website=Youtube|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926034955/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCF-8OQj0RE}}</ref>

== Scholarship ==
Graeber is the author of ''[[Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology]]'' and ''[[Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value|Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams]]''. He has done extensive anthropological work in [[Madagascar]], writing his doctoral thesis, ''The Disastrous Ordeal of 1987: Memory and Violence in Rural Madagascar'', on the continuing social division between the descendants of nobles and the descendants of former slaves.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpulSwAACAAJ|title=The Disastrous Ordeal of 1987: Memory and Violence in Rural Madagascar|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Anthropology|year=1996|volume=3|last=Graeber|first=David}}</ref> A book based on his dissertation, [[Lost People|''Lost People: Magic and the Legacy of Slavery in Madagascar'']], was published by [[Indiana University Press]] in September 2007.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NlSUM8OqUAC|title=Lost People: Magic and the Legacy of Slavery in Madagascar|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|last=Graeber|first=David|isbn=9780253219152|access-date=September 19, 2020|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926034940/https://books.google.com/books?id=4NlSUM8OqUAC|url-status=live}}</ref> A book of collected essays, ''[[Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion, and Desire]]'' was published by [[AK Press]] in November 2007,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjRxSBP0JqYC|title=Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion and Desire|publisher=AK Press|year=2007|last=Graeber|first=David|isbn=9781904859666}}</ref> and ''[[Direct Action: An Ethnography]]'' appeared from the same press in August 2009.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnTDEQkCoc4C|title=Direct Action: An Ethnography|publisher=AK Press|year=2009|last=Graeber|first=David|isbn=9781904859796|access-date=September 19, 2020|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926034941/https://books.google.com/books?id=PnTDEQkCoc4C|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, the aforementioned publisher printed a collection of essays by Graeber – co-edited with Stevphen Shukaitis and Erika Biddle – called ''Constituent Imagination: Militant Investigations//Collective Theorization'' (AK Press, May 2007).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fcl8T_gmU4wC|title=Constituent Imagination: Militant Investigations/Collective Theorization|publisher=AK Press|year=2007|editor1-last=Shukaitis|editor1-first=Stevphen|editor2-last=Graeber|editor2-first=David|editor3-last=Biddle|editor3-first=Erika|isbn=9781904859352|access-date=September 19, 2020|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926034952/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fcl8T_gmU4wC|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2017, Graeber and his former teacher [[Marshall Sahlins]] released a collection of essays entitled ''On Kings'', outlining a theory, inspired by [[Arthur Maurice Hocart|A. M.

From January 2013 until June 2016, Graeber was a contributing editor at ''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. From 2011 until 2017 he was editor-at-large of the open access journal ''[[HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory|HAU: The Journal of Ethnographic Theory]]'', for which he and [[Giovanni da Col]] co-wrote the founding theoretical statement and manifesto of the school of "ethnographic theory".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.001/50|title=The return of ethnographic theory|author1=Giovanni da Col|author2=David Graeber|journal=HAU: The Journal of Ethnographic Theory|volume=1|number=1|year=2011|access-date=September 23, 2016|archive-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924110350/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.001/50|url-status=live}}</ref>

Charles Kenny, writing in the political magazine ''[[Democracy (journal)|Democracy]]'', claimed that Graeber sought out data that "fit the narrative on the evils of neoliberalism" and challenged or criticised data which suggested otherwise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/48/its-not-as-bad-as-all-that/|title=It's Not As Bad As All That|date=March 26, 2018|website=Democracy Journal|language=en|access-date=July 6, 2019|archive-date=July 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706194447/https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/48/its-not-as-bad-as-all-that/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Graeber's first major historical monograph was ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]'' (2011).<ref name="melville" />

Karl Schmid, writing in the Canadian Anthropology Society's journal ''Anthropologica'', described ''Debt'' as an "unusual book" which "may be the most read public anthropology book of the 21st century" and noted that "it will be difficult for Graeber or anyone else to top this book for the attention it received due to excellent timing".<ref name="Schmid">{{cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Karl|date=January 1928|title=''Debt: The First 5,000 Years'' by David Graeber (review)|journal=Anthropologica|volume=56|issue=1|pages=244–246|publisher=University of Toronto Press|access-date=September 4, 2020|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/544759|issn=0003-5459|archive-date=September 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200904002755/https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/49737-melville-house-finds-hit-for-the-99.html|url-status=live}}{{registration required}}</ref> Schmid compared ''Debt'' to [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' and James C.

Graeber responded that these errors had no influence on his argument, remarking that the "biggest actual mistake DeLong managed to detect in the 544 pages of ''Debt'', despite years of flailing away, was (iirc) that I got the number of Presidential appointees on the Federal Open Market Committee board wrong".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title=Brad DeLong reply – David Graeber Industries|language=en-US|work=David Graeber Industries|url=https://davidgraeber.industries/sundries/brad-delong-reply|access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910082206/https://davidgraeber.industries/sundries/brad-delong-reply|url-status=live}}</ref> He dismissed his other criticisms as representing a divergence of interpretation, truncation of his arguments by DeLong, and mistakes in the [[copy editing]] of the book.<ref name=":0" />

=== Bureaucracy, managerialism, and "bullshit jobs" ===

Much of Graeber's later scholarship focused on the topic of "bullshit jobs", proliferated by administrative bloat and what Graeber calls "managerial [[feudalism]]". One of the points he raised in his 2013 book ''The Democracy Project''—on the [[Occupy movement]]—is the increase in what he calls ''bullshit jobs'', referring to forms of employment that even those holding the jobs feel should not or do not need to exist. He sees such jobs as being typically "concentrated in professional, managerial, clerical, sales, and service workers".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Yves Smith]]|journal=[[Naked Capitalism]]|url=http://www.alternet.org/economy/dignity-and-work?paging=off|title=Has Anyone Noticed That Most New Jobs Suck?|date=August 13, 2013|access-date=September 3, 2013|archive-date=March 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318021519/http://www.alternet.org/economy/dignity-and-work?paging=off|url-status=live}}</ref> As he explained also in an article in ''STRIKE!'': "Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/|title=On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs|date=July 17, 2013|last=Graeber|first=David|publisher=STRIKE!

Because of the article's popularity, Graeber then wrote the book [[Bullshit Jobs|''Bullshit Jobs: A theory'']], published in 2018 by [[Simon & Schuster]]. Writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Nathan Heller described the resulting book as having "the virtue of being both clever and charismatic".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom|title=The Bullshit-Job Boom|first=Nathan|last=Heller|magazine=The New Yorker|date=June 7, 2018|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910090059/https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom|url-status=live}}</ref> Reviewing the book for ''The New York Times'', Alana Semuels noted that although it could be criticised for generalisations about economics "Graeber’s anthropological eye and skepticism about capitalism are useful in questioning some parts of the economy that the West has come to accept as normal."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/books/review/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs.html|title=Are More and More People Working Meaningless Jobs?|first=Alana|last=Semuels|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2018|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910090130/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/books/review/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs.html|url-status=live}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' gave a mixed review of Graeber's ''Bullshit Jobs'', accusing him of having a "slightly condescending attitude" and attesting to the book's "laboured arguments", while referring to aspects of the book's thesis as "clearly right".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-david-graeber-review-laboured-rant|title=Bullshit Jobs: A Theory review – laboured rant about the world of work|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|date=May 27, 2018|work=The Observer|access-date=August 10, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910090306/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-david-graeber-review-laboured-rant|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Bullshit Jobs'' spent four weeks in the top-20 of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''' bestseller list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/bestsellers/titles/bullshit-jobs/|title=Bestsellers|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910090411/http://projects.latimes.com/bestsellers/titles/bullshit-jobs/|url-status=live}}</ref> The book was awarded "Book of the Year 2018" by each of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[New Statesman]]'', and [[City AM]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/295/295446/bullshit-jobs/9780141983479.html|title=Bullshit Jobs|first=David|last=Graeber|website=www.penguin.co.uk|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910090447/https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/295/295446/bullshit-jobs/9780141983479.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Activism ==

[[File:NLN David Graeber.jpg|thumb|Graeber (left) at a rally for immigrant rights at [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], New York City in 2007]]
In addition to his academic work, Graeber was directly and indirectly involved in political activism. He was a member of the labor union [[Industrial Workers of the World]], protested at the [[World Economic Forum]] in New York City in 2002, supported the [[2010 UK student protests]],<ref name=telegraph/> and played an early role in the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement. He was co-founder of the [[Anti-Capitalist Convergence]].<ref name=imageproblem/>

Graeber became a strong advocate of the [[democratic confederalism]] of the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]] after visiting the region in 2014, often drawing parallels between it and the Spanish Revolution his father fought for in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/08/why-world-ignoring-revolutionary-kurds-syria-isis|title=Why is the world ignoring the revolutionary Kurds in Syria? &#124; David Graeber|date=October 8, 2014|website=the Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://novaramedia.com/2020/09/05/an-everyday-anarchist-david-graeber-1961-2020/|title=An Everyday Anarchist: David Graeber, 1961–2020|website=Novara Media}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/david-graeber-pushed-us-to-imagine-greater-human-possibilities|title=David Graeber pushed us to imagine greater human possibilities &#124; Rebecca Solnit|date=September 8, 2020|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

On October 11, 2019, Graeber spoke at an [[Extinction Rebellion]] protest in [[Trafalgar Square]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/writers-marathon-by-writers-rebel|title=Writers Marathon by Writers Rebel &#124; Theatre in London|website=Time Out London|access-date=October 12, 2019|archive-date=October 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012120735/https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/writers-marathon-by-writers-rebel|url-status=live}}</ref> about the relationship between "bullshit jobs" and environmental harm, suggesting that the environmental movement should recognize these jobs in combination with unnecessary construction or infrastructure projects and planned obsolescence as significant issues.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bullshit_Jobs/co2RDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=The%20ruling%20class%20has%20figured%20out%20that%20a%20happy%20and%20productive%20population%20with%20free%20time%20on%20their%20hands%20is%20a%20mortal%20danger|title=Bullshit Jobs: A Theory|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date=May 7, 2019|last=Graeber|first=David|page=18|isbn=9781501143335}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Don't Judge People For Slacking Off―They May Just Have a Bullshit Job|url=https://kintopia.kintone.com/articles/005835.html|first=Alex|last=Steullet|date=July 22, 2020|access-date=September 4, 2020|publisher=Kintopia|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926035010/https://kintopia.kintone.com/articles/005835.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Occupy movement ===

In November 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited Graeber with giving the Occupy Wall Street movement its theme: "[[We are the 99 percent]]". Graeber wrote in ''The Democracy Project'' that the slogan "was a collective creation".<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=The Democracy Project|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780812993561|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780812993561/page/41 41]|quote=As a matter of historical record, since there is so much discussion of the origin of the slogan "We Are the 99 Percent," the answer is that—appropriately enough—it was a collective creation.|publisher=[[Spiegel & Grau]]|date=2013|isbn=978-0812993561}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' said he helped create the first [[New York City General Assembly]], with only 60 participants, on August 2.<ref name=sharlet/> He spent the next six weeks involved with the burgeoning movement, including facilitating general assemblies, attending working group meetings, and organizing legal and medical training and classes on [[nonviolent resistance]]. A few days after the encampment of [[Zuccotti Park]] began, he left New York for [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=businessweek/>

Graeber argued that the Occupy Wall Street movement's lack of recognition of the legitimacy of either existing political institutions or the legal structure, its embrace of non-hierarchical [[consensus decision-making]] and of [[prefigurative politics]] made it a fundamentally anarchist project.<ref name=aljazeera/> Comparing it to the [[Arab Spring]], he claimed that Occupy Wall Street and other contemporary grassroots protests represented "the opening salvo in a wave of negotiations over the dissolution of the American Empire."<ref name=occupyguardian/> Writing in ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', he noted that from the beginning the Occupy movement was about a "commitment to answer only to a moral order, not a legal one" and so held meetings without the requisite permits. Defending this early decision of the Occupy movement, he said, "as the public, we should not need permission to occupy public space".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011112872835904508.html|title=Occupy Wall Street's anarchist roots|date=November 30, 2011|work=Al Jazeera|access-date=February 2, 2019|archive-date=September 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200911181620/https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011112872835904508.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Graeber tweeted in 2014 that he had been evicted from [[Penn South|his family's home]] of over 50 years due to his involvement with Occupy Wall Street. He added that others associated with Occupy had received similar "administrative harassment".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Sutherland |first1=Ali |title=It's not what you know.

=== British politics ===
In November 2019, along with other public figures, Graeber signed a letter supporting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], calling him "a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world" and endorsed him in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]].<ref name="nme">{{cite news|last=Neale|first=Matthew|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-letter-supporting-jeremy-corbyn-2568734|title=Exclusive: New letter supporting Jeremy Corbyn signed by Roger Waters, Robert Del Naja and more|work=[[NME]]|date=November 16, 2019|access-date=November 27, 2019|archive-date=November 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191126184628/https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-letter-supporting-jeremy-corbyn-2568734|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election.

== Influence and reception ==
Kate Burrell wrote, in the journal ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]'', that Graeber's work "promotes anarchist visions of social change, which are not quite believed possible by the Left, yet are lived out within social movements every day" and that his work "offers poetic insight into the daily realities of life as an activist, overtly promotes anarchism, and is a hopeful celebration of just what can be achieved by relatively small groups of committed individuals living their truth visibly."<ref>Burrell, K. (2014). Book Review: David Graeber, 'The Democracy Project: A History. A Crisis. A Movement'. ''Sociology'', 48(5), 1066–167. {{doi|10.1177/0038038514543129}}</ref>

Hans Steinmüller, writing in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute]]'', described Graeber and his co-author Marshall Sahlins as "two of the most important anthropological thinkers of our time" and that their contributions to the anthropological theory of kingship represent a "benchmark of anthropological theory".<ref name=":5">Steinmüller, Hans (2019) Book review: on kings by David Graeber and Marshall Sahlins. ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 25 (2). pp. 413–14.</ref>

As stated by Penguin Random House editor Tom Penn, “David was a true radical, a pioneer in everything that he did. David's inspirational work has changed and shaped the way people understand the world... In his books, his constant, questing curiosity, his wry, sharp-eyed provoking of received nostrums shine through. So too, above all, does his unique ability to imagine a better world, borne out of his own deep and abiding humanity. We are deeply honoured to be his publisher, and we will all miss him: his kindness, his warmth, his wisdom, his friendship. His loss is incalculable, but his legacy is immense. His work and his spirit will live on.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/september/david-graeber-author-activist-dies.html|title = 'Inspirational' activist author David Graeber dies}}</ref>
