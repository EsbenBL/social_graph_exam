The '''Republic of Uzbekistan''' ({{lang-uz|O{{okina}}zbekiston Respublikasi}}), is a  [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Asia]]. It is itself surrounded by five landlocked countries: [[Kazakhstan]] to the [[Kazakhstan–Uzbekistan border|north]]; [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the [[Kyrgyzstan–Uzbekistan border|northeast]]; [[Tajikistan]] to the [[Tajikistan–Uzbekistan border|southeast]]; [[Afghanistan]] to the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan border|south]], [[Turkmenistan]] to the [[Turkmenistan–Uzbekistan border|south-west]]. Its [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Tashkent]]. Uzbekistan is part of the [[Turkic languages]] world, as well as a member of the [[Turkic Council]]. While the [[Uzbek language]] is the majority spoken language in Uzbekistan, [[Russian language|Russian]] is widely used as an inter-ethnic tongue and in government. Islam is the majority religion in Uzbekistan, most Uzbeks being [[non-denominational Muslim]]s.<ref>"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation". The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity. Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project. 9 August 2012. Retrieved 4 September 2013.</ref> 

The first recorded settlers on what is now Uzbekistan were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as [[Scythians]], who founded kingdoms in [[Khwarazm]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Bactria]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Sogdia]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Fergana Valley#History|Fergana]] (3rd century BC – 6th century AD), and [[Margiana]] (3rd century BC – 6th century AD). <ref>[https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/language-families/uzbek-the-penguin-of-turkic-languages.html Uzbek, “the penguin of Turkic languages”].</ref> The area was incorporated into the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] and, after a period of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Macedonian rule]], was ruled by the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]] and later by the [[Sasanian Empire]], until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the seventh century. The [[Early Muslim conquests]] and the subsequent [[Samanid Empire]] converted most of the people, including the local ruling classes, into adherents of [[Islam]]. During this period, cities such as [[Samarkand]], [[Khiva]], and [[Bukhara]] began to grow rich from the [[Silk Road]], and witnessed the emergence of leading figures of the [[Islamic Golden Age]], including [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]], [[Al-Tirmidhi]], [[al Khwarizmi]], [[al-Biruni]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Omar Khayyam]]. The local [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] and Central Asia as a whole were decimated by the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century, after which the region became dominated by Turkic peoples. The city of [[Shahrisabz]] was the birthplace of the Turco-Mongol conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), who in the 14th century established the [[Timurid Empire]] and was proclaimed the Supreme Emir of [[Turan]] with his capital in Samarkand, which became a centre of science under the rule of [[Ulugh Beg]], giving birth to the [[Timurid Renaissance]]. The territories of the [[Timurid dynasty]] were conquered by [[Shaybanids|Uzbek Shaybanids]] in the 16th century, moving the centre of power to [[Bukhara]]. The region was split into three states: the [[Khanate of Khiva]], [[Khanate of Kokand]] and [[Emirate of Bukhara]]. Conquests by Emperor [[Babur]] towards the east led to the foundation of India's newest invasions as [[Mughal Empire]]. All of Central Asia [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|was gradually incorporated]] into the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century, with [[Tashkent]] becoming the political center of [[Russian Turkestan]]. In 1924, [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|national delimitation]] created the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] as an independent republic within the [[Soviet Union]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it declared [[Independence Day (Uzbekistan)|independence]] as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991.

Uzbekistan is a [[secular state]], with a [[Presidential system|presidential]]  [[Constitution of Uzbekistan|constitutional]] government in place. Uzbekistan comprises 12 [[Regions of Uzbekistan|regions]] (vilayats), [[Tashkent|Tashkent City]] and one [[Autonomy|autonomous]] republic, [[Karakalpakstan]].

The [[Economy of Uzbekistan|Uzbek economy]] is in a gradual transition to the [[market economy]], with foreign trade policy being based on [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]]. In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible at market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of [[cotton]].

==Etymology==
The name "Uzbegistán" appears in the 16th century [[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat|Tarikh-i Rashidi]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Qazaq Khanate as Documented in Ming Dynasty Sources|author=Kenzheakhmet Nurlan|page=140|year=2013}}</ref>

The origin of the word Uzbek remains disputed. Three views exist as to the adjective accompanying ''[[-stan]]'' (in the family of [[Iranian languages]]: "land of"):
#"free", "independent" or the "lord himself" requiring an [[amalgamation (linguistics)|amalgamation]] of ''uz'' ([[Turkic language|Turkic]]: "own"), ''bek'' ("master" or "leader")<ref name="H. Keane, A. Hingston Quiggin p.312"/>
#[[eponym]]ously named after [[Oghuz Khagan]], also known as ''Oghuz Beg''<ref name="H. Keane, A. Hingston Quiggin p.312">A. H. Keane, A. Hingston Quiggin, A. C. Haddon, Man: Past and Present, p.312, Cambridge University Press, 2011, Google Books, quoted: "Who take their name from a mythical Uz-beg, Prince Uz (beg in Turki=a chief, or hereditary ruler)."</ref> 
#A contraction of ''Uğuz'', earlier Oğuz, that is, [[Oghuz (tribe)]], amalgamated with ''bek'' "[[oghuz (tribe)|oguz]]-leader".<ref>{{cite book|last=MacLeod|first=Calum|title=Uzbekistan: Golden Road to Samarkand|page=31|author2=Bradley Mayhew}}</ref>

All three have the middle syllable/phoneme being [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] with Turkic title ''[[Beg (title)|Beg]]''.

The place was often spelled as “Ўзбекистон” in Cyrillic, the script used during Soviet rule.

The first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were [[Scythians]] who came from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan, sometime in the first millennium BC; when these nomads settled in the region they built an extensive irrigation system along the rivers.<ref name="Lubin-earlyhistory">''This section incorporates text from the following source, which is in the [[public domain]]'': Lubin, Nancy (1997).

As East Asian countries began to develop its silk trade with the West, Persian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centres of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and rural settlements in the province of [[Transoxiana]], and further east in what is today China's [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region, the Sogdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. As a result of this trade on what became known as the [[Silk Route]], Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times [[Transoxiana]] (Mawarannahr) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.<ref name="Lubin-earlyhistory"/>

In 327 BC Macedonian ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] provinces of Sogdiana and Bactria, which contained the territories of modern Uzbekistan. A conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of the Macedonian [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. The kingdom was replaced with the Yuezhi dominated [[Kushan Empire]] in the 1st century BC. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by the Persian empires, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires, as well as by other empires, for example, those formed by the Turko-Persian [[Hephthalite]] and Turkic [[Gokturk]] peoples.

In the 8th century, Transoxiana, the territory between the [[Amu Darya|Amudarya]] and [[Syr Darya|Syrdarya]] rivers, was conquered by the Arabs ([[Qutayba ibn Muslim]]) becoming a focal point soon after of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Among the achievements of scholars during this period were the development of [[trigonometry]] into its modern form (simplifying its practical application to calculate the phases of the moon), advances in [[optics]], in [[astronomy]], as well as in poetry, philosophy, art, calligraphy, and many others, which set the foundation for the Muslim Renaissance.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Center of Islamic Civilization in Uzbekistan under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan|url=http://www.cisc.uz/habar-ISLAMIC-STUDIES-IN-MODERN-UZBEKISTAN-246|access-date=2021-07-07|website=www.cisc.uz}}</ref>

In the 9th and 10th centuries, Transoxiana was included into the [[Samanid]] State. Later, Transoxiana saw the incursion of the Turkic-ruled [[Karakhanids]], as well as the [[Seljuks]] (Sultan Sanjar) and [[Kara-Khitans]].<ref name="UNESCO">{{Cite book|last = Davidovich|first = E.

The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest under [[Genghis Khan]] during the 13th century would bring about a change to the region. The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] led to the displacement of some of the Iranian-speaking people of the region, their culture and heritage being superseded by that of the [[Mongols|Mongolian]]-[[Turkic peoples]] who came thereafter. The invasions of Bukhara, Samarkand, [[Köneürgenç|Urgench]] and others resulted in [[Destruction under the Mongol Empire|mass murders]] and unprecedented destruction, such as portions of [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarezmia]] being completely razed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120118054002/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities (XI – XIII century)]. faculty.washington.edu</ref>

Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, the Mongol law of the Mongol Empire maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Transoxiana stayed in the hands of the direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan]], the second son of Genghis Khan. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained a strong and united kingdom ([[Golden Horde]]).<ref name="Lubin-Timur">''This section incorporates text from the following source, which is in the [[public domain]]'': Lubin, Nancy (1997).

Timur initiated the last flowering of Transoxiana by gathering together numerous artisans and scholars from the vast lands he had conquered into his capital, Samarqand, thus imbuing his empire with a rich Perso-Islamic culture.

Uzbekistan lies between latitudes [[37th parallel north|37°]] and [[46th parallel north|46° N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian east|56°]] and [[74th meridian east|74° E]]. It stretches {{convert|1425|km|mi}} from west to east and {{convert|930|km|mi}} from north to south. Bordering [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Aralkum Desert]] (former [[Aral Sea]]) to the north and northwest, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] to the southwest, [[Tajikistan]] to the southeast, and [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the northeast, Uzbekistan is one of the largest [[Central Asia]]n states and the only Central Asian state to border all the other four. Uzbekistan also shares a short border (less than {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with [[Afghanistan]] to the south.

Uzbekistan is a dry, [[landlocked country]]. It is one of two [[doubly landlocked]] countries in the world (that is, a landlocked country completely surrounded by other landlocked countries), the other being [[Liechtenstein]]. In addition, due to its location within a series of [[endorheic basin]]s, none of its rivers lead to the sea. Less than 10% of its territory is intensively cultivated irrigated land in river valleys and oases, and formerly in the [[Aral Sea]], which has largely desiccated in one of the world's worst environmental disasters.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daily Telegraph|title=Aral Sea 'one of the planet's worst environmental disasters'| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/7554679/Aral-Sea-one-of-the-planets-worst-environmental-disasters.html|date=5 April 2010|access-date=1 May 2010| location=London|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408214552/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/7554679/Aral-Sea-one-of-the-planets-worst-environmental-disasters.html|archive-date=8 April 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The rest is the vast [[Kyzylkum Desert]] and mountains.

After Uzbekistan declared independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, an election was held, and [[Islam Karimov]] was elected as the [[List of Presidents of Uzbekistan|first President]] of Uzbekistan on 29 December 1991.

The elections of the [[Oliy Majlis]] (Parliament or Supreme Assembly) were held under a resolution adopted by the 16th Supreme Soviet in 1994. In that year, the Supreme Soviet was replaced by the Oliy Majlis.

The third elections for the bicameral 150-member Oliy Majlis, the Legislative Chamber, and the 100-member Senate for five-year terms, were held on 27 December 2009. The second elections were held from December 2004 to January 2005. The Oliy Majlis was unicameral up to 2004. Its size increased from 69 deputies (members) in 1994 to 120 in 2004–05 and currently stands at 150.

{{Confusing|section|reason=the last paragraph seems to lack preceding context|date=August 2018}}

Karimov's first presidential term was extended to 2000 via a [[1995 Uzbek presidential term referendum|referendum]], and he was re-elected in [[2000 Uzbekistani presidential election|2000]], [[2007 Uzbekistani presidential election|2007]], and 2015, each time receiving over 90% of the vote. Most international observers refused to participate in the process and did not recognise the results, dismissing them as not meeting basic standards.

The 2002 referendum also included a plan for a bicameral parliament consisting of a lower house (the Oliy Majlis) and an upper house (Senate). Members of the lower house are to be "full-time" legislators. Elections for the new bicameral parliament took place on 26 December.

Following Islam Karimov's death on 2 September 2016, the [[Oliy Majlis]] appointed Prime Minister [[Shavkat Mirziyoyev]] as interim president. Although the chairman of the Senate, [[Nigmatilla Yuldashev]], was constitutionally designated as Karimov's successor, Yuldashev proposed that Mirziyoyev take the post of the interim president instead in light of Mirziyoyev's "many years of experience". Mirziyoyev was subsequently elected as the country's second president in the [[Uzbekistani presidential election, 2016|December 2016 presidential election]], winning 88.6% of the vote, and was sworn in on 14 December.  Deputy Prime Minister [[Abdulla Aripov]] replaced him as prime minister.

Mirziyoyev removed most of Karimov's officials and urged the government to employ "new, young people who love their country." After a year in office, Mirziyoyev moved away from many of his predecessor's policies.

[[File:Baku hosts 7th Summit of Cooperation Council of Turkic-Speaking States 07.jpg|thumb|Representatives of Uzbekistan at the [[Turkic Council]] meeting in [[Baku]].]]
Uzbekistan joined the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in December 1991. However, it is opposed to reintegration and withdrew from the CIS collective security arrangement in 1999. Since that time, Uzbekistan has participated in the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and in UN-organized groups to help resolve the Tajikistan and Afghanistan conflicts, both of which it sees as posing threats to its own stability.

Previously close to Washington (which gave Uzbekistan half a billion dollars in aid in 2004, about a quarter of its military budget), the government of Uzbekistan has recently restricted American military use of the airbase at [[Karshi-Khanabad]] for air operations in neighbouring Afghanistan.<ref>Marquardt, Erich and Wolfe, Adam (17 October 2005) [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26246.html Rice Attempts to Secure US Influence in Central Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503094751/http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26246.html |date=3 May 2012 }}, Global Policy Forum.</ref> Uzbekistan was an active supporter of U.S. efforts against worldwide terrorism and joined the coalitions that have dealt with both Afghanistan and Iraq.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hill|first=Fiona|date=13 December 2001|title=Contributions of Central Asian Nations to the Campaign Against Terrorism|url=https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/contributions-of-central-asian-nations-to-the-campaign-against-terrorism/|access-date=2021-07-07|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The relationship between Uzbekistan and the United States began to deteriorate after the so-called "[[colour revolutions]]" in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Ukraine (and to a lesser extent [[Kyrgyzstan]]). When the U.S. joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody events at [[Andijan massacre|Andijan]], the relationship further declined, and President Islam Karimov changed the political alignment of the country to bring it closer to Russia and China.

In late July 2005, the government of Uzbekistan ordered the United States to vacate an airbase in Karshi-Kanabad (near Uzbekistan's border with Afghanistan) within 180 days.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=31 July 2005|title=Uzbekistan kicks US out of military base|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/01/usa.nickpatonwalsh|access-date=5 January 2021|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Karimov had offered use of the base to the U.S. shortly after [[9/11]]. It is also believed by some Uzbeks that the protests in Andijan were brought about by the UK and U.S. influences in the area of Andijan.<ref name=":1" /> This is another reason for the hostility between Uzbekistan and the West.

Uzbekistan is a member of the United Nations (UN) (since 2 March 1992), the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC), [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP), and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). It belongs to the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO) (comprising the five Central Asian countries, [[Azerbaijan]], Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan). In 1999, Uzbekistan joined the [[GUAM]] alliance (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and [[Moldova]]), which was formed in 1997 (making it GUUAM), but pulled out of the organisation in 2005.

[[File:2015 Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization 03.jpg|thumb|Leaders present at the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]] summit in [[Ufa]], Russia in 2015]]
Uzbekistan is also a member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (SCO) and hosts the SCO's Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in Tashkent. Uzbekistan joined the new [[Central Asian Cooperation Organisation]] (CACO) in 2002. The CACO consists of Uzbekistan, [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], and Kyrgyzstan. It is a founding member of, and remains involved in, the [[Central Asian Union]], formed with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and joined in March 1998 by Tajikistan.

In December 1994 Uzbekistan applied for the [[World Trade Organization]] membership and received an observer status to start the [https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/acc_e.htm accession process]. The Working Party on the Accession of Uzbekistan to the WTO held its 4th meeting on 7 July 2020 — almost 15 years after its last formal meeting.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Uzbekistan resumes WTO membership negotiations|url=https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news20_e/acc_uzb_07jul20_e.htm|access-date=2021-09-24|website=www.wto.org|language=en}}</ref>

In September 2006, [[UNESCO]] presented Islam Karimov an award for Uzbekistan's preservation of its rich culture and traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=12 September 2006|title=Surprise at Unesco award for President Karimov {{!}} Reporters without borders|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/surprise-unesco-award-president-karimov|access-date=5 January 2021|website=RSF}}</ref> Despite criticism, this seems to be a sign of improving relationships between Uzbekistan and the West.

The month of October 2006 also saw a decrease in the isolation of Uzbekistan from the West. The [[European Union|EU]] announced that it was planning to send a delegation to Uzbekistan to talk about human rights and liberties, after a long period of hostile relations between the two. Although it is equivocal about whether the official or unofficial version of the [[Andijan Massacre]] is true, the EU is evidently willing to ease its economic sanctions against Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed among Uzbekistan's population that the government will stand firm in maintaining its close ties with the [[Russian Federation]] and in its theory that the 2004–2005 protests in Uzbekistan were promoted by the US and UK.

In January 2008, [[Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva]] was appointed to her current role as Uzbekistan's ambassador to [[UNESCO]]. Karimova-Tillyaeva and her team have been instrumental in promoting inter-cultural dialogue by increasing European society's awareness of Uzbekistan's cultural and historical heritage.

[[non-governmental organization|Non-governmental]] human rights organisations, such as [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|IHF]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], as well as [[United States Department of State]] and [[Council of the European Union]], define Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with limited civil rights"<ref name="US State Dept - human rights">US Department of State, [https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/sca/119143.htm 2008 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Uzbekistan], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, 25 February 2009</ref> and express profound concern about "wide-scale violation of virtually all basic human rights".<ref>IHF,{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf-hr.org/documents/doc_summary.php?sec_id=3&d_id=3860 |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 February 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129175624/http://www.ihf-hr.org/documents/doc_summary.php?sec_id=3&d_id=3860 |archive-date=29 January 2010 }}, 23 June 2004</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Regions of Uzbekistan|Districts of Uzbekistan}}
Uzbekistan is divided into twelve [[province]]s (''viloyatlar'', singular ''[[viloyat]]'', compound noun ''viloyati'' e.g., Toshkent ''viloyati'', Samarqand ''viloyati'', etc.), one [[autonomous republic]] (''respublika'', compound noun ''respublikasi'' e.g. Qoraqalpog{{okina}}iston Muxtor ''Respublikasi'', Karakalpakstan ''Autonomous Republic'', etc.), and one [[independent city]] (''shahar'', compound noun ''shahri'', e.g., Toshkent ''shahri''). Names are given below in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]] languages when applicable, although numerous variations of the transliterations of each name exist.

Facing a multitude of economic challenges upon acquiring independence, the government adopted an evolutionary reform strategy, with an emphasis on state control, reduction of imports and self-sufficiency in energy. Since 1994, the state-controlled media have repeatedly proclaimed the success of this "Uzbekistan Economic Model"<ref>Islam Karimov's interview to Rossijskaya Gazeta, 7 July 1995{{cite web|url=http://2004.press-service.uz/rus/knigi/9tom/3tom_12.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 November 2005 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922045122/http://2004.press-service.uz/rus/knigi/9tom/3tom_12.htm |archive-date=22 September 2008 }} (in Russian).</ref> and suggested that it is a unique example of a smooth transition to the market economy while avoiding shock, pauperism and stagnation.

The gradualist reform strategy has involved postponing significant macroeconomic and structural reforms. The state in the hands of the [[new class|bureaucracy]] has remained a dominant influence in the economy. Corruption permeates the society and grows more rampant over time: Uzbekistan's 2005 [[Corruption Perception Index]] was 137 out of 159 countries, whereas in 2007 Uzbekistan was 175th out of 179 countries. A February 2006 report on the country by the [[International Crisis Group]] suggests that revenues earned from key exports, especially cotton, gold, corn and increasingly gas, are distributed among a very small circle of the ruling elite, with little or no benefit for the populace at large.<ref>Thomas, Gary (16 February 2006). {{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/New-Report-Paints-Grim-Picture-of-Uzbekistan.cfm?CFID=281017252&CFTOKEN=40626492&jsessionid=00308b85b39c112dba1e6241221e37211353 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090825223014/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/New-Report-Paints-Grim-Picture-of-Uzbekistan.cfm?CFID=281017252&CFTOKEN=40626492&jsessionid=00308b85b39c112dba1e6241221e37211353 |archive-date=25 August 2009 |title=New Report Paints Grim Picture of Uzbekistan |url-status=dead |access-date=1 June 2016}}.

The [[Tashkent Stock Exchange|Republican Stock Exchange]] (RSE) opened in 1994. The stocks of all Uzbek joint stock companies (around 1,250) are traded on RSE. The number of listed companies as of January 2013 exceeds 110. Securities market volume reached 2 trillion in 2012, and the number is rapidly growing due to the rising interest by companies of attracting necessary resources through the capital market. According to Central Depository as of January 2013 par value of outstanding shares of Uzbek emitters exceeded nine trillion.

Thanks in part to the recovery of world market prices of gold and cotton (the country's key export commodities), expanded natural gas and some manufacturing exports, and increasing labour migrant transfers, the current account turned into a large surplus (between 9% and 11% of GDP from 2003 to 2005).

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Adib-i sani.jpg|thumb|upright|A page in [[Uzbek language]] written in [[Nastaʿlīq]] script printed in Tashkent 1911]]
The Uzbek language is one of the [[Turkic languages]] close to [[Uyghur language]] and both of them belong to the [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] branch of the Turkic language family. It is the only official national language and since 1992 is officially written in the [[Latin alphabet]].<ref>Anthony J. Liddicoat, "Uzbekistan", in Liddicoat and Andy Kirkpatrick, eds., ''The Routledge International Handbook of Language Education Policy in Asia'' (London: Routledge, 2019), 495. {{ISBN|9781317354499}}</ref>

Before the 1920s, the written language of Uzbeks was called Turki (known to Western scholars as [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]) and used the [[Nastaʿlīq]] script. In 1926 the Latin alphabet was introduced and went through several revisions throughout the 1930s. Finally, in 1940, the Cyrillic alphabet was introduced by Soviet authorities and was used until the fall of Soviet Union. In 1993 Uzbekistan shifted back to the Latin script ([[Uzbek alphabet]]), which was modified in 1996 and is being taught in schools since 2000. Educational establishments teach only the Latin notation. At the same time, the Cyrillic notation is common among the older generation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&pg=PP14|title=The New Woman in Uzbekistan: Islam, Modernity, and Unveiling Under Communism|last=Kamp|first=Marianne|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-295-98819-1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405011646/http://books.google.com/books?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&pg=PP14|archive-date=5 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Even though the Cyrillic notation of Uzbek has now been abolished for official documents, it is still used by a number of popular newspapers and websites whilst a few TV channels duplicate the Latin notation with the Cyrillic one.

[[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], belonging to the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] branch of the Turkic language family and thus closer to [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], is spoken by half a million people, primarily in the [[Karakalpakstan|Republic of Karakalpakstan]], and has an official status in that territory.

Although the [[Russian language]] is not an official language in the country, it is widely used in many fields.

[[Tashkent]], the nation's capital and largest city, has a four-line [[Tashkent Metro|metro]] built in 1977, and expanded in 2001 after ten years' independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are currently the only two countries in Central Asia with a subway system. It is promoted as one of the cleanest systems in the former Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.tashkent.org/uzland/subway.html Tashkent Subway for Quick Travel to Hotels, Resorts, and Around the City!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118202134/http://www.tashkent.org/uzland/subway.html |date=18 January 2012 }} tashkent.org</ref> The stations are exceedingly ornate. For example, the station ''Metro Kosmonavtov'' built in 1984 is decorated using a [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] theme to recognise the achievements of humankind in space exploration and to commemorate the role of [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]], the Soviet [[cosmonaut]] of Uzbek origin. A statue of Vladimir Dzhanibekov stands near a station entrance.

There are government-operated trams and buses running across the city. There are also many taxis, registered and unregistered. Uzbekistan has plants that produce modern cars. The car production is supported by the government and the Korean auto company [[Daewoo]]. In May 2007 [[UzDaewooAuto]], the car maker, signed a strategic agreement with General Motors-Daewoo Auto and Technology ([[GM Daewoo|GMDAT]], see [[:en:GM Uzbekistan|GM Uzbekistan]] also).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uzdaily.com/?c=118&a=1315 |title=Uzbekistan, General Motors sign strategic deal |publisher=Uzdaily.com |access-date=2 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516011802/http://www.uzdaily.com/?c=118&a=1315 |archive-date=16 May 2011 }}</ref> The government bought a stake in Turkey's Koc in [[SamKochAvto]], a producer of small buses and lorries.

Train links connect many towns in Uzbekistan, as well as neighbouring former republics of the Soviet Union. Moreover, after independence two fast-running train systems were established. Uzbekistan launched the first [[Tashkent–Samarkand high-speed rail line|high-speed railway in Central Asia]] in September 2011 between [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarqand]]. The new high-speed electric train [[Talgo 250]], called ''Afrosiyob'', was manufactured by [[Talgo|Patentes Talgo S.L.]] (Spain) and took its first trip from Tashkent to Samarkand on 26 August 2011.<ref>[http://www.uzdaily.com/articles-id-15511.htm First high-speed electricity train carries out first trip from Samarkand and Tashkent, 27 August 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111171755/http://www.uzdaily.com/articles-id-15511.htm |date=11 January 2012 }}.

There is a large aeroplane plant that was built during the Soviet era&nbsp;– [[Tashkent Aviation Production Association|Tashkent Chkalov Aviation Manufacturing Plant]] or ТАПОиЧ in Russian. The plant originated during World War II, when production facilities were evacuated south and east to avoid capture by advancing Nazi forces. Until the late 1980s, the plant was one of the leading aeroplane production centres in the USSR. With dissolution of the Soviet Union, its manufacturing equipment became outdated; most of the workers were laid off. Now it produces only a few planes a year, but with interest from Russian companies growing, there are rumours of production-enhancement plans.

==Military==
{{Main|Armed Forces of the Republic of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Ukbekistani troops.jpg|thumb|right|Uzbek troops during a cooperative operation exercise]]
With close to 65,000 servicemen, Uzbekistan possesses the largest armed forces in Central Asia. The military structure is largely inherited from the [[Turkestan Military District]] of the [[Soviet Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Uzbekistan {{!}} Countries {{!}} Collection of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum|url=https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/countries/23424980/|access-date=2021-07-07|website=collection.cooperhewitt.org}}</ref> The Uzbek Armed Forces' equipment is standard, mostly consisting those of post-Soviet inheritance and newly crafted Russian and some American equipment.

The government has accepted the arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union, acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (as a non-nuclear state), and supported an active program by the U.S. [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA) in western Uzbekistan ([[Nukus]] and [[Vozrozhdeniye Island]]). The Government of Uzbekistan spends about 3.7% of GDP on the military but has received a growing infusion of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and other security assistance funds since 1998.

Following 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., Uzbekistan approved the [[U.S. Central Command]]'s request for access to an air base, the [[Karshi-Khanabad]] airfield, in southern Uzbekistan. However, Uzbekistan demanded that the U.S. withdraw from the airbases after the [[Andijan massacre]] and the U.S. reaction to this massacre. The last US troops left Uzbekistan in November 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Troops Leave Uzbekistan|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-troops-leave-uzbekistan/|access-date=5 January 2021|website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref> In 2020, it was revealed that the former US base was contaminated with radioactive materials which may have resulted in unusually high cancer rates in US personnel stationed there.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Herridge|first1=Catherine|date=October 26, 2020|first2=Jessica|last2=Kegu|work=CBS News|title=Uzbek base that housed U.S. troops allegedly had "7 to 9 times higher than normal" radiation, yellowcake uranium|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uzbekistan-k2-karshi-khanabad-base-us-troops-radiation/|access-date=5 January 2021}}</ref>

Uzbekistan has a wide mix of ethnic groups and cultures, with the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] being the majority group. In 1995 about 71% of Uzbekistan's population was Uzbek. The chief minority groups were Russians (8%), [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] (3–4.7%),<ref name="Karl Cordell 1999. pg 201"/><ref name="Lena Jonson 2006. pg 108"/><ref name="Foltz2"/><ref name="cornellcaspian.com"/> [[Kazakhs]] (4%), [[Tatar]]s (2.5%) and [[Karakalpaks]] (2%). It is said, however, that non-Uzbeks decline as Russians and other minority groups slowly leave and Uzbeks return from other parts of the former [[Soviet Union]].
[[File:Suzani (Boukhara, Ouzbékistan) (5657423581).jpg|thumb|Embroidery from Uzbekistan]]
When Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991, there was concern that [[Muslim fundamentalism]] would spread across the region.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Uzbekistan's History With Islam Might Explain a Lot About the New York Attack Suspect|url=https://time.com/5005629/new-york-attack-manhattan-saipov-uzbekistan/|access-date=5 January 2021|magazine=Time}}</ref> The expectation was that a country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of its dominant faith.

According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, Uzbekistan's population is 96.3% Muslim, around 54% identifies as non-denominational Muslim, 18% as Sunni and 1% as Shia. And around 11% say they belong to a Sufi order.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-08-09|title=Religious Identity Among Muslims|url=https://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|language=en-US}}</ref>

Central Asian classical music is called [[Shashmaqam]], which arose in [[Bukhara]] in the late 16th century when that city was a regional capital.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-19|title=Shashmaqam - Music and Poetry of Central Asia|url=https://voicesoncentralasia.org/shashmaqam-music-and-poetry-of-central-asia/|access-date=2021-07-07|website=Voices On Cental Asia|language=en-US}}</ref>[https://open.spotify.com/album/26g2oEzxzPvvJtz0HqRBt3] Shashmaqam is closely related to [[Azerbaijan]]i [[Mugam]] and [[Uyghur muqam]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Musical and Ontological Possibilities of Mugham Creativity in pre-Soviet, Soviet, and post-Soviet Azerbaijan|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/80818/3/Dessiatnitchenko_Polina_201711_PhD_thesis.pdf}}</ref> The name, which translates as ''six maqams'' refers to the structure of the music, which contains six sections in six different [[Musical mode]]s, similar to classical [[Persian traditional music]]. Interludes of spoken [[Sufi poetry]] interrupt the music, typically beginning at a lower register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone.

===Education===
Uzbekistan has a high [[literacy rate]], with 99.9% of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write.<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 November 2016|title=Uzbekistan|url=http://uis.unesco.org/en/country/uz|access-date=5 January 2021|website=uis.unesco.org}}</ref> However, with only 76% of the under-15 population currently enrolled in education (and only 20% of the 3–6 year olds attending pre-school), this figure may drop in the future. Students attend school Monday through Saturday during the school year, and education officially concludes at the end of the 12th grade.

There are two international schools operating in Uzbekistan, both in Tashkent: The British School catering for elementary students only, and [[Tashkent International School]], a K-12 international curriculum school.

Uzbekistan has encountered severe budget shortfalls in its education program. The education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform, but the physical base has deteriorated and curriculum revision has been slow. Corruption within the education system is rampant, with students from wealthier families routinely bribing teachers and school executives to achieve high grades without attending school, or undertaking official examinations.<ref>Kozlova, Marina (21 January 2008) [http://chalkboard.tol.org/uzbekistan-lessons-in-graft Uzbekistan: Lessons in Graft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608053517/http://chalkboard.tol.org/uzbekistan-lessons-in-graft |date=8 June 2012 }}.

Uzbek cuisine is influenced by local [[agriculture]], as in most nations. There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so bread and noodles are of importance and Uzbek cuisine has been characterised as "noodle-rich". [[Mutton]] is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of [[sheep]] in the country and it is part of various Uzbek dishes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mutton from Central Asia - Pilot Guides - Travel, Explore, Learn|url=https://www.pilotguides.com/articles/mutton-from-central-asia/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Pilot Guides|language=en-US}}</ref>

Uzbekistan's signature dish is [[Pilaf|palov]] (''plov'' or ''osh''), a main course typically made with [[rice]], pieces of [[meat]], and grated [[carrot]]s and [[onion]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cuisine of Uzbekistan.

There are a lot of different types of palov, every region have their own recipe of the dish.

Other notable national dishes include [[shurpa]] (''shurva'' or ''shorva''), a soup made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually [[mutton]]), and fresh vegetables;<ref>{{Cite web|title=Uzbek shurpa – one of the most popular dishes in the Uzbek cuisine.|url=https://www.people-travels.com/about-uzbekistan/uzbek-cuisine/uzbek-shurpa.html|access-date=2021-07-08|website=www.people-travels.com}}</ref> [[Naryn (soup)|norin]] and [[Laghman (soup)|laghman]], noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course;<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 Most Popular Foods You Have To Eat In Uzbekistan (2019)|url=https://uzwifi.com/en/blog/10-most-popular-foods-you-have-to-eat-in-uzbekistan-2019|access-date=2021-07-08|website=uzwifi.com}}</ref> [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[chuchvara]], and [[somsa]], stuffed pockets of [[dough]] served as an appetiser or a main course; [[dimlama]], a meat and vegetable stew; and various [[kebabs]], usually served as a main course.

The use of alcohol is less widespread than in the West, but wine is comparatively popular for a Muslim nation as Uzbekistan is largely secular. Uzbekistan has 14 wineries, the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in [[Samarkand]] (established in 1927).<ref>{{Cite web|title=What to eat and drink in Uzbekistan|url=https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/asia/uzbekistan/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=World Travel Guide|language=en-US}}</ref> The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local grape varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet]] dessert wine in Russian).
