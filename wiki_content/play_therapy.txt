'''Play therapy''' refers to a range of methods of capitalising on children's natural urge to explore and harnessing it to meet and respond to the developmental and later also their mental health needs. It is also used for [[Anatomically correct doll|forensic]] or psychological assessment purposes where the individual is too young or too traumatised to give a verbal account of adverse, abusive or potentially criminal circumstances in their life.

Play therapy is extensively acknowledged by specialists as an effective intervention in complementing children's personal and inter-personal development. Play and play therapy are generally employed with children aged six months through late adolescence and young adulthood. They provide a contained way for them to express their experiences and feelings through an [[Imagination|imaginative]] self-expressive process in the context of a trusted relationship with the care giver or therapist.<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Wilfred Bion|Bion, W. R.]]|date=1970|title= Attention and Interpretation|chapter=Container and Contained Transformed|location= London|publisher= Tavistock Publications. [Reprinted London: Karnac Books 1984]}}</ref> As children's and young people's experiences and knowledge are typically communicated through play, it is an essential vehicle for personality and social development.

In recent years play therapists in the western hemisphere, as a body of health professionals, are usually members or affiliates of professional training institutions and tend to be subject to codes of ethical practice.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Reynolds,Cynthia A.|title= Handbook of Play Therapy|chapter= Ethics in Play Therapy|

== Play as therapy ==
According to [[Jean Piaget]], "play provides the child with the live, dynamic, individual language indispensable for the expression of [the child’s] subjective feelings for which collective language alone is inadequate."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Play, dreams and imitation in childhood|last=Piaget|first=Jean|publisher=W.

Play helps a child develop a sense of true self and a mastery over her/his innate abilities resulting in a sense of worth and aptitude.<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Donald Woods Winnicott|Winnicott, D. W.]]|title=Playing and Reality|location= London|publisher= Tavistock|date= 1971}}</ref> During play, children are driven to meet the essential need of exploring and affecting their environment. Play also contributes in the advancement of creative thinking. Play likewise provides a way for children to release strong emotions. During play, children may play out challenging life experiences by re-engineering them, thereby discharging emotional states, with the potential of integrating every experience back into stability and gaining a greater sense of mastery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homeyer|first=Linda, E.|date=2008|title=Play Therapy: Practice, Issues, and Trends|url=http://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/1-2-article-play-therapy.pdf|journal=American Journal of Play|volume=1|pages=212}}</ref>

==General==
Play therapy is a form of psychotherapy which uses play as the main mode of communication especially with children, and people whose speech capacity may be compromised, to determine and overcome psychosocial challenges. It is aimed at helping patients towards better [[individuation|growth and development]], [[social integration]], decreased aggression,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Brittany J.|last2=Ray|first2=Dee|date=11 September 2018|title=Child-Centered Play Therapy: Aggression, Empathy, and Self-Regulation|journal=Journal of Counseling & Development|volume=96|issue=4|pages=399–409|doi=10.1002/jcad.12222|issn=0748-9633}}</ref> emotional modulation, social skill development,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Swank|first1=Jacqueline M.|last2=Cheung|first2=Christopher|last3=Williams|first3=Sydney A.|date=3 July 2018|title=Play Therapy and Psychoeducational School-Based Group Interventions: A Comparison of Treatment Effectiveness|journal=The Journal for Specialists in Group Work|volume=43|issue=3|pages=230–249|doi=10.1080/01933922.2018.1485801|s2cid=149471176|issn=0193-3922}}</ref> empathy,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Kallie B.|last2=Barber|first2=Catherine R.|date=January 2015|title=Examining the use of play activities to increase appropriate classroom behaviors.|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1037/a0038466|issn=1939-0629}}</ref> and trauma resolution. Play therapy also assists with [[sensorimotor development]] and coping skills.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = DeGangi | first1 = G. | last2 = Wietlisbach | first2 = S. | last3 = Goodin | first3 = M. | last4 = Scheiner | first4 = N. | year = 1993 | title = A comparison of structured sensorimotor therapy and child-centered activity in the treatment of preschool children with sensorimotor problems | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 777–786 | doi=10.5014/ajot.47.9.777| pmid = 7509573 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cochran|first1=Jeff L.|last2=Cochran|first2=Nancy H.|date=2017|title=Effects of child-centered play therapy for students with highly-disruptive behavior in high-poverty schools.|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|volume=26|issue=2|pages=59–72|doi=10.1037/pla0000052|s2cid=151963952|issn=1939-0629}}</ref>

===Diagnostic tool===
Play therapy can also be used as a tool for diagnosis. A play therapist observes a client playing with toys ([[Wendy house|play-houses]], soft toys, dolls, etc.) to determine the cause of the disturbed behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kendall-Tackett | first1 = K | year = 1992 | title = Beyond anatomical dolls: Professionals' use of other play therapy techniques | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 139–142 | doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90014-i| pmid = 1544025 }}</ref> The objects and patterns of play, as well as the willingness to interact with the therapist, can be used to understand the underlying rationale for behaviour both inside and outside of therapy session. Caution, however, should be taken when using play therapy for assessment and/or diagnostic purposes.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Paulina F. |last1=Kernberg |first2=Saralea E. |last2=Chazan |first3=Lina |last3=Normandin |title=The Children's Play Therapy Instrument (CPTI): Description, Development, and Reliability Studies |journal=The Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=196–207 |date=1998 |pmid=9631341 |pmc=3330503 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kot | first1 = S. | last2 = Landreth | first2 = G. | last3 = Giordano | first3 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Intensive child-centered play therapy with child witnesses of domestic violence | journal = International Journal of Play Therapy | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 17–36 | doi=10.1037/h0089421}}</ref>
 
According to the [[psychodynamic]] view, people (especially children) will engage in play behaviour to work through their interior [[Anxiety|anxieties]]. According to this viewpoint, play therapy can be used as a self-regulating mechanism, as long as children are allowed time for "free play" or "unstructured play." However, some forms of therapy depart from non-directiveness in fantasy play, and introduce varying amounts of direction, during the therapy session.

An example of a more directive approach to play therapy, for example, can entail the use of a type of [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitisation]] or relearning therapy, to change troubling behaviours, either systematically or through a less structured approach. The hope is that through the language of symbolic play, such desensitisation may take place, as a natural part of the therapeutic experience, and lead to positive treatment outcomes.

==Origins==
[[File:Little horse on wheels (Ancient greek child's Toy).jpg|thumb|upright|Little horse on wheels, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] children's toy. From a tomb dating 950–900 BCE, [[Kerameikos]] Archaeological Museum, Athens]]
[[Children's play]] has been recorded in artefacts at least since antiquity. In eighteenth-century Europe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] (1712–1778) wrote, in his book ''Emile'', about the importance of observing play as a way to learn about and understand children.<ref>[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. ''Emile, or On Education''. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books, 1979.</ref>

===From education to therapeutics===
During the 19th century, European educationalists began to address play as an integral part of childhood education. They include [[Friedrich Fröbel]],<ref>Fröbel, Friedrich (1900) ''The Student's Froebel: adapted from "Die Erziehung der Menschheit" of F. Froebel'', by [[Lady Barn House School|William H.

[[Hermine Hug-Hellmuth]] formalised play as therapy by providing children with toys to express themselves and observed play to analyse the child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hug-Hellmuth |first1=H |title=On the technique of child-analysis |journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis |date=1921 |volume=2 |pages=287–305}}</ref> In 1919, [[Melanie Klein]] began to use play as a means of analyzing children under the age of six.<ref>{{cite book|author=Grosskurth, Phyllis|author-link=Phyllis Grosskurth|title=Melanie Klein: Her World and Her Work|publisher= [[Alfred A.

Arguably, the first documented case, describing a proto-therapeutic use of play, was in 1909 when [[Sigmund Freud]] published his work with "Little Hans", a five-year-old child suffering from a horse phobia. Freud saw him once briefly and recommended his father take note of Hans' play to provide observations which might assist the child. The case of "Little Hans" was the first case where a child's difficulty was adduced to emotional factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/36872_O%27Neil_Ch_01.pdf|title=Freud's Baby – Little Hans (1909)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologistworld.com/freud/little-hans-freud-case|title=The Case Of Little Hans: How Freud Used A Boy's Horse Phobia To Support His Theories|website=www.psychologistworld.com|access-date=29 June 2018|date=2 May 2016}}</ref>

Play therapy can be divided into two basic types: non-directive and directive.  Non-directive play therapy is a non-intrusive method in which children are encouraged to play in the expectation that this will alleviate their problems as perceived by their care-givers and other adults. It is often classified as a [[psychodynamic therapy]]. In contrast, directed play therapy is a method that includes more structure and guidance by the therapist as children work through emotional and behavioural difficulties through play. It often contains a behavioural component and the process includes more prompting by the therapist.<ref name="Ray">{{cite journal | last1 = Ray | first1 = D. | last2 = Bratton | first2 = S. | last3 = Rhine | first3 = T. | last4 = Jones | first4 = L. | year = 2001 | title = The effectiveness of play therapy: Responding to the critics | journal = International Journal of Play Therapy | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 85–108 | doi=10.1037/h0089444}}</ref> Both types of play therapy have received at least some empirical support.<ref name=Bratton/> On average, play therapy treatment groups, when compared to control groups, improve by .8 standard deviations.<ref name="Bratton">{{cite journal | last1 = Bratton | first1 = S. | last2 = Ray | first2 = D. | last3 = Rhine | first3 = T. | last4 = Jones | first4 = L. | year = 2005 | title = The efficacy of play therapy with children: A meta-analytic review of treatment outcomes | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 376–390 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.36.4.376 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.68 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = T. | last2 = Newcomer | first2 = B. | year = 1975 | title = Effects of directive vs. nondirective play therapy with institutionalized mentally retarded children | journal = American Journal of Mental Deficiency | volume = 79 | issue = 6| pages = 666–669 | pmid = 1146857 }}</ref>

[[Jessie Taft]] (1933), ([[Otto Rank]]'s American translator),<ref>Taft, Jessie. The dynamics of therapy in a controlled relationship. New York: Macmillan, 1933.</ref> and Frederick H. Allen (1934) developed an approach they entitled relationship therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1934.tb06284.x|title=Therapeutic work with children: A statement of a point of view|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|volume=4|issue=2|pages=193–202|year=1934|last1=Allen|first1=Frederick H.}}</ref> The primary emphasis is placed on the emotional relationship between the therapist and the child. The focus is placed on the child's freedom and strength to choose.

[[Virginia Axline]], a child therapist from the 1950s applied [[Carl Rogers]]' work to children. Rogers had explored the work of the therapist relationship and developed non-directive therapy, later called [[Client-Centred Therapy]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=C |title=Client-centered therapy |url=https://archive.org/details/clientcenteredth00roge |url-access=registration |date=1951 |publisher=Houghton- Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> Axline summarized her concept of play therapy in her article, 'Entering the child's world via play experiences' and stated, "A play experience is therapeutic because it provides a secure relationship between the child and the adult, so that the child has the freedom and room to state himself in his own terms, exactly as he is at that moment in his own way and in his own time" (Progressive Education, 27, p.&nbsp;68). Axline also wrote [[Dibs in Search of Self]], which describes a series of play therapy sessions over a period of a year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Axline|first=Virginia|title=Dibs in Search of Self|url=https://archive.org/details/dibsinsehofse00axli|url-access=registration|year=1964|publisher=Ballatine Books|location=New York|isbn=0345339258}}</ref>

===Nondirective play therapy===
Non-directive play therapy, may encompass [[child psychotherapy]] and unstructured play therapy. It is guided by the notion that if given the chance to speak and play freely in appropriate therapeutic conditions, troubled children and young people will be helped towards resolving their difficulties. Non-directive play therapy is generally regarded as mainly non-intrusive.<ref name=LeBlanc>{{cite journal | last1 = LeBlanc | first1 = M. | last2 = Ritchie | first2 = M. | year = 2001 | title = A meta-analysis of play therapy outcomes | journal = Counselling Psychology Quarterly | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 149–163 | doi=10.1080/09515070126334}}</ref> The hallmark of non-directive play therapy is that it has minimal constraints apart from the [[Frame (psychotherapy)|frame]] and thus can be used at any age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lebo | first1 = D | year = 1958 | title = A theoretical framework for nondirective play therapy: Concepts from psychoanalysis and learning theory | journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 275–279 | doi=10.1037/h0048364| pmid = 13587760 }}</ref> These approaches to therapy may originate from [[Margaret Lowenfeld]], [[Anna Freud]], [[Donald Winnicott]], [[Michael Fordham]], Dora Kalff, all of them child specialists or even from the adult therapist, [[Carl Rogers]]' non-directive psychotherapy and in his characterisation of "the optimal therapeutic conditions". [[Virginia Axline]] adapted Carl Rogers's theories to child therapy in 1946 and is widely considered the founder of this therapy.<ref name=Kendrick>Kendrick, P., Wilson, K., & Ryan, V. (1992) Play Therapy: A Nondirective Approach for Children and Adolescents. North Yorkshire, UK: Elsevier Science Limited.</ref> Different techniques have since been established that fall under the realm of non-directive play therapy, including traditional sandplay therapy, play therapy using provided toys and Winnicott's ''Squiggle'' and ''Spatula'' games.  Each of these forms is covered briefly below.

Using toys in non-directive play therapy with children is a method used by child psychotherapists and play therapists. These approaches are derived from the way toys were used in [[Anna Freud]]'s theoretical orientation.<ref name=Lebo>{{cite journal | last1 = Lebo | first1 = D | year = 1955 | title = The expressive value of toys recommended for nondirective play therapy | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 144–148 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(195504)11:2<144::aid-jclp2270110207>3.0.co;2-3| pmid = 14354045 }}</ref> The idea behind this method is that children will be better able to express their feelings toward themselves and their environment through play with toys than through verbalisation of their feelings. Through this experience children may be able to achieve [[catharsis]], gain more stability and enjoyment in their emotions, and test their own reality.<ref name=Ginott>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginott | first1 = H. G. | year = 1960 | title = A rationale for selecting toys in play therapy | journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 243–246 | doi=10.1037/h0043980| pmid = 13850211 }}</ref> Popular toys used during therapy are animals, dolls, hand puppets, soft toys, crayons, and cars. Therapists have deemed such objects as more likely to open imaginative play or creative associations, both of which are important in expression.<ref name=Lebo/>

====Sandplay====
Play therapy using a tray of sand and miniature figures is attributed to Dr. [[Margaret Lowenfeld]], a paediatrician interested in child psychology who pioneered her "World Technique" in 1929, drawn from the writer [[H. G. Wells]] and his ''[[Floor Games]]'' published in 1911.<ref name=SPT>[http://www.sandplaytherapy.org/sandplayinfluences.html Sandplay Influences – Lowenfeld World Technique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912010750/http://www.sandplaytherapy.org/sandplayinfluences.html |date=12 September 2009 }} Retrieved, 24 June 2009</ref> Dora Kalff, who studied with her, combined Lowenfeld's World Technique with [[Carl Jung]]'s idea of the [[collective unconscious]] and received Lowenfeld's permission to name her version of the work "sandplay".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kalff |first=Dora M. |date=1980 |title=Sandplay |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Beacon}}</ref> As in traditional non-directive play therapy, research has shown that allowing an individual to freely play with the sand and accompanying objects in the contained space of the sandtray (22.5" x 28.5") can facilitate a healing process as the unconscious expresses itself in the sand and influences the sand player. When a client creates "scenes" in the sandtray, little instruction is provided and the therapist offers little or no talk during the process. This protocol emphasises the importance of holding what Kalff referred to as the "free and protected space" to allow the unconscious to express itself in symbolic, non-verbal play. Upon completion of a tray, the client may or may not choose to talk about his or her creation, and the therapist, without the use of directives and without touching the sandtray, may offer supportive response that does not include interpretation. The rationale is that the therapist trusts and respects the process by allowing the images in the tray to exert their influence without interference.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V. |script-title=ru: Психотерапия детей и подростков: Методические рекомендации |trans-title=Psychotherapy of children and adolescents: Methodical recommendations |year=1987 |location=[[Kharkov]] |publisher=The Ukrainian Republican Council of trade unions resorts |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m11.html |language=ru|access-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

Sandplay therapy can be used during [[family therapy]].  The limitations presented by the boundaries of the sandtray can serve as physical and symbolic limitations to families in which boundary distinctions are an issue.  Also when a family works together on a sandtray, the therapist may make several observations, such as unhealthy alliances, who works with whom, which objects are selected to be incorporated into the sandtray, and who chooses which objects.  A therapist may assess these choices and intervene in an effort to guide the formation of healthier relationships.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hale | first1 = R.

====Winnicott's Squiggle and Spatula games====
{{Main|Donald Woods Winnicott}}
Donald Winnicott probably first came upon the central notion of play from his collaboration in [[World War II|wartime]] with the psychiatric social worker, [[Clare Winnicott|Clare Britton]], (later a psychoanalyst and his second wife), who in 1945 published an article on the importance of play for children.<ref>[[Clare Winnicott|Britton, C.]] (1945). "Children who cannot play", ''Play and Mental Health''. London: New Educational Fellowship.</ref> By "playing", he meant not only the ways that children of all ages play, but also the way adults "play" through making art, or engaging in sports, hobbies, humour, meaningful conversation, etc. Winnicott believed that it was only in playing that people are entirely their true selves, so it followed that for psychoanalysis to be effective, it needed to serve as a mode of playing.

Two of the playing techniques Winnicott used in his work with children were the ''squiggle'' game and the ''[[spatula]]'' game.  The first involved Winnicott drawing a shape for the child to play with and extend (or vice versa){{snd}} a practice extended by his followers into that of using partial interpretations as a 'squiggle' for a patient to make use of.<ref name="Casement">{{Cite book|author=Casement, Patrick|title=Further Learning from the Patient|publisher=Free Association Books|date= 1990| pages= 95 and 184}}</ref>

The second involved Winnicott placing a spatula (medical tongue depressor) within the child's reach for her/him to play with.<ref>Casement, Patrick. "Learning from Life." Lecture presented in Seattle, WA 4 June 2011.</ref> Winnicott considered that "if he is just an ordinary baby he will notice the attractive object...and he will reach for it....[then] in the course of a little while he will discover what he wants to do with it".<ref name="DWW" /> p.&nbsp;75–6. From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for [[transference]].<ref name="Casement"/> p.&nbsp;12.

====Efficacy====
[[File:WinnieThePooh-Winnie-OriginalChristopher.png|thumb|left|150px|Winnie-The-Pooh, the original "Winnie", possibly [[Christopher Robin Milne|Christopher Robin]]'s [[Comfort object|transitional object]]]]
Winnicott came to consider that "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....[T]he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure".<ref name="DWW">{{Cite book|author=Winnicott, D. W.|title= The Child, the Family, and the Outside World|publisher=Middlesex| date=1973| page=  146}}</ref> "Potential space" was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others.<ref name="Casement"/> p.&nbsp;162. Playing can also be seen in the use of a ''[[transitional object]]'', a term Winnicott coined for an object, such as a teddy bear, which may have a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a "real bear" or a creation of the child's own imagination, and went on to argue that it was very important that the child be allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, "transitional" status between the child's imagination and the real world outside the child.<ref name="DWW" /> p.&nbsp;169. For Winnicott, one of the most important and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a larger world of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; whereas in a [[False self]] disorder, the child may find it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead may feel compelled to hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241</ref> Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge "between self and other", which helps a child develop the capacity to be creative and genuine in relationships.<ref name="DWW"/> p.&nbsp;170-2.

====Research====
Play therapy has been considered to be an established and popular mode of therapy for children for over sixty years.<ref name=Hall>{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = D. | last2 = Kaduson | first2 = H. | last3 = Schaefer | first3 = C.E. | year = 2002 | title = Fifteen effective play therapy techniques | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 515–522 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.33.6.515| citeseerx = 10.1.1.514.4911 }}</ref> Critics of play therapy have questioned the effectiveness of the technique for use with children and have suggested using other interventions with greater empirical support such as [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]].<ref name=Ray/> They also argue that therapists focus more on the institution of play rather than the empirical literature when conducting therapy<ref name=Brattonray>{{cite journal | last1 = Bratton | first1 = S. | last2 = Ray | first2 = D. | year = 2000 | title = What the research shows about play therapy | journal = International Journal of Play Therapy | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 47–88 | doi=10.1037/h0089440}}</ref> Classically, Lebo argued against the efficacy of play therapy in 1953, and Phillips reiterated his argument again in 1985.  Both claimed that play therapy lacks in several areas of hard research. Many studies included small sample sizes, which limits the generalisability, and many studies also only compared the effects of play therapy to a control group.  Without a comparison to other therapies, it is difficult to determine if play therapy really is the most effective treatment.<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Dell>{{cite journal | last1 = Lebo | first1 = D | year = 1953 | title = The present status of research on nondirective play therapy | journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 177–183 | doi=10.1037/h0063570| pmid = 13061658 }}</ref> Recent play therapy researchers have worked to conduct more experimental studies with larger sample sizes, specific definitions and measures of treatment, and more direct comparisons.<ref name=Brattonray/>

|access-date=11 December 2012|publisher=CAMHS EBPU}}</ref> research is comparatively lacking in other, or random applications, on the overall effectiveness of using toys in non-directive play therapy. Dell Lebo found that out of a sample of over 4,000 children, those who played with recommended toys vs. non-recommended or no toys during non-directive play therapy were no more likely to verbally express themselves to the therapist. Examples of recommended toys would be dolls or crayons, while example of non-recommended toys would be marbles or a checkers board game.<ref name=Lebo/> There is also ongoing controversy in choosing toys for use in non-directive play therapy, with choices being largely made through intuition rather than through research.<ref name=Ginott/> However, other research shows that following specific criteria when choosing toys in non-directive play therapy can make treatment more efficacious.  Criteria for a desirable treatment toy include a toy that facilitates contact with the child, encourages catharsis, and lead to play that can be easily interpreted by a therapist.<ref name=Ginott/>

Several [[Meta analysis|meta analyses]] have shown promising results about the efficacy of non-directive play therapy. Meta analysis by authors LeBlanc and Ritchie, 2001, found an [[effect size]] of 0.66 for non-directive play therapy.<ref name=LeBlanc/> This finding is comparable to the effect size of 0.71 found for psychotherapy used with children,<ref name=Casey>{{cite journal | last1 = Casey | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Berman | first2 = J.S. | year = 1985 | title = The outcome of psychotherapy with children | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 388–400 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.388| pmid = 3901067 }}</ref> indicating that both non-directive play and non-play therapies are almost equally effective in treating children with emotional difficulties. Meta analysis by authors Ray, Bratton, Rhine and Jones, 2001, found an even larger effect size for nondirective play therapy, with children performing at 0.93 standard deviations better than non-treatment groups.<ref name=Ray/> These results are stronger than previous meta-analytic results, which reported effect sizes of 0.71,<ref name=Casey/> 0.71,<ref name=Weisz>{{cite journal | last1 = Weisz | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = B. | last3 = Han | first3 = S.S. | last4 = Granger | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Morton | first5 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Effects of psychotherapy with children and adolescents revisited: A meta-analysis of treatment outcomes | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 450–468 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.450| pmid = 7777649 }}</ref> and 0.66.<ref name=LeBlanc/> Meta analysis by authors Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, 2005, also found a large effect size of 0.92 for children being treated with non-directive play therapy.<ref name=Bratton/> Results from all meta-analyses indicate that non-directive play therapy has been shown to be just as effective as psychotherapy used with children and even generates higher effect sizes in some studies.<ref name=Ray/><ref name=Bratton/>

====Predictors of effectiveness====
There are several predictors that may also influence the effectiveness of play therapy with children. The number of sessions is a significant predictor in post-test outcomes, with more sessions being indicative of higher effect sizes.<ref name=Ray/> Although positive effects can be seen with the average 16 sessions,<ref name=Kendrick/> there is a peak effect when a child can complete 35–40 sessions.<ref name=LeBlanc/> An exception to this finding is children undergoing play therapy in critical-incident settings, such as hospitals and domestic violence shelters. Results from studies that looked at these children indicated a large positive effect size after only 7 sessions, which provides the implication that children in crisis may respond more readily to treatment<ref name=Bratton/> Parental involvement is also a significant predictor of positive play therapy results. This involvement generally entails participation in each session with the therapist and the child.<ref name=Ritchie>{{cite journal | last1 = LeBlanc | first1 = M. | last2 = Ritchie | first2 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Predictors of play therapy outcomes | journal = International Journal of Play Therapy | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 19–34 | doi=10.1037/h0089429}}</ref> Parental involvement in play therapy sessions has also been shown to diminish stress in the parent-child relationship when kids are exhibiting both internal and external behaviour problems.<ref name=Dee>{{cite journal | last1 = Ray | first1 = D.C. | year = 2008 | title = Impact of play therapy on parent-child relationship stress at a mental health training setting | journal = British Journal of Guidance and Counseling | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 165–187 | doi=10.1080/03069880801926434| s2cid = 55593014 }}</ref> Despite these predictors which have been shown to increase effect sizes, play therapy has been shown to be equally effective across age, gender, and individual vs. group settings.<ref name=Ray/><ref name=Bratton/>

===Directive play therapy===
[[File:Friedrich Fröbel- Construction kit- 1782-1852- SINA Facsimil-dhub.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s wooden Construction kit, 1782–1852 SINA Facsimile]]

In the 1930s David Levy developed a technique he called release therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00332747.1938.11022205|title="Release Therapy" in Young Children†|journal=Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=387–390|year=1938|last1=Levy|first1=David M.}}</ref> His technique emphasized a structured approach. A child, who had experienced a specific stressful situation, would be allowed to engage in free play. Subsequently, the therapist would introduce play materials related to the stress-evoking situation allowing the child to reenact the traumatic event and release the associated emotions.

In 1955, Gove Hambidge expanded on Levy's work emphasizing a "structured play therapy" model, which was more direct in introducing situations. The format of the approach was to establish rapport, recreate the stress-evoking situation, play out the situation and then free play to recover.

Directive play therapy is guided by the notion that using directives to guide the child through play will cause a faster change than is generated by nondirective play therapy. The therapist plays a much bigger role in directive play therapy.  Therapists may use several techniques to engage the child, such as engaging in play with the child themselves or suggesting new topics instead of letting the child direct the conversation himself.<ref name=Harter>{{cite journal | last1 = Harter | first1 = S | year = 1977 | title = A cognitive-developmental approach to children's expression of conflicting feelings and a technique to facilitate such expression in play therapy | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 417–432 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.45.3.417| pmid = 325033 }}</ref> Stories read by directive therapists are more likely to have an underlying purpose, and therapists are more likely to create interpretations of stories that children tell. In directive therapy games are generally chosen for the child, and children are given themes and character profiles when engaging in doll or puppet activities.<ref name=Knell/> This therapy still leaves room for free expression by the child, but it is more structured than nondirective play therapy. There are also different established techniques that are used in directive play therapy, including directed sandtray therapy and cognitive behavioral play therapy.<ref name=Harter/>

Directed sandtray therapy is more commonly used with trauma victims and involves the "talk" therapy to a much greater extent.  Because trauma is often debilitating, directed sandplay therapy works to create change in the present, without the lengthy healing process often required in traditional sandplay therapy.<ref name=Tennessen>{{cite journal | last1 = Tennessen | first1 = J. | last2 = Strand | first2 = D. | year = 1998 | title = A comparative analysis of directed sandplay therapy and principles of Ericksonian psychology | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 109–114 | doi=10.1016/s0197-4556(97)00101-9}}</ref> This is why the role of the therapist is important in this approach.  Therapists may ask clients questions about their sandtray, suggest them to change the sandtray, ask them to elaborate on why they chose particular objects to put in the tray, and on rare occasions, change the sandtray themselves.  Use of directives by the therapist is very common.  While traditional sandplay therapy is thought to work best in helping clients access troubling memories, directed sandtray therapy is used to help people manage their memories and the impact it has had on their lives.<ref name=Tennessen/>

[[Filial therapy]], developed by Bernard and Louise Guerney, was an innovation in play therapy during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Z. L. | last2 = Landreth | first2 = G. | year = 1997 | title = Filial therapy with incarcerated mothers: A five week model | journal = International Journal of Play Therapy | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 53–73 | doi=10.1037/h0089408}}</ref> The filial approach emphasizes a structured training program for parents in which they learn how to employ child-centered play sessions in the home. In the 1960s, with the advent of school counselors, school-based play therapy began a major shift from the private sector. Counselor-educators such as Alexander (1964); Landreth;<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/002221946900200203|title=A Team Approach to Learning Disabilites|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=2|issue=2|pages=82–87|year=1969|last1=Landreth|first1=Garry L.|last2=Jacquot|first2=Willard S.|last3=Allen|first3=Louise|s2cid=145138515}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Landreth |first1=G |title=Why play therapy? |journal=Texas Personnel and Guidance Association Guidelines |date=1972 |volume=21 |issue=1}}</ref> Muro (1968); Myrick and Holdin (1971); Nelson (1966); and Waterland (1970) began to contribute significantly, especially in terms of using play therapy as both an educational and preventive tool in dealing with children's issues.

Roger Phillips, in the early 1980s, was one of the first to suggest that combining aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy with play interventions would be a good theory to investigate.<ref name=Phillips>{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = R | year = 1985 | title = Whistling in the dark?: A review of play therapy research | journal = Psychotherapy | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 752–760 | doi=10.1037/h0085565}}</ref> Cognitive behavioral play therapy was then developed to be used with very young children between two and six years of age.  It incorporates aspects of Beck's cognitive therapy with play therapy because children may not have the developed cognitive abilities necessary for participation in straight cognitive therapy.<ref name=Kazdin>{{cite journal | last1 = Kazdin | first1 = A.E. | year = 1991 | title = Effectiveness of psychotherapy with children and adolescents | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 6| pages = 785–798 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.59.6.785| pmid = 1774364 }}</ref> In this therapy, specific toys such as dolls and stuffed animals may be used to model particular cognitive strategies, such as effective coping mechanisms and problem-solving skills.  Little emphasis is placed on the children's verbalizations in these interactions but rather on their actions and their play.<ref name=Knell>{{cite journal | last1 = Knell | first1 = S. M. | year = 1998 | title = Cognitive-behavioral play therapy | journal = Journal of Clinical Child Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 28–33 | doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp2701_3| pmid = 9561934 }}</ref> Creating stories with the dolls and stuffed animals is a common method used by cognitive behavioral play therapists to change children's maladaptive thinking.

====Efficacy====
The efficacy of directive play therapy has been less established than that of nondirective play therapy, yet the numbers still indicate that this mode of play therapy is also effective.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barnett | first1 = L | year = 1984 | title = Research note: Young children's resolution of distress through play | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 477–483 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1984.tb00165.x| pmid = 6746795 }}</ref> In 2001 meta analysis by authors Ray, Bratton, Rhine, and Jones, direct play therapy was found to have an effect size of .73 compared to the .93 effect size that nondirective play therapy was found to have.<ref name=Ray/> Similarly in 2005 meta analysis by authors Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, directive therapy had an effect size of 0.71, while nondirective play therapy had an effect size of 0.92.<ref name=Bratton/> Although the effect sizes of directive therapy are statistically significantly lower than those of nondirective play therapy, they are still comparable to the effect sizes for psychotherapy used with children, demonstrated by Casey,<ref name=Casey/> Weisz,<ref name=Weisz/> and LeBlanc.<ref name=LeBlanc/> A potential reason for the difference in the effect size may be due to the number of studies that have been done on nondirective vs. directive play therapy.  Approximately 73 studies in each meta analysis examined nondirective play therapy, while there were only 12 studies that looked at directive play therapy.  Once more research is done on directive play therapy, there is potential that effect sizes between nondirective and directive play therapy will be more comparable.<ref name=Ray/><ref name=Bratton/>

=== Application of electronic games ===
[[File:Pong (28684491143).jpg|thumb|An early video game played by two children]]
The prevalence and popularity of video games in recent years has created a wealth of psychological studies centred around them. While the bulk of those studies have covered [[Violence and video games|video game violence]] and [[Video game addiction|addiction]], some mental health practitioners in the West, are becoming interested in including such games as therapeutic tools. These are by definition "directive" tools since they are internally governed by [[algorithm]]s. Since the introduction of electronic media into popular Western culture, the nature of games has become "increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Granic|first1=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C.

[[Role-playing game]]s (RPGs) are the most common type of electronic game used as part of therapeutic interventions. These are games where players assume roles, and outcomes depend on the actions taken by the player in a virtual world.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book|title=Clinical Assessment, Computerized Methods, and Instrumentation|last1=Maarse|first1=F.J.|last2=Akkerman|first2=A.E.|last3=Brand|first3=A.N.|last4=Mulder|first4=L.J.M.|publisher=Swets & Zeitlinger Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9781135302634|location=Lisse|pages=59}}</ref> Psychologists are able to gain insights into the elements of the capability of the patient to create or experiment with an alternate identity.

[[Biofeedback]] (sometimes known as applied psychophysiological feedback'')'' media is more suited to treating a range of anxiety disorders.

==== Efficacy ====
While the field of allowing electronic media a place in a therapist's office is new, the equipment is not necessarily so. Most western children are familiar with modern PCs, consoles, and handheld devices even if the practitioner is not. An even more recent addition to interacting with a game environment is [[virtual reality]] equipment, which both adolescent and clinician might need to learn to use properly. The umbrella term for the preliminary studies done with [[Virtual reality applications|''VR'']] is [[Virtual reality exposure therapy]] (VRET). This research is based on traditional [[exposure therapy]] and has been found to be more effective for participants than for those placed in a [[wait list control group]],<ref name=":92" /> though not as effective as in-person treatments. One study tracked two groups – one group receiving a typical, lengthier treatment while the other was treated via shorter VRET sessions – and found that the effectiveness for VRET patients was significantly less at the six-month mark.<ref name=":72" />

In the future, clinicians may look forward to using electronic media as a way to assess patients,<ref name=":82" /> as a motivational tool,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Granic|first1=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C.

==Play therapy in literature==
In 1953 [[Clark Moustakas]] wrote his first book, ''Children in Play Therapy''. In 1956 he compiled ''Publication of The Self'', the result of the dialogues between Moustakas, [[Abraham Maslow]], Carl Rogers, and others, forging the [[humanistic psychology]] movement. In 1973 Moustakas continued his journey into play therapy and published his novel ''The child's discovery of himself''. Moustakas' work as being concerned with the kind of relationship needed to make therapy a growth experience. His stages start with the child's feelings being generally negative and as they are expressed, they become less intense, the end results tend to be the emergence of more positive feelings and more balanced relationships.

Several approaches to play therapy have been developed for parents to use in the home with their own children.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=S. C.|author2=Landreth |title=Filial therapy with single parents: Effects on parental acceptance, empathy, and stress.|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|year=1995|volume=4|issue=1|pages=61–81|doi=10.1037/h0089142}}</ref>

Training in nondirective play for parents has been shown to significantly reduce mental health problems in at-risk preschool children.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Draper | first1 = K. | last2 = Siegel | first2 = C. | last3 = White | first3 = J. | last4 = Solis | first4 = C.M. | last5 = Mishna | first5 = F. | year = 2009 | title = Preschoolers, parents, and teachers (PPT): a preventive intervention with an at risk population | url =https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context=education-facultypubs | journal = International Journal of Group Psychotherapy | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 221–242 | doi=10.1521/ijgp.2009.59.2.221| pmid = 19441968 | s2cid = 40246944 }}</ref> One of the first parent/child play therapy approaches developed was Filial Therapy (in the 1960s - see History section above), in which parents are trained to facilitate nondirective play therapy sessions with their own children. Filial therapy has been shown to help children work through trauma and also resolve behavior problems.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rye | first1 = N | year = 2008 | title = Filial therapy for enhancing relationships in families | journal = The Journal of Family Health Care | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 179–181 | pmid = 18973091 }}</ref>

Another approach to play therapy that involves parents is ''Theraplay'', which was developed in the 1970s. At first, trained therapists worked with children, but Theraplay later evolved into an approach in which parents are trained to play with their children in specific ways at home. Theraplay is based on the idea that parents can improve their children's behavior and also help them overcome emotional problems by engaging their children in forms of play that replicate the playful, attuned, and empathic interactions of a parent with an infant. Studies have shown that Theraplay is effective in changing children's behavior, especially for children suffering from attachment disorders.<ref>Booth, P.B. & Jernberg, A.M. (2010). Theraplay: Helping Parents and Children Build Better Relationships Through Attachment-Based Play. San Francisco, CA: Josey-Bass.</ref>

In the 1980s, [[Stanley Greenspan]] developed [[Floortime]], a comprehensive, play-based approach for parents and therapists to use with autistic children.<ref>Greenspan, S.I. & Wieder, S. (2006). Engaging Autism: Using the Floortime Approach to Help Children Relate, Communicate, and Think. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press.</ref> There is evidence for the success of this program with children suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greenspan | first1 = S.I. | last2 = Wieder | first2 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Developmental patterns and outcomes in infants and children with disorders in relating and communicating: A chart review of 200 cases of children with autistic spectrum disorders | journal = Journal of Developmental and Learning Disorders | volume = 1 | pages = 87–141 }}</ref><ref>Solomon, R., J. Necheles, C. Ferch, and D. Bruckman (2007). Pilot study of a parent training program for young children with autism: The P.L.A.Y. Project Home Consultation program" ''Autism'', Vol 11 ( 3) 205–224.</ref>
  
[[Lawrence J. Cohen]] has created an approach called Playful Parenting, in which he encourages parents to play with their children to help resolve emotional and behavioral issues. Parents are encouraged to connect playfully with their children through silliness, laughter, and roughhousing.<ref name="playful_parenting">Cohen, J. L. (2001). Playful Parenting. New York, NY: Ballantine Books, {{ISBN|978-0345442864}}.</ref>

In 2006, Garry Landreth and Sue Bratton developed a highly researched and structured way of teaching parents to engage in therapeutic play with their children.  It is based on a supervised entry level training in child centred play therapy.  They named it Child Parent Relationship Therapy.<ref>Bratton, S., Landreth, G., Kellam, T., & Blackard, S. (2006).  ''Child Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT) Treatment Manual:  A 10-Session filial therapy model''.  New York, NY:  Routledge.  ''The manual includes a CD-ROM of all training materials for ease of reproduction.''</ref>  These 10 sessions focus on parenting issues in a group environment and utilises video and audio recordings to help the parents receive feedback on their 30-minute 'special play times' with their children.

More recently, [[Aletha Solter]] has developed a comprehensive approach for parents called Attachment Play, which describes evidence-based forms of play therapy, including non-directive play, more directive symbolic play, contingency play, and several laughter-producing activities. Parents are encouraged to use these playful activities to strengthen their connection with their children, resolve discipline issues, and also help the children work through traumatic experiences such as hospitalisation or parental divorce.<ref>Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play: How to Solve Children’s Behavior Problems with Play, Laughter, and Connection. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.</ref>
