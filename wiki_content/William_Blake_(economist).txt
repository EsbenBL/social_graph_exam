According to the ''[[Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership|Legacies of British Slave-Ownership]]'' at the [[University College London]], Blake was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] with the [[Slave Compensation Act 1837]]. The British Government took out a £15 million loan (worth £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|15,000,000|1833}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) with interest from [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] and [[Moses Montefiore]] which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015).

Blake's 1823 pamphlet on [[government expenditure]], ''Observations on the Effects Produced by Government Expenditure during the Restriction of Cash Payments'', caused a stir, however.
