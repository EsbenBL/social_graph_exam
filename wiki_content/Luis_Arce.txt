Arce was born in [[La Paz]] to a middle-class family. He graduated as an accountant from Institute of Banking Education in La Paz in 1984 before obtaining degrees in economics at the [[Higher University of San Andrés]] and the [[University of Warwick]] in England. He spent most of the 1990s as a public official in a succession of posts and teaching economics at various universities. In 2006 he was appointed Minister of Finance by the newly elected president, Evo Morales. Arce oversaw a period of [[economic growth]] in Bolivia, and as a member of MAS gained a reputation for being a [[technocrat]].

Arce was chosen as the presidential candidate for the Movement for Socialism in the [[2020 Bolivian general election|2020 general election]], which he won in the first round with 55.1% of the vote.

== Minister of Economy and Public Finance ==
On 23 January 2006, President [[Evo Morales]] appointed Arce Minister of Finance. Three years later, he assumed command of the new [[Ministry of Economy and Public Finance (Bolivia)|Ministry of Economy and Public Finance]]. Some Bolivian media called Arce the mastermind of Bolivia's economic resurgence.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 July 2015|title=Economía y finanzas - El milagro económico de Bolivia|url=https://www.rfi.fr/es/economia/20150701-el-milagro-economico-de-bolivia|access-date=19 October 2020|website=RFI}}</ref> He oversaw Bolivia's nationalization of hydrocarbon, telecommunications, and mining companies, as well as the creation of [[BancoSur]].<ref>[http://www.bolivia-us.org/downloads/events/LunchLuisArceCatacora21Apr10NY.pdf Bolivian-American Chamber of Commerce]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He oversaw the rapid expansion of the Bolivian economy, with GDP increasing by 344% and extreme poverty reduced from 38% to 15%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=González |first1=Diego |title=¿Cuáles son las claves del éxito económico boliviano? {{!}} DW {{!}} 12 July 2019 |url=https://p.dw.com/p/3Ls5q |website=DW.COM |access-date=12 May 2020 |language=es-ES}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lazcano |first1=Miguel |title=Bolivia redujo a mayor ritmo la pobreza extrema - La Razón |url=http://www.la-razon.com/economia/Bolivia-redujo-mayor-pobreza-extrema_0_3235476445.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126045745/http://www.la-razon.com/economia/Bolivia-redujo-mayor-pobreza-extrema_0_3235476445.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 January 2020 |website=La Razón |date=26 January 2020 |language=es-ES}}</ref>

In 2011, the American Economy Magazine ranked Arce the region's 8th-best minister of the economy out of 18.<ref name="Luis Alberto Arce">{{cite web |title=Luis Alberto Arce |url=https://live.worldbank.org/experts/luis-alberto-arce |website=World Bank Live |access-date=12 May 2020 |language=en |date=15 March 2016}}</ref> Crowded International Organization has highlighted Arce's work driving the Bolivian economy.

On 24 June 2017, Arce was forced to give up his position and travel to Brazil to undergo [[surgery]] to treat severe [[kidney cancer]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ateo y poderoso, Arce llegó a creer en la energía de la oración |url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2018/5/20/ateo-poderoso-arce-llego-creer-en-la-energia-de-la-oracion-180543.html |access-date=19 October 2020 |publisher=www.paginasiete.bo|language=es}}</ref> He remained there for a mandated recovery period before returning to his post as Minister of Economics on 23 January 2019.

As the Minister of Economics, Arce maintained a relatively low profile. Christopher Sabatini, a senior researcher fellow for Latin America at [[Chatham House]] and founder of ''[[Americas Quarterly]]'', called Arce "one of the few [[technocrats]] in [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|MAS]]". "He's level headed" and "doesn't engage in inflammatory rhetoric", Sabatini wrote.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5901832/bolivia-election-luis-arce/|title=The Far-Left Wins Back Power in Bolivia.

== 2020 presidential campaign ==
{{Main|2020 Bolivian general election}}
After the [[2019 Bolivian political crisis]] that saw President [[Evo Morales]]'s resignation, Interim President [[Jeanine Áñez]] called new elections. On 19 January 2020, Morales met with senior party officials in Buenos Aires and then announced Arce and former Foreign Minister [[David Choquehuanca]] as the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) candidates in the 2020 elections.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Abdalla |first1=Jihan |title=Bolivia: Morales names MAS party candidates for May election |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/1/20/bolivia-morales-names-mas-party-candidates-for-may-election |access-date=23 October 2021 |work=www.aljazeera.com |date=19 October 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Some MAS opponents said Arce was a puppet of Morales but Arce distanced himself from Morales during the campaign. A MAS leader from El Alto, David Apaza, said, "Categorically, Evo will not interfere in the government of brother Luis Arce ... [W]e believe our comrade [Morales] should rest, while brother Luis Arce takes the lead".<ref name="GuardianElect">{{Cite news|last=Phillips|first=Tom|last2=Collyns|first2=Dan|date=19 October 2020|title=Bolivia election: exit polls suggest thumping win for Evo Morales's party|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/19/bolivia-election-exit-polls-suggest-thumping-win-evo-morales-party-luis-arce|access-date=19 October 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Arce stated that Morales "will not have any role in our government" but will still be the president of the party.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rochabrun|first=Marcelo|date=20 October 2020|title=Exclusive: Bolivia's President-elect Arce says 'no role' for Morales in new government|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-election-arce-exclusive-idUSKBN2752K7|access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

Most public opinion polls showed Arce with a lead, but not one big enough to avoid a November runoff. By election night, the divided candidates of the right had managed to partially consolidate around former president [[Carlos Mesa]] as Áñez and former president [[Jorge Quiroga]] dropped out. Early results favored Mesa, but polling firm Ciesmori's quick-count of the vote on the morning of 19 October indicated that Arce had won 52.4% of the vote, enough to win the election outright without a runoff.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Marcelo|last=Rochabrun|first2=Daniel|last2=Ramos|date=19 October 2020|title=Bolivia's socialists claim victory as unofficial count shows big win|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-bolivia-election-idUKKBN27407Q|access-date=19 October 2020}}</ref> Arce and his party declared victory, which Áñez soon confirmed on Twitter.<ref>{{Cite tweet|title=Aún no tenemos cómputo oficial, pero por los datos con los que contamos, el Sr. Arce y el Sr. Choquehuanca han ganado la elección.

Bolivian newspaper ''[[El Deber]]'' called Arce's victory "clear and crushing" and praised him for his conciliatory statements after the result, while also stating that the new president will have to appease MAS's radical wing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Una clara y aplastante victoria {{!}} EL DEBER|url=https://eldeber.com.bo/edicion-impresa/una-clara-y-aplastante-victoria_205213|access-date=2020-10-27|website=eldeber.com.bo|language=es}}</ref> Writing on ''[[Los Tiempos]]'', Oscar Díaz Arnau attributed Arce's victory to MAS's strong support in rural areas, the weakness of Mesa's candidacy, Arce's moderation, lack of connection between the opposition and rural inhabitants and the candidacy of [[Luis Fernando Camacho]] splitting anti-MAS voters and weakening the opposition.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-26|title=Razones para una victoria y para una derrota|url=https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/opinion/20201026/columna/razones-victoria-derrota|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Los Tiempos|language=es}}</ref>

Arce officially became president-elect of Bolivia on 23 October 2020, after the completion of the official vote count and an announcement by the TSE.

On the night of 5 November, MAS spokesman Sebastián Michel denounced an attack committed against president-elect Arce. The statement came after a stick of dynamite was detonated at the party's campaign headquarters in La Paz. Though Arce suffered no physical damages, Michel pointed out that Arce still had not yet received state protection.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-06|title=Bolivia: el MAS denunció un atentado con dinamita en contra del presidente electo Luis Arce|url=https://www.clarin.com/mundo/bolivia-denuncio-atentado-dinamita-presidente-electo-luis-arce_0_zZEV1kQzF.html|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.clarin.com|language=es}}</ref>

=== Two-thirds controversy ===
While Arce was successful in his presidential bid, the general election resulted in the loss of the [[supermajority]] of more than two-thirds in both chambers of government which MAS had enjoyed since 2009. In order to mitigate this loss, MAS legislators in the outgoing assembly used their final days of control over both chambers of government to amend regulations governing both bodies so that motions that previously required the agreement of two-thirds would now only require a simple majority, an action various opposition leaders and legislators condemned.<ref name="trials">{{cite web|date=27 October 2020|title=MAS launches trial against 20 Añez management authorities|url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2020/10/28/el-mas-encamina-juicio-contra-20-autoridades-de-la-gestion-de-anez-273069.html|language=es}}</ref><ref name="neutralise">{{cite web|date=28 October 2020|title=MAS neutralizes the opposition for 5 years with the endorsement of Arce|url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2020/10/29/mas-neutraliza-la-oposicion-por-anos-con-el-aval-de-arce-273212.html|language=es}}</ref>

Arce endorsed the changes, saying that the decision "wakes up [the government]" for the incoming assembly. "What our Assembly has done is maintain legality. There are many laws that are going to be approved with two-thirds. That is established by the regulations and there should be no concern".<ref name="neutralise" />

Bolivian indigenous politician [[Felipe Quispe]] criticized Arce for creating a cabinet that did not contain any indigenous members.

Arce also returned the official residency of the president and his ministers to the [[Casa Grande del Pueblo]]. The building had been constructed during the presidency of Evo Morales to replace the historical [[Palacio Quemado]] but the Áñez government had refused to use it. Arce's government indicated plans to convert it into a museum.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arce gobernará desde la Casa Grande del Pueblo y prevén que el Palacio Quemado sea museo|url=https://www.la-razon.com/nacional/2020/10/30/arce-gobernara-desde-la-casa-grande-del-pueblo-y-preven-que-el-palacio-quemado-sea-museo/|access-date=2020-11-25|website=La Razón {{!}} Noticias de Bolivia y el Mundo|language=en}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
As part as his first diplomatic act, Arce restored diplomatic relations with [[Iran]] and recognised the government of Nicolás Maduro, reverting the previous administration's recognition of [[Juan Guaidó]]. In a ceremony on 11 November at the [[Plaza Murillo]] in La Paz, ambassadors Mortessa Tabreshi of Iran and Alexander Yánez of Venezuela presented their credentials to the Bolivian president. Áñez had granted diplomatic distinctions to José Cumare, sent by the Guaidó government just two weeks prior.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bolivia cambia su política exterior retomando relaciones con Irán y Venezuela|url=https://www.efe.com/efe/america/politica/bolivia-cambia-su-politica-exterior-retomando-relaciones-con-iran-y-venezuela/20000035-4391949|access-date=2020-11-25|website=www.efe.com|language=es}}</ref>

Arce also directed the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bolivia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to reinstate the country's membership in the [[ALBA|Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]] (ALBA) from which the previous government had withdrawn.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bolivia reanuda su participación en la Unasur, Alba y Celac|url=https://correodelsur.com/politica/20201120_bolivia-reanuda-su-participacion-en-la-unasur-alba-y-celac.html|access-date=2020-11-25|website=Correo del Sur|language=es}}</ref> In terms of regional integration, Arce stated that the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC) was the "best way" to integrate [[Latin America]]. He also proposed "the recovery of [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]] (Union of South American Nations)" which in 2018 and 2019 saw most of its members either withdraw or suspend their membership amid growing concern about Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arce anuncia regreso pleno a la Celac y plantea recuperar la Unasur|url=https://correodelsur.com/politica/20201108_arce-anuncia-regreso-pleno-a-la-celac-y-plantea-recuperar-la-unasur.html|access-date=2020-11-25|website=Correo del Sur|language=es}}</ref>

On 13 December, Arce flew to Brazil for a routine medical check-up related to his previous treatment for kidney cancer.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-13|title=Presidente Arce viaja a Brasil para revisión médica|url=https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/12/13/presidente-arce-viaja-a-brasil-para-revision-medica-y-realiza-primera-transmision-de-mando-al-vicepresidente/|access-date=2021-01-06|website=CNN|language=es}}</ref> Vice President Choquehuanca became acting president for 3 days until Arce's return on 15 December. Notably, Arce chose to take a commercial flight from Bolivia to Brazil and not use the presidential plane that Morales used, arguing issues of savings and efficiency.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bolivia|first=Opinión|title=Bajo perfil y rebrote de la pandemia marcan los dos meses de gestión de Arce en el Gobierno|url=https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/perfil-rebrote-pandemia-marcan-gestion-arce-gobierno/20210108114316802850.html|access-date=2021-01-08|website=Opinión Bolivia|language=es}}</ref>

[[Visa requirements for United States citizens|Visa requirements for United States]] and [[Visa requirements for Israeli citizens|Israeli]] citizens were reinstated by Supreme Decree on 2 February 2021. The requirements had been put in place by the Morales administration in 2014 but repealed by the Áñez administration in December 2019. The government argued that the measure "unilaterally benefited Israeli and US citizens, without their countries granting similar benefit, within the framework of the reciprocity principle, for Bolivian citizens".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gobierno decreta la exigencia de visas para ciudadanos de Israel y EEUU|url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2021/2/1/gobierno-decreta-la-exigencia-de-visas-para-ciudadanos-de-israel-eeuu-283053.html|access-date=2021-03-18|website=www.paginasiete.bo|language=spanish}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Suscripción digital {{!}} El Deber {{!}} Bolivia|url=https://suscripciones.eldeber.com.bo/|access-date=2021-03-18|website=El Deber|language=es}}</ref>

In March 2021, the Arce government had its first diplomatic clashes with the United States after [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Antony Blinken]] called for the immediate release of former interim President [[Jeanine Áñez]] and her ministers. The Arce government denounced U.S. meddling in internal Bolivian affairs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Estados Unidos exigió la liberación de la ex presidenta de Bolivia Jeanine Áñez|trans-title=The United States demanded the release of former Bolivian president Jeanine Áñez |url=https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2021/03/27/estados-unidos-exigio-la-liberacion-de-la-ex-presidenta-de-bolivia-jeanine-anez/ |access-date=3 May 2021 |work=[[Infobae]] |date=27 March 2021 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bolivia tilda de "injerencia" pronunciamiento de EE.UU. sobre Jeanine Áñez |trans-title=Bolivia labels the US pronouncement on Jeanine Áñez as "interference" |url=https://www.dw.com/es/bolivia-tilda-de-injerencia-pronunciamiento-de-eeuu-sobre-jeanine-%C3%A1%C3%B1ez/a-57029325 |access-date=3 May 2021 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=28 March 2021 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

==== Chile ====
{{See also|Bolivia–Chile relations|Atacama border dispute}}On 23 March 2021, the date of [[Día del Mar]] commemorating Bolivia's loss of coastal access to [[Chile]] in the [[War of the Pacific]], Arce reiterated the country's maritime claim as an "open and pending" issue.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-23|title=Bolivia dice que su demanda marítima es una cuestión "abierta y pendiente" • Hola News|url=https://holanews.com/bolivia-dice-que-su-demanda-maritima-es-una-cuestion-abierta-y-pendiente/|access-date=2021-03-23|website=Hola News|language=en-GB}}</ref> Arce presented a nine-point "road map" regarding continued negotiation with Chile towards the goal of sovereign sea access with the first point being the resumption of a "bilateral approach with Chile through dialogue and negotiation, in order to identify formulas of understanding and integration between brother peoples". The second and third points hoped to create "a climate of peace and mutual trust" between the two countries while promoting free transit and decreasing trade barriers faced by exports and imports in Chilean ports. Other avenues for maritime integration were also discussed. These included the development of the [[Paraguay]]-[[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] waterway project "to make our access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] effective" and the expansion of Bolivia's presence in the "free ports" granted to it by neighbouring countries, particularly as regards to the port of [[Ilo, Peru]] which Arce claimed could enable an alternative trade route to the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arce presenta "hoja de ruta" de 9 puntos para "inserción" de Bolivia en el Pacífico|url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2021/3/23/arce-presenta-hoja-de-ruta-de-puntos-para-insercion-de-bolivia-en-el-pacifico-288400.html|access-date=2021-03-23|website=www.paginasiete.bo|language=spanish}}</ref>

Hours after, Chilean Foreign Minister [[Andrés Allamand]] replied that while his country was "willing to resume dialogue with Bolivia without delay," he also affirmed that the issue of sovereign sea access had been "definitively resolved" by the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bolivia y Chile coinciden en restablecer el diálogo, Blanco confía en que ‘arrancará muy pronto’|url=https://www.la-razon.com/nacional/2021/03/23/bolivia-y-chile-coinciden-en-restablecer-el-dialogo-blanco-confia-en-que-arrancara-muy-pronto/|access-date=2021-03-24|website=La Razón {{!}} Noticias de Bolivia y el Mundo|language=en}}</ref> On the same day, President of the Senate [[Andrónico Rodríguez]] announced that Arce would travel to Chile to reestablish cordial relations. In terms of a date for such a visit, Rodríguez stated that there was "absolutely nothing scheduled, but surely between this month and next, it will be announced".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andrónico: Presidente Arce visitará Chile en busca de restablecer relaciones|url=https://correodelsur.com/politica/20210323_andronico-presidente-arce-visitara-chile-en-busca-de-restablecer-relaciones.html|access-date=2021-03-23|website=Correo del Sur|language=es}}</ref> On 7 May, Allamand announced that the two states had agreed to reopen dialogue for the first time since 2010 in a move towards reestablishing formal diplomatic relations which had been suspended in 1978.

Another topic of discussion was the role of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) which played a major role in the 2019 political crisis and just weeks prior had condemned the imprisonment of former president Jeanine Áñez as well as members of her cabinet on charges of terrorism, [[sedition]], and conspiracy.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-23|title=Arce viaja a México para tratar temas de cooperación, deuda externa, OEA, entre otros|url=https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20210323/arce-viaja-mexico-tratar-temas-cooperacion-deuda-externa-oea-otros|access-date=2021-03-23|website=Los Tiempos|language=es}}</ref> Days prior on 17 March, the [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs]] had called on the OAS to stop its interference in Bolivian foreign affairs.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Reuters Staff|date=2021-03-18|title=Mexico to OAS: Stop interfering in Bolivia's internal affairs|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-diplomacy-bolivia-idUSKBN2B934K|access-date=2021-03-23}}</ref> Bilateral relations between the two states were officially reestablished on 24 March.<ref>{{Cite web|title=En México, Arce y López Obrador relanzan las relaciones bilaterales para 'recuperar la hermandad'|url=https://www.la-razon.com/nacional/2021/03/24/arce-y-lopez-obrador-relanzan-las-relaciones-bilaterales-para-recuperar-la-hermandad/|access-date=2021-03-24|website=La Razón {{!}} Noticias de Bolivia y el Mundo|language=en}}</ref> Arce, who in 2019 joined Evo Morales in taking asylum in Mexico, expressed his happiness to return to the country "no longer as a refugee".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-24|title=Luis Arce: Es una felicidad volver a México ya no en calidad de refugiado • Hola News|url=https://holanews.com/luis-arce-es-una-felicidad-volver-a-mexico-ya-no-en-calidad-de-refugiado/|access-date=2021-03-24|website=Hola News|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Arce referred to the previous administration, stating that "we have endured a de facto government and we have resisted until democracy is restored, today we have to endure the coronavirus".

==== Sanitary Emergency Law and Strikes ====
{{main|2021 Bolivian doctors' strike}}
The ''Ley de Emergencia Sanitaria'' (Sanitary Emergency Law) was promulgated by Arce on 17 February 2021 with the stated purpose of "protect[ing] public health and prevent[ing] its loss or deterioration".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Edición: 1360NEC Gaceta Oficial del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia|url=http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/edicions/view/1360NEC|access-date=2021-02-19|website=www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo}}</ref> The article had been opposed by representatives of the health sector who on 5 February voiced their rejection of the law, claiming that "it violates the Political Constitution of the State".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-17|title=Entra en vigencia Ley de Emergencia Sanitaria pese a rechazo de médicos|url=https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20210217/entra-vigencia-ley-emergencia-sanitaria-pese-rechazo-medicos|access-date=2021-02-19|website=Los Tiempos|language=es}}</ref> The dispute centered on three sections; those which set a basic rate for hospitalization services and medical treatment, regulations restricting the hiring of foreign medical personnel only to instances where there are none available in the country, and the prohibition on the suspension or interruption of health services during the health emergency.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gobierno promulga la Ley de Emergencia Sanitaria {{!}} EL DEBER|url=https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/gobierno-promulga-ley-de-emergencia-sanitaria_221190|access-date=2021-02-19|website=eldeber.com.bo|language=es}}</ref> The latter was especially resisted by the health sector as it was viewed as a restriction on their right to protest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arce promulga Ley de Emergencia Sanitaria que prohíbe protestas de médicos|url=https://www.paginasiete.bo/sociedad/2021/2/17/arce-promulga-ley-de-emergencia-sanitaria-que-prohibe-protestas-de-medicos-284708.html|access-date=2021-02-19|website=www.paginasiete.bo|language=spanish}}</ref>

=== "Managing president" and the regional elections ===
{{main|2021 Bolivian regional elections}}
The first six months of Arce's presidency coincided with regional elections for governors, mayors, and municipal assemblies within the nine [[departments of Bolivia]]. Despite the challenges faced by MAS in consolidating support after the 2019 crisis, Arce remained notably separate and silent from the many campaigns, especially as compared to ex-president Evo Morales who was viewed by many outside and within the party as intervening far too heavily, particularly in regards to the selection of candidates. Arce's seeming lack of interest in the subnationals led to the political analyst Marcelo Arequipa dubbing him "a neutral actor" and a "managing president" who "presents himself as someone who does not care about the internal political dispute of the MAS" but rather is more interested in governing nationally and carrying out his agenda. [[Pando Department|Pando]] Senator Luis Adolfo Flores said that "I have not seen the president in a political campaign," adding that "Electorally, some candidates take the opportunity to shake hands, to take a photo. But the president's visits are not necessarily for campaigning".
