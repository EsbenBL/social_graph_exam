== Balcerowicz Plan ==
{{details|Balcerowicz Plan}}
The [[Balcerowicz Plan]] was a series of reforms, which brought the end to [[hyperinflation]], dismantled inefficient economic structures, and balanced the national budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://prospectjournal.org/2010/11/11/shock-therapy-what-we-can-learn-from-poland/ |title=SHOCK THERAPY: WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM POLAND |access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The prices of most consumer goods were freed and caps for annual increases established in state-sector employees' wages. Poland's currency, the [[złoty]], was made convertible within the country's borders. This resulted in a substantial increase in prices and had forced state-owned companies while making them economically competitive. This amounted to a two-year shock to the Polish economy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesdorn/2014/05/19/leszek-balcerowicz-transformed-poland-through-an-embrace-of-economic-freedom/#641c645a27b3 |title=Leszek Balcerowicz Transformed Poland Through An Embrace Of Economic Freedom |access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> Among other actions included in the plan was the negotiation of a significant reduction (approximately 50%) of the debts inherited from the [[Polish People's Republic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=30 September 1994|title=Poland – Debt Reduction Program|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/606891468332361087/Poland-Debt-Reduction-Program|language=en|pages=1}}</ref>

The severity of the reforms was initially controversial and made Balcerowicz an object of criticism by some politicians in Poland. On the other hand, many economists and experts such as Krzysztof Sobczak, [[Jeffrey Sachs]], and [[Jacek Rostowski]] agree that without introducing such radical changes, Poland's economic success and steady economic growth would not have been possible.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://polskieradio24.pl/42/273/Artykul/1323299,Plan-Balcerowicza-25-lat-od-jego-ogloszenia-Mity-i-fakty |title=Plan Balcerowicza: 25 lat od jego ogłoszenia.

==Criticism==
High unemployment remained a problem for some two decades after the implementation of the reforms, leaving certain poverty-stricken regions with structural unemployment.<ref name="Balcerowicz Plan: 20 Years On">[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/21501/article Balcerowicz Plan: 20 Years On] www.warsawvoice.pl</ref> Reducing unprofitability of the state-owned companies required significant layoffs.

==The BELLS==
During the Eurozone crisis Balcerowicz has been an outspoken supporter for fiscal discipline and has been frequently dubbed the anti-Bernanke for his scorn of distortionary fiscal stimulus. In various articles he has developed a comparison between the fiscally-profligate [[PIIGS|PIGS]] ([[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Spain]]) and the fiscally-disciplined BELLs ([[Bulgaria]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323981504578179310418828782 |title=Leszek Balcerowicz: The Anti-Bernanke |access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref> Responsible fiscal policy brings about better growth outcomes, claims Leszek Balcerowicz.<ref name="auto"/> He has many followers among East European economists, most prominently [[Simeon Djankov]], Deputy prime Minister and Minister of Finance of [[Bulgaria]] between 2009 and 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.piie.com/events/great-rebirth-lessons-victory-capitalism-over-communism |title=The Great Rebirth: Lessons from the Victory of Capitalism over Communism |access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref>

==Private life==
Balcerowicz was a competitive athlete in his youth. In 1966, he became Poland's youth champion in cross country at the distance of 1500 meters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balcerowicz.pl/pl/zyciorys|title=Życiorys – www.balcerowicz.pl|website=www.balcerowicz.pl|access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref> Since 1977, he has been married to Ewa Balcerowicz, an economist. He has three children.
