==Early life and education==
Volcker was born in [[Cape May, New Jersey]], the son of Alma Louise (née Klippel, 1892&ndash;1990) and Paul Adolph Volcker (1889&ndash;1960).<ref name="PVbook">Treaster (2004), pp. 87–92.</ref>  All his grandparents were of German origin. Volcker grew up in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], where his father was the township's first [[City manager|municipal manager]]. Paul Sr. thrived in the role for 20 years as he improved the burgeoning town's economic stability and the local government's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/centennial/teaneckhistory.htm|title=Looking Back on the History of Teaneck|publisher=Teaneck Public Library|first=Robert|last=Griffin|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> Paul Jr. had four older sisters: Ruth (1916&ndash;1991), Louise (1918&ndash;1966), Elinor (1922&ndash;1923) and Virginia Streitfeld (1924&ndash;2011). As a child, he attended his mother's [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church, while his father went to an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church. Volcker graduated from [[Teaneck High School]] in 1945,<ref name="PVbook"/> where he participated in several student groups and impressed his peers and teachers with his knowledge of politics.<ref>{{cite web|website=Ancestry.com|title=Teaneck High School Yearbook}}</ref>

Volcker attended [[Princeton University]] as an undergraduate student and graduated with highest honors from the School of Public and International Affairs (now the [[Princeton School of Public and International Affairs]]) in 1949. In his senior thesis, titled "The Problems of Federal Reserve Policy since [[World War II]]", Volcker criticized the Federal Reserve's post-WWII policies for failing to curb inflationary pressures, writing, "a swollen money supply presented a grave inflationary threat to the economy. There was a need to bring this money supply under control if the disastrous effects of a sharp price rise were to be avoided."<ref>{{cite thesis |first=Paul |last=Volcker |title=The Problems of Federal Reserve Policy since World War II |date=1949 |url=http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp019019s3255}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/01/the-integrity-and-will-of-ten-men-the-life-of-paul-volcker-49-obit|title='The integrity and will of ten men': the life of Paul Volcker '49|website=The Princetonian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/dsp019019s3255|title=The Problems of Federal Reserve Policy since World War II|first=Jr., Paul Adolf|last=Volcker|via=catalog.princeton.edu}}</ref> Following a summer as a research assistant at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Fed]], he moved to [[Harvard University]] to earn an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[political economy]] from its [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] and [[Harvard Kennedy School|Graduate School of Public Administration]]. He worked a second summer as a New York Fed research assistant before graduating in 1951. After Harvard, Volcker attended the [[London School of Economics]] from 1951 to 1952 as a [[Rotary International|Rotary Foundation]] Ambassadorial Fellow under Rotary's [[Ambassadorial Scholarships]] program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul A.

==Career==
In 1952 Volcker joined the staff of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] as a full-time economist. He left that position in 1957 to become a financial economist with the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]]. In 1962, [[Robert Roosa]], who had been his mentor at the Federal Reserve, hired him at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] as director of financial analysis.<ref>Treaster (2004), p. 38.</ref> In 1963, he became deputy under secretary for monetary affairs. He returned to Chase Manhattan Bank as vice president and director of planning in 1965.<ref name=walk>{{cite book|last=Santow|first=Leonard Jay|date=2009|title=Do They Walk on Water?: Federal Reserve Chairmen and the Fed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNRziBivjOQC&q=paul+volcker+Chase+Manhattan+Bank+vice+president+and+director+of+planning&pg=PA95|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page= <!-- or pages= -->95-105|isbn=9780313360336}}</ref>

Appointed by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]], Volcker served as under secretary of the Treasury for international monetary affairs from 1969 to 1974. He played an important role in President Nixon's decision to suspend [[convertibility|gold convertibility]] of the dollar on August 15, 1971, which resulted in the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]]. Volcker considered the suspension of gold convertibility "the single most important event of his career."<ref>Silber (2012) p. 2.</ref> Because of his position as under secretary, Volcker served as a board member for [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] and [[Fannie Mae]].<ref>{{cite report |title=Nomination of Paul A.

In 1975, he became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and he retained that role until he became [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chair]] in August 1979.<ref name=walk/>

Inflation emerged as an economic and political challenge in the United States during the 1970s. The [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] of the Federal Reserve board, led by Volcker, were widely credited with curbing the rate of [[inflation]] and expectations that inflation would continue. US inflation, which peaked at 14.8 percent in March 1980, fell below 3 percent by 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0?output_view=pct_12mths|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics Data|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=To Treat the Fed as Volcker Did|work=The New York Times|date=November 4, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/business/05views.html|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> The Federal Reserve board led by Volcker raised the [[federal funds rate]], which had averaged 11.2% in 1979, to a peak of 20% in June 1981. The [[prime rate]] rose to 21.5% in 1981 as well, which helped lead to the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|1980–1982 recession]],<ref>NBER, [https://www.nber.org/cycles/  ''US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012231548/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> in which the national [[Unemployment in the United States|unemployment rate]] rose to over 10%. Volcker's Federal Reserve board elicited the strongest political attacks and most widespread protests in the history of the Federal Reserve (unlike any protests experienced since 1922), due to the effects of high interest rates on the construction, farming, and industrial sectors, culminating in indebted farmers driving their tractors onto C Street NW in [[Washington, D.C.]]<!--[[C Street NW, (Washington, D.C.)|C Street NW]]--> and blockading the [[Eccles Building]].<ref>Shull, Bernard. 2005.

Praeger/Greenwood. {{ISBN|1-56720-624-7}}. p. 142.</ref> [[Monetary policy of the United States|US monetary policy]] eased in 1982, helping lead to a resumption of economic growth.

The US current account was in permanent deficit by the nineties.  Volcker himself tried to remedy the situation by the [[Plaza Accord]] in 1986, which called for Germany and Japan to revalue relative to the US dollar.<ref>Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten (1992). Changing Fortunes.</ref>

The combination of the Fed's tight money policies and the expansive fiscal policy of the Reagan Administration (large tax cuts and a major increase in military spending) produced large [[United States federal budget|federal budget deficits]] and significant macroeconomic imbalances in the U.S. economy. The combination of growing federal debt and high interest rates led to a substantial rise in federal net interest costs. The sharp rise of interest costs and large deficits led Congress to take some steps towards fiscal constraint.<ref>"Volcker: The Triumph of Persistence (Bloomsbury Press; 2012) 454 pages, p. 8."</ref>

Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] said about him in an interview:

<blockquote style="font-size:100%">Paul Volcker, the previous Fed Chairman known for keeping inflation under control, was fired because the Reagan administration didn't believe he was an adequate de-regulator.<ref>Gardels, Nathan. [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-gardels/stiglitz-the-fall-of-wall_b_126911.html?page=3 Stiglitz: The Fall of Wall Street Is to Market Fundamentalism What the Fall of the Berlin Wall Was to...], ''[[HuffPost]]'', September 16, 2008. Retrieved November 30, 2017.</ref></blockquote>

Congressman [[Ron Paul]], well known as a [[Political positions of Ron Paul#Inflation and the Federal Reserve|harsh critic of the Federal Reserve]], offered qualified praise of Volcker:

<blockquote style="font-size:100%">Being in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and serving on the [[House Banking Committee]], I met and got to question several Federal Reserve chairmen: [[Arthur Burns]], [[G. William Miller]], and Paul Volcker. Of the three, I had the most interaction with Volcker. He was more personable and smarter than the others, including the more recent board chairmen [[Alan Greenspan]] and [[Ben Bernanke]].<ref>Chan, Sewell (December 11, 2010).

In 1983, Volcker received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=Jefferson Awards Foundation|access-date=November 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2015, Volcker donated his public service papers to [[Princeton University]]'s [[Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Federal Reserve chairman Volcker donates public service papers to Princeton|url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S44/35/41M54/index.xml?section=topstories|website=Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>

In 1996, he took up the chair of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons ([[Volcker Commission]]) to look into the dormant accounts of Jewish victims of the Holocaust lying in Swiss banks. This included a "massive accounting of Swiss bank records." In the midst of a contentious process (the committee was formed by three Jewish representatives and three representatives of Swiss banks), he was able to bring about an agreement among the parties for a settlement of $1.25 billion.<ref>Treaster (2004), p. x.</ref>

In 2000 he accepted the Chairmanship of the IFRS Trustees, the not-for-profit funding arm of the International Accounting Standards Board (later the IFRS Foundation). The IFRS Foundation is a private sector enterprise based in London which seeks to develop a single global accounting model, subject to adoption country by country under their rules of law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/IFRS-Foundation/Oversight/Annual-reports/Documents/1Trustees_AR_2011.pdf|title=Annual Report of the IFRS Trustees Foundation|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911225341/http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/IFRS-Foundation/Oversight/Annual-reports/Documents/1Trustees_AR_2011.pdf|archive-date=September 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In April 2004, the United Nations [[Paul Volcker Committee|assigned]] Volcker to research possible corruption in the [[Iraq]]i [[Oil for Food program]]. In the report summarizing its research, Volcker criticized [[Kojo Annan]], son of then-[[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], and the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company Cotecna Inspection SA, Kojo's employer, for trying to conceal their relationship. He concluded in his March 2005, report that "there is no evidence that the selection of Cotecna, in 1998, was subject to improper influence of the Secretary General in the bidding or selection process."<ref>Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme – [http://www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportMar2005.pdf Second Interim Report (29 March 2005)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805032019/http://www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportMar2005.pdf |date=August 5, 2009 }} p.77.</ref> While Volcker did not implicate the Secretary General in the selection process, however, he did cast serious doubt on Kofi Annan, whose "management performance ... fell short of the standards that the United Nations Organization should strive to maintain."<ref>[[Traub, James]]. 2006.

As of October 2006, he was the chairman of the board of trustees of the influential [[Washington D.C.|Washington]]-based financial advisory body, the [[Group of Thirty]], and a member of the [[Trilateral Commission]]. He had a long association with the [[Rockefeller family]], not only with his positions at Chase Bank and the Trilateral Commission, but also through membership of the trust committee of Rockefeller Group, Inc., which he joined in 1987. That entity managed, at one time, the [[Rockefeller Center]] on behalf of the numerous members of the Rockefeller family. He was a chairman and an honorary trustee of [[International House of New York|International House]], the cultural exchange residence and program center in New York City. He was a founding member of the [[Trilateral Commission]] and a long-time member of the [[Bilderberg Group]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

I remember I read a lot of Hawtrey.<br />'''Mehrling''': ''Currency and Credit''? ''The Art of Central Banking''? <br />'''Volcker''': I don’t remember the names of the books, just being in London. In those days I used to read ''The Economist'' and the ''Financial Times'', so I kept up with what was going on in the money markets.
