==Summary of main works==

With the advent of Existential-Integrative [[Psychotherapy]],<ref name="existential-integrative psychotherapy">Schneider, K.J. (2008).  ''Existential-integrative psychotherapy: Guideposts to the core of practice''.  New York: Routledge.</ref> Schneider expanded the traditional focus of existential therapy on depth exploration to include other, more mainstream treatment modalities. By the same token, he broadened mainstream treatment modalities with the ever-present availability of depth exploration.<ref>Hoffman, L., Yang, M., & Kaklauskas, F.J. (2019). "Existential psychology east-west." Colorado Springs: University Professors Press.</ref> Existential-Integrative therapy is a "deeply relational approach which uses a range of therapeutic concepts and strategies to help clients engage more fully with their experiencing".<ref>Cooper, M. (2009). Person-Centered and Experiential Psychotherapies, Vol. 8, p. 165.</ref> Schneider discussed freedom at the level of psychosexuality and how it entails the integration of one's sexual-aggressive past. According to Schneider, liberation at this level strengthens one's [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. Another form of freedom he discussed is that at the level of interpersonal relations and how it acknowledges and transcends freedom at the level of psychosexual relations. He says that at the interpersonal level, freedom balances individual striving and uniqueness with interpersonal dependence and connectedness. He coined the term 'experiential freedom' saying that it "embraces not only physiology, environmental conditioning, cognition, psychosexuality, and interpersonal relations, but also cosmic or intersituational relations".<ref>{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Kirk|title=Existential-integrative psychotherapy: guideposts to the core of practice|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|pages=37–38}}</ref> Schneider begins by defining and describing “awe,” a most important attitude and state of being, which has become much less central to our lives in these times. Awe is a fluid attitude, which incorporates wonder, dread, mystery, veneration, and the embracing of paradox. Cultivating awe as central in our consciousness requires that we move away from many of the values with which we are continually confronted: consumerism, conventionality, competitiveness, and mindless entertainment. An awe inspired life also counters all sorts of dogmatic beliefs and convictions, be they fundamentally religious or rigidly atheistic.<ref>John L. Levy The Humanistic Psychologist (April 2007), 35 (2), pg. 219-222</ref>
 
With Rediscovery of Awe<ref name="rediscovery of awe">Schneider, K.J. (2004).  ''Rediscovery of awe: Splendor, mystery, and the fluid center of life''.  St. Paul, MN:  Paragon House.</ref> and Awakening to Awe,<ref>Schneider, K.J. (2009).  ''Awakening to Awe: Personal stories of profound transformation''. Lanham, MD:  Jason Aronson.</ref> Schneider drew upon the rich heritage of existential-spiritual philosophy as elaborated by such thinkers as [[Paul Tillich]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Abraham Heschel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[William James]] as well as his own clinical and personal observations to cultivate an "awe-based" approach to psychology and life. By "awe-based," Schneider means the sense of humility and wonder or adventure one experiences simply by living. While the sense of awe may be inherent to living it also must be cultivated periodically, lest it be crushed by our "quick fix," efficiency oriented culture; or by political or religious [[dogma]]. In Rediscovery of Awe,<ref name="rediscovery of awe" /> Schneider set forth the principles of an awe-based psychology as well as applications of those principles to concrete spheres of life, such as the educational setting, the work setting, and the ethical-spiritual setting. In "Awakening to Awe," Schneider focused specifically on how the sense of [[awe]] radically transformed seven lives. Among the people he investigated were a former gang member who became a gang mediator, an ex drug addict who became a case worker and [[Yoga]] instructor, and a survivor of [[stage-three cancer]]. Finally, in Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy, Schneider showed how the humility and wonder cultivated in good therapy can inspire the humility and wonder, or, in short awe, that can be nurtured outside of good therapy. In his most recent book, "The polarized mind: Why it's killing us and what we can do about it,"  (2013), Schneider shows how the sense of awe and encounter with life's mystery can be an antidote to destructive and totalitarian cultures as well as individuals.

In his works he took the approach of humanistic psychologists.<ref name="Schneider 2008 438–439">{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Kirk|title=Introduction: Catching the Baton 50 Years Thence|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|year=2008|volume=48|issue=4|pages=438–439|doi=10.1177/0022167808320538}}</ref> In this field of psychology, Schneider credits Abe Maslow for being an influential figure in his early years in the field of psychology. He acknowledges that his humanistic perceptions were awakened by Maslow's works. He believed that Maslow implied that our healing comes from our "restoration of awe, the attunement to a larger picture of life".<ref name="Schneider 2008 438–439"/> He was a proponent for spiritual healing and trying to attain fulfillment. He uses the theory of awe as a therapeutic method in enlivening lives.
