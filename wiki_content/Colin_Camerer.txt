'''Colin Farrell Camerer''' (born December 4, 1959) is an [[Americans|American]] [[behavioral economics|behavioral economist]], and Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Finance and Economics at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).

==Background==
A former [[child prodigy]], Camerer received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in quantitative studies from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1977 (at age 17), followed by an [[M.B.A.]] in [[finance]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1979 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in behavioral [[decision theory]] from that same institution in 1981 (at age 21) for thesis titled ''The Validity and Utility of Expert Judgment'' under the supervision of [[Hillel Einhorn]] and Robin Hogarth.<ref name=chicago/><ref name=cv/>  Camerer worked at [[Kellogg School of Management|Kellogg]], [[Wharton Business School|Wharton]], and the University of Chicago [[Booth School of Business]] before moving to Caltech in 1994.

Camerer's research is on the interface between [[cognitive psychology]] and [[economics]].  This work seeks a better understanding of the [[psychology|psychological]] and [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] basis of decision-making in order to determine the validity of models of human economic behavior. His research uses mostly economics experiments—and occasionally field studies—to understand how people behave when making decisions (e.g., risky gambles for money), in games, and in markets (e.g., speculative price bubbles).

He spoke at the Econometric Society World Congress in London on August 20, 2005 and at the Nobel Centennial Symposium in 2001 on Behavioral and Experimental Economics.

He is the author of "Behavioral Game Theory" published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 2003.

During the late 1990s and until mid-2008, Camerer began instructing college courses in fields such as Cognitive Psychology, Microeconomic Theory, Behavioral Economics, and Organizational Design. These courses were held at a variety of different universities, including the aforementioned California Institute of Technology and additionally [[New York University]].<ref name="Colin Camerer"/>

In September 2013, Camerer was named a [[MacArthur fellow]].<ref name=nyt/>

==Fever Records==
In 1983, Camerer started a [[record label]] called "Fever Records" as "an economics experiment". Bands that he signed to the label include [[the Dead Milkmen]], [[Big Black]] and [[Get Smart! (band)|Get Smart!]].<ref name=brown/> The label was part of the [[Enigma Records]] group of labels.<ref name=underground/>

Another [[Fever Records]] was founded in the 1980s in New York City to distribute rap records, and has no connection.

Unless you were part of the punk scene in Chicago at the time, or are a music historian, you probably haven't heard of the Bonemen of Baruma, Big Black, or the Dead Milkmen, but you can take my word that they were exciting and important local bands of the period.
