==Biography==
Roger Myerson was born in 1951 in Boston. He attended [[Harvard University]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], ''[[summa cum laude]]'', and [[Master of Science|S.M.]] in [[applied mathematics]] in 1973. He completed his  [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/front-center-john-callaway-global-economic-crisis/ |title = Front & Center with John Callaway: The Global Economic Crisis &#124; Pritzker Military Museum & Library &#124; Chicago}}</ref> His doctorate thesis was ''A Theory of Cooperative Games''.<ref name="CV">{{cite web |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~rmyerson/research/rbmvita.pdf |title=Curriculum Vitae of Roger Myerson |access-date=2008-08-15 }}</ref>

From 1976 to 2001, Myerson was a professor of economics at [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Kellogg School of Management]], where he conducted much of his Nobel-winning research.<ref>[http://www.juf.org/news/local.aspx?id=27784&terms=Roger+Myerson JUF News: Nobel Prize winners have Jewish, Chicago connections]</ref> From 1978 to 1979, he was Visiting Researcher at [[Bielefeld University]]. He was Visiting Professor of Economics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1985–86 and from 2000–01. He became Professor of Economics at Chicago in 2001. Currently, he is the inaugural David L. Pearson Distinguished Service Professor of Global Conflict Studies at the University of Chicago.<ref name="UChicagoPress Release">{{cite web |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/roger-myerson-appointed-inaugural-david-l-pearson-distinguished-service-professor|title=Roger Myerson appointed inaugural David L.

==Awards and Honors==
===Bank of Sweden Nobel Memorial Prize===
Myerson was one of the three winners of the 2007 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], the other two being [[Leonid Hurwicz]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], and [[Eric Maskin]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He was awarded the prize for his contributions to [[mechanism design theory]].<ref name="UC">{{cite web |url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/071015.nobel.myerson.shtml |title=Roger Myerson wins 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics |date=2007-10-17 |publisher=University of Chicago |access-date=2008-08-16}}</ref>

Myerson made a path-breaking contribution to mechanism design theory when he discovered a fundamental connection between the allocation to be implemented and the monetary transfers needed to induce informed agents to reveal their information truthfully. Mechanism design theory allows for people to distinguish situations in which markets work well from those in which they do not. The theory has helped economists identify efficient trading mechanisms, regulation schemes, and voting procedures. Today, the theory plays a central role in many areas of [[economics]] and parts of [[political science]].<ref name="UC"/>

===Memberships and Honors===
Myerson is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref name="CV"/> He is a Fellow of the [[Game Theory Society]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gametheorysociety.org/people/ |title=Game Theory Society - People}}</ref> and serves as an advisory board member on the International Journal of Game Theory.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/journal/182/editors |title=International Journal of Game Theory Editors}}</ref>  Myerson holds an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Basel]] in 2002 <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/About-University/Dies-Academicus/Honorary-Awards-Dies-Academicus-Faculty-of-Business-and-Economics.html |title=Honorary Awards Faculty of Business and Economics}}</ref> and received the Jean-Jacques Laffont Prize in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tse-fr.eu/jjl-prize |title=Jean Jacques Laffont Prize Former Laureates}}</ref> He also served on the Social Sciences jury for the [[Infosys Prize]] in 2016.
