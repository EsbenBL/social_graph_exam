'''John Peabody Harrington''' (April 29, 1884 – October 21, 1961)<!--full dates in box--> was an [[United States|American]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[ethnologist]] and a specialist in the [[indigenous peoples of California]]. Harrington is noted for the massive volume of his documentary output, most of which has remained unpublished: the shelf space in the [[National Anthropological Archives]] dedicated to his work spans nearly 700 feet.<ref name="glenn1991sound">{{Cite journal | issn = 0003-5483 | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–366 | last = Glenn | first = James R.  | title = The Sound Recordings of John P.

==Early life and education==

Born in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], Harrington moved to California as a child. From 1902 to 1905, Harrington studied [[anthropology]] and classical languages at [[Stanford University]]. While attending specialized classes at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], he met anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]. Harrington became intensely interested in [[Native American languages]] and [[ethnography]].

==Linguistic legacy==

Rather than completing his doctorate at the Universities of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], Harrington became a high-school language teacher. For three years, he devoted his spare time to an intense examination of the few surviving [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] people. His exhaustive work came to the attention of the [[Smithsonian]] Museum's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]]. Harrington became a permanent field ethnologist for the bureau in 1915. He was to hold this position for 40 years, collecting and compiling several massive caches of raw data on native peoples, including the [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Mutsun]], [[Rumsen people|Rumsen]], [[Chochenyo people|Chochenyo]], [[Kiowa]], [[Chimariko people|Chimariko]], [[Yokuts]], [[Gabrielino]], [[Salinan]], [[Quechan|Yuma]], and [[Mojave (people)|Mojave]], among many others. Harrington also extended his work into traditional culture, particularly mythology and geography. His field collections include information on placenames and thousands of photographs. The massive collections were disorganized in the extreme, and contained not only linguistic manuscripts and recordings, but also objects and [[realia (education)|realia]] of every stripe; a later cataloger described how opening each box of his legacy was "an adventure in itself."<ref name="callghan1991">{{Cite journal| volume = 33| issue = 4| pages = 350–356| last = Callaghan| first = C. A| title = Encounter with John P. Harrington| journal = Anthropological Linguistics| year = 1991}}</ref> He published very little of his work; many of his notes appear to have been deliberately hidden from his colleagues. After his death, Smithsonian curators discovered over six tons of boxes stored in warehouses, garages and even chicken coops throughout the West.<ref>Lisa M. Krieger, "[https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/12/23/long-gone-native-languages-emerge-from-the-grave/ Long gone Native languages emerge from the grave]", ''The Mercury News'', 23 December 2007.</ref>

Harrington is virtually the only recorder of some languages, such as [[Obispeño language|Obispeño]] (Northern) Chumash, [[Kitanemuk]], and [[Serrano (people)|Serrano]]. He gathered more than 1 million pages of phonetic notations on languages spoken by tribes from Alaska to South America. When the technology became available, he supplemented his written record with audio recordings - many recently digitized<ref name="smithsonianRecordingsHarrington">{{Cite web |url= http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?view=&dsort=&date.slider=&fq=online_media_type%3A%22Sound+recordings%22&q=Harrington%2C+John+Peabody&fq=online_visual_material%3Atrue |title=Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution |work=collections.si.edu |access-date=16 May 2010 }}</ref> - first using wax cylinders, then aluminum discs.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081203124757/http://thereporter.com/news/ci_8289386]  He is credited with gathering some of the first recordings of native languages, rituals, and songs, and perfecting the [[phonetics]] of several different languages.<ref>{{cite news | last=Krieger | first=Lisa M. | title=Long gone Native languages emerge from the grave: Millions of cryptic notes from linguist John Peabody Harrington | url=http://www.mercurynews.com//ci_7795964 | publisher=[[Mercury News]] | date=2007-12-23 | access-date=2007-12-30}}</ref> Harrington's attention to detail, both linguistic and cultural, is well-illustrated in "Tobacco among the [[Karuk]] Indians of California," one of his relatively few formally published works.<ref>Harrington, John P. 1932.
