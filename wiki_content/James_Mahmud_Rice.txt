'''James Mahmud Rice''' (born 1972) is an Australian sociologist in the Demography and Ageing Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, [[University of Melbourne]]. He works at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political science, focusing in particular on inequalities in the distribution of economic resources such as income and time and how private and public conventions and institutions shape these inequalities. In 2009 he was awarded the [[Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research]].<ref name="jamesmahmudrice">{{cite web|title=James Mahmud Rice: Home|url=http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/|website=James Mahmud Rice|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref>

==Early life==
Rice was born in 1972 in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. His mother was a [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] woman from [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]]. His father, who was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], was an economist who taught economics at the [[University of Hawaii]] and [[Monash University]], in addition to conducting a large number of consultancies in [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wie|first1=Thee Kian|title=Robert Charles Rice (1939–2009)|journal=Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies|date=2009|volume=45|issue=2|pages=251–254|doi=10.1080/00074910903040344|s2cid=153924724}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wills|first1=Ian|last2=Vicziany|first2=Marika|last3=Barton|first3=Greg|title=Modest guru in economics|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/modest-guru-in-economics-20090413-a4u4.html|access-date=24 September 2019|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 April 2009}}</ref>

==Research==

===Domestic technology and household work===
Research by Michael Bittman, James Mahmud Rice, and [[Judy Wajcman]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bittman|first1=Michael|last2=Rice|first2=James Mahmud|last3=Wajcman|first3=Judy|title=Appliances and their impact: The ownership of domestic technology and time spent on household work|journal=British Journal of Sociology|date=2004|volume=55|issue=3|pages=401–423|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2004.00026.x|pmid=15383094|url=https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:1955/SOURCE01?view=true}}</ref> has shown that domestic appliances which are designed to make our lives easier do not reduce the overall time spent doing housework, and in some cases may even increase the time spent doing chores.<ref name="elliottsunday">{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=John|title=It's a hard life on the "labour saving" domestic front|work=Sunday Times|date=19 September 2004}}</ref>

"The authors ... believe that people use the devices simply to achieve ever-higher standards of cleanliness and refinement in their home, rather than to free up time for other pursuits," according to John Elliott in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.<ref name="elliottsunday" />

The results of this research received wide press coverage in Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name="elliottsunday" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=John|title=Time savers aren't doing their job|work=Australian|date=6 October 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Horin|first1=Adele|title=Money can't buy bliss in the kitchen|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 October 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Leisure in the red with white goods|work=mX|date=20 September 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Tom|title=The labour savers that are making slaves of us|work=Daily Express|date=20 September 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Safe|first1=Mike|title=The lost weekend - dream travel|work=Weekend Australian Magazine|date=18 October 2003}}</ref>

===Temporal autonomy and discretionary time===
''[[Discretionary Time|Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom]]''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goodin|first1=Robert E.|last2=Rice|first2=James Mahmud|last3=Parpo|first3=Antti|last4=Eriksson|first4=Lina|title=Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-70951-4|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9780521709514}}</ref> by [[Robert E. Goodin]], James Mahmud Rice, Antti Parpo, and Lina Eriksson was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2008. It is based on the authors' analysis of data from the United States, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden, and Finland.<ref name="DTweb">{{cite web|title=Discretionary Time|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/discretionary-time-new-measure-freedom|website=Cambridge University Press|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref>

The authors propose that temporal autonomy can be used as an indicator of freedom, which is measured by how many hours people are free to do as they please.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeff|first=Peter|editor-last=McMahon|editor-first=Fred|title=Towards a Worldwide Index of Human Freedom|publisher=Fraser Institute|date=2012|pages=113–135|chapter=Measuring individual freedom: Actions and rights as indicators of individual liberty|isbn=978-0-88975-259-7|chapter-url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/towards-a-worldwide-index-of-human-freedom.pdf|access-date=10 February 2014}}</ref> They then explore how much temporal autonomy people could have under alternative welfare, gender, and household arrangements.<ref name="DTweb"/>

Another one of their statements is that the richer an individual is, the more he or she feels stressed. However, they argue, a richer individual's prosperity could be part of the problem. An example is that a banker who earns £200 per hour has a greater [[opportunity cost]] by choosing not to work, than a cleaner who earns only £10 per hour. As a result, the banker may feel compelled to work a greater number of hours than the cleaner does, despite making a greater total income.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cave|first1=Stephen|title=Time in our hands|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bd266118-285a-11dd-8f1e-000077b07658.html|access-date=9 February 2014|work=Financial Times|date=28 May 2008}}</ref>

===Low fertility and standards of living===
How low fertility influences standards of living is examined in research published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] by Ronald Lee, Andrew Mason, James Mahmud Rice, and other members of the [[National Transfer Accounts]] Network.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Ronald|last2=Mason|first2=Andrew|last3=members of the NTA Network|title=Is low fertility really a problem? Population aging, dependency, and consumption|journal=Science|date=2014|volume=346|issue=6206|pages=229–234|doi=10.1126/science.1250542|pmid=25301626|pmc=4545628}}</ref> This research indicates, on the basis of an analysis of data from 40 countries, that typically fertility well above replacement and population growth would be most beneficial for government budgets. Fertility near replacement and population stability, however, would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. Fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.

==Awards and honours==
In 2009 Rice was awarded the [[Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research]], together with Robert E. Goodin, Antti Parpo, and Lina Eriksson. The prize was awarded for their book ''Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom.''<ref>{{cite web|title=Stein Rokkan Prize Winners|url=https://ecpr.eu/Prizes/PrizeWinners.aspx?PrizeID=6|website=European Consortium for Political Research}}</ref>
