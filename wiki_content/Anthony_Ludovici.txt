'''Anthony Mario Ludovici''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (8 January 1882 &ndash; 3 April 1971) was a British [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[social critic]] and [[polyglot]]. He is known as a proponent of [[aristocracy]] and [[anti-egalitarianism]], and in the early 20th century was a leading British [[Conservatism|conservative]] author. He wrote on subjects including [[art]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Scholes | first = Robert E. | authorlink = Robert Scholes | title = Paradoxy of Modernism | url = https://archive.org/details/paradoxymodernis00scho_073 | url-access = limited | page = [https://archive.org/details/paradoxymodernis00scho_073/page/n56 40] | publisher = [[Yale University Press]]| year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-300-10820-0}}</ref> [[metaphysics]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], the differences between the [[sexes]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], [[health]], and [[eugenics]].

Ludovici began his career as an artist, painting and illustrating books. He was [[private secretary]] to sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] for several months in 1906.<ref>Bacci, Francesca; David Melcher (2011). ''Art and the Senses'', Oxford University Press, p. 146.</ref> He later wrote over 30 books, and translated many others.

==Early life==

Ludovici was born in [[London]], [[England]] on 8 January 1882 to [[Albert Ludovici]], and Marie Cals. Ludovici's father and grandfather, [[Albert Ludovici, Sr.]], were both artists. He was of Basque, French, German and Italian ancestry.<ref>http://www.anthonymludovici.com/rbkerr.htm</ref> He was educated privately, in England and abroad but chiefly by his mother.<ref>Kerr, R.B. (1932). [http://www.anthonymludovici.com/rbkerr.htm "Anthony M. Ludovici: The Prophet of Anti-Feminism,"] in ''Our Prophets, Studies of Living Writers''. Croydon: R.B. Kerr, pp.&nbsp;84–99.</ref> As a young student he became friends with Harry Guy Radcliffe Drew,<ref>Guy Drew was the son of organist Harry Drew and grandson of [[Joseph Drew]] of Weymouth</ref> whom he met at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition of 1900]]. Years later he befriended Drew's young daughters Dorothy (later a student of [[F. M. Alexander]]) and Joyce (better known as architect [[Jane Drew]]). He married [[Elsie Finnimore Buckley]] on 20 March 1920, and they first lived at 35 Central Hill, [[Upper Norwood]] in South London.  He spent several years in [[Germany]] where he studied Nietzsche's writings in the original German. He was fluent in several languages.

During the year 1906, Ludovici was private secretary to the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]], and as such had a close association with him. He later wrote of his personal experiences of Rodin's personality and art, as well as his own opinions, in articles first appearing in the [[Cornhill Magazine]] from 1923, and in 1926 published in a book ''Personal Reminiscences of Auguste Rodin''. In the summer of 1908 he first met and befriended Dr. [[Oscar Levy]], editor of ''The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche'', the first translation of Nietzsche's works in English. Ludovici contributed several volumes.<ref>Ludovici, Anthony M. (1946-7). [http://www.anthonymludovici.com/oscarlev.htm "Dr. Oscar Levy,"] ''The New English Weekly'', Vol. 30, pp. 49–50.</ref> Levy introduced him to his future wife Elsie F. Buckley. He began lecturing on art, politics, religion, and the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>Stone, Dan (1999). "The Extremes of Englishness: The 'Exceptional' Ideology of Anthony Mario Ludovici," ''Journal of Political Ideologies'', Vol. 4 (2), pp. 191–218.</ref> about whom he wrote ''Who is to be Master of the World?: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1909) and ''Nietzsche: His Life and Works'' (1910). Nietzsche scholar [[William Mackintire Salter]] called ''Nietzsche: His Life and Works'' "the well-nigh perfect short manual" on Nietzsche.<ref>William Mackintire Salter, 'Book Reviews', ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jul., 1915), p. 404.</ref> His pioneering work on Nietzsche's æsthetic: “Nietzsche and Art”(1911) was one of the first attempts of its kind in Europe. It was based on a course of lectures Ludovici had delivered at University College, London, during November and December, 1910.<ref>Nietzsche and Art by Anthony M. Ludovici (London: Constable & Co. Ltd., 1911), [February 1911]p.v.</ref> According to Steven Aschheim, his 1911 ''Nietzsche and Art'' was "a unique attempt to write a Nietzschean history of art in terms of rising aristocratic and decadent-democratic epochs".<ref>Aschheim, Steven (1994). ''The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany, 1890-1990,'' University of California Press, p. 48 (footnote).</ref> This was the year of the first [[Parliament Act 1911]], cutting back the power of the [[House of Lords]]. It also marks a watershed or change in Ludovici's writing, to a more overt political line, which would only sharpen over the next 25 years.

During [[World War I]] he joined the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] as a translator, and then served as an [[artillery]] officer at [[Battle of Armentières|Armentières]] and the [[battle of the somme|Somme]], where he described himself as "a miserable and vermin-ridden trench-rat", and then in the [[military intelligence|Intelligence]] Staff at the War Office, where after two years of service he rose to head of his department (MI6 A):

“I was told to report to the OC MI6 at the War Office, where my languages could be put to some use and where I contrived to make myself sufficiently useful to be retained. And after two years’ work in intelligence, in 1919, as General Staff Officer, third grade, with the rank of Captain, I rose to be the head of my department (MI6 A).”<ref>Confessions of an anti-feminist : the autobiography of Anthony M. Ludovici. Edited by John V. Day. (San Francisco : Counter-Currents Pub. Ltd., 2018), MY EDUCATION III (1916–1959)</ref> 
He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]], which he immediately returned because he felt that it was too easily attainable and held by too many people. He attained the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] during World War I., He was subsequently called 'Captain' as a nickname.{{cn|date=April 2020}}



Ludovici came across the [[Alexander Technique]] in 1925 and said he had lessons in 'deportment' over a period of four years with [[F.M. Alexander]].<ref>Religion for Infidels. London: Holborn, 1961. Excerpts reprinted as "How I came to have lessons with F. M. Alexander" in The Philosopher's Stone: Diaries of Lessons with F. Matthias Alexander, edited by Jean M. O. Fischer. London: Mouritz, 1998, pp. 102–108.</ref>

==Writing==

Ludovici's writing was varied, and took traditional conservative stances on social issues. [[Liberalism]], [[socialism]], [[Marxism]], [[Christianity]], [[feminism]],<ref>Balfour, Lady Frances (1923). "The Anti-Feminist Folly," ''English Review'', Vol. 37, pp. 741–744.</ref><ref>Harrison, Austen (1924). "The New Anti-Feminism," ''English Review'', Vol. 38, pp. 80–87.</ref><ref>Ditzion, Sidney (1953). [https://archive.org/stream/marriagemoralsse00ditz#page/354/mode/2up "Female vs. Male in the Twentieth-Century,"] in ''Marriage, Morals, and Sex in America: A History of Ideas''. New York: Bookman Associates, pp. 355–380.</ref><ref>Freedman, Estelle B. (1974). "The New Woman: Changing Views of Women in the 1920s," ''Journal of American History'', Vol. 61, No. 2, pp. 372–393.</ref> [[multiculturalism]], the modern culture of [[consumerism]] and revolt against tradition constituted Ludovici's main areas of attack. As a young man his fin de siècle reading was typically dominated by science and the popularization of the doctrine of evolution. Ludovici was especially influenced by the important debate that took place in the late 1880s between [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Henry Wace (priest)|Henry Wace]], with the young Ludovici fully adopting Huxley’s philosophical position<ref> Christianity and Agnosticism. A Controversy Consisting of Papers by Henry Wace, D.D., Prof. Thos. H. Huxley, The Bishop of Peterborough, W. H. Mallock, Mrs. Humphry Ward ( New York : The Humboldt Publishing Co., 1889), Thomas H. Huxley, IX. Agnosticism and Christianity, pp. 96-97.</ref> of [[agnosticism]].

"From about my seventeenth year, my reading of science, especially biology, zoology and astronomy, became regular and assiduous. I read every book by Darwin, Haeckel, Huxley, Romanes, Spencer and Proctor that I could lay my hands on. With great avidity, I also read Huxley’s famous controversy with Wace, following the arguments on each side with breathless interest and becoming a convinced agnostic in the process. But the two authors that probably exerted the greatest influence on me in my early twenties were Schopenhauer and Schiller. The former enlightened me enormously on psychology, and I still regard him as the greatest European psychologist who appeared between Montaigne and Freud. Indeed, there is much in his work that anticipates Freud’s discoveries, a fact to which I have more than once called attention, and Nietzsche owed him many a profound observation, the source of which, however, is rarely acknowledged."<ref>Confessions of an anti-feminist : the autobiography of Anthony M. Ludovici. Edited by John V. Day. (San Francisco : Counter-Currents Pub. Ltd., 2018)</ref>

He wrote "I have long been an opponent and critic of [[Christianity]], [[democracy]], and [[Anarchism|anarchy]] in art and literature. I am particularly opposed to '[[Abstract Art]],' which I trace to [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]'s heretical doctrines of art and chiefly to his denial that the subject matters, his assimilation of the graphic arts and music, and his insistence on the superior importance of the composition and colour-harmony of a picture, over its representational content." He was an early critic of [[Jacob Epstein]], attacking him in ''[[The New Age]]'',<ref>Ardis, Ann L. (2002). "'Life is not Composed of Watertight Compartments': The New Age's Critique of Modernist Literary Specialization," in ''Modernism and Cultural Conflict, 1880–1922'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 149–151.</ref><ref>Buchowska, Dominika (2011). "English Rebels in Art Circles: ''The New Age'' in its Elitist and Populist Dimension," In ''Regarding the Popular: Modernism, the Avant-Garde and High and Low Culture'', Walter de Gruyter, pp. 44–56.</ref> to which he contributed as an art critic before the [[World War I|Great War]].<ref>Mairet, Philip (1936).

In his ''A Defence of Aristocracy'' (1915), Ludovici defends [[aristocracy]] against government in popular control. In ''The False Assumptions of "Democracy"'' (1921), he attacked the democratic idea and the liberal attitude in general, as being unnatural.{{cn|date=April 2020}} ''A Defence of Conservatism'' (1927) defends tradition as being tied to survival.<ref>Ludovici, Anthony M. (1927). [http://www.anthonymludovici.com/dc_01.htm#chap1 "The Meaning of Conservatism,"] in ''A Defence of Conservatism''. London: Faber and Gwyer, pp. 1–2.</ref>

For Ludovici, [[egalitarianism]] was a denial of the innate biological differences between individuals, the [[sexes]] and races. He criticized what he saw as the sentimental coddling of the mediocre and botched. His articles were a regular feature of the ''New Pioneer'', a far-right journal controlled by [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth|Viscount Lymington]] and closely linked to the [[British People's Party (1939)|British People's Party]].<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''Hurrah for the Blackshirts! Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars'', Pimlico, 2006, p. 279</ref> Ludovici repeatedly warned of the dangers of [[miscegenation]] and defended [[incest]] as an appropriate response to racial mixing, arguing that society should act 'to break down the barriers now preventing the mating of close relatives' as it was the only way to cause 'a purification of our stock.'.<ref>http://www.anthonymludovici.com/eugenics.htm</ref>

== Views ==

Ludovici was a [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and a supporter of [[eugenics]]. <ref>Scholtke, Paul Ernest (1980). [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7431/1/7431_4496.PDF?UkUDh:CyT ''The Fascist Element in A.M. Ludovici's Defence of Conservatism'']. Masters thesis, Durham University.</ref> He was also a devoted [[Monarchism|monarchist]] who held [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in high regard.

==Later life==
He was on the Selection Committee of the [[Right Book Club]],<ref>Green, E. H. H. (2002). ''Ideologies of Conservatism: Conservative Political Ideas in the Twentieth Century'', Oxford University Press, p. 151.</ref> with [[Norman Thwaites]], [[Trevor Blakemore]], [[Collinson Owen]] and [[W. A. Foyle]].<ref>Webber, G. C. (1986). ''The Ideology of the British Right, 1918–1939'', Croom Helm, p. 161.</ref>

After the [[Second World War]], Ludovici fell into obscurity. In 1936, he had written enthusiastically about [[Adolf Hitler]], whom he had met personally that year, along with many other high-ranking Nazi leaders.<ref>Ludovici, Anthony M. (1936). [http://www.anthonymludovici.com/IIIreich.htm "Hitler and the Third Reich,"] ''The English Review'', Vol. 63, pp. 35–41, 147–153, 231–239.</ref> He was critical of the effect of [[Jew]]s on the [[history of England]], writing a work under the pseudonym Cobbett, ''The Jews, and the Jews in England'' (1938).{{cn|date=April 2020}}

Ludovici was dismissed from his intelligence work on 14 August 1940 and his house was subsequently raided allegedly due to his membership of the political group [[Right Club|The Right Club]]. On Friday 8 October 1940, Ludovici was interviewed at [[Scotland Yard]], and then released.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

From 1955 until 1969 Ludovici wrote a series of articles in the monthly journal ''The South African Observer''.<ref>Brown, S. E. D. (ed.), ''The South African Observer - A Journal for Realists'', Pretoria, South Africa.</ref> Topics under his analysis included ''The Essentials of Good Government''<ref>''South African Observer'', Vol. IX-X, September 1963/May 1965.</ref> in a series of 20 monthly parts, and ''Public Opinion in England''<ref>''South African Observer'', Vol. X-XIII, July 1965/June 1968.</ref> in a similar series.
