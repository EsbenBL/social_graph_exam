'''John Rex''' (5 March 1925 – 18 December 2011<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/warwickpeople/obituary_-_professor|title=Obituary - Professor John Rex|website=www2.warwick.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>) was a South African-born British [[sociology|sociologist]]. Born in [[Port Elizabeth]], he was radicalised after working for the South African Bantu Affairs Administration and moved to Britain.  He was a lecturer at the universities of [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] (1949–62) (where he was a leading left-wing activist), [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]] (1962–64), [[University of Durham|Durham]] (1964–70), [[University of Warwick|Warwick]] (1970–79 and 1984–90), [[Aston University|Aston]] (1979–84), [[University of Toronto|Toronto]] (1974–75), [[University of Cape Town|Cape Town]] (1991) and [[New York University|New York]] (1996).  He was also a member of the [[UNESCO]] International Experts' Committee on Racism and Race Prejudice (1967) and president of the International Sociological Association's Research Committee on Racial and Ethnic Minorities (1974–82).

==Academic work==
His academic work involved the [[Social conflict theory|analysis of conflict]] as a key problem of both society and sociological theory. His 1961 book, ''Key Problems of Sociological Theory,'' was his first major work where [[Group conflict|conflict]] was claimed to be more realistic than the past British [[Structural functionalism|functionalist theories]] of social order and system-stability.  He is also known for his studies of [[race relations|race and ethnic relations]]. He analyzed the classic tradition of sociology, including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] in his book ''Discovering Sociology'' (1973).

He was a professor emeritus at Warwick University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/shss/expertise/rex/ |title=John Rex |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/ev.php-URL_ID=2555&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html#rex |title=Editorial Board &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>
His life has been described by {{ill|Herminio Martins|pt}} of [[Oxford University]]<ref>1993</ref> as one where both "passion" and "knowledge" intertwined. Theory and practice was for him always a dynamic issue and led to his demands for "objective" research and comment while being a political radical involved in the UK's [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and the ''[[New Left Review]].''
