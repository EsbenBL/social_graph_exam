==Career==
[[File:Deirdre McCloskey by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|McCloskey speaking in 2015 in Washington, D.C.]]
McCloskey earned her undergraduate and graduate degrees in [[Economics]] at [[Harvard University]]. Her dissertation, supervised by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MaCciKWcDIAC&pg=PA302 The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics]</ref> on British iron and steel won in 1973 the David A. Wells Prize.<ref>McCloskey, Deirdre. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6RAJq7enhoAC&pg=PA350 ''Measurement and Meaning in Economics: The Essential Deirdre McCloskey''], ed. [[Stephen Ziliak|Stephen Thomas Ziliak]] (Cheltenham, UK, and Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2001), 350.</ref>

In 1968, McCloskey became an assistant professor of economics at the [[University of Chicago]], where she stayed for 12 years, gaining tenure as an associate professor in economics in 1975, and an associate professorship in history in 1979.  Her work at Chicago, under her birth name Donald McCloskey, is marked by her contribution to the [[Cliometrics|cliometric]] revolution in economic history, and teaching generations of leading economists [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago]] [[Microeconomics|Price Theory]], a course which culminated in her book ''The Applied Theory of Price''.<ref name=price>{{cite web|last=McCloskey|first=Deirdre|title=The Applied Theory of Price|url=http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/price.pdf|work=PDF|publisher=Deirdre McCloskey.com|access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref>  In 1979, at the suggestion of [[Wayne C. Booth|Wayne Booth]] in English at Chicago, she turned to the study of [[rhetoric]] in economics.  Later at the [[University of Iowa]], McCloskey, the John Murray Professor of Economics and of History (1980–1999), published ''The Rhetoric of Economics'' (1985) and co-founded with John S. Nelson, Allan Megill, and others an institution and graduate program, the ''Project on Rhetoric of Inquiry''.<ref>{{cite web|title=People |url=http://poroi.grad.uiowa.edu/board-of-directors |website=Project on Rhetoric of Inquiry (2008–2015) |publisher=The University of Iowa |access-date=April 5, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411204451/http://poroi.grad.uiowa.edu/board-of-directors |archive-date=April 11, 2015 }}</ref> McCloskey has authored 16 books and nearly 400 articles in her many fields.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Matt|title=Economist Deirdre McCloskey: playing both sides of the street|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/economist-deirdre-mccloskey-playing-both-sides-of-the-street-20131201-2ygwu.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=April 5, 2013|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref>

Her major contributions have been to the [[economic history of Britain]] (19th-century trade, modern history, and medieval agriculture), the quantification of historical inquiry ([[Cliometrics]]), the rhetoric of economics, the rhetoric of the human sciences, economic methodology, virtue ethics, [[feminist economics]], [[heterodox economics]], the role of mathematics in economic analysis, and the use (and misuse) of significance testing in economics, her trilogy "The Bourgeois Era",<ref name=books/> and the origins of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

==''Bourgeois'' era==
Her book ''The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce''<ref name=BV>{{cite book|last1=McCloskey|first1=Deirdre|title=Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an age of Commerce|date=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref> was the first of a planned series of books about the world since the Industrial Revolution—the Bourgeois Era—and was published in 2006. McCloskey argued that the bourgeoisie, contrary to its self-advertised faith in prudence only, believes in all [[seven virtues]].

The second, ''[[Bourgeois Dignity]]: Why Economics Can't Explain the Modern World'', was published in 2010, and argued that the unprecedented increase in human welfare of the 19th and 20th centuries, from $3 per capita per day to over $100 per day, issued not from capitalist accumulation but from innovation.

The third, ''Bourgeois Equality: How Ideas, Not Capital or Institutions, Enriched the World'', appeared in 2016.<ref name=books>{{cite web|last=McCloskey|first=Deirdre|title=Books by Deirdre McCloskey|url=http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/books/index.php|publisher=Deirdre McCloskey.com|access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref> McCloskey expanded her argument, coining the term "Great Enrichment" to describe the unprecedented gains in human welfare of the 19th and 20th centuries. She reiterated her argument that the enrichment came from innovation and not from accumulation as argued by many including [[Thomas Piketty]].

==Personal life==
McCloskey is the eldest child of [[Robert G. McCloskey (professor)|Robert McCloskey]], a professor of government at [[Harvard University]], and Helen McCloskey ({{nee|Stueland}}), a poet. McCloskey was born Donald McCloskey and lived as a man until the age of 53. Married for thirty years, and the parent of two children, she made the decision to transition from male to female in 1995, writing about her experience in a ''New York Times'' Notable Book of the Year, ''Crossing: A Memoir'' (1999, University of Chicago Press).<ref name="crossing">{{cite web

The book describes how in her teenage years, McCloskey would commit gender burglaries of neighbors' homes, dressing up in the crinoline dresses favored by young women of that era, in addition to "shoes, garter belts and all the equipment of a 1950s girl". The memoir then goes on to describe her new life, following sex-reassignment surgery, in her career as a female academic economist and scholar of femininity.

McCloskey has advocated on behalf of the rights of persons and organizations in the [[LGBT]] community.<ref>{{Citation|last=Learn Liberty|title=Trans Talks: Series Trailer |date=2015-11-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym1oxt-q4DQ&list=PL-erRSWG3IoAmDJLCh5Q9yaN0xC_7x2Z9|access-date=2017-02-12}}</ref> She was a vocal critic of J. Michael Bailey's 2003 book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', which popularized the theory of [[autogynephilia]] as a motivation for sex reassignment, by the sexologist [[Ray Blanchard]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=Criticism of a Gender Theory, and a Scientist Under Siege | first=Benedict |last=Carey |newspaper=New York Times |date=2007-08-21 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/health/psychology/21gender.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5124&en=0c11623b4c191f82&ex=1345348800&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink }}</ref>

McCloskey has described herself as a "literary, quantitative, postmodern, free-market, progressive [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], Midwestern woman from Boston who was once a man. Not 'conservative'! I'm a Christian Classical Liberal."<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=McCloskey|first=Deirdre|title=Informal Biographical Remarks|url=http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/main/bio.php|publisher=deirdremccloskey.com|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref>

In 2008, McCloskey was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[NUI Galway]].
