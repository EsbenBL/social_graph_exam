Kaufman has taught learning-disabled children and worked as a school psychologist, learning disabilities specialist, university professor, and founder-director of several psychoeducational clinics. She also was a direct participant in the development and standardization of the [[McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities|McCarthy Scales]] and [[WISC-R]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Nadeen L.

Nadeen has been married to psychologist [[Alan S. Kaufman]] since 1964. From 1974 to 1997, Kaufman and her husband trained school psychologists and clinical psychologists, and supervised graduate-student research, at the University of Georgia, the National College of Education in Evanston, Illinois, the [[California School of Professional Psychology]] in [[San Diego]], and the University of Alabama. The research team that they supervised while at the [[University of Georgia]] in 1978-79 helped the Kaufman’s to develop the original [[K-ABC]]. The Kaufmans’ went on to create several other psychological and educational tests, including the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (K-TEA/NU), Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT), and the second editions of both (KTEA-II and KBIT-2). The Kaufman Survey of Early Academic and Language Skills (K-SEALS) and the Cognitive/Language Profile of the Early Screening Profiles address the preschool level. The Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test (KAIT), the Kaufman Short Neuropsychological Assessment Procedure (K-SNAP), and the Kaufman Functional Academic Skills Test (K-FAST) extend through the adult life span.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="boffey">Boffey, Philip M.
