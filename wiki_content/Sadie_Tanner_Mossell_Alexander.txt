'''Sadie Tanner Mossell''' was born on January 2, 1898, in Philadelphia to [[Aaron Albert Mossell II]] and [[Mary Louisa Tanner]] (born 1867).

Mossell attended high school in Washington, D.C., at the M&nbsp;Street School, now known as [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]], graduating in 1915.<ref name=papers/><ref>{{cite book |title=The Education of Minority Children |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Sowell |editor=Lazear, Edward P. |year=2002 |pages=79–92 |url=http://www.tsowell.com/speducat.html |access-date=October 26, 2010 |isbn=978-0-8179-2892-6}}</ref>

Mossell returned to Philadelphia to study at the School of Education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1918. There, she faced numerous hardships, due to her race and gender, such as poor advising, false accusations of plagiarism, and other students stealing her intellectual property.<ref name="The Alexander Technique 2020, pp. 46-47">"The Alexander Technique." ''The Economist'', vol. 437, no. 9225, December 19, 2020, pp. 46-47''.''</ref> She pursued graduate work in economics, also at Penn, earning her master's in 1919. Awarded the Francis Sergeant Pepper fellowship, she was able to continue her studies and in 1921 became the first [[African-American]] woman in the United States to earn a [[Ph.D]] from an American university.<ref name="Boston1997">{{cite book |last=Malveaux |first=Julianne |editor=Thomas D.

Finding it difficult to get professorship work in Philadelphia as an African-American even with her doctorate,<ref name=":1"/> Mossell decided to take an actuarial job with the black-owned [[North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], and worked there for two years.

In 1919, Sadie Tanner Mossell was elected the first national President of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] Sorority. Mossell Alexander also served as the legal advisor to [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority for 35 years.<ref>{{Citation|last=Malveaux|first=Julianne|title=Missed Opportunity|date=December 13, 1996|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203012642.ch6|work=A Different Vision|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-09590-7|access-date=May 6, 2021}}</ref> She was in contact with the Alpha Chapter of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] since 1915 when she arrived at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. However, she needed five students to charter a chapter of the sorority, which was not possible until 1918. In March 1918, the Gamma Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta was established with Mossell as its first President. At the request of the Alpha Chapter, the four existing chapters of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] were called to convene at Howard University in December 1919. The sorority planned to host their meetings in the women's dormitory on campus until Mossell's uncle [[Lewis Baxter Moore]] offered his office as a meeting place. At this convention, the Grand Chapter of the sorority was established, taking the sorority from a loose federation of chapters to a national body. Under, Mossell's leadership the Sorority expanded to new locales in the West, the South, and further into the Midwest and Northeast. She also initiated Delta's first national program, May Week.<ref name="Gid48">Giddings 1998, op. cit., p. 83.</ref>

In 1923, Mossell married [[Raymond Pace Alexander]] shortly after he was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]], then returned with him to Philadelphia. Mossell received job offers from several Black colleges and universities, but none of them were located in Philadelphia, and she had no desire to leave her new family. So she stayed home for a year, did volunteer work, and eventually entered law school.<ref name=":1"/> She was the first African-American woman admitted to the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].<ref name=Almanac/> In 1927, she was its first African-American woman graduate, and the first to be admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar.<ref name=papers/>

Mossell Alexander practiced law from 1927 until her retirement in 1982.  Upon admission to the Bar, she joined her husband's law practice as partner, specializing in estate and family law. They both were active in [[civil rights]] law as well. In 1928 she was the first [[African-American]] woman appointed as Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Philadelphia, serving to 1930. She was reappointed from 1934–1938. From 1943–1947, she was the first woman to serve as secretary of the [[National Bar Association]].<ref name=Almanac/> She was appointed to the [[Commission on Human Relations]] of the City of Philadelphia, serving from 1952–1968. In 1959, when her husband was appointed to the [[Pennsylvania courts of common pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] in [[Philadelphia]], she opened her own law office. She continued to practice law independently until her husband's death in 1974.<ref name=":1"/> In 1976, she joined the firm of [[Atkinson, Myers, and Archie]] as a [[general counsel]], where she remained until her retirement.

Mossell Alexander died on November 1, 1989, at Cathedral Village in [[Andorra, Philadelphia]], from pneumonia as a complication from [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=obit>{{cite web |title=Sadie T.

==Family==
[[File:Sadie Alexander (13270411653).jpg|thumb|Sadie Alexander in 1982]]
Her maternal grandfather was [[Benjamin Tucker Tanner]] (1835–1923), a [[bishop]] in the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME) and editor of the ''[[Christian Recorder]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Clarence E.|last2=Seraile|first2=William|date=June 2000|title=Fire in His Heart: Bishop Benjamin Tucker Tanner and the A.M.E.

Her father, [[Aaron Albert Mossell|Aaron Albert Mossell II]] (1863-1951), was the first African-American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Law and practiced as a lawyer in Philadelphia.  In 1899, when his daughter Sadie was a one year old, he abandoned his family and moved to Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackhistorynow.com/sadie-alexander/|title=Sadie Alexander Biography at Black History Now|access-date=June 8, 2020}}</ref> Her uncle, [[Nathan Francis Mossell]] (1856–1946) was the first African-American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.<ref name=papers/>

Mossell Alexander's siblings include Aaron Albert Mossell III (1893–1975), who became a pharmacist; and Elizabeth Mossell (1894–1975), who became a Dean of Women at [[Virginia State College]], a [[historically black college]].<ref name=papers>{{cite web |title=Alexander Family Collection |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/alexander_stma.html |publisher=University of Pennsylvania University Archives and Records Center |access-date=October 26, 2010}}</ref>

During her high school years, Mossell lived in [[Washington, DC]], with her uncle, [[Lewis Baxter Moore]], who was dean at [[Howard University]].

On November 29, 1923, Sadie Tanner Mossell married Raymond Pace Alexander (1897–1974) in her parents' home on Diamond Street in North Philadelphia, with the ceremony performed by her father.  Alexander, the son of slaves, grew up in Philadelphia.  He attended and graduated from [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] (1917, valedictorian), [[Wharton School of Business|Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] (1920), and [[Harvard Law School]] (1923).  At the time of this marriage, he had established a law practice in Philadelphia.

Sadie and Raymond had four premature children, with only the last two surviving. They were able to raise two daughters:<ref name=":1" /> Mary Elizabeth Alexander (born 1934), who married Melvin Brown; and Rae Pace Alexander (born 1937), who earned a PhD. and married [[Archie C. Epps III]]. After her divorce with Epps, in 1971 Rae Pace Alexander married [[Thomas Minter]], and they had two sons together.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thomas Minter, 84, New York and Federal Education Official, Dies|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=May 26, 2009|access-date=May 27, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/nyregion/27minter.html?ref=obituaries}}</ref>

According to [[Nina Banks]],<ref name="Banks2008">Nina Banks, The Black Worker, Economic Justice and the Speeches of Sadie T.M. Alexander. Review of Social Economy, Vol. LXVI, No. 2, June 2008 p 139-161 available as of November 1, 2018 at https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770460</ref> Alexander's opposition to racial oppression was within a tradition of 19th century scholars [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[T. Thomas Fortune]], and with later scholars [[W.E.B. DuBois]] and [[A. Philip Randolph]]. Alexander's focus was frequently on racial and economic justice for the working class, especially for working men and women. However, unlike Dubois or Randolph, Alexander never embraced socialism. Alexander also can be contrasted with [[Howard University]] radicals [[Ralph Bunche]], [[E. Franklin Frazier]], and fellow black economist [[Abram Lincoln Harris|Abram Harris]]. For example, Harris wrote that the fundamental problems facing blacks could be overcome through multi-racial labor organizing and did not support direct action for civil rights until blacks had achieved economic power. Alexander, on the other hand, was outspoken against white dominance in political, social, and economic spheres.<ref name="Banks2008"/>

Alexander's work and views are recorded in speeches kept in the [[University of Pennsylvania]] archives. Among her earliest works are from the 1920s and discuss black workers in the US economy. In 1930, Alexander published an article, "Negro Women in Our Economic Life", which was published in Urban League's Opportunity magazine advocating black women's employment, particularly in industrial jobs. Alexander generally supported the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], suspicious of the control of conservative southern whites over the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], although she also criticized Republican political appointments, as well as what she saw as uneven benefits of the [[New Deal]] which did not do enough to help blacks who were most hurt by the great depression. During [[World War II]], Alexander saw similarities in a rise in racial violence and discrimination in the US as paralleling the treatment of Jews in Germany. Near the end of the war, she supported integrating labor unions to increase their bargaining power once the war economy slowed and industrial employment moved toward pre-war levels. Her interest in labor economic issues extended to advocating for government regulation to smooth fluctuations in the [[business cycle]], modification of [[tariff]]s, regulation of [[public utilities]], and regulation of [[securities]] and [[securities markets]].<ref name="Banks2008"/>

After the war she was appointed to Truman's Presidential Committee on Human Rights and shifted her focus to civil and human rights. Evidence in the archives suggests that her focus was in this direction for over a decade. In 1949, Alexander and six other Philadelphians formed the Citizens' Council on Democratic Rights to "protect and extend the enjoyment of human rights." In 1951, joined by [[Henry W. Sawyer]], the Council became the Greater Philadelphia Branch of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]; Alexander continued to serve on that organization's Board of Directors for many years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shuford |first1=Reggie |title=A Relatively Brief History of the ACLU of Pennsylvania |url=https://www.aclupa.org/en/news/relatively-brief-history-aclu-pennsylvania |website=ACLU Pennsylvania |access-date=16 September 2021}}</ref> In 1963 she gave a speech to the Annual Conference of Commission on Human Rights and she returned to the topic of economic justice, advocating for universal employment.<ref name="Banks2008"/>

In a 1981 interview she did with the Geriatric Nursing journal about her position as chair of the WHCoA, Alexander expressed her disapproval of anti-abortion legislation. She advocated for better benefits for nurses and stressed their vitality to the healthcare system. She also expressed that everyone, no matter their age or educational level, can add value to the economy with the proper support.
