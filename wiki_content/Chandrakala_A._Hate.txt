'''Chandrakala Anandrao Hate''' (pronounced Haa-tay) (1903–1990) ([[née]] Murkute) was an author, [[feminist]], [[social worker]], and professor in [[Bombay]], [[India]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born Chandrakala Jagannath Murkute on 12 September 1903 to Dr. Jagannath and Lahanibai Murkute, she was born into a family belonging to [[Mumbai]]'s [[Daivadnya]] community. Education played an important role from early on in her life. She married Anandrao Ramkrishna Hate.

===Career===
Much of Dr. Hate's work entailed studying and improving the status of women in Indian society. She received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[Economics]] and wrote ''Hindu Woman and Her Future'' (1948) for her [[Ph.D.]] thesis in [[Sociology]], advised by the influential [[sociologist]] Dr. [[G. S. Ghurye]]. Considered extremely forward-thinking at that time, the study advocated education of women as well increasing the acceptability of women in the work force.

She wrote the books ''Changing status of woman in post-independence India'' (1969) and ''Turn..? whither...? to....?'' (1978), and contributed often to the many English and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] Bombay magazines. Dr. Hate taught as a professor of Sociology at [[SNDT Women's University]], Bombay. 

She began the organization ''Kutumb Sakhi'' in 1975 to help [[socially disadvantaged]] women employ themselves.<ref name="NDTV 2011">{{cite news |last1=NDTV Correspondent |title=Celebrating Women's Day with Kutumb Sakhi |url=https://www.ndtv.com/business/celebrating-womens-day-with-kutumb-sakhi-2134 |access-date=25 June 2021 |work=NDTV |date=October 29, 2011}}</ref> ''Kutumb Sakhi'' initially began as a group of women stitching petticoats from cloth purchased from a mill owned by the [[cricketer]] [[Vijay Merchant]]. However, to improve revenue, the organization turned to cooking snack foods; over the years, the organization has become quite successful in the Mumbai eatery business, and in turn, has served a role in empowering many women take control of the own futures.<ref name="NDTV 2011"/> As of 2011, the organization employed around 150 women, many of whom are [[widows]] or deserted wives.<ref name="NDTV 2011"/>

===Personal===
Dr. Hate's husband died early in her life, and she raised three sons on her own, playing an important role in the way she viewed much of society. Much of her spiritual support came from the teachings of Gurudev R D Ranade. She died of [[esophageal cancer]] in Mumbai in 1990. 

===Legacy===
In the years after her death, the city of Mumbai dedicated and renamed a [[:wikt:chowk|chowk]] in [[Girgaum]], [[South Mumbai]], Chandrakalabai Hate Chowk in her honor.
