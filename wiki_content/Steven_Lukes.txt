'''Steven Michael Lukes''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1941) is a British political and social theorist. Currently he is a professor of politics and sociology at [[New York University]]. He was formerly a professor at the [[University of Siena]], the [[European University Institute]] (Florence) and the [[London School of Economics]].

==Life and career==
Lukes attended the [[Newcastle Royal Grammar School|Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne]],<ref>http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/object/stevenlukes{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> completing his studies there in 1958. Lukes completed his BA in 1962 at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He worked as a research fellow at [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] and as a lecturer in politics at [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]] and completed his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1967. In 1968, he completed his doctorate on the work of [[Émile Durkheim]]. From 1966 to 1987 he was fellow and tutor in politics at Balliol College. He is a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA) and a visiting professor at the [[University of Paris]], New York University, [[University of California, San Diego]], and [[Hebrew University]].

From 1974 to 1983 he was President of the Committee for the History of Sociology of the [[International Sociological Association]].

He was the co-director of the European Forum on Citizenship at the European University Institute from 1995 to 1996.

In April 2006, Lukes married the political commentator and author [[Katha Pollitt]]; this being his third marriage. Lukes was previously a widower.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/fashion/weddings/30poll.html The New York Times: Katha Pollitt and Steven Lukes]</ref> He has three children from his previous marriage to the English barrister [[Nina Stanger]]: freelance journalist Daniel (born 1977), musician Michael (born 1979) and academic Alexandra (born 1981).

==Academic interests==

Lukes' main interests are political and social theory, the sociology of [[Durkheim]] and his followers, [[individualism]], rationality, the category of the person, [[Marxism]] and ethics, [[sociology of morality]] and new forms of liberalism, varieties of conceptions of [[Power (sociology)|power]], the notion of the "good society", rationality and relativism, moral conflict and politics.

He is a member of the editorial board of the ''European Journal of Sociology'' and directs a research project on what is left of the socialist idea in Western and Eastern Europe.

===The three dimensions of power===

One of Lukes' academic theories is that of the "three faces of power," presented in his book, ''Power: A Radical View.'' This theory claims that power is exercised in three ways: decision-making power, non-decision-making power, and ideological power.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}<ref>[[Andrew Heywood|Heywood, Andrew]]. (2013). Faces of power. In ''The Palgrave Macmillan Politics'' (4th ed., p. 9). New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan. Heywood used the terms ''power as agenda setting'' and ''power as thought control'' for the second and third faces of power.</ref>

Decision-making power is the most public of the three dimensions. Analysis of this "face" focuses on policy preferences [[Revealed preference|revealed]] through political action.<ref>Lukes, Steven. ''Power: A Radical View''. London: Macmillan Press, 1974. p. 15.</ref>

Non-decision-making power is that which sets the [[Political agenda|agenda]] in debates and makes certain issues (e.g., the merits of [[socialism]] in the [[United States]]) unacceptable for discussion in "legitimate" public forums. Adding this face gives a two-dimensional view of power allowing the analyst to examine both current ''and'' potential issues, expanding the focus on observable conflict to those types that might be observed overtly or covertly.<ref>Lukes, Steven. ''Power: A Radical View''. London: Macmillan Press, 1974. p. 20.</ref>

[[Ideological]] power allows one to influence people's wishes and thoughts, even making them want things opposed to their own self-interest (e.g., causing women to support a patriarchal society). Lukes offers this third dimension as a "thoroughgoing critique" of the behavioural focus of the first two dimensions,<ref>Lukes, Steven. ''Power: A Radical View''. London: Macmillan Press, 1974. p. 24.</ref> supplementing and correcting the shortcomings of previous views, allowing the analyst to include both latent and observable conflicts. Lukes claims that a full critique of power should include both subjective interests and those "real" interests held by those excluded by the political process.<ref>Lukes, Steven. ''Power: A Radical View''. London: Macmillan Press, 1974. p. 25.</ref>
