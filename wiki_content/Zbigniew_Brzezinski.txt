Zbigniew Brzezinski was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], on March 28, 1928.<ref name=NYTobit /> His family came from [[Berezhany|Brzeżany]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in the [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]] (administrative region) of then eastern [[Poland]] (now in [[Ukraine]]). The town of Brzeżany is thought to be the source of the family name. Brzezinski's parents were Leonia (''née'' Roman) Brzezińska and [[Tadeusz Brzeziński]], a Polish diplomat who was posted to Germany from 1931 to 1935; Zbigniew Brzezinski thus spent some of his earliest years witnessing the rise of the [[Nazis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Tadeusz-Brzezinski-Former-Polish-Consul-General-Dies/id-84b996f2e4a3f5e8ad52fffd5e8591b3 |title=Tadeusz Brzezinski, Former Polish Consul-General, Dies|access-date=May 25, 2016}}</ref> From 1936 to 1938, Tadeusz Brzeziński was posted to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]],<ref>Gati (2013) p. 237</ref> and was later praised by Israel for his work helping Jews escape from the Nazis.<ref name=WashPoObit>{{cite news|last1=Hoagland|first1=Jim|title=Zbigniew Brzezinski, foreign policy intellectual who served as Carter's national security adviser, dies at 89|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/zbigniew-brzezinski-foreign-policy-intellectual-who-served-as-carters-national-security-adviser-dies-at-89/2017/05/26/84cf5d5c-3f42-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html|access-date=May 27, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 26, 2017}}</ref>

In 1938, Tadeusz Brzeziński was posted to [[Montreal]] as a consul general.<ref name=WashPoObit /> The Brzezinski family lived proximate to the Polish Consulate-General, on [[Stanley Street (Montreal)|Stanley Street]].<ref>{{cite web |title=USA: Zbigniew Brzeziński nie żyje |url=https://poland.us/strona,9,293,0,usa-zbigniew-brzezinski-nie-zyje.html |website=poland.us |access-date=1 July 2021 |language=Polish |date=26 May 2017}}</ref> In 1939, the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] was agreed to by [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union; subsequently the two powers [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. The 1945 [[Yalta Conference]] among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] allotted Poland to the Soviet sphere of influence. The [[Second World War]] had a profound effect on Brzezinski, who stated in an interview: "The extraordinary violence that was perpetrated against Poland did affect my perception of the world, and made me much more sensitive to the fact that a great deal of world politics is a fundamental struggle."<ref>{{YouTube|03ApSE6mgHE|Al Jazeera: One on One – Zbigniew Brzezinski}}</ref>

[[McGill University]].</ref> Brzezinski's plan for pursuing further studies in the United Kingdom in preparation for a diplomatic career in Canada fell through, principally because he was ruled ineligible for a scholarship he had won that was only open to British subjects. Brzezinski then attended [[Harvard University]] to work on a doctorate with [[Merle Fainsod]], focusing on the Soviet Union and the relationship between the [[October Revolution]], [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s state, and the actions of [[Joseph Stalin]]. He received his Ph.D. in 1953; the same year, he traveled to Munich and met [[Jan Nowak-Jezioranski]], head of the Polish desk of [[Radio Free Europe]]. He later collaborated with [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl J. Friedrich]] to develop the concept of [[totalitarianism]] as a way to more accurately and powerfully characterize and criticize the Soviets in 1956.<ref name="Gati 2013 p 208">Gati (2013) p. 208</ref>

Brzezinski was on the faculty of [[Harvard University]] from 1953 to 1960, and of [[Columbia University]] from 1960 to 1972 where he headed the Institute on Communist Affairs. He was Senior Research Professor of International Relations at the [[Paul H.

</div>
As a Harvard professor, he argued against [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s and [[John Foster Dulles]]'s policy of [[rollback]], saying that antagonism would push Eastern Europe further toward the Soviets.<ref name="Gati 2013 p xxi">Gati (2013) p. xxi</ref> The [[Poznań 1956 protests|Polish protests]] followed by the [[Polish October]] and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] in 1956 lent some support to Brzezinski's idea that the Eastern Europeans could gradually counter Soviet domination. In 1957, he visited Poland for the first time since he left as a child, and his visit reaffirmed his judgement that splits within the [[Eastern bloc]] were profound. He developed his ideas he called "peaceful engagement."<ref name="Gati 2013 p xxi" /> Brzezinski became a naturalized American citizen in 1958.<ref>[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6n5920p "Brzezinski, Zbigniew 1928–."] In: [[SNAC|''Social networks and archival context''.]] [[University of Virginia]].</ref>

In 1959, Harvard awarded an associate professorship to [[Henry Kissinger]] instead of Brzezinski.<ref name=NYTobit>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/us/zbigniew-brzezinski-dead-national-security-adviser-to-carter.html|title=Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Adviser to Jimmy Carter, Dies at 89|last=Lewis|first=Daniel|date=May 27, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=May 27, 2017|issn=0362-4331|page=A1}}</ref> He then moved to New York City to teach at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="Gati 2013 p 208" /> Here he wrote ''Soviet Bloc: Unity and Conflict'', which focused on Eastern Europe since the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. He also taught future Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]], who, like Brzezinski's widow Emily, is of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent, and whom he also mentored during her early years in Washington.<ref>[[Madeleine Albright|Albright, Madeleine]] (2003). [[Madam Secretary (book)|''Madam Secretary: A Memoir''.]] Hyperion. p. 57. {{ISBN|978-1401399474}}. {{OCLC|439810833}}.</ref> He also became a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and joined the [[Bilderberg Group]].<ref>Gati (2013) p. 12</ref>

During the [[1960 U.S. presidential election]]s, Brzezinski was an advisor to the [[John F. Kennedy]] campaign, urging a non-antagonistic policy toward Eastern European governments. Seeing the Soviet Union as having entered a period of stagnation, both economic and political, Brzezinski predicted a future breakup of the Soviet Union along lines of nationality (expanding on his master's thesis).<ref name="masters" />

As a scholar, he developed his thoughts over the years, fashioning fundamental theories on international relations and [[Geopolitics|geostrategy]]. During the 1950s he worked on the theory of [[totalitarianism]]. His thought in the 1960s focused on wider Western understanding of disunity in the [[Soviet Bloc]], as well as developing the thesis of intensified degeneration of the Soviet Union. During the 1970s he proposed that the Soviet system was incapable of evolving beyond the industrial phase into the "technetronic" age.

Brzezinski continued to argue for and support [[détente]] for the next few years, publishing "Peaceful Engagement in Eastern Europe" in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Zbigniew |last1=Brzezinski |first2=William |last2=Griffith |title=Peaceful Engagement in Eastern Europe |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=39 |issue=4 |date=Spring 1961 |page=647 |doi=10.2307/20029518|jstor=20029518 }}</ref> and he continued to support non-antagonistic policies after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] on the grounds that such policies might disabuse Eastern European nations of their fear of an aggressive Germany, and pacify Western Europeans fearful of a superpower compromise along the lines of the [[Yalta Conference]]. In a 1962 book Brzezinski argued against the possibility of a [[Sino-Soviet split]], saying their alignment was "not splitting and is not likely to split."<ref name=NYTobit />

Pictured are, among others, Zbigniew Brzezinski (far left) as well as [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin|Ewald von Kleist]] and [[Franz-Josef Strauss]] (center).]]
In 1964, Brzezinski supported [[1964 U.S. presidential election|Lyndon Johnson's presidential campaign]] and the [[Great Society]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights policies]], while on the other hand he saw Soviet leadership as having been purged of any creativity following the [[Nikita Khrushchev#Life in retirement|ousting of Khrushchev]]. Through Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, Brzezinski met with [[Adam Michnik]], future Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] activist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Brzezinski continued to support engagement with Eastern European governments, while warning against [[Charles de Gaulle|De Gaulle]]'s vision of a "Europe from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Urals]]." He also supported the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1966, Brzezinski was appointed to the [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Council]] of the [[U.S. Department of State]] (President Johnson's October 7, 1966, "Bridge Building" speech was a product of Brzezinski's influence). In 1968, Brzezinski resigned from the council in protest of President Johnson's expansion of the war.<ref name=NYTobit /> Next, he became a foreign policy advisor to Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]].<ref name=NYTobit/>

Events in [[Czechoslovakia]] further reinforced Brzezinski's criticisms of the right's aggressive stance toward Eastern European governments. His service to the Johnson administration, and his fact-finding trip to Vietnam, made him an enemy of the [[New Left#The American New Left|New Left]].

For the [[1968 U.S. presidential election|1968 U.S. presidential campaign]], Brzezinski was chairman of the Humphrey's Foreign Policy Task Force.

Brzezinski called for a pan-European conference, an idea that would eventually find fruition in 1973 as the [[Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].<ref>Brzezinski, Zbigniew (January 3, 1970). "Détente in the '70s." ''[[The New Republic]]''. p. 18.</ref> Meanwhile, he became a leading critic of both the [[Richard M.

==The Trilateral Commission==
[[File:Trilateral.svg|thumb|right|[[The Trilateral Commission]] emblem.]]
In his 1970 piece ''Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era'', Brzezinski argued that a coordinated policy among [[developed nation]]s was necessary in order to counter global instability erupting from increasing [[economic inequality]]. Out of this thesis, Brzezinski co-founded the [[Trilateral Commission]] with [[David Rockefeller]], serving as director from 1973 to 1976.<ref name=sklar/> The Trilateral Commission is a group of prominent political and business leaders and academics primarily from the United States, Western Europe and Japan. Its purpose was to strengthen relations among the three most industrially advanced regions of the capitalist world. In 1974, Brzezinski selected [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] as a member.<ref name=NYTobit/><ref name=sklar/>

==Government==
[[File:Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and National Security Council Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. - NARA - 175514.tif|thumb|Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] and National Security Council Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (1977)]]
Carter announced his candidacy for the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential campaign]] to a skeptical media and proclaimed himself an "eager student" of Brzezinski.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brauer |first=Carl |date=November 1, 1988 |title=Lost In Transition |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1988/11/lost-in-transition/307120/ |journal=The Atlantic |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Atlantic Media |access-date=March 27, 2014 }}</ref> Brzezinski became Carter's principal foreign policy advisor by late 1975. He became an outspoken critic of the Nixon-Kissinger over-reliance on détente, a situation preferred by the Soviet Union, favoring the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki process]] instead, which focused on [[human rights]], [[international law]] and peaceful engagement in Eastern Europe. Brzezinski was considered to be the Democrats' response to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Henry Kissinger]].<ref>John Maclean, "Advisers Key to Foreign Policy Views", ''The Boston Evening Globe'' (October 5, 1976)</ref> Carter engaged his incumbent opponent for the presidency, [[Gerald Ford]], in foreign policy debates by contrasting the Trilateral vision with Ford's détente.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan |first=Patrick G. |editor-first=Leopoldo| editor-last=Nuti |title=The Crisis of Détente in Europe: From Helsinki to Gorbachev, 1975–1985 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |pages=11–25 |chapter=Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Helsinki Final Act |isbn=978-0-415-46051-4}}</ref>

After his victory in 1976, Carter made Brzezinski [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]. Earlier that year, major labor riots broke out in Poland, laying the foundations for [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. Brzezinski began by emphasizing the "Basket III" human rights in the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]], which inspired [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] shortly thereafter.<ref>Michael Getler, "Dissidents Challenge Prague – Tension Builds Following Demand for Freedom and Democracy", ''The Washington Post'' (January 21, 1977).</ref>

Brzezinski assisted with writing parts of Carter's inaugural address, and this served his purpose of sending a positive message to Soviet [[dissident]]s.<ref>Zbigniew Brzezinski, ''Power and Principle: Memoirs of the National Security Adviser, 1977–1981'' (New York, 1983), p. 123.</ref> The Soviet Union and Western European leaders both complained that this kind of rhetoric ran against the "code of détente" that Nixon and Kissinger had established.<ref>Seyom Brown, ''Faces of Power'' (New York, 1983), p. 539.</ref><ref>"Giscard, Schmidt on Détente", ''The Washington Post'' (July 19, 1977).</ref> Brzezinski ran up against members of his own [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who disagreed with this interpretation of détente, including Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]]. Vance argued for less emphasis on human rights in order to gain Soviet agreement to [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT), whereas Brzezinski favored doing both at the same time. Brzezinski then ordered [[Radio Free Europe]] transmitters to increase the power and area of their broadcasts, a provocative reversal of Nixon-Kissinger policies.<ref>David Binder, "Carter Requests Funds for Big Increase in Broadcasts to Soviet Bloc", ''The New York Times'' (March 23, 1977).</ref> West German chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] objected to Brzezinski's agenda, even calling for the removal of Radio Free Europe from German soil.<ref>Brzezinski, ''Power and Principle'', p. 293.</ref>

During the Carter (and Reagan) administrations, the access of [[Armand Hammer]], petroleum industrialist and Soviet trade advocate, to the [[Oval Office]] was blocked. Brzezinski stated he "did what was necessary to keep him out of the White House."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Woutat|first=Donald|date=1987-06-07|title=The Unfinished Business of Armand Hammer : After a Lifetime in the Public Eye, He Still Worries About His Place in History|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-06-07-tm-542-story.html|url-status=live|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

The State Department was alarmed by Brzezinski's support for dissidents in [[East Germany]] and objected to his suggestion that Carter's first overseas visit be to Poland. He visited [[Warsaw]] and met with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Stefan Wyszynski]] (against the objection of the U.S. Ambassador to Poland), recognizing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the legitimate opposition to communist rule in Poland.<ref>David A. Andelman, "Brzezinski and Mrs. Carter Hold Discussion with Polish Cardinal", ''The New York Times'' (December 29, 1977).</ref>

By 1978, Brzezinski and Vance were more and more at odds over the direction of Carter's foreign policy. Vance sought to continue the style of détente engineered by Nixon-Kissinger, with a focus on [[arms control]]. Brzezinski believed that détente emboldened the Soviets in [[Angola]] and the Middle East, and so he argued for increased military strength and an emphasis on human rights. Vance, the State Department, and the media criticized Brzezinski publicly as seeking to revive the Cold War.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Brzezinski advised Carter in 1978 to engage the [[People's Republic of China]] and traveled to Beijing to lay the groundwork for the normalization of relations between the two countries. This also resulted in the severing of ties with the United States' longtime anti-Communist ally the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

<div class="toccolours" style="float:right;width:175px;margin:10px;padding:10px">For historical background on this period of history, see:
* [[Iranian Revolution]];
* [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]; and
* [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]].
</div>
1979 saw two major strategically important events: the overthrow of U.S. ally the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The [[Iranian Revolution]] precipitated the [[Iran hostage crisis]], which would last for the rest of Carter's presidency. Brzezinski anticipated the Soviet invasion, and, with the support of [[Saudi Arabia]], Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China, he created a strategy to undermine the Soviet presence. Using this atmosphere of insecurity, Brzezinski led the United States toward a new arms buildup and the development of the [[Rapid Deployment Forces]]—policies that are both more generally associated with Reagan's presidency now.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1979, the Soviets intervened in the [[Yemenite War of 1979|Second Yemenite War]]. The Soviet backing of [[South Yemen]] constituted a "smaller shock", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in shifting Carter's viewpoint on the Soviet Union to a more assertive one, a shift that finalized with the Soviet-Afghan War.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jimmy Carter and the Second Yemenite War: A Smaller Shock of 1979? {{!}} Wilson Center|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/jimmy-carter-and-second-yemenite-war-smaller-shock-1979|access-date=2021-11-21|website=www.wilsoncenter.org|language=en}}</ref>

Brzezinki constantly urged either the restoration of the Shah of Iran to power or a military takeover, whatever the short-term costs in terms of values.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vaïsse|first=Justin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1041140127|title=Zbigniew Brzezinski : America's grand strategist|date=2018|others=Catherine Porter|isbn=978-0-674-91950-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=1041140127}}</ref> 

On November 9, 1979, Brzezinski was woken at 3{{nbsp}}am by a phone call with a startling message: The Soviets had just launched 250 nuclear weapons at the United States. Minutes later, Brzezinski received another call: The early-warning system actually showed 2,000 missiles heading toward the United States.<ref name="3am1979">{{cite web |title=The 3 A.M.

An early warning training tape generating indications of a large-scale Soviet nuclear attack had somehow transferred to the actual early warning network, which triggered an all-too-real scramble.<ref name="3am1979" />

Brzezinski, acting under a lame duck Carter presidency—but encouraged that Solidarity in Poland had vindicated his style of engagement with Eastern Europe—took a hard-line stance against what seemed like an imminent Soviet invasion of Poland. He even made a midnight phone call to [[Pope John Paul II]] (whose visit to Poland in 1979 had foreshadowed the emergence of Solidarity) warning him in advance. The U.S. stance was a significant change from previous reactions to Soviet repression in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Brzezinski developed the [[Carter Doctrine]], which committed the U.S. to use military force in defense of the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name=WashPoObit /> In 1981 President Carter presented Brzezinski with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

President Carter chose Brzezinski for the position of National Security Adviser (NSA) because he wanted an assertive intellectual at his side to provide him with day-to-day advice and guidance on foreign policy decisions. Brzezinski would preside over a reorganized National Security Council (NSC) structure, fashioned to ensure that the NSA would be only one of many players in the foreign policy process.<ref>Justin Vaïsse, ''Zbigniew Brzezinski: America's Grand Strategist'' (2018) ch 6.</ref>

Initially, Carter reduced the NSC staff by one-half, and decreased the number of standing NSC committees from eight to two. All issues referred to the NSC were reviewed by one of the two new committees, either the Policy Review Committee (PRC) or the [[Special Coordinating Committee]] (SCC). The PRC focused on specific issues, and its chairmanship rotated. The SCC was always chaired by Brzezinski, a circumstance he had to negotiate with Carter to achieve. Carter believed that by making the NSA chairman of only one of the two committees, he would prevent the NSC from being the overwhelming influence on foreign policy decisions it had been under Kissinger's chairmanship during the Nixon administration.<ref>Vaïsse, ''Zbigniew Brzezinski'' (2018) ch 6.</ref>

The SCC was charged with considering issues that cut across several departments, including oversight of intelligence activities, arms control evaluation, and crisis management. Much of the SCC's time during the Carter years was spent on SALT issues. The Council held few formal meetings, convening only 10 times, compared with 125 meetings during the eight years of the Nixon and Ford administrations. Instead, Carter used frequent, informal meetings as a decision-making device—typically his Friday breakfasts—usually attended by the Vice President, the secretaries of State and Defense, Brzezinski, and the chief domestic adviser.<ref>Vaïsse, ''Zbigniew Brzezinski'' (2018) ch 6.</ref>

No agendas were prepared and no formal records were kept of these meetings, sometimes resulting in differing interpretations of the decisions actually agreed upon. Brzezinski was careful, in managing his own weekly luncheons with secretaries Vance and Brown in preparation for NSC discussions, to maintain a complete set of notes. Brzezinski also sent weekly reports to the President on major foreign policy undertakings and problems, with recommendations for courses of action. President Carter enjoyed these reports and frequently annotated them with his own views. Brzezinski and the NSC used these Presidential notes (159 of them) as the basis for NSC actions.<ref>Vaïsse, ''Zbigniew Brzezinski'' (2018) ch 6.</ref>

From the beginning, Brzezinski made sure that the new NSC institutional relationships would assure him a major voice in the shaping of foreign policy. While he knew that Carter would not want him to be another Kissinger, Brzezinski also felt confident that the President did not want Secretary of State Vance to become another Dulles and would want his own input on key foreign policy decisions. Brzezinski's power gradually expanded into the operational area during the Carter Presidency. He increasingly assumed the role of a Presidential emissary. In 1978, for example, Brzezinski traveled to Beijing to lay the groundwork for normalizing [[Sino-American relations|U.S.–PRC relations]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gerry Argyris Andrianopoulos|title=Kissinger and Brzezinski: The NSC and the Struggle for Control of US National Security Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPC-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA144|year=2016|publisher=Springer|pages=143–44|isbn=9781349217410}}</ref>

Like Kissinger before him, Brzezinski maintained his own personal relationship with Soviet Ambassador to the United States [[Anatoly Dobrynin]]. Brzezinski had NSC staffers monitor State Department cable traffic through the Situation Room and call back to the State Department if the President preferred to revise or take issue with outgoing State Department instructions. He also appointed his own press spokesman, and his frequent press briefings and appearances on television interview shows made him a prominent public figure, although perhaps not nearly as much as Kissinger had been under Nixon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gerry Argyris Andrianopoulos|title=Kissinger and Brzezinski: The NSC and the Struggle for Control of US National Security Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPC-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA144|year=2016|publisher=Springer|pages=143–44|isbn=9781349217410}}</ref>

The Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 significantly damaged the already tenuous relationship between Vance and Brzezinski. Vance felt that Brzezinski's linkage of SALT to other Soviet activities and the MX, together with the growing domestic criticisms in the United States of the SALT II Accord, convinced Brezhnev to decide on military intervention in Afghanistan. Brzezinski, however, later recounted that he advanced proposals to maintain Afghanistan's independence but was frustrated by the Department of State's opposition. An NSC [[working group]] on Afghanistan wrote several reports on the deteriorating situation in 1979, but Carter ignored them until the Soviet intervention destroyed his illusions. Only then did he decide to abandon SALT II ratification and pursue the anti-Soviet policies that Brzezinski proposed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian J. Auten|title=Carter's Conversion: The Hardening of American Defense Policy|publisher=University of Missouri Press|url=https://archive.org/details/cartersconversio00aute|url-access=registration|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/cartersconversio00aute/page/276 276]}}</ref>

The [[Iranian revolution]] was the last straw for the disintegrating relationship between Vance and Brzezinski. As the upheaval developed, the two advanced fundamentally different positions. Brzezinski wanted to control the revolution and increasingly suggested military action to prevent [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] from coming to power, while Vance wanted to come to terms with the new [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. As a consequence, Carter failed to develop a coherent approach to the Iranian situation. Vance's resignation following the unsuccessful mission to rescue the American hostages in March 1980, undertaken over his objections, was the final result of the deep disagreement between Brzezinski and Vance.<ref>Gary Sick, ''All fall down: America's fateful encounter with Iran'' (IB Tauris, 1985).</ref>

===Major policies===
During the 1960s, Brzezinski articulated the strategy of peaceful engagement for undermining the Soviet bloc, and while serving on the State Department Policy Planning Council, persuaded President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to adopt (in October 1966) peaceful engagement as U.S. strategy, placing [[détente]] ahead of [[German reunification]] and thus reversing prior U.S. priorities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, at the height of his political involvement, Brzezinski participated in the formation of the [[Trilateral Commission]] in order to more closely cement U.S.–Japanese–European relations. As the three most economically advanced sectors of the world, the people of the three regions could be brought together in cooperation that would give them a more cohesive stance against the communist world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dinoknudsen.dk/books-pamphlets|title=Books|website=dinoknudsen.dk}}</ref>

While serving in the White House, Brzezinski emphasized the centrality of human rights as a means of placing the Soviet Union on the ideological defensive. With Jimmy Carter in [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David]], he assisted in the attainment of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Zbigniew|last=Brzezinski|title=Strategy for Camp David|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1821105/1978-08-31c.pdf|work=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|date=August 31, 1978|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

He actively supported Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and the [[Afghan resistance]] to Soviet invasion, and provided covert support for national independence movements in the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He played a leading role in normalizing U.S.–PRC relations and in the development of joint strategic cooperation, cultivating a relationship with [[Deng Xiaoping]], for which he is thought very highly of in mainland China to this day.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the 1990s he formulated the strategic case for buttressing the independent statehood of [[Ukraine]], partially as a means to prevent a resurgence of the [[Russian Empire]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and to drive Russia toward integration with the West, promoting instead "geopolitical pluralism" in the space of the former Soviet Union. He developed "a plan for Europe" urging the expansion of NATO, making the case for the expansion of NATO to the [[Baltic states]].

He served as [[Bill Clinton]]'s emissary to [[Azerbaijan]] in order to promote the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]]. Subsequently, he became a member of Honorary Council of Advisors of [[U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce]] (USACC). Further, he led, together with [[Lane Kirkland]], the effort to increase the endowment for the U.S.-sponsored [[Polish-American Freedom Foundation]] from the proposed $112&nbsp;million to an eventual total of well over $200&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

President Carter was surprised by the invasion, as the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community during 1978 and 1979—reiterated as late as September 29, 1979—was that "Moscow would not intervene in force even if it appeared likely that the Khalq government was about to collapse." Indeed, Carter's diary entries from November 1979 until the Soviet invasion in late December contain only two short references to Afghanistan, and are instead preoccupied with the ongoing [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis in Iran]].<ref name="Riedel">{{cite book|author-link=Bruce Riedel|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=What We Won: America's Secret War in Afghanistan, 1979–1989|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8157-2595-4|pages=ix-xi, 21–22, 93, 98–99, 105}}</ref> In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name="Kepel" /> 

Moreover, the failure to accurately predict Soviet intentions caused American officials to reappraise the Soviet threat to both Iran and [[Pakistan]], although it is now known that those fears were overblown. For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Brzezinski that "if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate [[Balochistan|Baluchistan]]&nbsp; ... [thus] dismembering Pakistan and Iran" took on new urgency.<ref name="Blight" /><ref name="Riedel" /> 

These concerns were a major factor in the unrequited efforts of both the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter]] and [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administrations]] to improve relations with Iran, and resulted in massive aid to Pakistan's [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. Zia's ties with the U.S. had been strained during Carter's presidency due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in April 1979, but Carter told Brzezinski and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cyrus Vance]] as early as January 1979 that it was vital to "repair our relationships with Pakistan" in light of the [[Iranian Revolution|unrest in Iran]].<ref name="Riedel" /> 

One initiative Carter authorized to achieve this goal was a collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI); through the ISI, the CIA began providing some $500,000 worth of non-lethal assistance to the mujahideen on July 3, 1979—several months prior to the Soviet invasion. The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official [[Robert Gates]], "that a substantial U.S. covert aid program" might have "raise[d] the stakes" thereby causing "the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended".<ref name="Riedel" /><ref name="Gates">{{cite book|author-link=Robert Gates|last=Gates|first=Robert|title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4165-4336-7|pages=145–147}} When asked whether he expected that the revelations in his memoir (combined with an apocryphal quote attributed to Brzezinski) would inspire "a mind-bending number of conspiracy theories which adamantly—and wrongly—accuse the Carter Administration of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan", Gates replied: "No, because there was no basis in fact for an allegation the administration tried to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan militarily."

In the aftermath of the invasion, Carter was determined to respond vigorously to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid to Pakistan, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense.<ref name="Riedel" /><ref name="Gates" /> The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated [[Operation Cyclone|a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI]] and secured a pledge from [[Saudi Arabia]] to match U.S. funding for this purpose. U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, [[Ronald Reagan]], at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3&nbsp;billion. The Soviets were unable to quell the insurgency and [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrew from Afghanistan]] in 1989, precipitating the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself.<ref name="Riedel" /> 

However, the decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to [[Karachi]] were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon "became one of the most violent cities in the world". Pakistan also controlled which rebels received assistance: Of the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|seven mujahideen groups]] supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs—and these fundamentalists received most of the funding.<ref name="Kepel" /> Years later, in a 1997 [[CNN]]/[[National Security Archive]] interview, Brzezinski detailed the strategy taken by the Carter administration against the Soviets in 1979:

<blockquote>We immediately launched a twofold process when we heard that the Soviets had entered Afghanistan. The first involved direct reactions and sanctions focused on the Soviet Union, and both the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] prepared long lists of sanctions to be adopted, of steps to be taken to increase the international costs to the Soviet Union of their actions. And the second course of action led to my going to Pakistan a month or so after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for the purpose of coordinating with the Pakistanis a joint response, the purpose of which would be to make the Soviets bleed for as much and as long as is possible; and we engaged in that effort in a collaborative sense with the Saudis, the [[Egypt]]ians, the [[United Kingdom|British]], the [[China|Chinese]], and we started providing weapons to the Mujaheddin, from various sources again—for example, some Soviet arms from the Egyptians and the Chinese. We even got Soviet arms from the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] communist government, since it was obviously susceptible to material incentives; and at some point we started buying arms for the Mujaheddin from the Soviet army in Afghanistan, because that army was increasingly corrupt.<ref name="gwu.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html |title=Interview with Dr Zbigniew Brzezinski |date= June 13, 1997 |access-date=May 25, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829032721/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html |archive-date=August 29, 2000 }}</ref></blockquote>

In November 1979, [[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] students stormed the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran]] and took American diplomats hostage. Brzezinski argued against Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]]'s proposed diplomatic solutions to the [[Iran hostage crisis]], insisting they "would deliver Iran to the Soviets."<ref name=NYTobit /> Vance, struggling with [[gout]], went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend.<ref name=NYTmag>{{cite news|last1=Douglas Brinkley|title=The Lives They Lived; Out of the Loop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-out-of-the-loop.html|access-date=May 3, 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=December 29, 2002|author1-link=Douglas Brinkley}}</ref>

====China====

Shortly after taking office in 1977, President Carter again reaffirmed the United States' position of upholding the [[Shanghai Communiqué]]. In May 1978, Brzezinski overcame concerns from the State Department and traveled to Beijing, where he began talks that seven months later led to full diplomatic relations.<ref name=NYTobit /> The United States and People's Republic of China announced on December 15, 1978, that the two governments would establish diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979. This required that the United States sever relations with the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]]. Consolidating U.S. gains in befriending Communist China was a major priority stressed by Brzezinski during his time as National Security Advisor. However, Brzezinski "denied [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|reports]] that he encouraged China to support the genocidal dictator [[Pol Pot]] in [[Cambodia]], because Pol Pot's [[Khmer Rouge]] were the enemies of communist Vietnam."<ref name="Guardianobit">{{cite web|last=Hodgson|first=Godfrey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/zbigniew-brzezinski-obituary|title=Zbigniew Brzezinski obituary|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 28, 2017|access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref>

The most important strategic aspect of the new U.S.–Chinese relationship was in its effect on the Cold War. China was no longer considered part of a larger Sino-Soviet bloc but instead a third pole of power due to the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], helping the United States against the Soviet Union.<ref name="hoov_China-US">{{Cite web |title=China-US Relations In The Eyes Of The Chinese Communist Party: An Insider's Perspective |author=Cai Xia |work=Hoover Institution |date= |access-date=28 July 2021 |url= https://www.hoover.org/research/china-us-relations-eyes-chinese-communist-party-insiders-perspective-zhong-gong-yan-zhong}}</ref>

In the [[Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations]] dated January 1, 1979, the United States transferred diplomatic recognition from [[Taipei]] to Beijing. The United States reiterated the Shanghai Communiqué's acknowledgment of the PRC position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China; Beijing acknowledged that the United States would continue to carry on commercial, cultural, and other unofficial contacts with Taiwan. The [[Taiwan Relations Act]] made the necessary changes in [[U.S. law]] to permit unofficial relations with Taiwan to continue.

In addition the severing relations with the Republic of China, the Carter Administration also agreed to unilaterally pull out of the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]], withdraw U.S. military personnel from Taiwan, and gradually reduce arms sales to the Republic of China. There was widespread opposition in [[United States Congress|Congress]], notably from Republicans, due to the Republic of China's status as an [[anti-Communist]] ally in the Cold War. In ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', [[Barry Goldwater]] made a failed attempt to stop Carter from terminating the mutual defense treaty.

[[File:Carter, Brzezinski and Vance at Camp David, 1977.jpg|thumb|216px|U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] with Brzezinski and [[Cyrus Vance]] at [[Camp David]] in 1977]]
PRC Vice Premier [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s January 1979 visit to Washington, D.C., initiated a series of high-level exchanges, which continued until the [[Tiananmen Square massacre]], when they were briefly interrupted. This resulted in many bilateral agreements, especially in the fields of scientific, technological, and cultural interchange and trade relations. Since early 1979, the United States and the PRC have initiated hundreds of joint research projects and cooperative programs under the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, the largest bilateral program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pages.uoregon.edu/chinaus/publications/China-US%20relationship%20in%20Science%20and%20Technology.pdf|title=The China-U.S. Relationship in Science and Technology|last=Xiaoming|first=Jin|date=2003|website=University of Oregon}}</ref>

On March 1, 1979, the United States and People's Republic of China formally established embassies in Beijing and Washington. During 1979, outstanding private claims were resolved, and a bilateral trade agreement was concluded. U.S. Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] reciprocated Vice Premier Deng's visit with an August 1979 trip to China. This visit led to agreements in September 1980 on maritime affairs, civil aviation links, and textile matters, as well as a bilateral consular convention.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

As a consequence of high-level and working-level contacts initiated in 1980, U.S. dialogue with China broadened to cover a wide range of issues, including global and regional strategic problems, political-military questions—including [[arms control]], UN and other multilateral organization affairs, and international [[narcotics]] matters.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Poland, the Pope, and Solidarity===

The New York Sun, April 4, 2005, Stephen Miller

Later in 1979 the Pope John Paul II traveled to Poland, where he was received rapturously by crowds that totaled a third of his homeland's population. His presence became a rallying point for the nation as its Communist regime seemed to be weakening in the face of popular dissent. The Kremlin was apoplectic, and a KGB inquiry into Wojtyla's election supposedly concluded that it was a German-American plot led by President Carter's national security adviser, the Polish-born Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Cardinal John Krol of Philadelphia.

In the wake of the Pope's departure, Poland's Solidarity movement arose, with the moral (and some said financial) support of the papacy. When Lech Walesa signed the agreement with the Polish government that legalised Solidarity in 1980, it was with a souvenir pen from the Pope's 1979 visit. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Edmonton Journal (Alberta), April 3, 2005, Don Butler
Carter's Polish-born security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski had met Karol Wojtyla in 1976 when he was still an archbishop. The two corresponded regularly thereafter.

In 1980 Brzezinski began a dialogue with Czech bishop Jozef Tomko advising him of American financial and organisational support for the budding Solidarity movement. They discussed how the United States and the Vatican could work together to promote human rights in Poland without inciting a crackdown by authorities. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Later that year Brzezinski phoned the pontiff to warn that the Soviets were preparing to invade Poland. According to Bernstein and Politi, the Pope quickly agreed to instruct his bishops to pressure governments in Western Europe to threaten the Soviets with isolation if they intervened. The Soviets later retreated. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Thus began a pattern of co-operation and intelligence-sharing between Washington and the Vatican that would continue throughout the pivotal decade of the 1980s, when the Americans, according to the authors of His Holiness, covertly spent more than $50&nbsp;million US supporting Solidarity. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Agence France Presse – English, April 2, 2005
For the popular Komsomolskaya Pravda daily, "Several US politicians actively pushed (Karol) Wojtyla (John Paul II) forward to the Holy See, not least the famous anti-communist and Russophobe, (former US national security adviser) Zbignew Brzezinski. He thought "his man" in the Vatican would be well worth hundreds of divisions in the West's confrontation with the Soviet Bloc. And he was not wrong."-->

Presidential Directive 18 on U.S. National Security, signed early in Carter's term, signaled a fundamental reassessment of the value of [[détente]], and set the United States on a course to quietly end Kissinger's strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/pddirectives/pd18.pdf |title=Unclassified Memorandum from National Security Council |publisher=Jimmycarterlibrary.org |date=August 27, 1977 |access-date=December 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721044458/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/pddirectives/pd18.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==After power==
Brzezinski left office concerned about the internal division within the Democratic party, arguing that the [[dovish]] McGovernite wing would send the Democrats into permanent minority. [[Ronald Reagan]] invited him to stay on as his National Security Adviser, but Brzezinski declined, feeling that the new president needed a fresh perspective on which to build his foreign policy.<ref>{{cite news|date=May 29, 2017|title=Reagan poprosił Brzezińskiego, by został także jego doradcą|publisher=TVN24.pl|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-ze-swiata,2/john-hamre-reagan-chcial-by-brzezinski-zostal-jego-doradca,743913.html|access-date=June 1, 2017}}</ref> He had mixed relations with the [[Reagan administration]]. On the one hand, he supported it as an alternative to the Democrats' [[pacifism]]. On the other hand, he also criticized it as seeing foreign policy in overly black-and-white terms.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

By the 1980s, Brzezinski argued that the general crisis of the Soviet Union foreshadowed communism's end.

He remained involved in Polish affairs, critical of the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]] in 1981, and more so of the Western European acquiescence to its imposition in the name of stability. Brzezinski briefed U.S. vice-president [[George H. W. Bush]] before his 1987 trip to Poland that aided in the revival of the Solidarity movement.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1985, under the Reagan administration, Brzezinski served as a member of the President's [[Chemical warfare|Chemical Warfare]] Commission. From 1987 to 1988, he worked on the [[U.S. National Security Council]]–[[U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Department]] Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy. From 1987 to 1989 he also served on the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1988, Brzezinski was co-chairman of the Bush National Security Advisory Task Force, endorsing Bush for president, and breaking with the Democratic party. Brzezinski published ''The Grand Failure'' the same year, predicting the failure of Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms, and the collapse of the Soviet Union in a few more decades. He said there were five possibilities for the Soviet Union: successful pluralization, protracted crisis, renewed stagnation, coup (by the [[KGB]] or [[Soviet military]]), or the explicit collapse of the Communist regime. He called collapse "at this stage a much more remote possibility" than protracted crisis. 

He also predicted that the chance of some form of communism existing in the Soviet Union in 2017 was a little more than 50% and that when the end did come it would be "most likely turbulent". In the event, the Soviet system collapsed totally in 1991 following Moscow's crackdown on [[Lithuania]]'s attempt to declare independence, the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] of the late 1980s, and scattered bloodshed in other republics. This was a less violent outcome than Brzezinski and other observers anticipated.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1989, the Communists failed to mobilize support in Poland, and Solidarity swept the general elections. Later the same year, Brzezinski toured Russia and visited a memorial to the [[Katyn Massacre]]. This served as an opportunity for him to ask the [[Soviet government]] to acknowledge the truth about the event, for which he received a standing ovation in the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]]. Ten days later, the [[Berlin Wall#The Fall of the Wall|Berlin Wall fell]], and Soviet-supported governments in Eastern Europe began to totter. [[Strobe Talbott]], one of Brzezinski's long-time critics, conducted an interview with him for ''TIME'' magazine entitled ''Vindication of a Hardliner''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Talbott|first=Strobe|author-link=Strobe Talbott|last2=Zintl|first2=Robert|date=1989-12-18|title=Vindications of a hardliner|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,959391,00.html|url-status=live|website=Time}}</ref>

In 1990, Brzezinski warned against post–Cold War euphoria. He publicly opposed the [[Gulf War]],{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} arguing that the United States would squander the international goodwill it had accumulated by defeating the Soviet Union, and that it could trigger wide resentment throughout the [[Arab world]]. He expanded upon these views in his 1992 work ''Out of Control''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Brzezinski was prominently critical of the [[Clinton administration]]'s hesitation to intervene against the [[Army of Republika Srpska|Serb forces]] in the [[Bosnian war]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120715143345/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n32_v11/ai_17210365/ Brzezinski on isolation: former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brezinski warns of the failures of Clinton foreign policy], Insight on the News, August 21, 1995</ref> He also began to speak out against Russia's [[First Chechen War]], forming the [[American Committee for Peace in Chechnya]]. Wary of a move toward the reinvigoration of Russian power, Brzezinski negatively viewed the succession of former KGB agent [[Vladimir Putin]] after [[Boris Yeltsin]]. In this vein, he became one of the foremost advocates of [[NATO expansion]]. He wrote in 1998 that "Without [[Ukraine]], Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire."<ref>"[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-27/the-new-great-game-why-ukraine-matters-to-so-many-other-nations The New Great Game: Why Ukraine Matters to So Many Other Nations]". Bloomberg. February 27, 2014.</ref> He later came out in support of the [[1999 NATO bombing of Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo war]].<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/4378 A conversation about Kosovo with Zbigniew Brzezinski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008003709/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/4378|date=October 8, 2012}} Charlie Rose, March 25, 1999</ref>

After his role as National Security Adviser came to a close, Brzezinski returned to teaching but remained an influential voice in international relations. Polish politician [[Radek Sikorski]] wrote that to Poles, Brzezinski was considered "our statesman" and his was one of the most revered voices in Poland: "During the decades when Poland was stuck against her will behind the Iron Curtain, he and the [[Pope John Paul II|Polish pope]] were the two most important voices for a free Poland abroad. After liberation, he acted as an adviser and champion of the new democracies on their way to rejoining Western institutions."<ref name="sikorski">{{cite news|last1=Sikorski|first1=Radek|author-link=Radosław Sikorski|title=For Poles, Zbigniew Brzezinski was our American statesman|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/05/27/for-poles-zbigniew-brzezinski-was-our-american-statesman/|access-date=June 1, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=May 27, 2017}}</ref>

Though he rose to national prominence as a member of the Carter administration, Brzezinski avoided partisan politics and sometimes later voted Republican. In 1988, he endorsed [[George H. W. Bush]] for president over Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]].<ref name="ft">{{cite news|last1=Luce|first1=Edward|title=Lunch with the FT: Zbigniew Brzezinski|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4d03c5f6-3ac1-11e1-a756-00144feabdc0|access-date=June 1, 2017|work=Financial Times|date=January 13, 2012}}</ref>

Brzezinski argued against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and was outspoken in the then-unpopular opinion that the invasion would be a mistake. As recalled by [[David Ignatius]], "Brzezinski paid a cost in the insular, self-reinforcing world of Washington foreign policy opinion, until it became clear to nearly everyone that he (joined in this Iraq War opposition by [[Brent Scowcroft|Scowcroft]]) had been right."<ref name="wapo-ignatius">{{cite news|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|author-link=David Ignatius|title=Zbigniew Brzezinski was an intrepid advocate of the 'liberal international order'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/zbigniew-brzezinski-was-an-intrepid-advocate-of-the-liberal-international-order/2017/05/29/609154d2-4487-11e7-a196-a1bb629f64cb_story.html|access-date=June 1, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> He later called President [[George W. Bush]]'s foreign policy "catastrophic."<ref name=NYTobit /> 

Brzezinski was a leading critic of the [[George W. Bush Administration]]'s conduct of the [[War on Terror]]. In 2004, Brzezinski wrote ''The Choice'', which expanded upon his earlier work,''[[The Grand Chessboard]]'' (1997), and sharply criticized [[George W. Bush]]'s foreign policy. In 2007, in a column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Brzezinski excoriated the Bush administration, arguing that their post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] actions had damaged the reputation of the United States "infinitely greater than any wild dreams entertained by the fanatical perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks" and destroyed any chance of uniting the world to defeat extremism and terrorism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brzezinski|first1=Zbigniew|title=Terrorized by 'War on Terror'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301613.html|access-date=June 1, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> He later stated that he had "visceral contempt" for British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], who supported Bush's actions in Iraq.<ref name="ft"/> In September 2007, he defended the book ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'' by [[John Mearsheimer]].<ref name=YnetSept2007>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3449954,00.html Obama advisor raises concerns], Ynet, September 15, 2007.</ref>

In August 2007, Brzezinski endorsed Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]]. He stated that Obama "recognizes that the challenge is a new face, a new sense of direction, a new definition of America's role in the world"<ref>Alec MacGillis, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/24/AR2007082402127.html Brzezinski Backs Obama], Washington Post, August 25, 2007.</ref> and that "What makes Obama attractive to me is that he understands that we live in a very different world where we have to relate to a variety of cultures and people."<ref>Eric Walberg, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/907/in3.htm The real power behind the throne-to-be] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910212611/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/907/in3.htm|date=September 10, 2009}}, ''Al-Ahram'', July 24–30, 2008.</ref> In September 2007 during a speech on the Iraq war, Obama introduced Brzezinski as "one of our most outstanding thinkers," but some pro-Israel commentators questioned his criticism of the [[Israel lobby in the United States]].<ref name=YnetSept2007 />

They have to fly over our airspace in Iraq.

On October 1, 2009, Brzezinski delivered the [[Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations]] at [[Old Dominion University]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Tayla |title=Thursday, September 24 |url=http://www.hearsay.org/2009/09/default.aspx |website=Hearsay.org |access-date=August 14, 2019}}</ref> In 2011, Brzezinski supported the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO intervention]] against the forces of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], calling non-intervention "morally dubious" and "politically questionable".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world/jan-june11/overview_03-21.html|title=PBS: Turmoil in Arab World: Deepening Divisions or Turning a New Page?}}</ref>

In early 2012, Brzezinski expressed disappointment and said he was confused by some of Obama's actions, such as the decision to send 2,500 U.S. troops to Australia, but supported him for re-election.<ref name="ft" />

[[File:MSC 2014 Brzezinski Kleinschmidt MSC2014.jpg|thumb|Brzezinski at the [[Munich Security Conference]], 2014]]
On March 3, 2014, between the February 22 ousting of [[Ukraine]] President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the March 16, [[2014 Crimean status referendum|Crimean referendum]], Brzezinski authored an [[op-ed]] piece for ''The Washington Post'' entitled "What is to be done?

Rather, he suggested that [[NATO]] should be put on high alert and recommended "to avert miscalculations". He explicitly stated that reassurances be given to "Russia that it is not seeking to draw Ukraine into NATO."<ref name=brzukr />

According to Ignatius and Sikorski, Brzezinski was "deeply troubled" by the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president of the United States and worried over the future. Two days after the election, on November 10, 2016, Brzezinski warned of "coming turmoil in the nation and the world" in a brief speech after he was awarded the [[Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service|Medal for Distinguished Public Service]] from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].<ref name="wapo-ignatius" /> On May 4, 2017, he sent out his final Tweet, saying, "Sophisticated US leadership is the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of a stable world order.

==Personal life==
Brzezinski was married to Czech-American sculptor [[Emilie Benes Brzezinski|Emilie Benes]] (grand-niece of the second Czechoslovak president, [[Edvard Beneš]]), with whom he had three children. His younger son, [[Mark Brzezinski]] (b. 1965), is a lawyer who served on President Clinton's National Security Council as an expert on Russia and Southeastern Europe, and served as the [[U.S. ambassador to Sweden]] (2011–2015).
