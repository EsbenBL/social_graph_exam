'''Friedrich Pollock''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ə|k}}; {{IPA-de|ˈpɔlɔk|lang}}; 22 May 1894 – 16 December 1970) was a [[Germany|German]] [[social scientist]] and [[philosopher]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Institute for Social Research]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and a member of the [[Frankfurt School]] of neo-Marxist theory.

== Life ==
Friedrich Pollock was born to a leather factory owner in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. Pollock's Jewish-born father turned away from [[Judaism]], and raised his son accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |first=Rolf |last=Wiggershaus |title=The Frankfurt School: Its History, Theories, and Political Significance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZMjjW4uOWIC&pg=PA42 |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-73113-3 |pages=42}}</ref> Pollock was educated in finance 1911 to 1915. During this time he met [[Max Horkheimer]], with whom he became a lifelong friend. He then studied [[Economics|economy]], [[sociology]] and philosophy in [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he wrote his thesis on [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] [[labor theory of value]] and received his doctorate in 1923.

The [[Institute for Social Research]] was founded in 1923 by Pollock and fellow Marxist [[Felix Weil]], who funded the group. Weil was inspired to found the institute after the success of his week-long conference, the ''Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche'' ([[First Marxist Workweek]]), in 1923.<ref name="Marxist Internet Archive">{{cite web |title=The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory |publisher=Marxist Internet Archive |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/frankfurt-school/index.htm |access-date=12 September 2009}}</ref> Weil's goal was to bring together different schools of Marxism, and included [[György Lukács]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Karl August Wittfogel]], and Friedrich Pollock.

In 1927/1928 Pollock traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] in honor of the tenth anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. His research there led to his treatise: ''Attempts at Planned Economy in the Soviet Union 1917–1927.''  Thereafter he took a post as lecturer at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] and he replaced the ill [[Carl Grünberg]] as Director of the institute from 1928–1930.

Prior to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] seizure of power, Pollock had used his contacts in the [[International Labour Organization]] to establish a [[Geneva]] branch of the Institute.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Helmut |last=Dubiel |year=1981 |title=Origins of Critical Theory: An Interview with Leo Löwenthal |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |volume=1981 |issue=49 |pages=142–3 |doi=10.3817/0981049141 |s2cid=143888896 |url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/1981/49/141.full.pdf+html}}</ref> In 1933, Pollock and Horkheimer moved into exile, first in Geneva, then to [[London]], [[Paris]], and finally [[New York City]].

In 1950, he was finally able to return to Frankfurt, taking part in the reestablishment of the Institute, again taking the role of director. From 1951 to 1958 he was professor of economics and sociology at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]].

In 1959, Pollock and Horkheimer moved to [[Montagnola]], [[Ticino]], [[Switzerland]], although Pollock held a position as professor Emeritus at the University of Frankfurt until 1963. He died in Montagnola in 1970.
