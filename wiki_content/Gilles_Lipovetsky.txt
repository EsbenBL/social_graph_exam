'''Gilles Lipovetsky''' (born September 24, 1944) is a French [[philosopher]], writer, and [[sociologist]], professor at [[Stendhal University]] in [[Grenoble]], [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]], France.

==Life and career==
Lipovetsky was born in Millau in 1944. He studied [[philosophy]] at University of Grenoble, and participated in the [[May 1968 events in France|1968 student uprising in Paris]] to change the French educational model. However he criticizes the model that came from that as producing alienated individuals with fragile personalities prone to emotional disorder due to [[hedonism]] and immediate gratification.<ref name=defensor>{{cite news   |title= Gilles Lipovetsky, defensor del capitalismo  |publisher=El Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=August 31, 2009 |language=es |url=http://www.informador.com.mx/economia/2009/133647/6/gilles-lipovetsky-defensor-del-capitalismo.htm |access-date=August 20, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=presente>{{cite journal |author=Raul Corral Quintero |title= Gilles Lipovetsky: Una sociología del presente pos(hiper)moderno |journal=Casa del Tiempo |publisher=Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana |date=October–November 2007 |volume=IV |issue=4 pages 41–46 |language=es |url=http://www.difusioncultural.uam.mx/casadeltiempo/01_oct_nov_2007/casa_del_tiempo_eIV_num01_41_46.pdf|access-date=August 20, 2013 }}</ref>

He began his academic career teaching classes with his alma mater. With the success of his first book, he has become well known in many parts of the world and has become one of the most important French intellectuals of the latter 20th century.<ref name=exceso>{{cite news   |title= El exceso domina la sociedad actual; se perdieron los límites   |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City  |date=March 28, 2012 |page=9  |language=es |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2012/03/28/espectaculos/a09n1esp|access-date=August 20, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=vivimos>{{cite news|author=Jesus Alejo |title=Gilles Lipovetsky: vivimos un tiempo en que la cultura no tiene influencia |newspaper=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=March 23, 2012 |language=es |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/69508a81215c1944961855c574ab9ef5 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130827003353/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/69508a81215c1944961855c574ab9ef5 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 27, 2013 |access-date=August 20, 2013 }}</ref>

Along with tenure, he has received two honorary doctorates from the [[Université de Sherbrooke]] in Québec (Canada) and from the [[New Bulgarian University]] in [[Sofia]], membership in the Conseil d'analyse de la société of the French government, knighthood in the [[Legion of Honor]], membership in the National Council of Programs and is a consultant with the Association of Management Progress.<ref name=presente/><ref name=volvera>{{cite news |title= Gilles Lipovetsky volverá a México |newspaper=El Universal |date=August 14, 2013 |language=es |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/2013/giles-lipovetsky-visita-mexico-942572.html |access-date=August 20, 2013 }}</ref> In 2015, 2016 and 2017, he was a member of the Prix Versailles judges panel.<ref>[http://www.prix-versailles.com/world-jury-2017 Prix Versailles website]</ref>

==Ideas ==
Lipovetsky began his philosophical career as a [[Marxist]], similar to many others in the 1960s, affiliated with the "[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]" which demanded the world not to transform it but rather to "swallow it."<ref name=presente/><ref name=sauret>{{cite journal |author=Alberto Sauret |title=Gilles Lipovetsky, el Imperio de lo efímero |publisher=Instituto Tecnologico Autonoma de Mexico |language=es |url=http://biblioteca.itam.mx/estudios/estudio/letras24/rese3/sec_1.html |access-date=August 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220014116/http://biblioteca.itam.mx/estudios/estudio/letras24/rese3/sec_1.html |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, since then, his philosophy has changed significantly, including the acceptance of [[capitalism]] as "the only legitimate economic model."<ref name=defensor/> When questioned about his change in stance from his Marxist beginning he replies "Only idiots never change opinion."<ref name=sauret/>

Lipovetsky's work focuses on the modern world from the latter 20th century to the present. His has divided this time period into three periods:  "Marxist self criticism" (1965-1983), post- modern (1983-1991) and the hyper modern period from 1991 on. This began with his 1983 book, which declared the world to be [[post-modern]], characterized by extreme [[individualism]] and the dissolution of politics based on political parties, turning its back on a strong sense of social duty on which [[democracy]] and [[socialism]] depend. However, by the end of the 2000s, he proposed that this term had become obsolete and unable to describe the world past 1991. He then proposed "hyper-modern," similar to post-modern but with a superlative and unstoppable meaning, focusing on new technologies, markets, and global culture.<ref name=presente/><ref name=volvera/>

From his 1983 book which brought him to prominence, Lipovetsky has continued to write on topics such as [[modernity]], [[globalization]], [[consumerism]], [[modern culture]], [[market (economics)|markets]], [[feminism]], [[fashion]], and [[Media (communication)|media]], but they have the common thread of individualism.<ref name=exceso/> He defines individualism as the desire to break with tradition and the past and to look towards the future and our own pleasure.<ref name=cronica>{{cite web|author=Jesus Alejo |title=Visitará Gilles Lipovetsky el Tecnológico de Monterrey |work=Cronica Intercampus |publisher=Tec de Monterrey |location=Mexico |volume=IV |issue=51 |date=August 10, 2007 |language=es |url=http://www.itesm.mx/cronicaintercampus/no_51/academica.html |access-date=August 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228030944/http://www.itesm.mx/cronicaintercampus/no_51/academica.html |archive-date=December 28, 2010 }}</ref> In 1987 he wrote ''L'Empire de l'éphémère : la mode et son destin dans les sociétés modernes'' continuing the argument of the 1983 work focusing on fashion as a reflection of individualism and hyper [[consumerism]]. It also indicates the desire to be young forever and that only the here-and-now exists.<ref name=presente/> In 1992 he published ''Le Crépuscule du devoir''. In this work he states that the vision of a [[secular]] world started with [[Martin Luther]]'s revolt against the [[Catholic Church]], and developed by thinkers such as [[René Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] [beware: this is not possible, since Thomas Aquinas lived more than two centuries before Martin Luther; there must be a misunderstanding], leading to the idea that one purpose of God is to define and protect individual rights. In ''La Troisième femme'' in 1997 he argues the idea that the [[women's liberation movement]] is strongly connected to hyper consumerism as women are the main customers of luxury goods.<ref name=presente/> In ''Métamorphoses de la culture libérale – Éthique, médias, entreprise'' in 2002, he examines the paradoxes of hyper modern democracies, with emphasis both on the individual, regionalization vs. globalization and the collective and a society that is both open and closed, concluding that they are interdependent. The 2003 book ''Le luxe éternel'' examines the concept of luxury over human history. ''Le bonheur paradoxal. Essai sur la société d'hyperconsommation'' in 2006 examines the multiplication and globalization of major brands and the connection between fashion and luxury which is the basis of hyper-consumerism. In ''La société de déception''  (2006) he analyzes the concept of disappointment following on the work of Jacques Lacan that desire creates a vacuum and can never be filled. In ''L'écran global. Culture-médias et cinéma à l'âge hypermoderne''  (2007) he analyses a "second modern revolution" declaring the end of post modernism, arguing that paradoxes are multiplying due to the complexity of modern life.<ref name=presente/> His 2013 book, ''L'esthétisation du monde : vivre à l'âge du capitalisme artiste'' focuses on capitalism and its relationship to art, especially the cinema.<ref name=volvera/><ref name=pantalla>{{cite web |title=Reflexionarán sobre la pantalla global con Gilles Lipovetsky |publisher=Tec de Monterrey |language=es |url=http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/snc/portal+informativo/por+tema/cultura/pantallaglobalgilleslipovetsky030713 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130820235717/http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/snc/portal+informativo/por+tema/cultura/pantallaglobalgilleslipovetsky030713 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 20, 2013 |access-date=August 20, 2013 }}</ref>

Lipovetsky has made provocative statements on modern life and elements related to it, which have been often at odds with intellectual trends of the last decades. He has compared fashion with democracy as unstable, ephemeral and superficial, but states it as a positive and more workable then a more [[systems theory|interdependent society]].<ref name=presente/><ref name=empire>{{cite journal   |author=Ellis Cashmore |title= Free style -- The Empire of Fashion by Gilles Lipovetsky and translated by Catherine Porter |publisher=New Statesman & Society|volume=8 |issue=336   |date=January 20, 1995 |page=37 |author-link= Ellis Cashmore }}</ref> He states that the focus of modern life is the new, which then quickly becomes old and we look for something else, leading to his notion of "hyper" as this need for new becomes faster in the age of [[Internet]] and [[social media]], which also breaks down traditional institutions such as nation and family.<ref name=exceso/> Even "culture" succumbs to this, according to him, as people go to museums more as tourists rather than for education.<ref name=vivimos/> The need for new triggers hyper-consumerism, with people trying to keep up with trends, and creating frustration among the poorer who cannot keep up.<ref name=marcas>{{cite news   |title= Entrevista / Gilles Lipovetsky / No sólo de marcas vive el hombre  |publisher=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 5, 2008 |page=5 |language=es }}</ref> However, he makes a distinction between hyper-consumerism and consumerism. He does not criticize the latter, which he says has had positives in rising living standards. He believes that consumption should be [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|a means to an end, not an end in itself]] and believes that concerns such as [[ecology]] are not incompatible with capitalism.<ref name=defensor/><ref name=marcas/>

Lipovetsky does not have a well-defined style of presentation, varying among manners of speaking similar to that of psychologist or sociologist as well as philosopher often gesturing emphatically. His methodology varies as well, often dealing in [[paradoxes]]. His approach to issues is almost nonexistent [[epistemologically]]. There is also strong influence in his writing from [[French literature]] although he does not write fiction.<ref name=defensor/><ref name=presente/>
