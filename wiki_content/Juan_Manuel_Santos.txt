'''Juan Manuel Santos Calderón''' {{post-nominals|list=[[Order of Prince Henry|GColIH]] [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] [[Order of Liberty|GColL]] [[Order of Boyaca|ODB]]}} ({{IPA-es|ˈxwam maˈnwel ˈsantos kaldeˈɾon|lang}}; born 10 August 1951) is a [[Colombia]]n [[politician]] who was the [[President of Colombia]] from 2010 to 2018. He was the sole recipient of the [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize]].

An [[economist]] by profession and a [[journalist]] by trade, Santos is a member of the wealthy and influential Santos family, who from 1913 to 2007 were the [[majority shareholder]]s of the [[newspaper]] ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' until its sale to [[Planeta DeAgostini]] in 2007. He was a cadet at the [[Colombian Navy|Navy Academy]] in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Shortly after graduating from the [[University of Kansas]], he joined the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]] as an economic advisor and delegate to the [[International Coffee Organization]] in London, where he also attended the [[London School of Economics]]. In 1981, he was appointed deputy director of ''El Tiempo'' newspaper, becoming its director two years later. Santos earned a mid-career/master's in public administration in 1981 from [[Harvard Kennedy School]] (HKS) and was a 1988 [[Nieman Fellowship|Nieman Fellow]] for his award-winning work as a columnist and reporter. Santos was a Fulbright visiting fellow at [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy|Fletcher]] at [[Tufts University]] in 1981. Santos has been a member of the Washington-based think tank the [[Inter-American Dialogue]] since 1990, and he previously served as co-chair of the Board of Directors. Santos was president of the Freedom of Expression Commission for the Inter American Press Association.

In 1991, he was appointed by President [[César Gaviria Trujillo]] as Colombia's first [[Minister of Foreign Trade of Colombia|Minister of Foreign Trade]]. Santos worked in expanding international trade with Colombia, and worked in creating various agencies for this purpose including: [[Proexport]], [[Bancoldex]] and [[Fiducoldex]]. In 2000, he was appointed by President [[Andrés Pastrana Arango]] as the 64th [[Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia|Minister of Finance and Public Credit]].<ref name="En Sus Puestos">{{cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1275966 |title=En Sus Puestos |date=18 July 2000 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |issn=0121-9987 |oclc=28894254 |location=Bogotá |access-date=28 May 2014 |language=es }}</ref>

Santos rose to prominence during the Administration of President [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]]. In 2005, he co-founded and led the [[Social Party of National Unity]] (Party of the U), a [[liberal-conservative]] [[party coalition]] that backed the policies of President Uribe, successfully supporting his attempt to seek a Constitutional reform to be able to run for a second term. In 2006, after Uribe's re-election, when the Party of the U won a majority of seats in the two chambers of [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]], Santos was appointed as [[Ministry of National Defense (Colombia)|Minister of National Defence]], and continued defending the security policies of President Uribe, taking a strong and forceful stance against [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] and the [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|other guerrilla groups]] operating in Colombia. Santos also created the Good Government Foundation.

In 2010, Santos won the [[2010 Colombian presidential election|presidential election]] as the protégé of his predecessor [[Álvaro Uribe|Álvaro Uribe Vélez]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/america/2010/05/31/colombia/1275269910.html|title=Santos: 'Presidente Uribe, éste es su triunfo' {{!}} Colombia {{!}} elmundo.es|last=Internet|first=Unidad Editorial|website=El Mundo|location=Spain|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayNWDwAAQBAJ&q=Quiero+dar+las+gracias+al+presidente+%C3%81lvaro+Uribe+V%C3%A9lez+santos&pg=PT35|title=El nobel|last=Dávila|first=Vicky|date=2018-04-01|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Colombia|isbn=9789585650534|language=es}}</ref> However, some months after Santos' possession, Uribe became his strongest opponent, who also founded, three years later, the opposition party [[Democratic Center (Colombia)|Democratic Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.elcolombiano.com/colombia/politica/las-peleas-de-juan-manuel-santos-y-alvaro-uribe-en-los-ultimos-6-anos-FY5111214|title=Las peleas que divorciaron a Uribe y Santos|last=Restrepo|first=Estefanía Carvajal|work=elcolombiano.com|access-date=2018-10-26|language=es-ES}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2012/04/07/santos-v-uribe|title=Santos v Uribe|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}</ref> This rivalry determined both Santos' unpopularity and his near-missed defeat during the [[2014 Colombian presidential election|presidential election in 2014]] before Uribe's protégé [[Óscar Iván Zuluaga|Oscar Iván Zuluaga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/razones-que-explican-la-impopularidad-de-juan-manuel-santos/578012|title=¿Por qué Santos fue tan impopular?|last=Semana|website=Razones que explican la impopularidad de Juan Manuel Santos|date=4 August 2018|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/ultimas_noticias/2014/05/140513_ultnot_zuluaga_adelante_encuesta_hr|title=Colombia: encuesta coloca a Zuluaga derrotando a Santos en primera y segunda vuelta|last=Mundo|first=Redacción BBC|website=BBC News Mundo|date=13 May 2014|language=es|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>

Families of the victims and non-governmental organisations have held the [[Álvaro Uribe|Uribe]] administration and Santos, as Defence Minister, responsible for the extrajudicial killings because they consider that the government's reward policies motivated the crimes.<ref name="3000estimatesELESPECTADOR" /><ref name="FEDES2010" /> Directive 029 of 2005 issued under Defence Minister Camilo Ospina Bernal and presidential decree 1400&nbsp;of May 2006 have been questioned for offering incentives and benefits in exchange for capturing or killing members of illegal armed groups.<ref name="BBC2009-ES-TRASPIE" /><ref name="FEDES2010" />

In June 2009, [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] [[Philip Alston]] declared that extrajudicial executions had been carried out in a "more or less systematic manner" by numerous Colombian military personnel and found the number of trials for those implicated to be lacking, but stated that he had found no evidence of the executions being an official government policy and acknowledged a decrease in the number of reported cases.<ref name="UNSpecRap2009">{{cite web |url=http://www.elespectador.com/philip-alston/articulo146447-onu-confirma-desalentador-panorama-derechos-humanos |title=ONU confirma desalentador panorama en Derechos Humanos |publisher=[[El Espectador]] |date=18 June 2009 |access-date=7 October 2010|language=es}}</ref>

In March 2010, Santos publicly stated these executions had stopped since October 2008 and that this had been confirmed by the CINEP, one of Colombia's foremost human rights defence institutions. ''[[Semana]]'', a well-respected weekly magazine, reported that a few days later the CINEP responded to Santos's declarations by issuing a press release which stated that, while the number of reported cases had been significantly reduced after the Defence Ministry's measures were announced, the period between November 2008 and December 2009 still saw 7 such executions and 2 arbitrary detentions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-conflicto-armado/cinep-santos-falsos-positivos-no-han-dejado-problema/136830.aspx |title=Cinep a Santos: "falsos positivos no han dejado de ser un problema" |publisher=Semana.com |access-date=12 August 2010}}</ref>

Juan Manuel Santos announced his resignation from the Defence Ministry on 18 May 2009. Santos said that his resignation did not necessarily imply tossing his hat into the 2010 presidential race and that his participation in the electoral race depended on whether Uribe would pursue a third term, which he was willing to support. His resignation took effect on 23 May 2009. When the Constitutional Court ruled out the possibility of Uribe's participation in the upcoming elections, Santos officially launched his campaign for the presidency of the Republic of Colombia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/juan-manuel-santos-farc-colombia-nobel-peace-prize-war-on-drugs|title=Juan Manuel Santos: peace prize winner still in search of the final deal|last1=Mulholland|first1=John|date=2016-10-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-22|last2=Vulliamy|first2=Ed|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==President of Colombia==

On 20 June 2010, after two rounds of voting in the [[2010 Colombian presidential election|Presidential election]], Juan Manuel Santos Calderón was officially elected as [[President of Colombia]] and was inaugurated on 7 August 2010 in the midst of a [[2010 Colombia-Venezuela diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]] with [[Venezuela]], which was quickly resolved.<ref>{{cite news |title=Venezuela Resumes Relations It Severed with Colombia |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=362587&CategoryId=10717 |work=Latin American International Tribune |date=11 August 2010 |access-date=19 August 2010}}</ref>

=== Negotiations with FARC ===
Santos announced on 27 August 2012 that the Colombian government had engaged in exploratory talks with [[FARC]] in order to seek an end to the conflict.<ref name="Colombia peace Yahoo">{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/colombian-government-seeking-peace-farce-rebels-021300909.html | title=Colombian government seeking peace with FARC rebels | publisher=Yahoo News | agency=Reuters| date=27 August 2012 | access-date=28 August 2012 |author1=Murphy, Helen |author2=Acosta, Luis James }}</ref><ref name="BBC peace">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19393096 | title=Colombia agrees to hold peace talks with Farc rebels | publisher=BBC | date=27 August 2012 | access-date=28 August 2012}}</ref> He also said that he would learn from the mistakes of previous leaders, who failed to secure a lasting ceasefire with FARC, though the military would still continue operations throughout Colombia while talks continued.<ref name="Colombia peace Yahoo"/> According to an unnamed Colombian intelligence source, Santos offered FARC assurances that no one would be extradited to stand trial in another country.<ref name="France 24 peace">{{cite web | url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120827-colombia-government-talks-raise-prospect-farc-peace-deal-alvaro-uribe-santos | title=Government, FARC rebels agree to peace talks | publisher=France 24 | agency=Reuters| date=27 August 2012 | access-date=28 August 2012}}</ref> The move has been viewed as a cornerstone of Santos' presidency. Former President Uribe has criticised Santos for seeking peace "at any costs" in contrast to his predecessor's rejection of talks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/08/20128280155953340.html |title=Colombia seeking peace with FARC rebels - Americas |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=4 October 2011 |access-date=31 August 2012}}</ref>

In October 2012, Santos received the Shalom Prize "for his commitment to seeking peace in his country and worldwide." Upon accepting the award from the Latin American chapter of the World Jewish Congress, Santos stated that "Both the people here and the people in Israel have been seeking peace for decades," adding that Colombia is in favour of a [[two-state solution]] to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/10/23/3110081/colombias-president-awarded-shalom-prize| title = Colombia’s president awarded Shalom Prize}}, ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'' (JTA), 23 October 2012.</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/12498/colombian_leader_says_world_must_recognize_israel_as_state_of_jewish_people| title = Colombian leader says world must recognize Israel as state of Jewish people}}, ''[[World Jewish Congress]]'', 17 October 2012.</ref>

In September 2016, Santos announced that an agreement had been made completely settling the dispute between the Colombian government and FARC on the basis of a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|truth and reconciliation]]-like process, in which a combination of complete admissions of guilt and community service on the part of perpetrators of misdeeds during the years of conflict would serve in place of retributive justice.<ref>BBC News, {{cite web| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37469364| title = Colombian President: 'Last armed conflict in western hemisphere'}}, 26 September 2016</ref>

The 52-year Colombian war has cost the country 152 billion (USD), according to conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz. Within the last five years the daily cost of the war has escalated to US$9.3 million per day – enough to feed 3 million people in Colombia and wipe out extreme poverty in that country.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://real-leaders.com/nobel-peace-prize-winner-9-3-million-day-war/| title = Nobel Peace Prize Winner on His $9.3 Million a Day War - Real Leaders}}, ''[[Real Leaders]]'', 1 February 2017.</ref>

=== Relations with Trump administration ===

In May 2017, Donald Trump and Santos held a joint news conference at the White House, where Trump praised Colombia's efforts to end a 52-year civil war that left more than 220,000 dead as a "great thing to watch."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/davos-2018-protectionism-will-hurt-us-most-colombias-president-says.html|title = Protectionism will hurt the US most, Colombia's president says|date = 23 January 2018}}</ref>

Around that time, it was reported that Trump had an "unusual meeting with former presidents [[Alvaro Uribe]] and [[Andres Pastrana]]" at his Florida resort [[Mar-a-Lago]], lending weight to suspicion that Santos's political enemies were enlisting Trump's support against the historic peace accord.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-has-secret-meetings-with-1492639458-htmlstory.html| title = Negotiators reach a deal to fund the federal government but deny Trump several key priorities - Los Angeles Times}} </ref> The event was widely reported in Colombia, yet never announced by the White House.

In September 2017, Santos defended Colombia's record against [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s complaints about what he called unacceptable growth in coca cultivation and production.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/new-annual-data-released-white-house-drug-policy-office-shows-record-high-cocaine-cultivation-production-colombia/| title = New Annual Data Released by White House Drug Policy Office Shows Record High Cocaine Cultivation and Production in Colombia}}, ''[[White House]]'', 28 June 2018.</ref><ref name="reuters.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-colombia-drugs/colombia-defends-anti-drug-efforts-after-trump-critique-idUSKCN1BP1VV|title=Colombia defends anti-drug efforts after Trump critique|newspaper=Reuters|date=14 September 2017}}</ref> Trump added that he considered downgrading the country in a White House assessment, which would result in reduced development and security funding. One source of contention is the usage of [[glyphosate]] to eradicate coca crops, which Colombia had halted in favor of other methods due to health concerns.<ref name="reuters.com"/>

Colombia defended its anti-narcotics efforts after the threat of [[Donald Trump]] to decertify the country as a partner in counter-narcotics efforts.

{{cquote|For more than 30 years Colombia has demonstrated its commitment – paying a very high cost in human lives – with overcoming the drug problem.

In July 2018, Santos called on Trump to urge Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] to stop supporting Venezuela's authoritarian government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://colombiareports.com/colombia-asks-trump-to-urge-end-of-russian-support-for-venezuela|title = Colombia asks Trump to urge end to Russian support for Venezuela|date = 16 July 2018}}</ref> Santos has acknowledged that, in 2017, Trump raised the idea of a [[Coup d'état|military invasion]] of Venezuela to drive out President [[Nicolas Maduro]], which he and other Latin American leaders rejected at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-assassination-attempt-by-drone-is-just-the-latest-moment-of-chaos-in-venezuela|title = An Assassination Attempt by Drone is Just the Latest Moment of Chaos in Venezuela|date = 6 August 2018}}</ref>

During a Google hangout hosted by the Colombian newspaper ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' on 20 May 2014, Santos voiced his support for [[same-sex marriage]]. "Marriage between homosexuals to me is perfectly acceptable and what's more I am defending unions that exist between two people of the same sex with the rights and all of the same privileges that this union should receive," said Santos.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/05/27/colombia-president-backs-sex-marriage| title = Colombia president backs same-sex marriage}}, ''[[Washington Blade]]'', 27 May 2014.</ref>

On 12 March Santos officially launched his re-election campaign for the 2014 presidential election under the slogan: "We have done much, there is much to be done".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/elecciones-2014/presidencia/hemos-hecho-mucho-falta-mucho-por-hacer-eslogan-de-la-reeleccin/13644355 |title='Hemos hecho mucho, falta mucho por hacer', eslogan de la reelección |date=13 March 2014 |access-date=15 June 2014 |language=es |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |location=Bogotá |issn=0121-9987 |oclc=28894254 }}</ref> On 24 February, Santos announced that the running mate for his 2014 reelection campaign would be is [[Germán Vargas Lleras]], a veteran politician from one of Colombia's most powerful political dynasties, and his former [[Ministry of Housing, City and Territory (Colombia)|Minister of Housing, City and Territory]]. The decision to replace Vice President Garzón as his running mate was an expected one, as Garzón had already announced his desire to retire from politics.

On 15 May, Santos obtained 25.69% of the votes, falling behind his main rival, [[Óscar Iván Zuluaga Escobar]] of the [[Democratic Center (Colombia)|Democratic Center]], who obtained 29.25% of the votes. Since no one candidate earned the required majority, a run-off election was announced. In the second round, Santos received the backing and support of his former electoral rival: [[Clara López Obregón]] of the [[Alternative Democratic Pole]],<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Semana]] |title=Clara López votará por Juan Manuel Santos |date=4 June 2014 |language=es |location=Bogotá |issn=0124-5473 |oclc=7475329}}</ref> as well from dissident members of the Conservative and [[Green Party (Colombia)|Green]] parties.

On 15 June, Santos won 50.95% of the popular vote in the second round of the election. President Santos addressed supporters and volunteers gathered at the campaign's headquarters in the Claustro de La Enseñanza after his reelection and said: "This is the end of 50 years of conflict in this country, and it is the beginning of a new Colombia". Santos's victory, which was much smaller than his landslide result in 2010, was credited with strategic endorsements from left-wing politicians such as Clara López who appeared on a T.V. endorsement for Santos despite having nearly polar opposite views on many issues. This helped Santos, who had been neck and neck with his Conservative challenger on polls up to the second election round. Many among the Left whose fortunes had declined since the start of the FARC insurgency hoped a peaceful negotiation with FARC, which required a Santos victory, would help rehabilitate the left among the Conservative-Liberal dominated political scene in Colombia.
