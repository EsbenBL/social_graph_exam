The '''State University of New York at New Paltz''' ('''SUNY New Paltz''' or '''New Paltz''') is a [[public university]] in [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It traces its origins to the New Paltz Classical School, a [[Secondary education|secondary institution]] founded in 1828 and reorganized as an [[academy]] in 1833.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/about/glance.html| title = SUNY New Paltz Facts at a Glance| access-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Old Main at SUNY New Paltz.JPG|left|thumb|Old Main, the oldest building on campus]]
Following a decimating fire in 1884, the New Paltz Classical School offered their land to the state government of New York contingent upon the establishment of a [[normal school]].  In 1885, the New Paltz Normal and Training School was established to prepare teachers to practice their professions in the public schools of New York. It was granted the ability to award baccalaureate degrees in 1938, when it was renamed the State Teachers College at New Paltz; the inaugural class of 112 students graduated in 1942. In 1947, a [[graduate school|graduate program]] in education was established. When the State University of New York was established by legislative act in 1948, the Teachers College at New Paltz was one of 30 colleges associated under SUNY's umbrella. An art education program was added in 1951. In 1960, the college (assigned the moniker of the State University of New York College of Liberal Arts and Science at New Paltz in 1961) was authorized to confer liberal arts degrees.

There were several student-led demonstrations in the late 1960s and early 1970s, primarily against the [[Vietnam War]]. In the spring of 1967, a [[sit-in]] protesting military recruitment on campus blocked the entrance to the Student Union for two days. While there were scores of demonstrators the first day, all but 13 dispersed before [[New York State Troopers]] arrived and bodily carried the demonstrators to a waiting school bus for a trip to court. In the fall of 1968, students rallied in support of Craig Pastor (now Craig DeYong) who had been arrested by New Paltz Village Police for desecration of the American flag which he was wearing as a superhero cape in a student film directed by [[Edward Falco]]. College President John J. Neumaier posted bail. Pastor was released and charges were dropped.

The [[Cambodian Campaign]] and concomitant [[Kent State shootings]] in May 1970 led to a protest that culminated in a five-day student occupation of the Administration Building, subsequently renamed Old Main after the opening of the Haggerty Administration Building two years later. A March 1974 sit-in at the Haggerty Building reacted against perceived discriminatory hiring practices, the state-mandated reintegration of Shango Hall (which then housed underrepresented students), and the threatened cessation of the Experimental Studies Program in the wake of a budget shortfall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xKJhAAAAIBAJ&pg=1597,4397432&dq=new+paltz+experimental+studies&hl=en|title=New Palz Building Occupied|date=Mar 27, 1974|publisher=The Evening News |via=Google News Archive Search}}</ref>

[[File:Van den Berg Hall - SUNY New Paltz.JPG|right|thumb|Van den Berg Hall is the second oldest building on campus. Today it is the home to the business program.]]

Amid this tumult, the college's general education program (including then-vanguard introductory surveys of African and Asian cultures) was eliminated in 1971; a distribution requirement was re-instituted in 1993. A program in [[African American studies]] was established in 1968. Three years later, the Experimental Studies Program (reorganized as the Innovative Studies Program in 1975) began to  enroll students, instructors, and local residents in credited and cocurricular courses that encompassed myriad disciplines, including [[video art]] (under [[Paul Ryan (video artist)|Paul Ryan]]), [[dance therapy]], [[clowning]], [[camping]], and [[ecodesign]]. Instructors in the program were hired by students and compensated through student activity fees. A {{convert|4|acre|adj=on}} environmental studies site operated by students and community members under the aegis of the program at the southern periphery of the campus included [[geodesic dome]]s, windmills, [[kiln]]s, a solar-powered house funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and more inchoate variants of sustainable architecture. Upon ascending to the college presidency in 1980, Alice Chandler characterized the edifices as "shacks and hovels" and abolished the program in the early 1980s, demolishing most of the site in the process.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremiah Horrigan |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050912/NEWS/309129993&cid=sitesearch&template=printart |title=Home of the future's time is past |publisher=recordonline.com |date=2005-09-12 |access-date=2013-08-09}}</ref>

Under Chandler's leadership, the college (then known as the State University of New York College of Arts and Science New Paltz) began to offer professional degree programs in nursing, engineering, journalism, and accounting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.newpaltz.edu/banner/archives/timeline.html |title=STL:CHC - SUNY New Paltz Timeline |publisher=Library.newpaltz.edu |access-date=2013-08-09}}</ref> The ''[[Legislative Gazette]]'', a journalism and political science internship in which students live and work in Albany and produce a weekly newspaper about state politics, was established in 1978.

[[File:The Pond - SUNY New Paltz.JPG|left|thumb|The Pond with Esopus Hall in the background]]

On December 29, 1991, the campus was the scene of a widely reported [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] incident that contaminated four dormitories (Bliss, Gage, Capen and Scudder Halls), as well as the Coykendall Science Building and [[Parker Theatre]]. Under the direction of the county and state health departments, the university began a massive, thorough clean-up effort. As an additional precaution, 29 other buildings were thoroughly tested and, if necessary, cleaned. The clean-up process lasted until May 1995. Since 1994, PCBs have not been used on the SUNY New Paltz campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/healthcenter/pcbupdate.html |title=Scientists Say SUNY Dorms Pose No Health Dangers, Date: August 2010 |publisher=SUNY New Paltz|date=1991-12-29 |access-date=2013-08-09}}</ref>

The college was rebranded as the State University of New York at New Paltz in 1994.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/ugc/aboutnp.html | title = About New Paltz| access-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>

In November 1997, two events on campus attracted nationwide media attention. The first, a feminist conference on sex and sexuality sponsored by the [[Women's Studies]] department entitled "Revolting Behavior: The Challenges of Women's Sexual Freedom", featured an instructional workshop on [[sex toys]] offered by a Manhattan sex shop proprietor and a lecture panel on [[sadomasochism]] ("[[Safe, Sane and Consensual]] [[Sadomasochism|S/M]]: An Alternate Way of Loving").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-11-07/news/18058973_1_carolee-schneemann-seminar-pataki |title=Daily News America NY Daily News |publisher=Articles.nydailynews.com |access-date=2013-08-09}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> The second, a seminar entitled "Subject to Desire: Refiguring the Body", was sponsored by the School of Fine and Performing Arts. One presenter, [[Fluxus]] performance artist and longtime New Paltz resident [[Carolee Schneemann]], was best known for ''Interior Scroll'' (1975), a piece that culminated in her unrolling a scroll from her vagina and reading it to the audience; at the seminar, Schneemann exhibited<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-11-08/news/18051091_1_body-parts-art-class-art-history |title=Daily News America - Breaking national news, video, and photos - Homepage - NY Daily News |publisher=Articles.nydailynews.com |access-date=2013-08-09}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> abstract photographs of her vagina as part of ''Vulva's Morphia'' (1995), "a visceral sequence of photographs and text in which a Vulvic personification presents an ironic analysis juxtaposing slides and text to undermine [[Lacanian]] semiotics, gender issues, [[Marxism]], the male art establishment, religious and cultural taboos."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/vulvasmorphia.html |title=Vulva's Morphia, 1995 |publisher=Carolee Schneemann |access-date=2013-08-09}}</ref>

[[File:Academic Spine - SUNY New Paltz.JPG|right|thumb|The Excelsior Concourse, one of the busiest parts of campus]]
Political conservatives were outraged that a public university had hosted such events, and Governor [[George Pataki]] and SUNY chancellor Robert King expressed their displeasure. The controversy escalated when the Theatre Arts department staged ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' shortly afterwards. The college's then-president, Roger Bowen, defended freedom of expression on campus and refused to apologize, doing little to allay conservative ire. "The real issue," he said, "is whether some ideologues, however well-intentioned, have the right to dictate what we say and what we do on this campus." SUNY trustee Candace de Russy called for him to be dismissed.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.chronogram.com/issue/1999/11/room+SUNY.htm |title=Chill Factor at SUNY New Paltz |first=Lorna |last=Tychostup |publisher=Chronogram}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic|fix-attempted=yes}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  Bowen later resigned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/29/nyregion/embattled-college-president-is-leaving-suny-new-paltz.html|title=Embattled College President Is Leaving SUNY New Paltz|first=Karen W.|last=Arenson|date=August 29, 2001|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

===Clubs and traditions===
[[File:The Old Main Quad at SUNY New Paltz.JPG|left|thumb|The quad at SUNY New Paltz]]
The student governance is operated by the Student Association, which funds most student activities through a mandatory fee. There are many clubs, [[fraternity|fraternities]], and [[sorority|sororities]]. Clubs that are recognized by the Student Association are organized into one of six boards: Academic, Advocacy, Athletic, Fine and Performing Arts, Media, and Social and Cultural.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/saus/organizations.html|title=SUNY New Paltz - Office of Student Activities and Union Services|website=www.newpaltz.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref> There is also an on-campus government, the Residence Hall Student Association (RHSA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.newpaltz.edu/rhsa/about/|title=RHSA official web site About webpage|publisher=Newpaltz.edu |access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/rhsa/|title=RHSA official web site Officers list webpage |publisher=Newpaltz.edu |access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref>

The college has an auxiliary services corporation common to many state campuses in New York, called Campus Auxiliary Services, Inc. (CAS). This on-campus company operates the dining halls and bookstore, as well as being the source of discretionary funds for spending by the college president and the RHSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cas.newpaltz.edu/|title=CAS official web site|publisher=Newpaltz.edu|access-date=20 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418203053/http://cas.newpaltz.edu/|archive-date=April 18, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The college has a foundation and an active alumni association.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/afv/ |title=Official web pages for Alumni, friends, visitors, and SUNY New Paltz Foundation |publisher=Newpaltz.edu |access-date=20 October 2020 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204030422/http://www.newpaltz.edu/afv/ |archive-date=February 4, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The college's official student newspaper is ''The Oracle''. In 2010, it was honored by the Society of Professional Journalists for having the Best Affiliated Website for four-year college or university (Region 1 competition). It was named as a runner-up for the National Title.

Among the many clubs and associations on campus is the Nifty Nifflers, a Quidditch team inspired by the fictional sport played in the ''Harry Potter'' series.

The campus TV station is WNPC TV. It broadcasts on channels 3, 6 and 8 in the New Paltz area.

The college's radio station, WFNP, is known as "The Edge".  It broadcasts part-time at FM 88.7, and also streams online.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wfnp.org |title=WFNP 88.7 FM the EDGE |publisher=SUNY New Paltz}}</ref>  Its [[public service announcement]] program is called the "voicebox of the Valley".{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Beginning in 2006, "geeky" SUNY New Paltz clubs have run two conventions on campus: "New Paltz Convention" in the Fall and "Conquest" in the Spring. The first year the conventions were run by the Anime, Live Action Role Play, and Gaming clubs on campus. Each year various other "geeky" clubs have taken part. In the 2017-2018 school year, the two conventions were combined into one event, the New Paltz Convention (NPC) in the Spring.

Among the social and cultural clubs is the Asian and Pacific Islander Student Alliance (APISA), which hosts several programs, trips, and events celebrating and spreading Asian culture and history. Some of APISA's yearly traditions include a week-long film festival series focusing on Asian success in the film industry as performers, film directors, and producers, culinary nights where students are invited to learn how to cook Asian foods, and a gala in May to celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.
