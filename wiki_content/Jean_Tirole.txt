[[File:(31) - Toulouse School of Economics.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Toulouse School of Economics]].]]
Tirole is chairman of the board of the [[Jean-Jacques Laffont Foundation]] at the [[Toulouse School of Economics]], and scientific director of the [[Industrial Economics Institute]] (IDEI) at [[Toulouse 1 University Capitole]]. After receiving his doctorate from MIT in 1981, he worked as a researcher at the [[École nationale des ponts et chaussées]] until 1984. From 1984–1991, he worked as Professor of Economics at [[MIT]]. His work by 1988 helped to define modern industrial organization theory by organising and synthesising the main results of the game-theory revolution ''vis-à-vis'' understanding of non-competitive markets.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Jean Tirole: Market Power and Regulation|date = 13 October 2014|journal = Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences}}</ref>

From 1994 to 1996 he was a professor of economics at the [[École Polytechnique]]. Tirole was involved with [[Jean-Jacques Laffont]] in the project of creating a new [[Toulouse School of Economics|School of Economics in Toulouse]]. He is Engineer General of the Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forest, serving as Chair of the Board of the [[Toulouse School of Economics]], Visiting Professor at MIT and Professor "cumulant" at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] since 1995.

He was president of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1998 and of the [[European Economic Association]] in 2001. Around this time, he was able to determine a way to calculate the optimal prices for the regulation of natural monopolies and wrote a number of articles about the regulation of capital markets—with a focus on the differential of control between decentralised lenders and the centralised control of bank management.<ref name=":0" /> Tirole has been a member of the [[Académie des Sciences morales et politiques]] since 2011, the Conseil d'analyse économique since 2008 and the Conseil stratégique de la recherché since 2013. In the early 2010s, he showed that banks generally tend to take short-term risks and recommended a change in [[quantitative easing]] towards a more quality-based market stimulation policy.<ref name=":0" />

== Contributions to economics ==
Tirole's textbook, ''The Theory of Industrial Organization'', synthesised modern models of oligopolistic competition, analysing various cases where industries consist of a small number of firms with significant market power. He and [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] published a paper showing the conditions in which a vertical merger can result in foreclosure.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The theory of industrial organization|last=Tirole |first=Jean|date=1988|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262200714|oclc=464151427|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofindustri00jean}}</ref> Rochet and Tirole analysed the implications of 2-sided markets for competition policy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rochet|first1=Jean-Charles|last2=Tirole|first2=Jean|date=2003-06-01|title=Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|volume=1|issue=4|pages=990–1029|doi=10.1162/154247603322493212|issn=1542-4766|doi-access=free}}</ref> [[Drew Fudenberg|Fudenberg]] and Tirole also created a taxonomy of strategic effects in oligopolistic competition models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmusen.org/GI/reader/15a.aerfud&Tirole.Puppy.pdf|title=The Fat Cat Effect, the Puppy Dog Ploy and the Lean an d Hungry Look}}</ref>

== Awards ==
Tirole was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2014 for his analysis of [[market power]] and the regulation of natural monopolies. Tirole received [[doctorate honoris causa|doctorates ''honoris causa'']] from the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] in 1989, the [[London Business School]] and the [[University of Montreal]] in 2007, the [[University of Mannheim]] in  2011, the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] and the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]] in 2012 as well as the [[University of Lausanne]] in 2013.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.economia.uniroma2.it/nuovo/eventi.asp?id=1078 Laurea magistrale honoris causa Jean Tirole]</ref>

He is a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1993) and of the [[American Economic Association]] (1993). He has also been a [[Sloan Fellow]] (1985) and a [[Guggenheim Fellow (1988)]]. He was a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1986 and an Economic Theory Fellow (Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory) in 2011.

In 2008, he received the Prix du Cercle d'Oc; in 2009, he received an  Outstanding Contributions to the Profession Award ([[International Association for Energy Economics]]); in 2010, he was granted the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] – [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (CME-MSRI) prize in Innovative Quantitative Innovations in Finance,  the Tjalling Koopmans Asset Award ([[Tilburg University]]), and  the "Prix Claude Levi-Strauss". He is among the most influential economists in the world according to [[RePEc|IDEAS/RePEc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html|title=Economist Rankings at IDEAS|access-date=15 October 2014}}</ref>  Besides his numerous academic distinctions, he was the recipient of the Gold Medal of the city of Toulouse in 2007, a [[Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur]] since 2007 and an Officer in the [[Ordre national du Mérite]] since 2010.
