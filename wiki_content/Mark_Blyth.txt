I've released five or six albums, but all with independent labels that never went anywhere. If they had, I wouldn't be here. I'd be lying on a beach with [[Heidi Klum]]."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nevils |first1=Brooke |title=Things I've learned: Prof. Mark Blyth |url=https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2006/10/things-ive-learned-prof-mark-blyth-26651 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins News-Letter |date=12 October 2006}}</ref>

In 1991, Blyth received a Walker Bequest award from the [[University of Strathclyde]] and a Scottish International Educational Trust Award for Study in the United States. He eventually became a US citizen.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schwartzapfel |first1=Beth |title=Capitalism With Airbags |url=https://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/articles/2013-10-30/capitalism-with-airbags |website=Brown Alumni Magazine |publisher=Brown Alumni Magazine |accessdate=30 October 2013}}</ref>

He went on to receive a MA in political science in 1993, an MPhil of political science in 1995, and a PhD in political science in 1999 from [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BLYTH Mark McGann |url=http://www.worldwhoswho.com/public/views/entry.html?id=sl2174460 |website=World Who's Who |publisher=World Who's Who |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

In 1997, Blyth joined the faculty of [[Johns Hopkins University]] as an assistant professor of political science. From 2005 to 2009, he was an associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins.<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy Hour with Mark Blyth |url=https://www.alumni.jhu.edu/event/markblyth |website=Johns Hopkins Office of Alumni Relations|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>

In 2009, Blyth became a professor of international political economy at Brown University's Department of Political Science. Since 2014, he has been the Eastman Professor of Political Economy as part of a joint appointment at Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies and the Department of Political Science.

As of 2020, Blyth is the William R. Rhodes '57 Professor of International Economics and Director of the Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University.<ref>{{cite web |title=Researchers@Brown |url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mblyth |website=Brown University |accessdate=8 September 2020}}</ref>

Blyth is best known for his critique of [[austerity]], ''[[Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea]]'', described by ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' writer Elias Esquith as "necessary reading" and as an economics [[primer (textbook)|primer]], a polemic, and a history that offers "insight into austerity's lineage, its theories, its champions and its failures...Mark Blyth's new book explains the damaging consequences of austerity in Europe and the U.S." Blyth characterized the argument advanced by austerity advocates as "a canard" and "complete horseshit".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Esquith |first1=Elias |title=Austerity Is 'Complete Horsesh*t': Ivy League Prof Dismantles the Conservative Lie |journal=Salon |date=11 February 2015 |url=https://www.alternet.org/2015/02/austerity-complete-horsesht-ivy-league-prof-dismantles-conservative-lie/ |accessdate=8 September 2020|via=AlterNet}}</ref>

Using the term "[[Trumpism]]", Blyth argues that there are similar anti-establishment movements across the developed world.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-11-15/global-trumpism|title=Global Trumpism|first=Mark|last=Blyth|date=15 November 2016|journal=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=8 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs|title=Mark Blyth ─ Global Trumpism|date=2016-09-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkm2Vfj42FY|format=Video|access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref>

In August of 2020, Blyth expressed his support for [[Scottish independence]] from the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|title="Economist Mark Blyth: ‘I’m now a convert to Scottish independence’" (Interview with Mark Blyth) {{!}} Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy|url=https://watson.brown.edu/taubman/news/2020/economist-mark-blyth-m-now-convert-scottish-independence-interview-mark-blyth|access-date=2021-07-19|website=watson.brown.edu}}</ref> He sits on the [[Scottish Government|Scottish Government's]] Advisory Council on transforming Scotland's economy, chaired by Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy [[Kate Forbes]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Delivering economic transformation - gov.scot|url=https://www.gov.scot/news/delivering-economic-transformation/|access-date=2021-07-19|website=www.gov.scot}}</ref>
