'''Leonardus Lessius''' ({{lang-nl|Lenaert Leys}}; 1 October 1554, in [[Brecht, Belgium|Brecht]] – 15 January 1623, in [[Leuven]]) was a Flemish moral theologian from the [[Jesuit]] order.<ref>Leonardus Lessius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/sale-securities-and-insurance On Sales, Securities, and Insurance]''.

==Life==

At the age of thirteen the young Leonard won the Brecht scholarship to the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]]. This university is the main place he will be identified with for the next fifty years. In 1567 he matriculated in an arts department called Le Porc (Porcus alit doctos), during the final oral exam he was merited the title of primus.<ref name=Leonard>{{cite book|last=Chamberlain, S.

He joined the Jesuits in 1572, and after theological studies in [[Rome]] under [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[Robert Bellarmine]], he became professor of [[theology]] at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]].<ref>Leonardus Lessius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/sale-securities-and-insurance On Sales, Securities, and Insurance]''. CLP Academic, 2016, p.xxvii</ref> In his early teaching years, he was involved in the [[predestination]] theological debate that was raging in Leuven in 1587–88 (against [[Baianism]]). Despite significant persecution and censorship that he receive as a result, Lessius supported the view of free will and predestination developed by [[Luis de Molina]], which was seen by many theologians at the time as too little conservative position.<ref>Leonardus Lessius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/sale-securities-and-insurance On Sales, Securities, and Insurance]''. CLP Academic, 2016, p.xxviii</ref> In 1615 Pope [[Paul V]] thanked him personally for the services rendered to the [[Catholic Church]].

Lessius is now best known for his treatise ''De iustitia et iure'' (''On Justice and Law'') (1605), a commentary on the ''Secunda secundae'' of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas's]] [[Summa Theologica]], that went through more than 20 editions in the 17th century alone.<ref>Leonardus Lessius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/sale-securities-and-insurance On Sales, Securities, and Insurance]''. CLP Academic, 2016, p.xxviii</ref> It is probably the first in-depth moral theological approach to [[economic]] and [[financial]] questions. Lessius went to [[Antwerp]], then a world business centre in rapid expansion, to study how [[banking]] and [[commerce]] were functioning. His experience gave weight to his [[ethical]] solutions to moral cases dealing with business and finance. He has been praised by modern historians of [[economics]] for the subtlety of its understanding of business matters involving [[interest]]. For example, Lessius clearly states the dependence of the price of an [[insurance]] contract on the [[risk]] of the event insured against.<ref name=Frabook>{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=James |date=2001 |title=The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal |url=https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/The_Science_of_Conjecture/1zDECQAAQBAJ |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=287-8 |isbn=0-8018-6569-7}}</ref> Among other things he gave guidelines for a new "just price" approach, accepting the fact that what was proposed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] was no longer workable in the 16th century.

His work ''On the Providence of the Deity, and the Immortality of the Soul, Against Atheists and Politicians'', containing [[teleological argument|design arguments]] for the existence of [[God]], was translated into English in 1631 under the title ''Rawleigh his Ghost''.<ref name=Frabook />{{rp|244-5}}

From 1610 on, and already in poor health, he turned towards writing ascetical and theological books that had also much success.

==Tomb==

Lessius is buried in St. Michael Church, the historic Jesuit church in Leuven. His simple tomb is located in the [[baptistry]], just to the north of the [[apse]]. Previously, he was interred at the nearby Jesuit college.
