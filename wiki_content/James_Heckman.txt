=== Center for the Economics of Human Development ===
Founded in 2014 and directed by Heckman, the Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), at the University of Chicago, umbrellas his multiple research areas and initiatives that encompass rigorous empirical research to determine effective human capital policies and program design. CEHD initiatives include the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, the Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development, the [[Heckman Equation]], the Research Network on the Determinants of Life Course Capabilities and Outcomes, and the Asian Family in Transition Initiative. Along with professor [[Steven Durlauf|Steve Durlauf]], Heckman is the Co-Director of the HCEO Working Group.

==Research==
Heckman is noted for his contributions to [[selection bias]] and [[self-selection]] analysis, especially [[Heckman correction]], which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also well known for his empirical research in [[labor economics]], particularly regarding the efficacy of [[early childhood education]] programs.

His work has been devoted to the development of a scientific basis for economic policy evaluation, with special emphasis on models of individuals and disaggregated groups, and the problems and possibilities created by [[unobserved heterogeneity|heterogeneity, diversity, and unobserved counterfactual states]]. He developed a body of new econometric tools that address these issues. His research has given policymakers important new insights into areas such as education, jobtraining, the importance of accounting for general equilibrium in the analysis of labor markets, anti-discrimination law, and civil rights. He demonstrated a strong causal effect of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] in promoting [[African-American]] economic progress. He has recently demonstrated that the high school dropout rate is increasing in the US. He has studied the economic benefits of sorting in the labor market, the ineffectiveness of active labor market programs, and the economic returns to education.

His recent research focuses on inequality, human development and lifecycle skill formation, with a special emphasis on the economics of early childhood education. He is currently conducting new social experiments on early childhood interventions and reanalyzing old experiments. He is also studying the emergence of the underclass in the US and [[Western Europe]]. For example, he showed that a high IQ only improved an individual's chances of financial success by 1 or 2%.<ref name="bloombergifyouresosmart">{{cite news|last1=Flam|first1=Faye|title=If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-22/if-you-re-so-smart-why-aren-t-you-rich|access-date=June 2, 2017|work=Bloomberg|date=December 22, 2016}}</ref> Instead, "conscientiousness," or "diligence, perseverance and self-discipline," are what led to financial success.<ref name="bloombergifyouresosmart"/>

In the early 1990s, his pioneering research, on the outcomes of people who obtain the [[GED]] certificate, received national attention.

Heckman has published over 300 articles and several books. His books include ''Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policy?'' (with Alan Krueger); ''Evaluating Human Capital Policy, Law, and Employment: Lessons from Latin America and the Caribbean'' (with Carmen Pages); the ''Handbook of Econometrics'', volumes 5, 6A, and 6B (edited with Edward Leamer); ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law,'' (edited with R. Nelson and L. Cabatingan); and ''The Myth of Achievement Tests: The GED and the Role of Character in American Life'' (with John Eric Humphries and Tim Kautz).

He is currently co-editor of the ''Journal of Political Economy''. He is also a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (USA) and the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=James+J.+Heckman&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-04-28|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> He is  a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Econometric Society]] (of which he is also former president), the [[Society of Labor Economics]], the [[American Statistical Association]], and the [[International Statistical Institute]].

Heckman has received numerous awards for his work, including the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] of the American Economic Association in 1983, the 2005 and 2007 Dennis Aigner Award for Applied Econometrics from the ''Journal of Econometrics'', the 2005 [[Jacob Mincer Award|Jacob Mincer Award for Lifetime Achievement in Labor Economics]], the 2005 Ulysses Medal from the University College Dublin, the 2007 Theodore W.
