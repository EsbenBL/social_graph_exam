==Biography==
Timasheff "came from an old family of Russian nobility"; his father was Minister of Trade and Industry under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].<ref>Goul, "N. S. Timasheff 1886-1970," p. 363.</ref> In [[St. Petersburg]], where he was born, he attended a classical high school; he went on to attend the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]], the [[University of Strasbourg]], and the [[Saint Petersburg State University]] (MA 1910, LLD 1914). At the latter university he met the Polish-Russian jurist [[Leon Petrazycki]], who was a significant influence on him throughout his life.<ref>A. Javier Treviño, introduction to Nicholas S. Timasheff, ''An Introduction to the Sociology of Law'' (Transaction Publishers, 1939: {{ISBN|0-7658-0729-7}}), p. xi.</ref> Two years later he began teaching sociological jurisprudence at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petrograd]]. He emigrated to the [[United States]] following an alleged involvement with the [[:ru:Дело Таганцева|Tagantsev Conspiracy]] in 1921. He joined the [[Harvard University]] Sociology Department, chaired at that time by P. A. Sorokin, and later transitioned to sociology faculty of [[Fordham University]], where he would remain for the rest of his career.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timasheff |first1=Nicholas |title=How I Became a Sociologist |journal=Novyi Zhurnal |date=1966 |issue=85}}</ref>

Timasheff was the author of various works, including ''The Great Retreat: The Growth and Decline of Communism in Russia'' (New York, 1946), in which he argued that the Bolsheviks made a conscious retreat from [[socialist]] values during the 1930s, instead returning to traditional ones like patriotism and the family. Historian Terry Martin considers this a misnomer, because "in the political and economic spheres, the period after 1933 marked a consolidation, rather than a repudiation, of the most important goals of Stalin's socialist offensive: forced industrialization, collectivization, nationalization, abolition of the market, political dictatorship."<ref>Terry Martin, ''The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939'' (Cornell University Press, 2001: {{ISBN|0-8014-8677-7}}), p. 415.</ref>

Buried: [[Oakland Cemetery (Yonkers, New York)]] Westchester County, USA.
