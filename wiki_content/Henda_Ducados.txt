=== Youth and Education ===
Henda Ducados Pinto de Andrade was born in the Moroccan capital city, Rabat,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Congress|first=The Library of|title=Ducados, Henda - LC Linked Data Service: Authorities and Vocabularies {{!}} Library of Congress, from LC Linked Data Service: Authorities and Vocabularies (Library of Congress)|url=https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2001098154.html|access-date=2021-09-13|website=id.loc.gov}}</ref> where her father [[Mário Pinto de Andrade]] was a well-known resistance fighter against [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial power]] in [[Angola]] and was elected chairman of the Angolan liberation movement MPLA in 1960, as coordinator of Portuguese colonial organizations (''Conferência das Organizações das Colónias Portuguesas'' (CONCP)). The aim of CONCP, founded in [[Casablanca]], Morocco in 1961, was to connect and support the independence movements in the Portuguese colonies of Africa. Her mother, [[Sarah Maldoror]], was a French-born filmmaker of [[Guadeloupe|Guadeloupian]] origin. The couple had two daughters, Henda and Annouchka de Andrade.<ref>{{Citation|last=ruigrok|first=inge mariëtte ruigrokinge mariëtte|title=Ducados, Henda|date=2011-01-01|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195382075.001.0001/acref-9780195382075-e-0582|work=Dictionary of African Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195382075.001.0001/acref-9780195382075-e-0582|isbn=978-0-19-538207-5|access-date=2021-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Sarah Maldoror, Prémio de Cultura e Artes 2020 de Angola|url=https://www.voaportugues.com/a/sarah-maldoror-prémio-de-cultura-e-artes-/5672847.html|access-date=2021-09-13|website=VOA|language=pt}}</ref> 

In 1966, the family moved to [[Algiers|Algiers, Algeria]], where they were accepted by the Algerian independence movement FLN ([[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]]). The Algerian President [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] provided the family with a residence in [[Bab El Oued]], a suburb of Algiers. Henda's father worked for the FLN and tried to support the [[MPLA]] party in Angola from Algeria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=PressReader.com - Digital Newspaper & Magazine Subscriptions|url=https://www.pressreader.com/angola/jornal-de-angola/20200418/282389811616907|access-date=2021-09-13|website=www.pressreader.com}}</ref> Meanwhile, her mother produced films for the FLN army. (Among other things, she worked with [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] on the film ''Battle of Algiers''.) In 1970, an incident broke out between the filmmaker and a general of the FLN army that resulted in her arrest and subsequent deportation. The mother then moved with her two daughters to the Paris suburb of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where Henda Ducados attended elementary and secondary school. Her father stayed in Africa. After he fell out with the MPLA, he lived in various former Portuguese colonies in Africa and the family members rarely saw each other. 

In the 1980s, Henda Ducados moved to Chicago and enrolled at [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]], where she earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1992.<ref name=":1" />  

=== Advocate of microcredit in Angola ===
During her studies at Loyola University, Ducados became interested in the principles of [[microcredit]] developed by [[Grameen Bank]],<ref name=":1" /> which had become successful in [[Bangladesh]]. She decided to move to Angola in 1992, where she learned Portuguese and led a microcredit pilot project for an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] there before receiving a scholarship to learn more about the principles of microcredit on-site in Bangladesh. In 1998, she founded the ''Rede Mulher'' (Women's Network) in Angola, an exchange and networking platform for women using microfinancing techniques.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Henda Ducados {{!}} Conciliation Resources|url=https://www.c-r.org/people-profiles/henda-ducados|access-date=2021-09-13|website=www.c-r.org}}</ref> 

At the same time, she deepened her studies in economics and development with a focus on microcredits as part of a Masters at the Institute for Development Studies at the [[University of Sussex]], which she graduated in 1998. To this she added a degree (MPhil) in "Gender and Development" at the [[London School of Economics]] and Political Science in 2001,<ref name=":1" /> with her paper titled "Women in War-Torn Societies: A Study of Households in Luanda's Peri-Urban Areas." 

=== Professional positions ===
In 2001, Ducados became deputy head of the Social Action Fund funded by the [[World Bank]].<ref name=":1" /> 

In 2008,<ref name=":1" /> she took over the external communications unit for the Angolan branch of the French oil company [[TotalEnergies|Total]].<ref name=":0" />
