'''Kenneth E. Train''' (born November 14, 1951) is an Adjunct Professor of Economics at [[University of California, Berkeley|the University of California, Berkeley]], United States. He is also Vice President of [http://www.nera.com NERA Economic Consulting, Inc.] in San Francisco, California. He received a Bachelors in Economics at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and PhD from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]. He specializes in econometrics and regulation, with applications in energy, environmental studies, telecommunications and transportation.

Kenneth Train has published three books and more than sixty articles. His most recent book, ''Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation'', deals with [[Discrete Choice]], a new area in econometrics. His software for [[Discrete Choice#I. Mixed Logit|mixed logit]] estimation, which is distributed free on his university [http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~train/software.html website], has been used by researchers worldwide, and several commercial statistical packages  have recently added mixed logit routines.{{fact|date=September 2020}}
