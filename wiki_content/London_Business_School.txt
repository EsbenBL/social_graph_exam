==History==

=== Foundation ===
[[File:LBS campus.jpg|thumb|right|Sussex Place, main campus of the London Business School in London]]
London Business School was founded in 1964 under the name of the '''London Graduate School of Business Studies','' with Dr. Arthur Earle as Dean. In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the [[University of London]] as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the School's [[Regent's Park]] campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the ''London Business School'' and was incorporated by [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]], which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the [[Columbia Business School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/london-business-school|title=London Business School|website=London Business School}}</ref>

In 2007 a new campus was opened in [[Dubai]] to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the [[University of Hong Kong]] and [[Columbia Business School]], and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired [[Marylebone Town Hall]] and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent.<ref name="LBS Expansion"/> The building was renamed "The Sammy Ofer Centre" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-Marylebone-town-hall/index.html|title=Sammy Ofer Centre|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312011214/https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-marylebone-town-hall/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.

With the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a £100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised £98 million, £40 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with £28 million for research, £18 million in scholarships for students, £10 million to increase the school's endowment, and £4 million to improve technology across the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|title=Funding campaign|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220101627/https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|archive-date=20 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> By June 2016, the school had raised £125 million, including two £25 million gifts from alumni [[Jim Ratcliffe]] and [[Idan Ofer]].<ref name="ftraiseslbsmoules">{{cite news|last1=Moules|first1=Jonathan|title=London Business School raises £125m in first fundraising|url=https://next.ft.com/content/b97a1762-316b-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153|access-date=16 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=15 June 2016}}</ref>

[[François Ortalo-Magné]], the French-born former Dean of the [[Wisconsin School of Business]], succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017.<ref name="ftlbsappoints">{{cite news|last1=Vina|first1=Gonzalo|title=LBS appoints François Ortalo-Magné as dean|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ee0659e-5284-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef|access-date=25 March 2017|work=Financial Times|date=25 July 2016}}</ref>

==Campus==
The campus is located at [[Sussex Place]] in [[Marylebone]], on the perimeter of [[Regent's Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/theschool/campusservices.html|title=Campus services|work=london.edu|access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref>

LBS maintains a number of facilities, including a sports centre, restaurant, three cafes and a library, all dedicated for the exclusive use of its community. There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student [[amphitheatre]] rooms.

There is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and [[executive education]] participants. Most students choose to live in nearby private residential buildings or in students halls of residence such as the [[International Students House, London]].

LBS is expanding its campus in central London. The business school has redeveloped the [[Marylebone Town Hall]] into classrooms and offices at the Sammy Ofer Centre.  It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/newsandevents/news/2013/09/Landmark_%C2%A325_million_gift_for_London_Business_School%E2%80%99s_Old_Marylebone_Town_Hall_1695.html|title=News|work=london.edu|access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Admission ===
All candidates must take international exams related to their English abilities ([[Test of English as a Foreign Language|TOEFL]]) or IELTS and mathematic/logical reasoning skills ([[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] or [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]]). Candidates are also asked to write several [[essay]]s (topics are related to the envisaged programmes). The recruitment process has two steps. The first one consists of sending an application with the following information:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/education-and-development/masters-courses/masters-in-financial-analysis/how-to-apply#.VuX1AFMrLaY|title=How to apply|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927120841/https://www.london.edu/education-and-development/masters-courses/masters-in-financial-analysis/how-to-apply#.VuX1AFMrLaY|archive-date=27 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* An application form (administrative and academic information on the candidate, but also his/her career plan and personal ambitions)
* Several essays
* The GMAT or GRE scores. The average GMAT score is usually around 700 (90th percentile)
* The TOEFL scores (English test)
* A one-page resume (CV)
* Two reference letters (one academic and one professional)
* The candidate's academic transcript with his/her grades
Once the application has been accepted, an examination is made by the selection committee. If the candidate meets the criteria of the school, he/she will be invited for an interview on campus in London. If this latter step is a success, the candidate receives an offer from LBS.

=== Master in Business Administration (MBA) ===
The school's flagship programme is its full-time 15–21-month [[Master of Business Administration]] degree. MBA students take a prescribed set of core courses then choose from roughly 70 different electives. Class size has been around 400 students in every annual cohort. These are broken into 5 streams of approximately 80 students who take all core courses together. The admission process is highly competitive and selective.

Beyond academics, the school puts an emphasis on personal and professional development including [[leadership development|leadership]], global awareness, and business skill building. These developments are facilitated via specialized workshops led by external consultants, students, and faculty. In addition to a range of elective courses at the London Business School, the school has partnerships with around 32 exchange schools around the world.  Each academic year around 100 students spend a term at another leading business school.

The MBA program at LBS is widely considered to be one of the top 10 in the world. In the Financial Times' 2015 Global MBA Rankings, LBS ranked 2nd in the world just behind [[Harvard Business School]].  In CNN Expansion's 2014 Global MBA Rankings, LBS ranked 5th in the world.

=== Executive MBA ===
The school offers four Executive (part-time) MBA degrees, which are completed in 16–20 months. At an academic level, the school offers the same degree to both Executive (part-time) and full-time MBA students. The programmes involve very similar core courses to the full-time MBA, international field work and a wide range of elective courses. The course ends with a capstone together with company project or management report.
* '''Executive MBA (London)'''.
* '''Executive MBA (Dubai)'''. The programme begins with an orientation week in London. Following this, students take 10 core modules, which are taught in a four- or five-day block each month in Dubai. Students then undertake electives, which are primarily offered in London, and an international assignment. Two additional core modules take place in London. 
* '''EMBA-Global Americas and Europe'''. A further 140 executives are enrolled in the dual-degree EMBA-Global Programme. It is taught in partnership with [[Columbia Business School]]. Graduates are awarded degrees from both universities. The first year involves week-long modules each month alternating between London and New York. In the second year, students select from the full range of electives available at the participating schools.
* '''EMBA-Global Asia'''. launched in 2008 jointly with [[Hong Kong University]] and Columbia. Teaching takes place at all three business schools. While the first year is modelled on the transatlantic EMBA-Global, the school states that because "EMBA-Global Asia is designed for people who have or will have significant trans-national responsibilities, all courses reflect a greater proportion of global material".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emba-global.com/asia/faqs.html?WT.svl=topnav#Other_EMBA_difference|title=What is the difference between EMBA-Global Asia and other Executive MBA programmes?|access-date=24 June 2009|publisher=London Business School}}</ref>
