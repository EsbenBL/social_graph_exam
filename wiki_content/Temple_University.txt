==History==
[[File:Baptist_temple_postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard depicting the original Baptist Temple and [[Russell Conwell]]]]
[[File:Truman_visits_temple.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Harry S. Truman]] visits Temple University]]
[[File:mlk_visits_temple.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] lecturing at Temple University in 1965]]

Temple University was founded in 1884 by [[Russell Conwell]], a [[Yale]]-educated [[Boston]] lawyer, orator, and ordained Baptist minister, who had served in the [[Union Army]] during the American Civil War. Conwell came to Pennsylvania in 1882 to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules. These students, later dubbed "night owls," were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple (hence the origin of the university's name and mascot).

The Grace Baptist Church quickly grew popular within the North Philadelphia area. A temporary board of trustees was created to handle the rapidly growing formalities associated with the church's programs. When the board conducted its first meeting they named Russell H. Conwell president of "The Temple College." Within the following months, Grace Baptist Church appointed a new board of trustees, printed official admissions files, and issued stock to raise funds for new teaching facilities. Regardless of whether they had the resources to support the school, Conwell's desire was “to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels”.<ref name="usca">{{cite web | url=http://www.usca.edu/essays/vol152005/lovik.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210065213/http://www.usca.edu/essays/vol152005/lovik.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2006-02-10 | date=2006-02-10}}</ref>

Conwell used the income from his “[[Russell Conwell|Acres of Diamonds]]” speech to fund Temple<ref name="usca" /> as a place where working-class Philadelphians might receive higher education.

Philadelphia granted a charter in 1888 to establish “The Temple College of Philadelphia”, but the city refused to grant authority to award academic degrees. By 1888, the enrollment of the college was nearly 600. It was in 1907 that Temple College revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university. Legal recognition as a university enhanced Temple in noticeable ways including its reputation, professional and graduate programs, overall enrollment, and financial support.<ref name="usca" />

Over time, Temple expanded: Samaritan Hospital was founded, a Medical School was added, and Temple merged with the Philadelphia Dental College.<ref name="usca"/> After the merger, Temple officially reincorporated as Temple University on December 12, 1907.

In 1954, Temple University agreed to terms to purchase 11 1/2 acres of the adjacent [[Monument Cemetery]] and repurpose it for athletic fields and a parking lot.<ref name=Dembele>{{cite web |last1=Dembele |first1=Marian |title=Before there was Geasey, there were tombstones |url=https://temple-news.com/geasey-tombstones/ |website=www.temple-news.com |date=11 November 2014 |access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref> Families of the deceased claimed about 8,000 of the 28,000 bodies on the site and the rest were moved to an unmarked mass grave at [[Lawnview Memorial Park]].<ref name="becoming">Puckett, John L. & Mark Frazier Lloyd.

[http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/06/how-thousands-headstones-ended-under-philadelphia-bridge/2410/ How Thousands of Headstones Ended Up Under a Philadelphia Bridge], ''City Lab''</ref>

Since 1965, Temple has been a Pennsylvania [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] university, meaning the university receives state funds, subject to state appropriations, but is independently operated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/institution_types/8713/state-related_universities/522465|title=State-Related Universities |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Education|access-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref>

Williams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owlsports.com/index.aspx |title=Temple University Athletics |publisher=Owlsports.com |access-date=2012-08-05}}</ref>

===Men's basketball===
{{Main|Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple Owls women's basketball}}
[[File:Liacourus Center.jpg|thumb|right|Temple University Liacouras Center]]
The Temple Men's basketball program was ranked 5th in all-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] wins with 1,903 starting the 2017-2018 season. Only [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]], [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] have a higher total.

Temple is recognized as having won the first-ever National Collegiate basketball championship in 1938, under Coach James Usilton. That Owls team, which finished with a 23–2 record, won the inaugural [[National Invitation Tournament]] by routing Colorado 60-36 in the championship final. Because the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] was not held until the following year, Temple's NIT championship earned the Owls the first national college basketball title. During the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA [[Final Four]] appearances (1956, 1958) under legendary Head Coach Harry Litwack. Litwack would be inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite news|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/tem/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/MBB_MG_History_2008-09.pdf|title=Temple Basketball History|work=2008-09 Temple Men’s Basketball Media Guide|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

Head Coach [[John Chaney (basketball, born 1932)|John Chaney]], who is also a Hall of Fame coach, won a total of 724 career games and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987–88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 1 in the country, and he has reached the [[Elite Eight]] on five occasions. He was consensus national coach of the year in 1988.<ref name="auto2"/>

On April 10, 2006, University of Pennsylvania head coach and [[La Salle University]] alumnus [[Fran Dunphy]] was named the new Temple's Men's Head Basketball coach after Chaney's retirement in conclusion of the 2006 season. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move. Dunphy and the Owls won three straight Atlantic-10 tournaments in 2008, 2009 and 2010, with the third marking a conference-leading ninth A-10 title. In the 2011-12 season, the Owls won the A-10 regular season title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://owlsports.com/news/2010/3/8/MBB_0308104758.aspx|title=Fran Dunphy Named Finalist For National Coach of the Year - Temple University|website=Temple University|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>

Heading into the 2015-16 season, the program owned a 116-year win-loss record of 1,849-1,024. The Owls' history also includes 48 postseason tournament appearances (31 NCAAs, 18 NITs), two Final Four appearances (1956 and 1958) under Harry "The Chief" Litwack, five regional finals in the last 22&nbsp;years under John Chaney (1988, 1991, 1993, 1999 and 2001), NIT championships in 1938 and 1969, and two Naismith Basketball Association Hall of Fame Coaches in Litwack and Chaney. Temple is one of eight schools that have competed in the last six NCAA Tournaments, as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://owlsports.com.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/2015/11/10/TU_notes_UNC.pdf?id=4417 |title=Temple University Athletics |publisher=Owlsports.com |access-date=2016-01-09}}</ref>
