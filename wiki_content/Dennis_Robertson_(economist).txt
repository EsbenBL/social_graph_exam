'''Sir Dennis Holme Robertson''' (23 May 1890 – 21 April 1963) was an English economist who taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of London|London]] Universities.

== Biography ==
Robertson, the son of a [[Church of England]] clergyman, was born in [[Lowestoft]] and educated as a scholar of [[Eton College|Eton]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he read Classics and Economics, graduating in 1912.

Robertson worked closely with [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1920s and 1930s, during the years when Keynes was developing many of the ideas that later were incorporated in his ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''. Keynes wrote that at that time, working with Robertson, it was good to work with someone who had a "completely first class mind". Robertson was the first to use the term "[[liquidity trap]]".<ref>Richard Sutch
[http://apebhconference.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/sutch1.pdf ''The Liquidity Trap: A Lesson from Macroeconomic History for Today''] note 7</ref>  Ultimately however, differences of temperament and views about economic theory and practice (especially in the 1937 debate over the savings-investment relationship in the General Theory) led to some estrangement between the two men.

Robertson died of a [[heart attack]] at Cambridge on 21 April 1963.
