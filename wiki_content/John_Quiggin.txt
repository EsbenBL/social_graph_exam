Quiggin writes a blog involving "commentary on Australian and world events from a socialist and democratic viewpoint".<ref>[http://johnquiggin.com/ John Quiggin's Blog]</ref> It was included in the ''Focus Economics'' Top Economics and Finance Blogs of 2018 and the Top 100 Economics Blogs of 2020 by the ''Intelligent Economist''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top Economics & Finance Blogs of 2018 |url=https://www.focus-economics.com/blog/top-economics-finance-blogs-of-2018 |website=Focus Economics |date=24 January 2018 |publisher=Focus Economics |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Agarwal |first1=Prateek |title=Top 100 Economics Blogs of 2020 |url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economics-blogs/ |website=Intelligent Economist |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref> He is also a regular contributor to ''[[Crooked Timber]]'', ''[[Inside Story (Australian TV program)|Inside Story]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>[http://www.crookedtimber.org/author/john-quiggin/ The Crooked Timber Blog].</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=John Quiggin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-quiggin |work=The Guardian |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=John Quiggin |url=https://insidestory.org.au/authors/john-quiggin/ |website=Inside Story |publisher=Inside Story |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref> Until April 2015, he was a Fellow at the [[Centre for Policy Development]].<ref>[http://newsocialdemocrat.net/?p=197 Statement on resignation from CPD and alternative: public statement by Mark Bahnisch, Eva Cox and John Quiggin, (24 April 2015), The New Social Democrat] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20150424081010/http://newsocialdemocrat.net/?p=197 |date=24 April 2015 }} accessed 24 April 2015</ref> He was an opinion columnist for the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' from 1996 until March 2012.

As of 2015, Quiggin opposed [[Bitcoin]], calling it a "delusion" that would lead to "environmental disaster" due to the "ever-increasing environmental damage from the electricity used in the 'mining' of Bitcoins" and that "The sooner this collective delusion comes to an end, the better."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-06/quiggin-bitcoins-are-a-waste-of-energy/6827940|title = Bitcoins are a waste of energy - literally|date = 5 October 2015}}</ref> He also proposed that the value of Bitcoin was a refutation of the [[efficient market hypothesis]]: "The EMH states that the market value of an asset is equal to the best available estimate of the value of the services or income flows it will generate. In the case of a company stock, this is the discounted value of future earnings. Since Bitcoins do not generate any actual earnings, they must appreciate in value to ensure that people are willing to hold them. But an endless appreciation, with no flow of earnings or liquidation value, is precisely the kind of bubble the EMH says can’t happen."<ref name="QuigginNI">{{cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-bitcoin-bubble-bad-hypothesis-8353|title=The Bitcoin Bubble and a Bad Hypothesis|last=Quiggin|first=John|work=The National Interest|date=16 April 2013 }}</ref>

In 2012, through Princeton University Press, Quiggin published his book Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us which sold upward of 20 000 copies and was translated into eight languages.<ref>{{cite book |title=Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us |url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691154541/zombie-economics |website=Princeton University Press |date=6 May 2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691154541 |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref name="Professor John Quiggin Researcher">{{cite web |title=Professor John Quiggin |url=https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1211 |website=UQ Researchers |publisher=University of Queensland |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref> His most recent book, ''Economics in Two Lessons: Why Markets Work So Well, and Why They Can Fail So Badly'', was published in 2019 also from Princeton University Press and provides an introduction to free-market economics, covering key theory as well as its successes and failures.<ref>[https://insidestory.org.au/authors/john-quiggin/ ] {{ISBN|978-0-691-15494-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Economics in Two Lessons: Why Markets Work So Well, and Why They Can Fail So Badly |url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691154947/economics-in-two-lessons |website=Princeton University Press |publisher=Princeton University Press |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref>

He was appointed in 2012 to the Board of the Climate Change Authority of the [[Australian Government]].<ref name="theaustralian"/><ref name="twoquit"/>
With reference to the pro-nuclear film ''[[Pandora's Promise]]'', Quiggin comments that it presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving [[nuclear power debate]]s is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable. Quiggin says that we need more [[efficient energy use]] and more [[renewable energy commercialisation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/reviving-nuclear-power-debates-is-a-distraction-we-need-to-use-less-energy |title=Reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction.

As part of his "commitment to public debate", Quiggin has contributed to a wide variety of Parliamentary inquires through submissions and appearances. These include the inquiries into Uranium Mining and Nuclear Power, Land Use in Victoria, the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the Urban Water Inquiry to name a few.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Quiggin |first1=John |title=Professor John Quiggin Researcher |url=https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1211 |website=UQ Researchers |publisher=University of Queensland |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Quiggin |first1=John |title=INQUIRY INTO URANIUM MINING AND NUCLEAR FACILITIES (PROHIBITIONS) REPEAL BILL 2019 |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/lcdocs/submissions/64919/0011%20Professor%20John%20Quiggin.pdf |website=Parliament NSW |publisher=NSW Government |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Quiggin |first1=John |title=Inquiry into the Proposed Long Term Lease of Land Titles and Registry Functions of Land Use Victoria |url=https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/944-epc-lc/inquiry-into-the-proposed-long-term-lease-of-land-titles-and-registry-functions-of-land-use-victoria |website=Parliament Victoria |publisher=Victoria Government |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Quiggin |first1=John |title=Urban Water Policy in Australia: Supply, Demand and Industry Structure |url=https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/urban-water/submissions/sub026.pdf |website=Productivity Commission Australia |publisher=PC Australia |access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref>
