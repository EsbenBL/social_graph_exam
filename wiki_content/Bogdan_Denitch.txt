==Early life==

Denitch was born Bogdan Denis Denić, in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]],<ref name="Svjedok histerije">{{cite book |author= Ninoslav Kopač |author-link= Ninoslav Kopač |date=2012|title=Svjedok histerije |publisher=[[Serb Democratic Forum]] |place=[[Zagreb]] |page=85 |isbn=978-953-57313-2-0}}</ref> to parents of Serbian background.  His father was a Yugoslav diplomat,<ref name="Svjedok histerije"/> who was forced into exile by the Nazis and then by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s communist regime after [[World War II]].  The family emigrated to the United States in 1946.  He enrolled in CUNY (then City College) in 1947, and at age 18 joined the [[Young People's Socialist League]] (YPSL), then the youth affiliate of the social-democratic [[Socialist Party of America]], led by [[Norman Thomas]].<ref>[[Maurice Isserman]], ''The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2000), p. 102.</ref> He helped lead that organization into a merger with the Trotskyist-communist [[Socialist Youth League (US)|Socialist Youth League]] to form the Young Socialist League in 1954.<ref>Maurice Isserman, ''If I Had a Hammer: The Death of the Old Left and the Birth of the New Left'' (New York: Basic Books, 1987),  p. 62.</ref>  He learned machinist skills at Metal Trades High School at night while studying at City College, worked as a journeyman machinist and tool and die maker for 13 years, and was an activist in the [[International Association of Machinists]].  His machinist union card gave him mobility, and he moved to the San Francisco Bay area in 1958.<ref>Maurice Isserman, ''The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2000), p. 223-4.</ref>  He was a member of the San Francisco Central Labor Council, and was active in the [[NAACP]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] from 1948 to 1964.

==Academic career==

In 1964 Denitch moved to Yugoslavia for five years, where he did field research for several sociological projects on unions and on students for [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]].  In 1968 Denitch secured a major research position for a study of elites in Yugoslavia, through the [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] at [[Columbia University]]. He moved back to New York in 1969 to complete work on an MA in sociology at Columbia, awarded in 1970 (the university waived its requirement of a BA degree, which Denitch had never completed).  He received a doctorat d'université from [[University of Paris]] in 1972 for research on the new working class with  Serge Mallet and [[Lucien Goldman]].  He completed his PhD in sociology in 1973 at Columbia with his dissertation on Yugoslavian elites.  He taught at [[Yale University]] in 1972, and moved in 1973 to [[Queens College]] of CUNY, where he remained until his retirement in 1994.<ref name="Postel">Danny Postel, "Citizen of a Lost Country: An Interview with Bogdan Denitch, ''In These Times'', May 14, 2001 [http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/25/12/postel2512.html]</ref>  He was executive officer of the PhD Program in Sociology at [[CUNY Graduate School]] from 1976 through 1988.
