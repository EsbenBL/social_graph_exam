'''Karl Menger''' (January 13, 1902 – October 5, 1985) was an Austrian-American [[mathematician]]. He was the son of the economist [[Carl Menger]]. He is credited with [[Menger's theorem]].  He worked on mathematics of algebras, algebra of geometries, curve and dimension theory, etc.  Moreover, he contributed to game theory and social sciences.

==Biography==
Karl Menger was a student of [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and received his PhD from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1924. [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L. E. J. Brouwer]] invited Menger in 1925 to teach at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. In 1927, he returned to Vienna to accept a professorship there. In 1930 and 1931 he was visiting lecturer at Harvard University and [[Rice University|The Rice Institute]]. From 1937 to 1946 he was a professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]].  From 1946 to 1971, he was a professor at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]]. In 1983, IIT awarded Menger a Doctor of Humane Letters and Sciences degree.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography of Karl Menger |url=http://www.iit.edu/csl/am/about/menger/about.shtml|access-date=2010-12-22|publisher=[[Illinois Institute of Technology]]}}</ref>

==Contributions to mathematics==
[[Image:Menger sponge (IFS).jpg|thumb|Computer illustration of the "Menger sponge".]]
His most famous popular contribution was the [[Menger sponge]] (mistakenly known as [[Waclaw Sierpinski|Sierpinski]]'s sponge), a three-dimensional version of [[Sierpinski carpet|Sierpinski's carpet]]. It is also related to the [[Cantor set]].

With [[Arthur Cayley]], Menger is considered one of the founders of [[distance geometry]]; especially by having formalized definitions to the notions of ''angle'' and of ''curvature'' in terms of directly measurable [[physical quantities]], namely ratios of ''distance'' values. The characteristic mathematical expressions appearing in those definitions are [[Cayley–Menger determinant]]s.

He was an active participant of the [[Vienna Circle]] which had discussions in the 1920s on social science and philosophy. During that time, he published an influential result<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Menger|first=Karl|date=1934-08-01|title=Das Unsicherheitsmoment in der Wertlehre|journal=Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie|language=de|volume=5|issue=4|pages=459–485|doi=10.1007/BF01311578|s2cid=151290589|issn=1617-7134}}</ref> on the [[St. Petersburg paradox#Expected utility theory|St. Petersburg paradox]] with applications to the [[utility theory]] in [[economics]]; this result has since been criticised as fundamentally misleading.<ref>Peters, O. and Gell-Mann, M., 2016. Evaluating gambles using dynamics. ''Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science'', 26(2), p.023103</ref> Later he contributed to the development of [[game theory]] with [[Oskar Morgenstern]].

==Legacy==
Menger's longest and last academic post was at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], which hosts an annual IIT Karl Menger Lecture and offers the IIT Karl Menger Student Award to an exceptional student for scholarship each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Karl Menger|url=http://www.iit.edu/csl/events/archive/remembering_menger.shtml|access-date=2009-03-26|publisher=[[Illinois Institute of Technology]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402052624/http://www.iit.edu/csl/events/archive/remembering_menger.shtml|archive-date=2009-04-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>
