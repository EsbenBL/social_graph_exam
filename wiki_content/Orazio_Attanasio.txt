'''Orazio Attanasio''' (born 31 October 1959, in [[Naples]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[economist]] and the Cowles Professor of Economics at [[Yale University]]. He was the [[Jeremy Bentham]] Chair of Economics at [[University College London]]. He graduated from the [[University of Bologna]] in 1982 and  [[London School of Economics]] in 1988. He then went to teach at [[Stanford]] and was a National Fellow at [[Stanford University|Stanford's]] [[Hoover Institution]] and a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]] before arriving at University College London.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.orazioattanasio.org/biography/|title=Bio – Orazio Attanasio|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> Currently he is also a Research Director at the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] (IFS) in [[London]], co-director of the [https://www.povertyactionlab.org/partners/centre-evaluation-development-policies Centre for the Evaluation of Development Policies] at the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], and a director of the [https://www.ifs.org.uk/research/cpp ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy].<ref name=":0" />

In 2004, Attanasio co-authored an IFS evaluation of an initiative which was designed to improve the lives of children in small [[Colombia]]n towns and villages by paying their mothers to improve their children's food intake; in return, younger children had to have regular medical check-ups and older ones were required to attend school regularly. Begun in 2002, and funded by both the [[World Bank]] and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the project had examined how funds to alleviate poverty and promote development should be targeted. Early results were positive, showing both an increase in the number of children going to school and those enjoying improved diets. Attanasio said, "This evaluation is important, not just for Colombia, but to help us understand how developing countries can best target valuable resources to improve the prospects for their poorest children."<ref name="BBC 21 January 2004">{{cite news |last= Kirby| first= Alex| author-link= Alex Kirby (journalist)|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3406843.stm|title= Poorest paid to feed their young | date= 21 January 2004|website= [[BBC News Online]] | access-date= 19 October 2016 }}</ref>
