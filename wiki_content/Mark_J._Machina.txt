'''Mark Joseph Machina''' (born October 27, 1954) is an [[United States|American]] [[Economics|economist]] noted for work in non-standard [[Consumer theory|decision theory]]. He is currently a [[distinguished professor]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. The [[Marschak–Machina triangle]], a [[probability]] diagram used in [[expected utility theory]], bears his name, along with that of [[Jacob Marschak]].

== Machina Triangle ==

The Machina Triangle is a way of representing a three dimensional probability vector in a two dimensional space. The probability of a given outcome is denoted by a euclidean distance from the point that represents a [[lottery (probability)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.econport.org/econport/request?page=man_ru_advanced_icurves|title=EconPort - Handbook - Decision-Making Under Uncertainty - Indifference Curves}}</ref>
