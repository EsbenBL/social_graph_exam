==Academics==
Hart is an expert on [[contract theory#Economics|contract theory]], [[theory of the firm]], [[corporate finance]], and [[law and economics]]. His research centers on the roles that [[Incomplete contracts|ownership structure and contractual arrangements]] play in the governance and boundaries of corporations. His research has emphasized the importance of contractual incompleteness — the inability of parties to contract on every contingency.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2016/press-release/|access-date=2021-11-13|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> He has used his theoretical work on firms in two legal cases as a government expert (Black and Decker v. U.S.A. and WFC Holdings Corp. (Wells Fargo) v. U.S.A.) where companies claimed tax related benefits as a result from selling some of their business. The government used Hart's research to claim that because the companies retained control of the sold assets, they could not lay claim to the tax benefits.<ref name=harvardbio/><ref name=nytimes/>
