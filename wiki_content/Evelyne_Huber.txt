From 1977 until 1978, Huber was a visiting professor of political science at the [[University of Rhode Island]].<ref name=profile/> She spent the following year lecturing at the [[University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee]], followed by 6 years at the [[College of the Holy Cross]].<ref name=profile/> From 1985 to 1987 she was a professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]], and then at [[Northwestern University]] from 1985 until 1992, when she moved to UNC-Chapel Hill.<ref name=profile/>

==Career==
In addition to publishing articles in journals like ''The [[American Journal of Sociology]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Evelyne |last1=Huber |first2=Charles |last2=Ragin |first3=John D. |last3=Stephens |title=Social Democracy, Christian Democracy, Constitutional Structure and the Welfare State: Towards a Resolution of Quantitative Studies |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=99 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=711–749|doi=10.1086/230321 |s2cid=143531795 }}</ref> the ''[[Latin American Research Review]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Peruvian Military Government, Labor Mobilization, and the Political Strength of the Left |journal=Latin American Research Review |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=57–93}}</ref> and ''[[Comparative Political Studies]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Evelyne |last1=Huber Stephens |first2=John D. |last2=Stephens |title=The Transition to Mass Parties and Ideological Politics: The Jamaican Experience Since 1972 |journal=Comparative Political Studies |volume=19 |issue=4 |date=January 1987 |pages=443–483|doi=10.1177/0010414087019004001 |s2cid=154855976 }}</ref> Huber has edited, written, or co-written 9 books, one of which was solo-authored. That book, called ''The Politics of Workers' Participation: The Peruvian Approach in Comparative Perspective'', was published in 1980. The book studies the role of workers' participation in political conflict. Huber considers workers' participation schemes in three types of political-economic systems: a "liberal-pluralist" type represented by the cases of [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Sweden]], and [[Chile]], a "bureaucratic-centralist" type represented by [[Yugoslavia]], and an "authoritarian-corporatist" type represented by Peru.<ref name=review>{{cite journal |first=Linda |last=Fuller |title=Review of The Politics of Workers' Participation: The Peruvian Approach in Comparative Perspective |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=89 |issue=1 |date=July 1983 |pages=249–252|doi=10.1086/227855 }}</ref> Linda Fuller, reviewing the work in the ''American Journal of Sociology'', writes that one interesting finding that emerges from the book is that worker's participation schemes that aim to increase identification with the workplace and the social system can ironically mobilize workers to make demands of the system, and also that "if there is no strong and unified working-class political organization at the national level, they are extremely vulnerable", which itself may not even be sufficient.<ref name=review/>

Huber's subsequent work has also largely focused on the relationship between economic structure and democratic movements in Latin America, the influence of workers on policy, and the politics of welfare and income inequality.<ref name=profile/> Several of these works, including her 1992 book ''Capitalist Development and Democracy'', have won multiple prizes and continue to be heavily cited.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjDsq1EAAAAJ&hl=en |title=Evelyne Huber |publisher=Google Scholar |date=23 January 2020 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> Three of Huber's books have won the Outstanding Book Award from the Political Sociology section of the [[American Sociological Association]], and she has won a number of other awards from the American Sociological Association and the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref name=apsa>{{cite web |url=https://www.apsanet.org/ABOUT/Governance/2017-Council-Nominations/Evelyne-Huber |title=Evelyne Huber |publisher=American Political Science Association |year=2017 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>

Huber has also served in several notable service positions in political science and Latin American Studies. In 2006, Huber became the chair of the Department of Political Science at UNC-Chapel Hill, a position she held until 2017.<ref name=apsa/> From 2012 to 2013, she was the president of the [[Latin American Studies Association]], having previously been its vice president for 2 years.<ref name=profile/> She also for several years ran the Comparative Politics section of the American Political Science Association.<ref name=profile/>

Huber has had one of the largest impacts of any active political scientist, as measured by citations. In a 2019 citation analysis by the political scientists Hannah June Kim and [[Bernard Grofman]], Huber was listed as the 16th most cited woman in political science at an American university, and one of the 25 most cited political scientists who obtained their PhD between 1975 and 1979.<ref name=kim19/> Huber's significant impact has been recognized with a number of notable awards. In 2009, she received the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which is given to people "who have demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts".<ref name=guggenheim>{{cite web |url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/evelyne-huber/ |title=EVELYNE HUBER |publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |year=2009 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> In 2010, Huber received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Bern]].<ref name=bern>{{cite web |url=https://kellogg.nd.edu/news/award-recipient-evelyne-huber |title=Award Recipient - Evelyne Huber |publisher=Kellogg Institute, University of Notre Dame |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> She was also a co-recipient of the 2019 Guillermo O'Donnell Democracy Award from the Latin American Studies Association, which recognizes "outstanding scholarship in the field of democracy studies".<ref name=lasa>{{cite web |url=https://www.lasaweb.org/en/news/lasa2019/awardees/ |title=Congratulations to the LASA2019 Awardees |publisher=Latin American Studies Association |date=11 January 2019 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>
