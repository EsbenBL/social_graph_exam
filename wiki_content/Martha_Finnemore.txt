== Biography ==
She is best known for her books ''National Interests in International Society,'' ''The Purpose of Intervention,'' and ''Rules for the World'' (with [[Michael_N._Barnett|Michael Barnett]]) which helped to pioneer constructivism. 

According to a review of her 1996 book ''National Interests in International Society'', Finnemore became "the first scholar of international relations to offer a sustained, systematic empirical argument in support of the constructivist claim that [[Social norm|international normative structures]] matter in world politics."<ref name=":1" />

In ''The Purpose of Intervention'' (2003)'','' she finds that the types of military interventions that states engage in have changed over time. For example, it was accepted practice for states to intervene militarily to collect debts during the 19th century, but it became widely rejected in the 20th century. Similarly, she shows that the type and frequency of humanitarian interventions have changed drastically since the 19th century, with a massive increase in humanitarian interventions since the end of the Cold War. According to Finnemore, existing realist and liberal theories of international relations cannot account for these changes. Using a constructivist approach, she finds that changing normative contexts led states to conceive of their interests differently. International norms altered common understandings of the appropriate ends and means of military intervention, as well as which humans were deserving of military protection by outsiders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Finnemore|first=Martha|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt24hg32|title=The Purpose of Intervention: Changing Beliefs About the Use of Force|date=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-3845-5|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt24hg32}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dessler|first1=David|last2=Owen|first2=John|date=2005|title=Constructivism and the Problem of Explanation: A Review Article|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3689039|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=3|pages=597–610|doi=10.1017/S1537592705050371|jstor=3689039|s2cid=145089464|issn=1537-5927}}</ref> 

In ''Rules for the World'' (2004), Finnemore and Barnett argue that international organizations derive power and autonomy from their [[rational-legal authority]] and control of information.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Blyth|first1=Mark|last2=Helgadottir|first2=Oddny|last3=Kring|first3=William|editor1-first=Orfeo|editor1-last=Fioretos|editor2-first=Tulia G|editor2-last=Falleti|editor3-first=Adam|editor3-last=Sheingate|date=2016-03-17|title=Ideas and Historical Institutionalism|url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199662814.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199662814-e-8|access-date=2021-02-28|website=The Oxford Handbook of Historical Institutionalism|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199662814.001.0001|isbn=9780199662814}}</ref> International organizations are therefore purposive social agents that can act inconsistently with the intentions of the founders of the organizations (which are often states). In contrast to some [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] and [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberal]] theories of international relations, Barnett and Finnemore show that international organizations are not just a reflection of state interests and that they do not necessarily act efficiently. International organizations can develop bureaucratic cultures that result in adverse outcomes (what they call "pathologies"). They list five mechanisms that breed organizational pathologies:<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Michael|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7591/9780801465161|title=Rules for the World|last2=Finnemore|first2=Martha|date=2012|publisher=Cornell University Press|doi=10.7591/9780801465161|isbn=978-0-8014-6516-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ege|first=Jörn|date=2020-11-23|title=What International Bureaucrats (Really) Want: Administrative Preferences in International Organization Research|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/gg/26/4/article-p577_5.xml|journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=577–600|doi=10.1163/19426720-02604003|issn=1942-6720|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

# '''Irrationality of rationalization''': when an organization sticks to existing rules and procedures regardless of circumstances rather than act in ways most appropriate for the circumstances
# '''Universalism''': the application of universal rules and categories may not reflect specific contexts 
# '''Normalization of deviance''': deviations from existing rules can become normalized and lead to aberrational behaviors
# '''Organizational insulation''': when organizations do not get feedback from the environment about their performance and are unable to update their behavior
# '''Cultural contestation''': different cultures within an organization may lead to clashes that produce adverse outcomes

Her 1998 study, co-authored with [[Kathryn Sikkink]], on the life cycle of norms is among the most cited articles published in ''[[International Organization (journal)|International Organization]]'', the leading International Relations journal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=International Organization {{!}} Most cited|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/most-cited|access-date=2021-03-20|website=Cambridge Core|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Sandholtz|first=Wayne|date=2017-06-28|title=International Norm Change|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.588|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics|isbn=9780190228637|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Jack|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/50422990|title="Is" and "Ought": Evaluating Empirical Aspects of Normative Research|work=Progress in International Relations Theory|publisher=MIT Press|year=2003|isbn=0-262-05068-4|pages=371|oclc=50422990}}</ref> Finnemore and Sikkink identify three stages in the life cycle of a norm:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Owen IV|first=John|url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691142395/the-clash-of-ideas-in-world-politics|title=The Clash of Ideas in World Politics|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-691-14239-5|pages=76|language=en}}</ref>

# '''Norm emergence''': Norm entrepreneurs seek to persuade others to adopt their ideas about what is desirable and appropriate
# '''Norm cascade''': When a norm has broad acceptance, with norm leaders pressuring others to adopt and adhere to the norm
# '''Norm internalization''': When the norm has acquired a "taken-for-granted" quality where compliance with the norm is nearly automatic
