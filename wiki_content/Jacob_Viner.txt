'''Jacob Viner'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|aɪ|n|ər}}.}} (3 May 1892 – 12 September 1970) was a Canadian [[economist]] and is considered with [[Frank Knight]] and [[Henry Calvert Simons|Henry Simons]] to be one of the "inspiring" mentors of the early [[Chicago school of economics]] in the 1930s: he was one of the leading figures of the [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] faculty.<ref>[[Alan O. Ebenstein]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tpFfjxshO08C&pg=PA164 Hayek's journey: the mind of Friedrich Hayek]'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, pp. 164–165</ref> [[Paul Samuelson]] named Viner (along with [[Harry Gunnison Brown]], [[Allyn Abbott Young]], [[Henry Ludwell Moore]], [[Frank Knight]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], and [[Henry Schultz]]) as one of the several "American saints in [[economics]]" born after 1860.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Christopher Keith |title=Harry Gunnison Brown: economist |url=https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13098&context=rtd |publisher=Iowa State University |date=1985 |access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref> He was an important figure in the field of political economy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Benjamin J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H79WVDwMzCEC|title=International Political Economy: An Intellectual History|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13569-4|pages=20|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Viner was born to a [[Jewish]] family<ref>edited by Stephen Harlan Norwood, Eunice G. Pollack [https://books.google.com/books?id=IB3mBsgfIHQC&pg=PA720&lpg=PA720&dq=Jacob+Viner#v=onepage&q=Jacob%20Viner&f=false Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1] August 2007</ref> on May 3, 1892, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], to [[Romania]]n immigrant parents. He earned his undergraduate degree at [[McGill University]] in 1914. He received a [[PhD]] at [[Harvard University]], where he wrote his dissertation, under the trade economist [[F.&nbsp;W. Taussig]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/viner_jacob.html|title=Viner, Jacob|work=etcweb.princeton.edu|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>

==Academic career==
{{Chicago school (economics)}}
Viner was a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1916 to 1917 and from 1919 to 1946. At various times, Viner also taught at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities and twice went to the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1946 he left for [[Princeton University]], where he remained until his retirement, in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|access-date=2009-10-11|title=Jacon Viner|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/629468/Jacob-Viner|publisher= britannica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Leitch|first=Alexander|year=1978|access-date=2009-10-11|title= Viner, Jacob|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/viner_jacob.html|publisher= Princeton University Press}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton from 1947 to 1948 and a permanent member there from 1950 to 1970.<ref>{{cite web|year=2016|access-date=2016-01-06|title=Jacob Viner|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/629468/Jacob-Viner|publisher= britannica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Leitch|first=Alexander|year=1978|access-date=2009-10-11|title= Viner, Jacob|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/viner_jacob.html|publisher= Princeton University Press}}</ref>

Nobel laureate [[Milton Friedman]] studied under Viner while he was at the [[University of Chicago]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Viner died on September 12, 1970, in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]].

==Public service==
Viner played a role in government, most notably as an advisor to [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] during the administration of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. During [[World War II]], he served as co-rapporteur to the economic and financial group of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]' "[[War and Peace Studies]]" project, along with Harvard economist [[Alvin Hansen]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Council on Foreign Relations and American Foreign Policy in the Early Cold War
|author=Michael Wala|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=1994|pages=38|quote=The rapporteurs of the Economic and Financial Group}}</ref>

== Work ==
===Economics===
Viner was a noted opponent of [[John Maynard Keynes]] during the [[Great Depression]]. While he agreed with the policies of government spending pushed by Keynes, Viner argued that Keynes's analysis was flawed and would not stand in the long run.

Known for his economic modeling of the [[wikt:firm|firm]], including the [[long run and short run|long- and the short-run]] [[cost curve]]s, his work is still used today.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jacob |last=Viner |year=1931 |title=Cost Curves and Supply Curves |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=23–46 |jstor=41792520 |doi=10.1007/BF01316299 |s2cid=153899081 }} Reprinted in R.&nbsp;B. Emmett, ed. 2002, ''The Chicago Tradition in Economics, 1892–1945'', Routledge, v. 6, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwhrYnGEYdoC&pg=PA192 192–215].</ref>

Viner is further known for having added the terms ''[[trade creation]]'' and ''[[trade diversion]]'' to the canon of economics in 1950. He also made important contributions to the theory of international trade and to the history of economic thought. While he was at Chicago, Viner co-edited the ''Journal of Political Economy'' with [[Frank Knight]].

His work, ''Studies in the Theory of International Trade'' (1937), discusses the [[history of economic thought]] and is a historical source for the [[Bullionism|Bullionist]] controversy in 19th-century Britain.

===Atomic bomb===
Viner spoke at the Conference on Atomic Energy Control in 1945, stating "that the [[atomic bomb]] was the cheapest way yet devised of killing human beings" and that atomic bombs "will be peacemaking in effect," perhaps making him the founder of [[nuclear deterrence]].<ref>{{cite book
