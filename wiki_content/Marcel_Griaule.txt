'''Marcel Griaule''' (16 May 1898 &ndash; 23 February 1956) was a [[France|French]] author and [[anthropology|anthropologist]] known for his studies of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] people of [[West Africa]],<ref>"[http://www.berose.fr/spip.php?article592 Démasquer la société dogon. Sahara-Soudan (janvier-avril 1935)", Éric JOLLY,  Les Carnets de Bérose n° 4, Lahic / DPRPS-Direction des patrimoines, 2014]</ref> and for pioneering [[ethnographic]] field studies in France. He worked together with [[Germaine Dieterlen]] and [[Jean Rouch]] on African subjects. His publications number over 170 books and articles for scholarly journals.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Aisy-sur-Armançon]], Griaule received a good education and was preparing to become an engineer and enrolled at the prestigious [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] when in 1917 at the end of [[World War I]] he volunteered to become a [[Aviator|pilot]] in the [[French Air Force]].

In 1920 he returned to university, where he attended the lectures of [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Marcel Cohen]]. Intrigued by anthropology, he gave up plans for a technical career. In 1927 he received a degree from the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|École Nationale de Langues Orientales]], where he concentrated on [[Amharic]] and [[Ge'ez]].

Between 1928 and 1933 Griaule participated in two large-scale ethnographic expeditions—one to [[Ethiopia]] and the ambitious [[Dakar]] to [[Djibouti]] expedition which crossed Africa. On the latter expedition he first visited the [[Dogon people|Dogon]], the ethnic group with whom he would be forever associated.

In 1933 he received a diploma from the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in religion.

Throughout the 1930s Griaule and his student [[Germaine Dieterlen]] undertook several group expeditions to the Dogon area in [[Mali]]. During these trips Griaule pioneered the use of aerial photography, surveying, and teamwork to study other cultures. In 1938 he produced his dissertation and received a doctorate based on his Dogon research.

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] Griaule was drafted again in the French Air Force and after the war he served as the inaugural professor of the first chair of anthropology at the [[University of Paris - Sorbonne]]. He died in 1956 in Paris.

Griaule is remembered for his work with the blind hunter [[Ogotemmeli]] and his elaborate exegeses of [[Dogon creation myth|Dogon myth]] ( [[:fr:Cosmogonie dogon|fr]] )—(including the [[Nommo]]) and ritual.<ref>[http://thenummo.com/dogon.html The Dogon] – article at [http://thenummo.com/ The Numo]</ref> His study of Dogon masks remains one of the fundamental works on the topic. A number of anthropologists are highly critical of his work and argue that his claims about [[Sirius]] and his elaborate accounts of cosmic eggs and mystic vibrations do not accurately reflect [[Dogon religion|Dogon belief]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/apter/Cahiers.pdf| title = Griaule’s Legacy: Rethinking "la parole claire" in Dogon Studies| author = Andrew Apter, ''[[Cahiers d'Études africaines]]'', XLV (1), 177, (2005), pp. 95-129}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/dogon.html| title = The Dogon Revisited| access-date = 2007-10-13| author = Bernard R.
