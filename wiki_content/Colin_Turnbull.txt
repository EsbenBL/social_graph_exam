'''Colin Macmillan Turnbull''' (November 23, 1924 – July 28, 1994) was a British-American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who came to public attention with the popular books ''[[The Forest People]]'' (on the [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]] [[Pygmy|Pygmies]] of [[Zaire]]) and ''[[The Mountain People]]'' (on the [[Ik people|Ik]] people of [[Uganda]]), and  one of the first anthropologists to work in the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

==Early life==
Turnbull was born in London and educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he studied politics and philosophy. During [[World War II]] he was in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] after which he was awarded a two-year grant in the Department of Indian Religion and Philosophy, [[Banaras Hindu University]], India, from which he graduated with a master's degree in Indian Religion and Philosophy.

==Career==
In 1951, after his graduation from Banaras, Turnbull traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) with Newton Beal, a schoolteacher from [[Ohio]] he met in India. Turnbull and Beal first studied the Mbuti [[pygmies]] during this time, though that was not the goal of the trip.

An "odd job" Turnbull picked up while in Africa at this time was working for the [[Hollywood]] producer [[Sam Spiegel]]. Spiegel hired Turnbull to assist in the construction and transportation of a boat needed for his film. This boat was the [[African Queen (boat)|''African Queen'']], which was used for the feature film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]]; 1951).<ref>Grinker, 70–71</ref> After his first trip to Africa, Turnbull traveled to [[Yellowknife]] in the Northwest Territories, where he worked as a [[geologist]] and gold miner for a year,<ref>Grinker, 87–89</ref> before he went back to school to obtain another degree.

Upon returning to Oxford in 1954,  Turnbull began specializing in the anthropology of Africa. He remained in Oxford for two years before another field trip to Africa, finally focusing on the Belgian Congo (1957–58) and [[Uganda]]. After years of fieldwork, he finally achieved his anthropology doctorate from Oxford in 1964.

Turnbull became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1965, after he moved to [[New York City]] to become [[curator]] in charge of African Ethnology at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1959. He later resided in [[Lancaster County, Virginia|Lancaster County]], and was on staff in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Other professional associations included [[corresponding member]]ship of [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] and a fellowship in the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|British Royal Anthropological Institute]]. He first gained prominence with his book ''[[The Forest People]]'' (1961), a study of the [[Mbuti people]].

In 1972, having been commissioned to come up with an explanation and solution to the difficulties experienced by the Ik people, the controversial ''[[The Mountain People]]'' was published.  The Ik were a [[hunter-gatherer]] tribe who had been forced to stop moving around ancestral lands, through the seasons, because it now involved the three national borders of Uganda, Kenya and Sudan. Forced to become stationary in Uganda, and without a knowledge base and culture for survival under such conditions, they failed to thrive, even to the point of starvation and death.

''The Mountain People'' was later adapted into a theatrical work by playwright [[Peter Brook]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Production of The Ik {{!}} Theatricalia|url=https://theatricalia.com/play/a0/the-ik/production/1dt|website=theatricalia.com|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

===Contributions to music===
Some of Turnbull's recordings of Mbuti music were commercially released, and his works inspired other [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] studies, such as those of [[Simha Arom]] and [[Mauro Campagnoli]].  His  recording of ''Music of the Rainforest Pygmies'', recorded in 1961, was released on CD by Lyrichord Discs, Inc. His recording of a Zaire pygmy girls' initiation song was used on the [[Voyager Golden Record]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Voyager - Music on the Golden Record|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/music/|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Turnbull's partner, [[Joseph Towles|Joseph Allen Towles]], was born in [[Senora, Virginia]], on August 17, 1937. In 1957 he moved to New York City to pursue a career as an actor and writer. He met Turnbull in 1959 and they exchanged marriage vows the following year.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Inventory of the Joseph A. Towles Papers, circa 1920s-2009|url=https://avery.cofc.edu/archives/Towles_Joseph_A.html|website=Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

From 1965 to 1967, Turnbull and Towles conducted fieldwork among the Ik of [[Northern Uganda]] in Africa. In the Congo in 1970, they conducted fieldwork on the Nkumbi [[circumcision]] initiation ritual for boys and the Asa myth of origin among the [[Mbo people (Congo)|Mbo]] of the [[Ituri Rainforest|Ituri forest]].

In 1979, they traveled studying the concept of tourism as pilgrimage. Towles criticised Turnbull's semi-autobiographical work ''The Human Cycle'' (1983), which omitted all references to their relationship.<ref name=":0" />

Turnbull arranged for Towles' research to be published posthumously. It appeared in 1993 as ''Nkumbi initiation ritual and structure among the Mbo of Zaïre'' and as ''Asa: Myth of Origin of the Blood Brotherhood Among the Mbo of the Ituri Forest'', both in ''Annales'' of the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] (Tervuren, Belgium), vol. 137.<ref>Open Library: [https://openlibrary.org/b/OL839785M/Nkumbi_initiation Nkumbi initiation]</ref><ref>University of Virginia Library: [http://virgobeta.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u2402463 Asa: Myth of Origin...]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Later years==
Late in life Turnbull took up the political cause of [[death row]] inmates. After his partner's death, Turnbull donated all his belongings to the [[United Negro College Fund]]. He donated all their research materials, most of which were the product of his career, to the [[College of Charleston]], insisting that the collection be known under Towles' name alone.<ref>Avery Research Center: [http://avery.cofc.edu/archives/Towles_Joseph_A.html Inventory of the Joseph A. Towles Papers, circa 1920s - 2009]</ref>

In 1989, Turnbull moved to [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]], to participate in the building of [[Tibetan Cultural Center]] with his friend [[Thupten Jigme Norbu]], elder brother of the [[Tenzin Gyatso|14th Dalai Lama]]. Later Turnbull moved to [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], India where he took the monks' vow of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], given to him by the [[Dalai Lama]]. Turnbull's partner, Joseph A Towles died of AIDS in 1988, and Turnbull had Towles book "Nkumbi Initiation and Asa: Myth of Origin of the Blood Brotherhood Among the Mbo of the Ituri Forest" published posthumously. Turnbull himself died of AIDS in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://avery.cofc.edu/archives/Towles_Joseph_A.html|title=Inventory of the Joseph A.

==Controversy==
[[Bernd Heine]] exemplifies the strong reaction evoked by Turnbull's evaluation of the Ik in a 1985 article.<ref>[http://www.internationalafricaninstitute.org/journal.html ''Africa''], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1159836 The Mountain People: Some Notes on the Ik of North-Eastern Uganda]</ref> Using information gained 20 years after Turnbull's researches, he provided new information that appeared to discredit the portrayal of the Ik provided by Turnbull.
Many people{{who|date=January 2013}} found Turnbull's accounts of the Ik disturbing, however, his graphic descriptions were placed into context by interviews he did with older Ik to contrast the older society that existed prior to displacement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} BBC Radio 4 broadcast 10 March 2021 a review by [[Matthew Syed]] of the influence of Turnbull's ''Mountain People'' and its subsequent reassessment and revision by anthropologists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000synk|title=Sideways - 5.
