In the spring of 1969, he was one of only a few analysts who correctly envisioned the recession at year's end,<ref name="auto"/> and was almost a lone voice in 1973, when he forecast a monolithic international inventory-building fling, followed by the first significant recession since the [[Great Depression]].

In the late 1970s, while most analysts presumed that waxing inflation would go on unabated, Shilling was the first to predict that America's infirm political climate would impede it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/celebritytalentbios/A.-Gary-Shilling|title = A. Gary Shilling Biography &#124; Booking Info for Speaking Engagements}}</ref>  He also foresaw various dangerous economic readjustment problems and a shift in investment strategy from a preference for tangible assets to an increased emphasis on stocks and bonds.

In June 2011, he predicted a 20% drop in housing in 2012 with a resulting global recession.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/20-drop-housing-cause-recession-2012-says-gary-161445494.html|title=20% Drop in Housing to Cause Recession in 2012, Says Gary Shilling|website=finance.yahoo.com}}</ref>

In August 2015, he predicted that the price of oil "is headed for $10 to $20 per barrel" (it was $43/barrel at the time) due to higher productivity through fracking and OPEC not limiting production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-14/here-s-why-supply-and-demand-means-30-oil|title=Here's Why Supply and Demand Means $30 Oil|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref>
