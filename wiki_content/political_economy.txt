The earliest works of political economy are usually attributed to the British scholars [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]], although they were preceded by the work of the French [[physiocrats]], such as [[François Quesnay]] (1694–1774) and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]] (1727–1781).<ref name="Steiner 2003 p62">Steiner (2003), pp. 61–62</ref> There is also a tradition which is almost as long, of [[critique of political economy]].

==Etymology==
Originally, political economy meant the study of the conditions under which production or consumption within limited parameters was organized in nation-states. In that way, political economy expanded the emphasis of economics, which comes from the Greek ''oikos'' (meaning "home") and ''nomos'' (meaning "law" or "order"). Political economy was thus meant to express the laws of production of wealth at the state level, quite like economics concerns putting home to order. The phrase ''économie politique'' (translated in English to "political economy") first appeared in France in 1615 with the well-known book by [[Antoine de Montchrétien]], ''Traité de l’economie politique''. Other contemporary scholars attribute the roots of this study to the 13th Century [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian Arab]] [[Historian]] and [[Sociology|Sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], for his work on making the distinction between "profit" and "sustenance", in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively. He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]''. In Al-Muqaddimah Khaldun states, “Civilization and its well-being, as well as business prosperity, depend on productivity and people’s efforts in all directions in their own interest and profit” – seen as a modern precursor to [[Classical economics|Classical Economic thought.]]

Leading on from this, the French [[physiocrats]] were the first major exponents of political economy,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bertholet|first=Auguste|date=2020-05-27|title=The intellectual origins of Mirabeau|journal=History of European Ideas|volume=47|pages=91–96|doi=10.1080/01916599.2020.1763745|s2cid=219747599|issn=0191-6599}}</ref> although the intellectual responses of [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Henry George]] and [[Karl Marx]] to the physiocrats generally receives much greater attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://poec.athabascau.ca/what/|title=What is Political Economy?|website=Political Economy, Athabasca University|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-15}}</ref> The world's first professorship in political economy was established in 1754 at the [[University of Naples Federico II]] in [[Kingdom of Naples|southern Italy]]. The Neapolitan philosopher [[Antonio Genovesi]] was the first tenured professor. In 1763, [[Joseph von Sonnenfels]] was appointed a Political Economy chair at the [[University of Vienna]], Austria. [[Thomas Malthus]], in 1805, became England's first professor of political economy, at the [[East India Company College]], Haileybury, [[Hertfordshire]]. At present, political economy refers to different yet related approaches to studying economic and related behaviours, ranging from the combination of economics with other fields to the use of different, fundamental assumptions challenging earlier economic assumptions:

Other important landmarks in the development of political economy include:
* [[New political economy]] which may treat economic ideologies as the phenomenon to explain, per the traditions of Marxian political economy. Thus, [[Charles S. Maier]] suggests that a political economy approach "interrogates economic doctrines to disclose their sociological and political premises.... in sum, [it] regards economic ideas and behavior not as frameworks for analysis, but as beliefs and actions that must themselves be explained".<ref>Mayer, Charles S. (1987). ''In Search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,  pp.3–6. [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1135479/?site_locale=en_GB Description] and scrollable [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nKOHoyAMnugC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=false#v=onepage&q=false&f=false preview.]  Cambridge.</ref> This approach informs [[Andrew Gamble]]'s ''The Free Economy and the Strong State'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1988), and [[Colin Hay]]'s ''The Political Economy of New Labour'' (Manchester University Press, 1999). It also informs much work published in ''New Political Economy'', an international journal founded by Sheffield University scholars in 1996.<ref>cf: Baker, David (2006). [http://davidlewisbaker.net/baker_political_economy_of_fascism "The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623033918/http://davidlewisbaker.net/baker_political_economy_of_fascism |date=2011-06-23 }}, ''New Political Economy'', 11(2), pp. 227–250.</ref>
* [[International political economy]] (IPE) an interdisciplinary field comprising approaches to the actions of various actors. According to International Relations scholar Chris Brown, [[University of Warwick]] professor, [[Susan Strange]], was "almost single-handedly responsible for creating international political economy as a field of study."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chris|date=July 1999|title=Susan Strange—a critical appreciation|journal=Review of International Studies|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=531–535|doi=10.1017/S0260210599005318|issn=1469-9044|doi-access=free}}</ref> In the United States, these approaches are associated with the journal ''[[International Organization]]'', which in the 1970s became the leading journal of IPE under the editorship of [[Robert Keohane]], [[Peter J. Katzenstein]] and [[Stephen Krasner]]. They are also associated with the journal ''[[The Review of International Political Economy]]''. There also is a more critical school of IPE, inspired by thinkers such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Karl Polanyi]]; two major figures are [[Matthew Watson (political economist)|Matthew Watson]] and [[Robert W. Cox]].<ref>Cohen, Benjamin J. "The transatlantic divide: Why are American and British IPE so different?", ''Review of International Political Economy'', Vol. 14, No. 2, May 2007.</ref>
* The use of a political economy approach by anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers used in reference to the regimes of politics or [[economic value]]s that emerge primarily at the level of states or regional governance, but also within smaller social groups and [[social network]]s. Because these regimes influence and are influenced by the organization of both [[social capital|social]] and [[economic capital]], the analysis of dimensions lacking a standard economic value (e.g. the political economy of language, of gender, or of religion) often draws on concepts used in Marxian critiques of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capital]]. Such approaches expand on [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxian]] scholarship related to [[economic development|development]] and [[underdevelopment]] postulated by [[André Gunder Frank]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].
* [[Historian]]s have employed political economy to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests.<ref>McCoy, Drew R. "The Elusive Republic: Political Economy in Jeffersonian America", Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina.</ref>
* Political economy and law is a recent attempt within legal scholarship to engage explicitly with political economy literature. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Legal realism|legal realists]] (e.g. [[Robert Lee Hale|Robert Hale]]) and intellectuals (e.g. [[John R. Commons|John Commons]]) engaged themes related to political economy. In the second half of the 20th century, lawyers associated with the Chicago School incorporated certain intellectual traditions from economics. However, since the crisis in 2007 legal scholars especially related to [[international law]], have turned to more explicitly engage with the debates, methodology and various themes within political economy texts.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dkennedy/publications/PoliticalEconomy.pdf|title = Law and the Political Economy of the World|last = Kennedy|first = David|date = 2013|journal = Leiden Journal of International Law|volume = 26|pages = 7–48|doi = 10.1017/S0922156512000635|s2cid = 153363066|access-date = December 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Research Handbook on Political Economy and Law|last = Haskell|first = John D.|publisher = Edward Elgar|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-78100-534-7}}</ref>
* [[Thomas Piketty]]'s approach and call to action which advocated for the re-introduction of political consideration and political science knowledge more generally into the discipline of economics as a way of improving the robustness of the discipline and remedying its shortcomings, which had become clear following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]].<ref>''Capital in the Twenty-First Century,'' [[Harvard University Press]]'', 2014, {{ISBN|978-0674430006}}''</ref>
* In 2010, the only Department of Political Economy in the [[United Kingdom]] formally established at [[King's College London]]. The rationale for this academic unit was that "the disciplines of Politics and Economics are inextricably linked", and that it was "not possible to properly understand political processes without exploring the economic context in which politics operates".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/political-economy/about/index | title=About Political Economy &#124; Department of Political Economy &#124; King's College London}}</ref>
* In 2017, the Political Economy UK Group (abbreviated PolEconUK) was established as a research consortium in the field of political economy. It hosts an annual conference and counts among its member institutions [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], [[King's College London]], [[Warwick University]] and the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.poleconuk.net/ |title = Home |website=The Political Economy UK Group }}</ref>

==Related disciplines==
Because political economy is not a unified discipline, there are studies using the term that overlap in subject matter, but have radically different perspectives:<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-economy|title=political economy|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-15|language=en}}</ref>
* [[Politics]] studies power relations and their relationship to achieving desired ends.
* [[Philosophy]] rigorously assesses and studies a set of beliefs and their applicability to reality.
* [[Economics]] studies the distribution of resources so that the material wants of a society are satisfied; enhance societal well-being.
* [[Sociology]] studies the effects of persons' involvement in society as members of groups and how that changes their ability to function. Many sociologists start from a perspective of production-determining relation from [[Karl Marx]]. Marx's theories on the subject of political economy are contained in his book  ''[[Das Kapital]]''.
* [[Political Economy in anthropology|Anthropology]] studies political economy by investigating regimes of political and economic value that condition tacit aspects of sociocultural practices (e.g. the pejorative use of [[Mock Spanish|pseudo-Spanish]] expressions in the U.S. entertainment media) by means of broader historical, political and sociological processes. Analyses of structural features of transnational processes focus on the interactions between the world capitalist system and local cultures.
* [[Archaeology]] attempts to reconstruct past political economies by examining the material evidence for administrative strategies to control and mobilize resources.<ref>Hirth, Kenneth G. 1996. Political Economy and Archaeology: Perspectives on Exchange and Production. ''Journal of Archaeological Research'', 4(3):203–239.</ref> This evidence may include architecture, animal remains, evidence for craft workshops, evidence for feasting and ritual, evidence for the import or export of prestige goods, or evidence for food storage.
* [[Psychology]] is the fulcrum on which political economy exerts its force in studying decision making (not only in prices), but as the field of study whose assumptions model political economy.
* [[Geography]] studies political economy within the wider geographical studies of human-environment interactions wherein economic actions of humans transform the natural environment. Apart from these, attempts have been made to develop a geographical political economy that prioritises commodity production and "spatialities" of capitalism.
* [[History]] documents change, often using it to argue political economy; some historical works take political economy as the narrative's frame.
* [[Ecology]] deals with political economy because human activity has the greatest effect upon the environment, its central concern being the environment's suitability for human activity. The ecological effects of economic activity spur research upon changing market economy incentives. Additionally and more recently, ecological theory has been used to examine economic systems as similar systems of interacting species (e.g., firms).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=Robert M.|last2=Levin|first2=Simon A.|last3=Sugihara|first3=George|title=Ecology for bankers|journal=Nature|volume=451|date=February 21, 2008|issue=7181|pages=893–895|doi=10.1038/451893a|pmid=18288170|doi-access=free}}</ref>
* [[Cultural studies]] examines social class, production, labor, race, gender and sex.
* [[Communications]] examines the institutional aspects of media and telecommunication systems. As the area of study focusing on aspects of human communication, it pays particular attention to the relationships between owners, labor, consumers, advertisers, structures of production and the state and the power relationships embedded in these relationships.
