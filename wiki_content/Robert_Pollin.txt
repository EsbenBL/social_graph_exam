'''Robert Pollin''' (born September 29, 1950) is an American [[economist]]. He is a professor of [[economics]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and founding co-director of its [[Political Economy Research Institute]] (PERI). He has been described as a [[leftist]] economist<ref>{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=James G.|title=Review of Social Economy Vol. 63, No. 2|date=June 2005|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|pages=299–301}}</ref> and is a supporter of [[egalitarianism]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steelman|first1=Aaron|title=Breaking into the Mainstream|url=https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2014/q2/pdf/profession.pdf|website=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]]|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
He was the economic spokesperson in [[Jerry Brown]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992 campaign for President of the United States]].

Pollin moved to the University of Massachusetts Amherst's economic department from [[University of California, Riverside]] in 1998. According to [[Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]], Pollin's department is described as being "left Keynesians, but the Keynesianism is the theoretical frame. Marxism, for sure, is not" while Pollin states that he would be happy to hire [[Marxist]]s but that economics departments do not produce them any longer.<ref name=WPost>{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Inside the offbeat economics department that debunked Reinhart-Rogoff|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/24/inside-the-offbeat-economics-department-that-debunked-reinhart-rogoff/|accessdate=22 August 2015|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=24 April 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Pollin, with [[Thomas Herndon]] and Michael Ash from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], published a paper which found several errors in [[Carmen Reinhart]]'s and [[Kenneth Rogoff]]'s widely cited 2010 paper, "[[Growth in a Time of Debt]]".<ref>{{cite document |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf |title=Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth?
