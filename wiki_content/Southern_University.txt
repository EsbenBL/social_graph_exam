'''Southern University and A&M College''' ('''Southern University''', '''Southern''', '''SUBR''' or '''SU''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] [[land-grant university]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].  It is the largest historically black college or university (HBCU) in [[Louisiana]], a member-school of the [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]], and the [[Flagship university|flagship institution]] of the [[Southern University System]]. Its campus encompasses 512 acres, with an agricultural experimental station on an additional 372-acre site, five miles north of the main campus on Scott's Bluff overlooking the [[Mississippi River]] in the northern section of Baton Rouge.

Southern University's 13 intercollegiate athletics teams are known as the [[Southern Jaguars and Lady Jaguars|Jaguars]], and are members of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC) in [[NCAA Division I]].  The [[Human Jukebox]] is a well known collegiate marching band that has been representing the university since 1947.

==History==
[[File:McKinleyReception2May1901SouthernUniversityNOLA.jpeg|left|thumb|President [[William McKinley]] speaks at Southern University in New Orleans, 1901.]]
At the 1879 Louisiana State [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]], African-American political leaders [[P.B.S. Pinchback]], [[Theophile T. Allain]] and [[Henry Demas]] proposed founding a higher education institution "for the education of [[persons of color]]." Louisiana before the American Civil War had an established class of [[free people of color]], who were often property owners and educated; they kept that tradition for their children.

In 1880, the Louisiana [[Legislature|General Assembly]] chartered what was then called Southern University for Colored Students, originally located in [[New Orleans]]. Southern opened its doors on {{Start date|1881|03|07}} with 12 students. The school was held for a time at the former Israel Sinai [[Synagogue|Temple]] on Calliope Street, between St. Charles and Camp streets.

In 1890, the legislature designated Southern as a [[land grant]] college for blacks, in order to continue to satisfy federal requirements under the land grant program to support higher education for all students in the state, despite having a segregated system. It established an Agricultural and [[mechanical engineering|Mechanical]] department.

The 1904 "Picayune Guide to New Orleans" described the University, then on the 5100 block of Magazine Street in [[Uptown New Orleans]],  as "for the education of colored persons. Coeducation is in force here. The school is excellent and the instruction of an advanced character."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU8UAAAAYAAJ|title=The Picayune's Guide to New Orleans|date=November 30, 1904|publisher=The Picayune|via=Google Books}}</ref>

For various reasons (including proximity to more rural Louisiana residents and pressure from White neighbors in the Tulane area), in 1914 the university moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Scotlandville]], along Scott's Bluff facing the [[Mississippi River]] and north of Baton Rouge.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cherrie|first=Lolita V|date=2016-03-29|title=Southern University: From New Orleans to Scotlandville (1880-1914)|url=http://www.creolegen.org/2016/03/29/3558/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-04|website=CreoleGen|language=en-US}}</ref> Now absorbed into the capital, this area is included as a historic destination of the [[Louisiana African American Heritage Trail]].

The first president of what is now known as Southern University at [[Baton Rouge]] was Dr. [[Joseph Samuel Clark]]. Clark, an African-American leader from Baton Rouge. He had led Baton Rouge College and the Louisiana Colored Teachers Association.

In 1921, the Louisiana Constitutional Convention authorized the reorganization and expansion of Southern University; Legislative Act 100 of 1922 provided that the institution be reorganized under the control of the State Board of Education. Clark presided over Southern University during its resulting expansion. Student enrollment grew from 47 to 500, and two of the school's early buildings were built during this time.

The Southern University Laboratory School System began operating in September 1922. The Laboratory School was first accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1936 and has conferred more than 5,000 high school diplomas since its inception.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sulabschool.enschool.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=123411&type=d&pREC_ID=244477 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705000512/http://sulabschool.enschool.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=123411&type=d&pREC_ID=244477 |archive-date=July 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Clark presided until his retirement in 1938.

Clark's son Dr. [[Felton Grandison Clark]] was appointed as president that year. He had been serving as a dean at Southern since 1934. The State School for the Negro Deaf and Blind was established here in 1938, under supervision of Southern University. In 1943, the university was visited by the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. F. G. Clark generated much more expansion of the university: 33 of 114 current buildings were erected during his 30 years of tenure. The student enrollment grew from 500 to nearly 10,000 students by the end of his tenure.

Under segregated state education, [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] Law School had refused to admit Charles J. Hatfield, III, an African American college graduate who filed a lawsuit in 1946 to gain professional education in the state. A special Louisiana Convention established a law program in 1947 at Southern University; it is now known as the [[Southern University Law Center]]. F. G. Clark expanded affiliated centers for Southern University, founding [[Southern University at New Orleans]] (SUNO) (1956) and [[Southern University at Shreveport]] (SUSLA) (1964). They were officially incorporated by the legislature into the [[Southern University System]] in 1974.

In 1969, Clark retired and Dr. G. Leon Netterville was selected as president. On November 16, 1972, in a second day of protests as students argued to be included in determining administration policies and decisions, Denver Smith and Leonard Brown were shot during a protest outside the Old Auditorium (now the Southern University Museum of Art). The murders have never been solved, but the students were killed with buckshot, which the sheriff's deputies were using. These two students were involved with "Students United," a student activist group. The governor and sheriff's office denied that their people were responsible for the deaths. Governor [[Edwin Edwards]] ordered the campus temporarily closed, and it was patrolled by troops to keep the peace.<ref>[https://blackthen.com/%E2%80%8Bnovember-16-1972-the-southern-university-massacre-occurs/ "November 16, 1972: The Southern University Massacre Occurs"], Black Then website, 2017</ref>

The institution continued to grow. In 1974, a [[special session]] in the Louisiana Legislature established the [[Southern University System]], with [[Jesse N. Stone]] of Shreveport as its president. The system consists of Southern University and A&M College, Baton Rouge (SUBR); Southern University, New Orleans (SUNO); Southern University Law Center (SULC); Southern University Agricultural Center (SUAC); and Southern University, [[Shreveport]] (SUSLA). SUSLA is a two-year, commuter college.

The Southern University Museum of Art at Shreveport has been designated as a destination of the [[Louisiana African American Heritage Trail]].

In 1978, the legislature merged the Southern School for the Deaf with the Louisiana School for the Deaf, moving the students temporarily into the Mayflower North Campus, during construction of the new South Campus. In 1985, they entered the new buildings in the South.

Between 1970 and 1990, the university consistently enrolled over 10,000 students and secured the title of being the largest HBCU in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_5f6edcd4-104f-11e8-8002-1327b8a7dabf.html|title=Deadly 1972 protest at Southern University highlighted in new PBS documentary on HBCUs|first=JUDY BERGERON |last=jbergeron@theadvocate.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/southern-university-1880-0|title=Southern University ][Baton Rouge] (1880- ) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/southern-university-sees-a-rise-in-enrollment-numbers/|title=Southern University sees a rise in enrollment numbers}}</ref>

==Legacy of Lacumba==
[[File:LacumbaSign.jpg|thumb|This sign remains near Lacumba's campus home]]
Southern University was the first HBCU to house a live mascot on campus. Henry J. Bellaire, alumnus and president of the 1961 senior class, and alumna Helen Williams presented a baby [[jaguar]] as a gift to the university. The jaguar was named ''Lacumba'' (meaning "Heart of Africa"<!-- In what language? -->) and was born on May 26, 1971. In 1991, Lacumba retired to the Acadiana Zoo in [[Broussard, Louisiana|Broussard, LA]] and was replaced with Lacumba II. Lacumba II (commonly referred to as simply Lacumba) was born on May 12, 1991, the offspring of two rare [[black jaguar]]s bred in hopes of producing a black jaguar. However, Lacumba II was born brown; it grew to be 200 pounds. Lacumba II died of natural causes at the age of 15 in December 2004 and was the last jaguar to live on campus. [[List of animal rights advocates|Animal rights advocates]] dissuaded the university from purchasing a new jaguar.  The jaguar pen remains in front of the [[Ace W. Mumford Stadium|A.W. Mumford football stadium]] off Harding Boulevard. The legacy of Lacumba lives on through the school's [[mascot|costumed jaguar mascot]] and Cafe Lacumba on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contentdm.auctr.edu/cdm/ref/collection/suam/id/1386 |title=Lacumba :: Southern University and A&M College |publisher=Contentdm.auctr.edu |access-date=2015-12-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subr.edu/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/852|title=Lacumba Speaks - Southern University and A&M College|website=Subr.edu|access-date=May 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|number=849286547241398272|user=SouthernU_BR|title=Come have lunch with us at Cafe...|date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>
