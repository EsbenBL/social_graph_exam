'''George Fitzhugh''' (November 4, 1806 – July 30, 1881) was an American social theorist who published racial and slavery-based sociological theories in the [[Antebellum South|antebellum era]]. He argued that the negro "is but a grown up child"<ref>Fitzhugh, George (1854). [https://archive.org/stream/sociologyforsou00fitz#page/82/mode/2up "Negro Slavery"], ''Sociology for the South'', Chap.

Fitzhugh decried capitalism as practiced by the Northern United States and Great Britain as spawning "a war of the rich with the poor, and the poor with one another",<ref>Fitzhugh (1854), p. 22.</ref> rendering [[Free Negro|free blacks]] "far outstripped or outwitted in the chase of free competition."<ref>Fitzhugh (1854), p. 84.</ref> Slavery, he contended, ensured that blacks would be economically secure and morally civilized. Nonetheless, some historians consider Fitzhugh's worldview to be [[Fascism|fascist]] in its rejection of liberal values, defense of slavery, and perspectives toward race.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roel Reyes|first=Stefan|date=2019-12-17|title=Antebellum Palingenetic Ultranationalism: The Case for including the United States in Comparative Fascist Studies|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/fasc/8/2/article-p307_307.xml|journal=Fascism|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=307–330|doi=10.1163/22116257-00802005|issn=2211-6257|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wish|first=Harvey|title=George Fitzhugh: Propagandist of the Old South|publisher=Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press|year=1943|isbn=|location=|pages=viii, 188-192}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roel Reyes|first=Stefan|date=2021-11-24|title=‘Christian Patriots’: The Intersection Between Proto-fascism and Clerical Fascism in the Antebellum South|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/hcm/aop/article-10.1163-22130624-00219121/article-10.1163-22130624-00219121.xml|journal=International Journal for History, Culture and Modernity|volume=-1|issue=aop|pages=1–29|doi=10.1163/22130624-00219121|issn=2213-0624}}</ref>

Fitzhugh practiced law and was a painter for years, but attracted both fame and infamy when he published two sociological tracts for the South. He was a leading [[Proslavery|pro-slavery]] intellectual<ref>Gilpin, Drew Faust (1977). ''A Sacred Circle: The Dilemma of the Intellectual in the Old South, 1840–1860'', Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> and spoke for many of the Southern plantation owners{{Who|date=May 2020}}. Before printing books, Fitzhugh tried his hand at a pamphlet, "Slavery Justified" (1849). His first book, ''Sociology for the South'' (1854) was not as widely known as his second book, ''Cannibals All!'' (1857). ''Sociology for the South'' is the first known English-language book to include the term "[[sociology]]" in its title.<ref>[http://www.walkercountyhistory.org/oakwood_cemetery.php Oakwood Cemetery, Walker County Historical Society website]; accessed August 27, 2017.</ref>

Fitzhugh differed from nearly all of his southern contemporaries by advocating a slavery that crossed racial boundaries. In 1860 Fitzhugh stated, "It is a libel on white men to say they are unfit for slavery" and suggested that if [[Yankee]]s were caught young they could be trained, domesticated and civilized to make "faithful and valuable servants."<ref>George Fitzhugh. ''[[Horace Greeley]] and his Lost Book'', [[Southern Literary Messenger]] Volume 31, Issue 3, 1860.</ref> In ''Sociology for the South'', Fitzhugh proclaimed, "Men are not 'born entitled to equal rights!' It would be far nearer the truth to say, 'that some were born with saddles on their backs, and others booted and spurred to ride them,' – and the riding does them good."; and that the Declaration of Independence "deserves the tumid yet appropriate epithets which Major Lee somewhere applies to the writings of Mr. Jefferson, it is, 'exhuberantly false, and [[wikt:arborescent|arborescent]]ly fallacious.'"<ref>[https://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/fitzhughsoc/fitzhugh.html Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society], pp. 179, 182.</ref>

==Life==
George Fitzhugh was born on November 4, 1806, to George Fitzhugh Sr. (a surgeon/physician) and Lucy (née Stuart) Fitzhugh. He was born in [[Prince William County, Virginia]]. His family moved to [[Alexandria, Virginia]], when he was six. He attended public school though his career was built on self-education. He married Mary Metcalf Brockenbrough in 1829 and moved to [[Port Royal, Virginia]]. There he began his own law business. Fitzhugh took up residence in a "rickety old mansion" known for a vast collection of bats in its attic that he inherited through his wife's family. He was something of a recluse in this home for most of his life and rarely travelled away from it for extended periods of time, spending most of his days there engaged in unguided reading from a vast library of books and pamphlets.

Of the writers in his library, Fitzhugh's beliefs were most heavily influenced by [[Thomas Carlyle]], whom he read frequently and referenced in many of his works.<ref>Straka, Gerald M. (1957). "The Spirit of Carlyle in the Old South," ''The Historian'' '''20''' (1), pp. 39–57.</ref> Atypical for a slavery advocate, Fitzhugh also subscribed to and regularly read abolitionist pamphlets such as ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. He made only one major visit to other parts of the nation in the entire antebellum period – an 1855 journey to the north where he met and argued with abolitionists [[Gerrit Smith]] and [[Wendell Phillips]].

Never politically active in his own right, Fitzhugh managed to find the company of well known political figures in his day.<ref>Hartz, Louis (1955). ''The Liberal Tradition in America: An Interpretation of American Political Thought Since the Revolution''. New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc.</ref> In addition to the two abolitionists, Fitzhugh was an acquaintance of several public officials. In 1857 Fitzhugh served as a law clerk in Washington, D.C. under [[Attorney General]] [[Jeremiah Sullivan Black]]. He gained fairly wide circulation in print, writing articles for several Virginia newspapers and for the widely circulated Southern magazine ''[[DeBow's Review]]''.<ref>Leland, Charles G. (1862). [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=cont;cc=cont;g=moagrp;xc=1;q1=George%20Fitzhugh;rgn=full%20text;view=image;seq=0486;idno=cont0002-4;node=cont0002-4%3A16 "A Southern Review,"] ''The Continental Monthly'' '''2''' (4), pp. 466–469.</ref><ref>Skipper, Ottis Clark (1958). ''J.D.B. De Bow: Magazinist of the old South''. Athens, Ga.: University of Georgia Press.</ref>

After moving to [[Richmond, Virginia]], in 1862 he began to work in the Treasury of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Fitzhugh spent a short time judging for the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Court]] and then retiring to [[Kentucky]] after his wife's death in 1877. He later moved to his daughter's residence in [[Huntsville, Texas]], where he died on July 30, 1881.  He is buried in a grave in [[Oakwood Cemetery (Huntsville, Texas)|Oakwood Cemetery]], Huntsville, where his daughter, Mariella Fitzhugh Foster and her husband Capt. Marcellus Aurelius Foster are also buried.<ref>[https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Fitzhugh_George_1806-1881#start_entry George Fitzhugh (1806–1881)] Encyclopedia of Virginia website.

==Writings==
===''Sociology for the South''===
''Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society'' (1854) was George Fitzhugh's most powerful attack on the philosophical foundations of free society. In it, he took on not only [[Adam Smith]],<ref>Dodd, William E. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesameric27john#page/n13/mode/2up ''The Cotton Kingdom: A Chronicle of the Old South''], Yale University Press, p. 64.</ref> the foundational thinker of capitalism, but also [[John Locke]],<ref>Loewenberg, Robert (1985). "John Locke and the Antebellum Defense of Slavery," ''Political Theory'' '''13''' (2), pp. 266–291.</ref> [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the entire liberal tradition. He argued that free labor and free markets enriched the strong while crushing the weak.<ref>Fitzhugh (1854), p. 179.</ref> What society needed, he wrote, was slavery, not just for blacks, but for whites as well. "Slavery," he wrote, "is a form, and the very best form, of [[socialism]]."<ref>Fitzhugh (1854), pp. 27–28.</ref> "Socialism," he continued:

<blockquote>Proposes to do away with free competition; to afford protection and support at all times to the laboring class; to bring about, at least, a qualified community of property, and to associate labor. All these purposes, slavery fully and perfectly attains. ... Socialism is already slavery in all save the master ... Our only quarrel with Socialism is, that it will not honestly admit that it owes its recent revival to the failure of universal liberty, and is seeking to bring about slavery again in some form.<ref>Fitzhugh (1854), pp. 48, 70.</ref></blockquote>

Fitzhugh believed that slavery reduced the pressure on the poor and lower classes; in other words, he advocated slavery for poor whites as well as blacks.<ref>Craven, Avery (1944). [https://archive.org/stream/papersinillinois1942illi#page/n13/mode/2up "Southern Attitudes Toward Abrahan Lincoln,"] ''Papers in Illinois History and Transactions for the year 1942'', The Illinois State Historical Society, p. 17.</ref> He also strongly opposed the racial doctrines of the time.<ref>"We abhor the doctrine of the "Types of Mankind;" first, because it is at war with scripture, which teaches us that the whole human race is descended from a common parentage; and, secondly, because it encourages and incites brutal masters to treat negroes, not as weak, ignorant and dependent brethren, but as wicked beasts,
without the pale of humanity. The Southerner is the negro's friend, his only friend. Let no intermeddling abolitionist, no refined philosophy, dissolve this friendship." — Fitzhugh (1854), p. 95.</ref>

===''Cannibals All!''===
''Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters'' (1857) was a critique further developing the themes that Fitzhugh had introduced in ''Sociology for the South.'' Both the book's title and its subtitle were phrases taken from the writing of [[Thomas Carlyle]], the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] social critic and a great hero to Fitzhugh's generation of proslavery thinkers.<ref>Dodd, William E. (1918). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2764032 "The Social Philosophy of the Old South,"] ''American Journal of Sociology'' '''23''' (6), pp. 735–746.</ref> The aim of his book, Fitzhugh claimed, was to show that "the unrestricted exploitation of so-called free society is more oppressive to the laborer than domestic slavery."<ref>Fitzhugh (1857), [https://archive.org/stream/cannibalsallorsll00fitz#page/n13/mode/2up ''Preface''], p. ix.</ref>

''Cannibals All!'' was a sharp criticism of the system of "[[wage-slavery]]" found in the north.<ref>Persky, Joseph (1992). "Unequal Exchange and Dependency Theory in George Fitzhugh," ''History of Political Economy'' '''24''' (1), pp. 117–128.</ref> Fitzhugh's ideas were based on his view that the "negro slaves of the South" were considerably more free than those trapped by the oppression of capitalist exploitation.<ref>Woodward, C. Vann (1964). "A Southern War Against Capitalism." In: ''American Counterpoint: Slavery and racism in the North-South Dialogue''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 107–139.</ref><ref>Wiener, Jonathan M. (1979). "Coming to Terms with Capitalism: The Postwar Thought of George Fitzhugh," ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' '''87''' (4), pp. 438–447.</ref> His idea to rectify social inequality created by capitalism<ref>Dowling, David (2009). "'Other and More Terrible Evils': Anticapitalist Rhetoric in Harriet Wilson's 'Our Nig' and Proslavery Propaganda," ''College Literature'' '''36''' (3), pp. 116–136.</ref> was to institute a system of universal slavery, based on his belief that "nineteen out of every twenty individuals have ... a natural and inalienable right to be slaves."<ref>Fitzhugh (1857), p. 102.</ref> Under this same context, Fitzhugh asserted that society was obligated to protect the weak by controlling and subjugating them. Fitzhugh wrote:

<blockquote>'It is the duty of society to protect the weak;' but protection cannot be efficient without the power of control; therefore, 'It is the duty of society to enslave the weak.'<ref>{{citation|title= Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters | author=George Fitzhugh | location= Richmond: VA| publisher=A. Morris Publishers |date=1857 |page=278}}</ref></blockquote>

Fitzhugh's ideas in ''Cannibals All!'', while often used in the defense of anti-abolition, have a more socially egalitarian undertone which attempted to remedy inequalities in "Property of man."<ref>Sklansky, Jeffrey P. (2002). ''The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820–1920'', University of North Carolina Press.</ref> His ideas of reform could be seen in terms of a non-Marxist socialist ideology.<ref>Frazier, Mark C. (1974). "Slavery and Socialism: Our Brothers' Keepers," ''Reason'' '''5''' (10), pp. 24–27.</ref> The extremes advocated by Fitzhugh's writing led even some of his allies to denounce his bold claims.

''Cannibals All!'' garnered more attention in the ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|Liberator]]'', [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s abolitionist newspaper, than any other book. [[Abraham Lincoln]] is said to have been more angered by George Fitzhugh than by any other pro-slavery writer, yet he unconsciously paraphrased ''Cannibals All!'' in his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided speech]].<ref>Phillips, Michael (2007). "George Fitzhugh (1806-1881)." In: Junius P. Rodriguez (ed.), ''Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia'', Vol. I, ABC-CLIO, p. 285.</ref>
