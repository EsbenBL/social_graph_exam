==History==

===Queen's College===
[[File:bbuilding.jpg|thumb|A view across Chancellor's Court, towards the Law building]]

The earliest beginnings of the university were originally traced back to the [[Queen's College, Birmingham|Queen's College]], which is linked to [[William Sands Cox]] in his aim of creating a medical school along strictly Christian lines, unlike the contemporary London medical schools.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Further research{{by whom|date=February 2021}} revealed the roots of the [[Birmingham Medical School]] in the medical education seminars of John Tomlinson, the first surgeon to the [[Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary]], and later to the [[Birmingham General Hospital]]. These classes, held in the winter of 1767–68, were the first such lectures ever held in England or Wales. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical apprentices at the General Hospital, founded in 1779. The medical school which grew out of the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary was founded in 1828, but Cox began teaching in December 1825. [[Queen Victoria]] granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham and allowed it to be styled "The Queen's Hospital". It was the first provincial teaching hospital in England. In 1843, the medical college became known as Queen's College.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/mds/about/history.aspx |title=History of the University of Birmingham Medical School, 1825 - 2001 |website=University of Birmingham}}</ref>

=== Mason Science College ===
[[File:Hallaston.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceiling of the Aston Webb building]]

In 1870, Sir [[Josiah Mason]], the Birmingham [[industrialist]] and philanthropist, who made his fortune in making key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating, drew up the Foundation Deed for [[Mason Science College]].<ref name="The First Civic University">Ives et al. 2000, p. 12.</ref> The college was founded in 1875.<ref name="Mason"/> It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham. In 1882, the Departments of Chemistry, Botany and Physiology were transferred to Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of Physics and [[Comparative Anatomy]]. The transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a [[university college]] was made. As the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 it became incorporated as Mason University College on 1 January 1898, with [[Joseph Chamberlain]] becoming the President of its Court of Governors.

===Royal charter===

It was largely due to Chamberlain's enthusiasm that the university was granted a [[royal charter]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 24 March 1900.<ref>Gosden, Peter. "From County College To Civic University, Leeds, 1904", ''Northern History'' 42.2 (2005): 317-328. ''Academic Search Premier'', Web. 12 November 2014.</ref> The [[Gough-Calthorpe family|Calthorpe family]] offered twenty-five acres (10 hectares) of land on the [[Bournbrook]] side of their estate in July. The Court of Governors received the Birmingham University Act 1900, which put the royal charter into effect on 31 May.

The transfer of Mason University College to the new University of Birmingham, with Chamberlain as its first [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] and Sir [[Oliver Lodge]] as the first [[Principal (university)|principal]], was complete. A remnant of Josiah Mason's legacy is the Mermaid from his coat-of-arms, which appears in the sinister chief of the university shield and of his college, the double-headed lion in the dexter.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Mermaid's Tale: the origins of the University's Crest |url=https://rcc-redmarley.tumblr.com/post/147586152755/a-mermaids-tale-the-origins-of-the-universitys |website=Research and Cultural Collections |publisher=University of Birmingham |access-date=28 April 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

The commerce faculty was founded by Sir [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]] in 1901, who from 1902 until 1923 served as first Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty.

From 1905 to 1908, [[Edward Elgar]] held the position of Peyton Professor of Music at the university. He was succeeded by his friend [[Granville Bantock]].<ref name="Anderton">Keith Anderton, slevenotes, ''Bantock: Hebridean Symphony'', Naxos 8.555473, 1989.</ref>

The university's own heritage archives are accessible for research through the university's Cadbury Research Library which is open to all interested researchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/cadbury/index.aspx|title=Cadbury Research Library - Special Collections|publisher=University of Birmingham}}</ref>

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the Great Hall in the Aston Webb Building was requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the 1st Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties; it was equipped with 520 beds and treated 125,000 injured servicemen.<ref name="birmingham.ac.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/university/our-impact.pdf |title=Our Impact |access-date=2014-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911224646/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/university/our-impact.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Expansion===
[[File:BirminghamBarberInstitute.jpg|thumb|The [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]]]]
In 1939, the [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]], designed by [[Robert Atkinson (architect)|Robert Atkinson]], was opened. In 1956, the first MSc programme in [[Geotechnical Engineering]] commenced under the title of "Foundation Engineering", and has been run annually at the university since.

The UK's longest-running MSc programme in Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors also started at the university in 1956, the same year that the world's first commercial nuclear power station was opened at [[Calder Hall]] in Cumbria.

In 1957, Sir [[Hugh Casson]] and Neville Conder were asked by the university to prepare a masterplan on the site of the original 1900 buildings which were incomplete. The university drafted in other architects to amend the masterplan produced by the group. During the 1960s, the university constructed numerous large buildings, expanding the campus.<ref name="hickman"/> In 1963, the university helped in the establishment of the faculty of medicine at the University of Rhodesia, now the [[University of Zimbabwe]] (UZ). UZ is now independent but both institutions maintain relations through student exchange programmes.

Birmingham also supported the creation of [[Keele University]] (formerly University College of North Staffordshire) and the [[University of Warwick]] under the Vice-Chancellorship of Sir Robert Aitken who acted as 'godfather' to the University of Warwick.<ref>Ives et al. 2000, p. 342.</ref> The initial plan was to establish a satellite university college in [[Coventry]] but Aitken advised an independent initiative to the University Grants Committee.<ref>Ives et al. 2000, p. 343.</ref>

[[Malcolm X]], the Afro-American human rights activist, addressed the University Debating Society in 1965.<ref name="birmingham.ac.uk"/>

===Scientific discoveries and inventions===
[[File:Aston Webb001.JPG|thumb|Friezes on the Aston Webb building]]

The university has been involved in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir [[Norman Haworth]] was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on [[carbohydrate chemistry]] in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of [[maltose]], [[cellobiose]], [[lactose]], [[gentiobiose]], [[melibiose]], gentianose, [[raffinose]], as well as the [[glucoside]] ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the [[starch]], [[cellulose]], [[glycogen]], [[inulin]] and [[xylan]] molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|title=Norman Haworth - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/haworth-bio.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref>

The [[cavity magnetron]] was developed in the Department of Physics by Sir [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]], [[Harry Boot]] and [[James Sayers (physicist)|James Sayers]]. This was vital to the Allied victory in World War II. In 1940, the [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]], a document which demonstrated that the [[atomic bomb]] was more than simply theoretically possible, was written in the Physics Department by Sir [[Rudolf Peierls]] and [[Otto Frisch]]. The university also hosted early work on [[gaseous diffusion]] in the Chemistry department when it was located in the Hills building.

[[File:Poynting Physics building 2.jpg|thumb|right|Poynting Physics building]]
Physicist Sir [[Mark Oliphant]] made a proposal for the construction of a proton-[[synchrotron]] in 1943, however he made no assertion that the machine would work. In 1945, phase stability was discovered; consequently, the proposal was revived, and construction of a machine that could surpass proton energies of 1&nbsp;[[GeV]] began at the university. However, because of lack of funds, the machine did not start until 1953. The [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] managed to beat them; they started their [[Cosmotron]] in 1952, and had it entirely working in 1953, before the University of Birmingham.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Laurie M. |last1=Brown |first2=Max |last2=Dresden|first3= Lillian |last3=Hoddeson |title=Pions to Quarks: Particle Physics in the 1950s: Based on a Fermilab Symposium |pages=167–9 |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-30984-0}}</ref>

In 1947, Sir [[Peter Medawar]] was appointed Mason Professor of Zoology at the university. His work involved investigating the phenomenon of tolerance and transplantation immunity. He collaborated with [[Rupert E. Billingham]] and they did research on problems of pigmentation and [[skin grafting]] in cattle. They used skin grafting to differentiate between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. Taking the earlier research of R. D. Owen into consideration, they concluded that actively acquired tolerance of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this research, Medawar was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. He left Birmingham in 1951 and joined the faculty at [[University College London]], where he continued his research on transplantation immunity. He was a recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1960.<ref name=Medawar>{{cite web|title=Peter Medawar - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1960/medawar-bio.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=15 July 2014}}</ref>

===Recent history===

In 1999 talks commenced on the possibility of [[Aston University]] integrating itself into the University of Birmingham as the University of Birmingham, Aston Campus. This would have resulted in the University of Birmingham expanding to become one of the largest universities in the UK, with a student body of 30,000. Talks were halted in 2001 after Aston University determined the timing to be inopportune. While Aston University management was in favour of the integration, and reception among staff was generally positive, the Aston student union voted two-to-one against the integration. Despite this set back, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Birmingham said the door remained open to recommence talks when Aston University is ready.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/mar/22/highereducation.news1|title=Aston pulls out of merger talks with Birmingham|first=Tillie|last=Harris|date=22 March 2001|via=The Guardian}}</ref>

On 9 August 2010 the university announced that for the first time it would not enter the [[Clearing system|UCAS clearing]] process for 2010 admission, which matches under-subscribed courses to students who did not meet their firm or insurance choices, due to all places being taken. Largely a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], Birmingham joined fellow Russell Group universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol in not offering any clearing places.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10913471 |work=BBC News | title=Students face a scramble for university places | date=9 August 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Aston Webb Building Entrance Statues University of Birmingham.JPG|thumb|Statues of the University of Birmingham (Beethoven, Virgil, Michelangelo, Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, Watt, Faraday, and Darwin)]]

The discipline of [[cultural studies]] was founded at the university and between 1964 and 2002 the campus was home to the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]], a research centre whose members' work came to be known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies. Despite being established by one of the key figures in the field, [[Richard Hoggart]], and being later directed by the theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], the department was controversially closed down.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Melanie |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409096 |title=Poor staff relations threaten Birmingham's sociology department |work=Times Higher Education |date=12 November 2009 |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref>

Analysis showed that the university was fourth in a list of British universities that faced the most [[employment tribunal]] claims between 2008 and 2011. They were the second most likely to settle these before the hearing date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.academicfoi.com/tribunalsgagging/index.htm |title=Investigating UK Universities through Freedom of Information |publisher=AcademicFOI.Com }}</ref>

In 2011 a parliamentary [[early day motion]] was proposed, arguing against the Guild suspending the elected Sabbatical Vice President (Education), who was arrested while taking part in protest activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2484 |title=Early day motion 2484 – EDWARD BAUER, THE RIGHT TO PROTEST AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH – UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom }}</ref>

In December 2011 it was announced that the university had obtained a 12-month-long injunction<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/governance/policies-regs/activism.aspx |title=Activism on campus|publisher=University of Birmingham }}</ref> against a group of around 25 students, who occupied a residential building on campus from 23 to 26 November 2011, preventing them from engaging in further "occupational protest action" on the university's grounds without prior permission. It was misreported in the press that this injunction applied to all students, however the court order defines the defendants as: <blockquote>
Persons unknown (including students of the University of Birmingham) entering or remaining upon the buildings known as No. 2 Lodge Pritchatts Road, Birmingham at the University of Birmingham for the purpose of protest action (without the consent of the University of Birmingham).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/university/legal/activism/NO1.pdf |title=High Court Order |access-date=16 August 2013}}</ref>
</blockquote> The university and the Guild of Students also clarified the scope of the injunction in an e-mail sent to all students on 11 January 2012, stating: "The injunction applies only to those individuals who occupied the lodge".<ref>[https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Tt_gBUp6iyEuaV_rmGM1-T1LC4Hxo3anrJi8KRTxFQY]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> The university said that it sought this injunction as a safety precaution based on a previous occupation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/governance/policies-regs/activism.aspx|title=Activism on campus|publisher=University of Birmingham|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711173020/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/governance/policies-regs/activism.aspx|archive-date=11 July 2012|access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref> Three separate human rights groups, including [[Amnesty International]], condemned the move as restrictive on human rights.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/dec/11/birmingham-university-protest-ban-condemned?INTCMP=SRCH |work=The Guardian | title=Birmingham University protest ban attacked as 'aggressive and censorious' | date=11 December 2011 | location=London | first=Shiv | last=Malik}}</ref>

In 2019 several women said the university refused to investigate allegations of [[campus rape]]. One student who complained of rape in university accommodation was told by employees of the university that there were no specific procedures for handling rape complaints. In other cases students were told they would have to prove the alleged rapes occurred on university property. The university has been criticized by legal professionals for not adequately assessing the risk to students by refusing to investigate complaints of criminal conduct.<ref>{{cite news |title=Birmingham University refused to look into student's off-campus rape claim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/18/birmingham-university-refused-to-look-into-students-off-campus-rape-claim |access-date=24 November 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=November 18, 2019}}</ref>

The main campus of the university occupies a site some {{convert|3|mi|km}} south-west of [[Birmingham city centre]], in [[Edgbaston]]. It is arranged around [[Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower]] (affectionately known as 'Old Joe' or 'Big Joe'), a grand [[campanile]] which commemorates the university's first chancellor, [[Joseph Chamberlain]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crosby |first1=Travis L. |title=Joseph Chamberlain: A Most Radical Imperialist |date=2011 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9781848857537 |page=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAKPcVqFqQsC |access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref> Chamberlain may be considered the founder of Birmingham University, and was largely responsible for the university gaining its Royal Charter in 1900 and for the development of the Edgbaston campus. The university's Great Hall is located in the domed [[Aston Webb]] Building, which is named after one of the architects – the other was [[Ingress Bell]]. The initial {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} site was given to the university in 1900 by Lord Calthorpe. The grand buildings were an outcome of the £50,000 given by steel magnate and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] to establish a "first class modern scientific college"<ref>{{cite book|first=Edmund |last=Burke|title=The Annual Register|year=1900|publisher=Rivingtons|page=27|isbn=1-60030-829-5}}</ref> on the model of [[Cornell University]] in the United States.<ref>[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3164/11/002_10.pdf The Carnegie Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180854/http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3164/11/002_10.pdf |date=17 July 2011 }}, ''Cornell Alumni News'', II(10), 29 November 1899, p. 6.</ref> Funding was also provided by Sir [[Holcroft Baronets|Charles Holcroft]].<ref>Ray Smallman, [http://www.eng.bham.ac.uk/metallurgy/news/RES%20-%20Hundred%20years%20of%20%20BUMS.pdf A hundred years of distinction], BUMS centenary lecture, p. 5.</ref>

The original domed buildings, built in [[Accrington brick|Accrington red brick]], semicircle to form Chancellor's Court. This sits on a {{convert|30|ft|m}} drop, so the architects placed their buildings on two tiers with a {{convert|16|ft|m}} drop between them. The clock tower stands in the centre of the Court.

The campus has a wide diversity in architectural types and architects. "What makes Birmingham so exceptional among the Red Brick universities is the deployment of so many other major Modernist practices: only Oxford and Cambridge boast greater selections".<ref>Foster, 2005, pp. 242–3.</ref>  The Guild of Students original section was designed by Birmingham inter-war architect [[Holland W. Hobbiss|Holland Hobbiss]] who also designed the  [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]] opposite. It was described as "Redbrick Tudorish" by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].<ref>Braithwaite, 1987, p. 20.</ref>

The statue on horseback fronting the entrance to the university and [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]] is a 1722 statue of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] rescued from Dublin in 1937.  This was saved by Bodkin, a director of the National Gallery of Ireland and first director of the Barber Institute.  The statue was commissioned by the [[Dublin Corporation]] from the Flemish sculptor [[John van Nost]].<ref>Ives et al. 2000, p. 230; Rupert Gunnis, ''Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660–1851'' (1968 revised edition), p.281 identifies it as a 1717 work for [[Essex Bridge, Dublin]].</ref>

Final negotiations for part of what is now the Vale were only completed in March 1947.  By then, properties which would have their names used for halls of residences such as Wyddrington and Maple Bank were under discussion and more land was obtained from the Calthorpe estate in 1948 and 1949 providing the setting for the Vale.<ref>Ives et al. 2000, p. 304.</ref> Landscape architect [[Mary Mitchell (landscape architect)|Mary Mitchell]] designed the layout of the campus and she included mature trees that were retained from the former gardens.<ref name=listedplan>{{Cite web|title=THE VALE, EDGBASTON, Birmingham - 1001483 {{!}} Historic England|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1001483|access-date=2021-04-14|website=historicengland.org.uk|language=en}}</ref> Construction on the Vale started in 1962 with the creation of a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} artificial lake and the building of Ridge, High, Wyddrington and Lake Halls.

====1960s and modern expansion====
[[File:Learning Center.jpg|thumb|right|The university's Learning Centre (left), School of Computer Science (right) and Sir [[Eduardo Paolozzi]]'s Faraday sculpture]]
The university underwent a major expansion in the 1960s due to the production of a masterplan by Casson, Conder and Partners. The first of the major buildings to be constructed to a design by the firm was the Refectory and Staff House which was built in 1961 and 1962. The two buildings are connected by a bridge. The next major buildings to be constructed were the Wyddrington and Lake Halls and the Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, all completed in 1965.  The Wyddrington and Lake Halls, on Edgbaston Park Road, were designed by [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and contained three floors of student dwellings above a single floor of communal facilities.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, now known as the Ashley Building, was designed by Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and is a long, curving two-storey block linked to a five-storey [[Spiral|whorl]]. The two-storey block follows the curve of the road, and has load-bearing brick cross walls. It is faced in specially-made concrete blocks. The spiral is faced with faceted pre-cast concrete cladding panels.<ref name=hickman>{{cite book|first=Douglas|last= Hickman|title=Birmingham|year=1970|publisher=Studio Vista Limited}}</ref> It was [[listed building|statutorily listed]] in 1993<ref name=STS /> and a refurbishment by [[Berman Guedes Stretton]] was completed in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bgsarchitects.co.uk/clients/education/oubcss.htm |title=University of Birmingham: Faculty of Commerce and Social Science |publisher=Berman Guedes Stretton |access-date=8 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506022056/http://www.bgsarchitects.co.uk/clients/education/oubcss.htm |archive-date=6 May 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Chamberlain, Powell and Bon were commissioned to design the Physical Education Centre which was built in 1966. The main characteristic of the building is the roof of the changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid roof light shells and is completely paved in quarry tiles. The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2½-inch thick sprayed concrete shells springing from {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} long pre-stressed valley beams. On the south elevation, the roof is supported on raking pre-cast columns and reversed shells form a [[cantilever]]ed canopy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Also completed in 1966 was the Mining and Minerals Engineering and Physical Metallurgy Departments, which was designed by [[Philip Dowson]] of [[Arup Group Limited|Arup Associates]]. This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. The frame is of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than ten feet away. The building received the 1966 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] Architecture Award for the West Midlands.<ref name=hickman /> It was [[listed building|statutorily listed]] in 1993.<ref name=STS>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/ELibrary?E_LIBRARY_ID=64&a=1141397636571 |title=Signalling the Sixties: 1960s Architecture in Birmingham |location=West Midlands |publisher=Birmingham.gov.uk |date=13 June 2009 |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> Taking the full five years from 1962 to 1967, Birmingham erected twelve buildings which each cost in excess of a quarter of a million pounds.<ref>Ives et al. 2000, p. 336.</ref>

[[File:University of Birmingham - geograph.org.uk - 464655.jpg|thumb|right|Faculty of Arts Building]]
In 1967, Lucas House, a new hall of residence designed by [[John Madin|The John Madin Design Group]], was completed, providing 150 study bedrooms. It was constructed in the garden of a large house. The Medical School was extended in 1967 to a design by Leonard J. Multon and Partners. The two-storey building was part of a complex which covers the southside of [[Metchley Fort]], a Roman fort. In 1968, the Institute for Education in the Department for Education was opened. This was another Casson, Conder and Partners-designed building. The complex consisted of a group of buildings centred around an eight-storey block, containing study offices, laboratories and teaching rooms. The building has a reinforced concrete frame which is exposed internally and the external walls are of silver-grey rustic bricks. The roofs of the lecture halls, penthouse and Child Study wing are covered in copper.<ref name=hickman />

Arup Associates returned in the 1960s to design the Arts and Commerce Building, better known as Muirhead Tower and houses the Institute of Local Government Studies. This was completed in 1969.<ref name=hickman /> A £42&nbsp;million refurbishment of the 16-storey tower was completed in 2009 and it now houses the Colleges of Social Sciences and the Cadbury Research Library, the new home for the university's Special Collections. The podium was remodelled around the existing Allardyce Nicol studio theatre, providing additional rehearsal spaces and changing and technical facilities. The ground floor lobby now incorporates a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop.<ref name="Reisz">{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408321|title=Original features|last=Reisz|first=Matthew|date=24 September 2009|work=Times Higher Education|access-date=8 November 2009}}</ref> The name, Muirhead Tower, came from that of the first philosophy professor of the university [[John Henry Muirhead]].<ref name="Reisz"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Dr R |last=Takagi |url=http://www.takagi-ryo.ac/docs/id/340/lang/1/ |title=Muirhead Tower of the University of Birmingham |publisher=Takagi-ryo.ac |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.associated-architects.co.uk/files/muirheadtower.pdf |title=Muirhead Tower, Birmingham |access-date=29 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110452/http://www.associated-architects.co.uk/files/muirheadtower.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>

Recently completed is a 450-seat concert hall, called the Bramall Music Building, which completes the redbrick semicircle of the Aston Webb building designed by [[Glenn Howells Architects]] with venue design by [[Acoustic Dimensions]].

Located within the Edgbaston site of the university is the [[Winterbourne Botanic Garden]], a 24,000 square metre (258,000 square foot) [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] [[Arts and Crafts]] style garden. The large statue in the foreground was a gift to the university by its sculptor Sir Edward Paolozzi – the sculpture is named 'Faraday', and has an excerpt from the poem 'The Dry Salvages' by [[T. S. Eliot]] around its base.

The University of Birmingham operates the [[Lapworth Museum of Geology]] in the Aston Webb Building in [[Edgbaston]]. It is named after [[Charles Lapworth]], a geologist who worked at Mason Science College.

Since November 2007, the university has been holding a [[farmers' market]] on the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/event/2008/01/Farmers_Market_23_01_08.shtml |title=University Farmers' Market |publisher=University of Birmingham |date=23 January 2008 |access-date=18 April 2008}}</ref> Birmingham is the first university in the country to have an accredited farmers' market.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2007/10/Farmers_Market_24_10_2007.shtml |title=Walnuts, Wine and Winterbourne Honey at First University Farmers' Market |publisher=University of Birmingham |date=24 October 2007 |access-date=18 April 2008}}</ref>

===Selly Oak campus===
The university's [[Selly Oak]] campus is a short distance to the south of the main campus. It was the home of a federation of nine colleges, known as [[Selly Oak Colleges]], mainly focused on theology, social work, and teacher training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hellogoodbyesellyoak.blogspot.co.uk/p/history.html|title=Hello/Goodbye!|work=hellogoodbyesellyoak.blogspot.co.uk}}</ref> The Federation was for many years associated with the University of Birmingham.

===Mason College and Queen's College campus===
[[File:Mason Science College.png|thumb|right|The [[Mason Science College|Mason College]] building housed the Faculties of Arts and Law until 1962]]

The Victorian neo-gothic [[Mason College]] Building in Birmingham city centre housed Birmingham University's Faculties of Arts and Law for over 50 years after the founding of the university in 1900. The Faculty of Arts building on the Edgbaston campus was not constructed until 1959–61. The Faculties of Arts and Law then moved to the Edgbaston campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/cadburyresearchlibrary/sets/72157632911020521/|title=Campus Construction photographs volume 1, 1950s-1963|work=Flickr|date=28 February 2013}}</ref> The original [[Mason College]] Building was demolished in 1962 as part of the redevelopment within the inner ring road.

The 1843 Gothic Revival building constructed opposite the Town Hall between Paradise Street (the main entrance) and Swallow Street served as [[Queen's College, Birmingham|Queen's College]], one of the founder colleges of the university. In 1904 the building was given a new buff-coloured terracotta and brick front. The medical and scientific departments merged with Mason College in 1900 to form the University of Birmingham and sought new premises in Edgbaston. The theological department of Queen's College did not merge with Mason College, but later moved in 1923 to Somerset Road in Edgbaston, next to the University of Birmingham as the [[The Queen's Foundation|Queen's Foundation]], maintaining a relationship with the University of Birmingham until a 2010 review. In the mid 1970s, the original Queen's College building was demolished, with the exception of the grade II listed façade.

====University of Birmingham Observatory====
[[File:UoBirmingham Observatory.jpg|thumb|upright|The University of Birmingham Astronomical Observatory]]
In the early 1980s, the University of Birmingham constructed an observatory next to the university playing fields, approximately {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of the Edgbaston campus.  The site was chosen because the night sky was ~100 times darker than the skies above campus. First light was on 8 December 1982, and the Observatory was officially opened by the [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Francis Graham-Smith]], on 13 June 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Observatory: History|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/history.php|website=Astrophysics & Space Research Group|publisher=University of Birmingham|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> The observatory was upgraded in 2013.

The Observatory is used primarily for undergraduate teaching.<ref>{{cite web|title=Observatory|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/|website=Astrophysics & Space Research Group|publisher=University of Birmingham|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> It has two main instruments, a 16" [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] (working at f/19) and a 14" [[Meade Instruments|Meade]] LX200R (working at f/6.35). A third telescope is also present and is used exclusively for visual observations.

Members of the public are given chance to visit the Observatory at regular ''Astronomy in the City'' events during the winter months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Observatory: Astronomy in the City|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/observatory/astronomyinthecity.php|website=Astrophysics & Space Research Group|publisher=University of Birmingham|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> These events include a talk on the night sky from a member of the university's student [[Birmingham University Astronomical Society|Astronomical Society]]; a talk on current astrophysics research, such as [[exoplanet]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s or [[gravitational-wave astronomy]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Astronomy in the City|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwgroup/#toggle024|website=Gravitational Wave Group|publisher=University of Birmingham|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> a question-and-answer session, and the chance to observing using telescopes both on campus and at the Observatory.

===Branding===

The original coat of arms was designed in 1900. It features a double headed lion (on the left) and a mermaid holding a mirror and comb (to the right). These symbols owe to the coat of arms of the institution's predecessor, Mason College.

In 2005 the university began rebranding itself. A simplified edition of the shield which had been introduced in the 1980s reverted to a detailed version based on how it appears on the university's original Royal Charter.

This scheme was the first of its kind, and has since been emulated in several other [[Russell Group]] universities across the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Birmingham University Alumni|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/alumni/BMag-2012.pdf|access-date=22 January 2015}}</ref> Since 2014, the scheme has been divided into [https://web.archive.org/web/20141021223922/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/birmingham-research-fellows.aspx Birmingham Research Fellowships] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20141201224647/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/excellence/fellows/teaching/index.aspx Birmingham Teaching Fellowships]. 
Birmingham Fellows are appointed to permanent academic posts (with two or three year probation periods), with five years protected time to develop their research.<ref name="Birmingham Fellowships">{{cite web|title=Birmingham Fellowships|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/birmingham-research-fellows.aspx|access-date=22 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021223922/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/birmingham-research-fellows.aspx|archive-date=21 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Birmingham Fellows are usually recruited at a lecturer or senior lecturer level. In the first period of the fellowship, emphasis is placed on the research aspect, publishing high quality academic outputs, developing a trajectory for their work and gaining external funding. However, development of teaching skills is encouraged.<ref name="Birmingham Fellowships"/> Teaching and supervisory responsibilities, as well as administrative duties, then steadily increase to a normal lecturer's load in the Fellow's respective discipline by the fifth year of the fellowship. Birmingham Fellows are not expected to carry out academic administration during their term as Fellows, but will do once their posts turn into lectureships (‘three-legged contract’). When accepted into the Birmingham Research Fellowship, Fellows receive a start-up package to develop or continue their research projects, an academic mentor and support for both research and teaching. All fellows are said to become part of the Birmingham Fellows Cohort, which provides them a university-wide network and an additional source of support and mentoring.<ref name="Birmingham Fellowships"/>

===International cooperation===
In Germany the University of Birmingham cooperates with the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]] in Frankfurt/Main. Both cities are linked by a long-lasting partnership agreement.

===Guild of Students===
[[File:BirminghamBUGS.jpg|thumb|right|University of Birmingham Guild of Students]]
{{Main|University of Birmingham Guild of Students}}
The University of Birmingham Guild of Students is the university's [[students' union|student union]]. Originally the Guild of Undergraduates, the institution had its first foundations in the Mason Science College in the centre of Birmingham around 1876. The University of Birmingham itself formally received its Royal Charter in 1900 with the Guild of Students being provided for as a Student Representative Council.<ref>{{harv|Cheesewright|1975|p=35}}</ref> It is not known for certain why the name 'Guild of Students' was chosen as opposed to 'Union of Students', however, the Guild shares its name with [[Liverpool Guild of Students]], another 'redbrick university'; both organisations subsequently founded the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. The Union Building, the Guild's bricks and mortar presence, was designed by the architect [[Holland W. Hobbiss]].

The Guild's official purposes are to represent its members and provide a means of socialising, though societies and general amenities. The university provides the Guild with the Union Building effectively rent free as well as a block grant to support student services. The Guild also runs several bars, eateries, social spaces and social events.

The Guild supports a variety of student societies and volunteering projects, roughly around 220 at any one time. The Guild complements these societies and volunteering projects with professional staffed services, including its walk-in Advice and Representation Centre (ARC), Student Activities, Jobs/Skills/Volunteering, Student Mentors in halls, and Community Wardens around [[Bournbrook]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guildofstudents.com/DisplayPage.aspx?GroupId=561&id=6371|title=Community Wardens|website=Guild of Students}}{{dead link|date=January 2021}}</ref> The Guild of Students was where the international volunteering charity [[InterVol]] was conceived and developed as a student-led volunteering project; the group currently supports charitable organisations in four developing countries.<ref>[http://www.download.bham.ac.uk/buzz/Buzz_73.pdf University of Birmingham Buzz Magazine. Details of InterVol set-up by volunteers including Tamzin Kensett, page 2. Retrieved 29 May 2010.]</ref> Another two of the Guild's long-standing societies are Student Advice and Nightline (previously Niteline), which both provide peer-to-peer welfare support.  The Guild was one of the first universities in the United Kingdom to publish a campus newspaper, ''[[Redbrick (Newspaper)|Redbrick]]'', supported financially by the Guild of Students and advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bugs.bham.ac.uk/guildofstudents_handbook_web_version.pdf |title=Guild of Students Membership Handbook 2007–08 |publisher=University of Birmingham Guild of Students |access-date=6 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215504/http://www.bugs.bham.ac.uk/guildofstudents_handbook_web_version.pdf |archive-date=30 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The Guild undertakes its representative function through its officer group, seven of whom are full-time, on sabbatical from their studies, and ten of whom are part-time and hold their positions whilst still studying. Elections are held yearly, conventionally February, for the following academic year. These officers have regular contact with the university's officer-holders and managers. In theory, the Guild's officers are directed and kept to account over their year in office by Guild Council, an 80-seat decision-making body. The Guild also supports the university "student reps" scheme, which aims to provide an effective channel of feedback from students on more of a departmental level.

The university provides sports and fitness facilities for students and the community to use with a membership. Such facilities include a gym, a dojo, a climbing wall and outdoor football pitches.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Onono |first1=Branwen |title=UoB Runs Out of Gym Memberships |url=https://www.redbrick.me/uob-runs-gym-memberships/ |website=Redbrick |access-date=5 October 2021 |date=17 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sport & Fitness Facilities |url=https://sportandfitness.bham.ac.uk/facilities/ |publisher=University of Birmingham |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref> As of the 2019 league, the university is ranked seventh in the [[British Universities and Colleges Sport]] league table.<ref>{{cite web |title=BUCS Points - BUCScore |url=https://bucscore.bucs.org.uk/BUCSPoints.aspx |website=bucscore.bucs.org.uk |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

University of Birmingham Sport provides a range of competitive and participation sports, for both the student and local community. Services include 180 fitness classes a week, 56 different sport clubs, including rowing, basketball, cricket, football, rugby union, netball, field hockey, American football, and triathlon. The wide selection has ensured the university has over 4,000 students participating in sport each year. The university also opened the Raymond Priestley Centre in 1981 on the shores of Coniston Water in the Lake District, offering students, staff and community alike to explore outdoor activities and learning in the area.

In the 2018 [[Commonwealth Games]] in Gold Coast, Australia, six students and eighteen alumni attended, and Birmingham was selected as the next host city for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. The university is set to host [[field hockey|hockey]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] competitions on campus for the 2022 games, and provide a village for the athletes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Partner of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/commonwealth-games/index.aspx |publisher=University of Birmingham |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

Sir Raymond Priestley, vice-chancellor of the university in 1938, and his Director of Sport A.D. Munrow, helped establish the first undergraduate courses in Physical Education in 1946, developed their sports facilities – starting with the gymnasium in 1939, and made participation in recreational sport compulsory for all new undergraduates from 1940 to 1968. Birmingham became the first UK university to offer a sports degree.

Many University of Birmingham students and alumni have competed at Olympics, Paralympics and Commonwealth Games. In 2004, six graduates and one student competed in the [[2004 Athens Summer Olympics]], and four alumni competed at the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], including cyclist [[Paul Manning (cyclist)|Paul Manning]] who won an Olympic Gold.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A chance to meet the University of Birmingham's Olympic heroes|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2016/10/A-chance-to-meet-the-University-of-Birmingham%27s-Olympic-heroes.aspx|access-date=2021-06-11|website=University of Birmingham|language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2012, Pamela Relph MBE was part of the rowing mixed coxed four that won Paralympic gold, and she successfully defended her title in Rio: the only current international para-rower to be a double Paralympic Champion.

The university hosted the Jamaican track and field team prior to the [[2012 London Olympics]]. The team, including the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt – who became the first man in history to defend his 100 metres and 200 metres titles at the Olympics – won team gold for the {{nowrap|4 × 400 m}} along with Nesta Carter, Yohan Blake and Michael Frater. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won gold in the women's 100 metres. The team returned to the university in 2017 to prepare for London's Indoor Championships, staying in the Chamberlain Hall on the Vale Village, and using the newly established Sport & Fitness facilities and athletics track.

University of Birmingham Sport has since been host to a number of international teams; the Australian and South Africa teams ahead of the men's Rugby World Cup in 2015, the Jamaican, England and New Zealand netball teams before the Vitality Nations Cup in January 2020, and 19 nations for the individual competition at the World University Squash Championships in 2018.

University of Birmingham Sport also offers around 30 scholarships and bursaries to national and international students of exceptional athletic ability.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sport Scholarships {{!}} UoB Sport & Fitness |url=https://sportandfitness.bham.ac.uk/sport/scholarships/ |website=Sport and Fitness Birmingham |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

===Housing===
The university provides housing for most first-year students, running a guarantee scheme for all those UK applicants who choose Birmingham as their firm UCAS choice. 90 per cent of university-provided housing is inhabited by first-year students.<ref name=Push>{{cite book|first=Johnny |last=Rich|title=The Push Guide to Which University 2006|year=2005|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=0-7487-9489-1}}</ref>

The university maintained gender-segregated halls until 1999 when Lake and Wyddrington "halls" (treated as two different halls, despite being physically one building) were renamed as Shackleton Hall. Chamberlain Hall (Eden Tower), a seventeen-storey tower block, was originally known as High Hall, for male students, and the connected Ridge Hall (later renamed to the Hampton Wing), for female students. University House was decommissioned as accommodation to house the expanding Business School, while Mason Hall has been demolished and rebuilt, opening in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In the summer of 2006, the university sold three of its most distant halls (Hunter Court, the Beeches and Queens Hospital Close) to private operators, while later in the year and during term, the university was forced urgently to decommission both the old Chamberlain Tower (High Hall) and also Manor House over fire safety inspection failures.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The university has rebranded its halls offerings into three villages.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Vale Village====
[[File:20131110ChamberlainHall.jpg|thumb|High Hall as it appeared just prior to demolition in 2013]]
The Vale Village includes Chamberlain Hall, Shackleton, Maple Bank, Tennis Court, Elgar Court and Aitken residences. A sixth hall of residence, Mason Hall, re-opened in September 2008 following a complete rebuild. Approximately 2,700 students live in the village.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/accommodation/halls/vale.aspx |title=Student accommodation: Vale Village |publisher=University of Birmingham |access-date=19 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109002512/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/accommodation/halls/vale.aspx |archive-date=9 January 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Shackleton Hall (originally Lake Hall, for male students, and Wyddrington Hall, for female students) underwent an £11&nbsp;million refurbishment and was re-opened in Autumn 2004. There are 72 flats housing a total of 350 students. The majority of the units consist of six to eight bedrooms, together with a small number of one, two, three or five bedroom studio/apartments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.has.bham.ac.uk/studentaccom/vale/shackleton.shtml|title=Student accommodation: Shackleton|publisher=University of Birmingham|access-date=10 February 2008}}</ref> The redevelopment was designed by Birmingham-based architect Patrick Nicholls while employed at Aedas, now a director of Glancy Nicholls Architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glancynicholls.com/ |title=Glancy Nicholls Architects |publisher=Glancy Nicholls Architects |access-date=5 May 2008}}</ref>

Maple Bank was refurbished and opened in summer 2005.

Construction of the new Mason Hall commenced in June 2006 following complete demolition of the original 1960s structures. It was designed by Aedas Architects. The entire project is thought to have cost £36.75&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.estates.bham.ac.uk/projects/Mason%20Hall%20Redev.htm |title=Mason Hall Redevelopment |publisher=The Estates Office (University of Birmingham) |first=Liz |last=Robinson |access-date=8 March 2008}}</ref> It has since been completed, with the first year of students moving in September 2008.

The new Chamberlain Tower and neighbouring low rise blocks opened in September 2015. Chamberlain is home to more than 700 first year students. It replaced the old 1964-built 18-storey (above ground level) High Hall (later renamed Eden Tower), for male students and low rise Ridge Hall (later renamed Hampton Wing) for female students, which closed in 2006. The 50-year-old Eden Tower was removed at the start of 2014. Previously known as High Hall, the tower and its associated low rise blocks were demolished after studies revealed it would be uneconomical to refurbish them and would not provide the quality of accommodation which the University of Birmingham desires for students.

The largest student-run event, the [[Vale Festival]] or 'ValeFest', is held annually on the Vale. The Festival celebrated its 10th event in 2014, raising £25,000 for charity. The 2019 event was headlined by The Hunna and Saint Raymond.
