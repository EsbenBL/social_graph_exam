The '''University of New Hampshire''' ('''UNH''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]] with its main campus in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].  It was founded and incorporated in 1866 as a land grant college in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]], moved to Durham in 1893, and adopted its current name in 1923.

The university's Durham campus comprises six colleges. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]] is in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital. The university is part of the [[University System of New Hampshire]] and is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".<ref name="Carnegie"/>

{{As of|2018}}, its combined campuses made UNH the largest state university system in the state of [[New Hampshire]], with over 15,000 students. It was also the most expensive state-sponsored school in the United States for in-state students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhpr.org/post/state-tuition-nhs-public-universities-remains-highest-nation|title=In-State Tuition at N.H.&#039;s Public Universities Remains Highest in Nation|first=Jason|last=Moon|website=www.nhpr.org}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] 
[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]
[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]
The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891, [[Governor of New Hampshire|Governor]] [[Hiram A. Tuttle]] signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Governor Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

In 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to "authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham." The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow & Randlett]].

In fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.

In 1923, Governor [[Fred H. Brown]] signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''. The university was incorporated on July 1, 1923.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44359836/r_d_hetzel_now_university_prexy/ |title=R. D.

In the spring of 2015, the university was given $4 million from the estate of [[Robert Morin (librarian)|Robert Morin]], who had been a librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2016/08/30/long-time-librarian-surprises-unh-4-million-gift|title=Long-Time Librarian Surprises UNH with $4 Million Gift|date=August 30, 2016|website=Unh.edu|access-date=March 24, 2018}}</ref> In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, both on and off campus.

* [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]
* [[Carsey School of Public Policy]]
* School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering

The university is a member of the [[New England Board of Higher Education]]'s New England Regional Student Program (NERSP) where New England public universities and colleges offer a number of undergraduate curricula with special considerations to students from other New England states. If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.

The Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Forest Technology, and Veterinary technology. Four other degree programs were discontinued in spring of 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Reo|first=Aidan|title=UNH's Thompson School Ending Four 2-Year Programs|work=Seacoast Online|url=https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20180329/unhs-thompson-school-ending-four-2-year-programs}}</ref>

The coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].

The [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.

There are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).

The university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs. The university runs/manages 22 study abroad programs in locations which include [[Cambridge]], England; [[London]], England; [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Brest, France]]; [[Dijon]], France; [[Grenoble]], France; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Osaka]], Japan; [[Utrecht]], Netherlands; [[Maastricht]], Netherlands; [[Ascoli Piceno]], Italy; New Zealand; India; South Africa; Kenya; and [[Granada]], Spain. The university also accepts credit from over 300 approved programs that are run through other institutions.  The university organizes an annual summer abroad program at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].  There are also over 100 National Exchange Program opportunities.

In 2010, the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] was incorporated into the University of New Hampshire System and renamed the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]. It is the only law school in the state of New Hampshire. The School of Law offers Juris Doctor degrees in addition to graduate studies in Intellectual Property and Commerce & Technology. The University of New Hampshire Law School is renowned for its intellectual property law programs, consistently ranking in the top ten of U.S. News & World Report rankings. In 2012, it was ranked 4th behind the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University and George Washington University.

===Student government===
The Student Senate of the University of New Hampshire is the on-campus, undergraduate [[Students' union|student government]]. The Student Senate controls the use of its own [[student activity fee]], and directly governs student organizations that receive a regular, annual budget from it. The Student Senate also formulates student stances on University policy, and attempts to lobby its position to administrators and the local and state government.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |url=https://www.unh.edu/sites/default/files/departments/student_senate/student_senate_constitution_april_2014.pdf |title=Student Senate Constitution |date=October 31, 2017 |work=University of New Hampshire Student Senate |language=en |access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> According to its Constitution, the Student Senate "[serves] as an advocate for all undergraduate students, deriving its power from the [[consent of the governed]] and developed on the principle that all undergraduate students of the University of New Hampshire have the right to participate in its governance. Such participation encourages the development of student expertise in University affairs and places significant responsibility on students for their involvement with the policies, rules, and regulations which affect the quality of education and the experience of students at the University of New Hampshire."<ref name="auto" /> The Student Senate at UNH is noted for being one of the few remaining [[student governments in the United States]] that are free of a faculty or staff advisor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/student-senate|title=Student Senate|date=2014-01-23|website=University of New Hampshire|language=en|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>

GSS representation, elections, and other functions are governed by the UNH Graduate Student Senate Constitution & Bylaws.

===''The New Hampshire'' student newspaper===
''[[The New Hampshire]]'' (commonly referred to as TNH) is a weekly student-run newspaper headquartered at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). Since 1911, it has been published weekly on Thursdays during the academic year, with a printed circulation of 3,000 copies per issue. TNH is distributed for free in the Memorial Union Building, university housing and academic buildings, Durham businesses, and other locations around the southern New Hampshire seacoast area; the newspaper also publishes an online edition of the week's print edition.

TNH is the oldest UNH publication still in operation; ''The Granite'' student yearbook, the oldest university publication on record, ran from 1908 to 2017.

===Fraternity and sorority life===

The Office of Student Involvement and Leadership, the Inter-fraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic Council (Panhel) oversee the 13 recognized social fraternities and eight recognized social sororities. Many of the fraternities and sororities have houses on Madbury Road and Strafford Avenue in Durham. These houses are not owned by or on university property.

==Underrepresented students==
===Elizabeth Virgil===
The first African-American graduate of the University of New Hampshire was Elizabeth Virgil. Virgil graduated in 1926 with a bachelor's degree in [[Home economics|Home Economics]]. She was from the nearby town of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and attended college at the urging of her mother, Alberta Curry Virgil, a housekeeper. Virgil later founded a scholarship in her mother's memory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Her Story: The First African American Woman To Graduate From UNH|url=https://www.hercampus.com/school/unh/her-story-first-african-american-woman-graduate-unh|access-date=2021-05-28|website=Her Campus|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=On Ben's Farm|url=http://unhmagazine.unh.edu/sp07/historypage.html|access-date=2021-05-28|website=unhmagazine.unh.edu}}</ref>

===Current Demographics===
According to College Factual's 2021 Diversity Report 9,849 undergraduates were white, 419 Hispanic, 339 Asian, 255 multi-ethnic, 125 Black or African-American, and 1 pacific Islander. The race of an additional 542 was unknown and 417 international students were not counted in the survey. Among graduate students, 1,031 were white, 35 Hispanic, 26 Black or African American, 24 Asian, 15 multi-ethnic, and 1 pacific islander. The races of 41 graduate students were unknown and an additional 277 were international and not counted in the survey.<ref>{{Cite web|title=University of New Hampshire - Main Campus Diversity: Racial Demographics & Other Stats|url=https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/university-of-new-hampshire-main-campus/student-life/diversity/|access-date=2021-05-28|website=www.collegefactual.com|language=en}}</ref>

===Student Organizations===

The student-led Diversity Support Coalition (DSC) aims to offer resources to groups "affected by institutionalized oppression based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and expression, age, ability, native language, national origin, and/or religion at UNH."<ref>{{cite web|title=Diversity Support Coalition|url=https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|website=WildcatLink.unh.edu|access-date=April 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427044531/https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|archive-date=April 27, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The DSC promotes, educates, and supports [[multiculturalism]], diversity, and equality at UNH through programming efforts and support of the six student organizations within the DSC. The six member groups are Alliance, the Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, the Native American Cultural Association, and the United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs to be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.

In addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.

Multiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success. Women-focused groups on campus include Her Campus, UNH Data Driven Women, Women in Business, the Society of Woman Engineers, and Women in Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/career/career-resources-women|title=Career Resources for Women|date=May 19, 2017|website=UNH Career and Professional Success|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>

Culturally focused groups on campus include the Desi Student Association, Japanese Cultural Club, Indonesian Student Association, International Student Organization, Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Russian Cultural Club and Vietnamese Student Association. These groups often host events to educate the student body on their cultures and to welcome experts of ancestral crafts. Conversely, the Committee on Rights and Justice (CORAJ) partners UNH students with local immigrant families, helping them with the [[naturalization]] process.

=== International students ===
The university instituted the [[Navitas Group|Navitas program]] in 2011 to expand the amount of international students at the school. This expanded over the years into the Global Student Success Program (GSSP). The GSSP, in cooperation with the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), gives students the support to "help discover opportunities at UNH to immerse in American culture and share your own traditions with others from the U.S. and from around the globe."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/global/international-students|title=International Students|date=April 20, 2016|website=UNH Global|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> The programs guide students through the application process and the extent of their career.

During fall 2015, UNH enrolled 298 students from 34 different countries. The most common countries of origin at that time were the People's Republic of China, Canada, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Profile |url=https://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf |website=University of New Hampshire Office of Admissions |publisher=University of New Hampshire |access-date=1 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810024821/http://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf |archive-date=August 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The school offers intensive English language education for students through the ESL Institute. As well as advancing students' knowledge of English as a second language, one of the goals of the ESL Institute is "to provide students with the cultural knowledge and awareness needed to function satisfactorily, both academically and socially, in the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cola.unh.edu/esl-institute/mission-statement|title=Mission Statement|date=July 23, 2018|website=College of Liberal Arts|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>

===First-generation college students===
Begun in 1994, UNH Connect is a program where first-generation college students and multicultural students are given a jump-start to the experiences of college life with a summer pre-orientation program aimed at social connection and comfortability with college life. Each student is assigned a peer mentor who helps with the transition to their freshman year. The program, with 100 students in 2014, also gives first-generation students an opportunity to meet people in similar situations prior to the beginning of college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/orientation/connect/about-us|title=About Us|date=February 24, 2015|website=Office of First Year Programs|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>

The Center for Academic Resources (CFAR) offers a program called TRIO that is partially funded by the US Department of Education. TRIO is intended for students who are first-generation, have a disability, or are in extreme financial need. Through the TRIO program students can receive services to help understand options for future careers as well as advice with financial aspects of college that they would most likely not have home support with. These include academic tutoring, assistance with student loans, scholarship advice, individual counseling, and career planning. In the 2017-18 school year the UNH TRIO program was funded for 200 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/cfar/triostudent-support-services|title=TRIO/Student Support Services|date=February 17, 2014|website=University of New Hampshire|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>

==Music==
The University of New Hampshire offers two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts in music and the Bachelor of Music; and two graduate degree programs: the Master of Arts in music (concentrations in composition, conducting, and musicology), and the Master of Arts in teaching.

The Department of Music offers several performing ensembles, some by audition and others with open enrollment. All UNH students are eligible for membership in all of the ensembles. There is one Symphony Orchestra, three concert bands (Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, and Concert Band), a large Concert Choir, an auditioned choir (Chamber Singers), two jazz bands, Vocal Arts Project, [[University of New Hampshire Wildcat Marching Band|Wildcat Marching Band]], Beast of the East Pep Band, and numerous chamber ensembles and jazz combos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cola.unh.edu/music/opportunities/ensembles|title=Ensembles|date=2018-07-05|website=College of Liberal Arts|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> Between the various ensembles, Faculty Concert Series, Traditional Jazz Series, student recitals, and guest artists, the Department of Music puts on a great many performances every year that are open to the public. Additionally, many outreach programs and events are offered, including the Summer Youth Music School (SYMS), UNH Youth Symphony Orchestra, New Hampshire Youth Band, Piano Extension Program, Clark Terry UNH Jazz Festival, UNH Choral Gala, Double Reed Day, UNH Band Extravaganza, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cola.unh.edu/music/outreach|title=Outreach|date=2018-07-03|website=College of Liberal Arts|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>

==Athletics==

The school's athletic teams are the [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|Wildcats]], and they compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. New Hampshire is a member of the [[America East Conference]] for [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] & [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[tennis]]; and women's [[lacrosse]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[field hockey]], and [[volleyball]]. The women's gymnastics<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unhwildcats.com/index.aspx?path=wgym|title=UNH Wildcats - Women's Gymnastics - University of New Hampshire|website=Unhwildcats.com|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> program competes in the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics League at the Division I level. They also compete in [[Hockey East]] in men's and women's [[ice hockey]], Eastern Collegiate Ski Association for skiing, as well as the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] for [[American football|football]] at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly known as [[Division I-AA]]) level.

The university's colors are white and blue, and its mascots are two [[Bobcat|wildcat]]s known popularly around campus as [[New Hampshire Wildcats|Wild E. Cat]] and Gnarlz. The introduction of a wildcat as a mascot came in 1926; it has had a plethora of different names and even forms throughout the campus' history. In 2000 Wild E. Cat was introduced, followed by Gnarlz in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mascot History|url=https://unhwildcats.com/sports/2015/6/24/Mascots.aspx|website=University of New Hampshire Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref>

In the 2006 academic year the university cut women's crew, men's swimming & diving, and men's and women's tennis at the varsity level, and trimmed the size of the men's ski team from 27 to 12. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships. The reason given was that the athletic department would save $500,000 towards a $1 million budget shortfall and be in compliance with [[Title IX]] for the first time.<ref>[http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141044/http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml|date=February 19, 2006}}</ref> In 1997, the university cut baseball, softball, men's and women's golf, and men's lacrosse.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through the Department of Campus Recreation, including [[aikido]], [[archery]], [[baseball]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[cycle sport|cycling]], [[dance]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[figure skating]], [[golf]], men's [[lacrosse]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[taekwondo]], men and women's ultimate Frisbee,<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate| last1=Johnson| first1=Cameron| title=Ultimate Frisbee: Sisters of Oriza: A look inside women's Ultimate| work=[[The New Hampshire]]| date=November 7, 2014| access-date=November 12, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012085115/https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate/| archive-date=October 12, 2015| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], and the Woodsmen Club. Many of these clubs compete either on an intercollegiate basis with New England teams, or sponsor university tournaments and frequently participate in national championships. UNH also offers horseback riding as a recreation. Many students can take horseback riding lessons with instructors, on their horse or the schools. UNH holds many events each year, for they have a large cross country course. UNH also has a [[dressage]] team and a hunt seat team that competes yearly.

The recognized [[fight song]] of UNH is "[[On to Victory (song)|On to Victory]]", the most current version of which was arranged by Tom Keck, Director of Athletic Bands from 1998–2003. In 2003, "UNH Cheer" (originally titled "Cheer Boys") was resurrected from the university archives by Erika Svanoe, Director of Athletic Bands from 2003-2006.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.erikasvanoe.com/conducting.html| title=Professional Experience| website=ErikaSvanoe.com| access-date=November 12, 2015}}</ref> Based on the school song "Old New Hampshire", not to be confused with the [[Old New Hampshire|New Hampshire state song]] of the same name, "UNH Cheer" currently serves as a secondary fight song and is often performed immediately following "On to Victory".

On October 7, 2006, Wildcats [[wide receiver]] [[David Ball (wide receiver)|David Ball]] tallied the 51st receiving [[touchdown]] of his career to displace [[Jerry Rice]] of [[Mississippi Valley State University]], who was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] a month earlier, atop the ranking of NCAA Division I and I-AA players by career receiving touchdowns. He later signed as a [[rookie]] [[free agent]] with the [[Chicago Bears]] and played with well-known college football players [[Chris Leak]] and [[Darius Walker]].

==Durham campus==
[[File:CongreveAcrossTHall.JPG|thumb|left|Congreve Hall]]The University of New Hampshire is located in the town of [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], a rural small town on the [[Downeaster (train)|Amtrak]] line to Boston.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Durham - UNH {{!}} Amtrak Downeaster|url=https://amtrakdowneaster.com/stations/durham-unh|access-date=2021-05-28|website=amtrakdowneaster.com|language=en}}</ref> The Durham campus is {{convert|1100|acre|km2}}, with {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in the "campus core" and {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of open land on the west edge of campus. The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} of land. For the 2020-2021 school year, in order to go on campus students were required to self-test twice weekly to enter campus buildings and use the university's buses.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-21|title=COVID-19 Testing Resources|url=https://www.unh.edu/coronavirus/covid-testing|access-date=2021-04-26|website=University of New Hampshire|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-16|title=Valid Wildcat Pass Required; Enforcement to Begin Next Week|url=https://www.unh.edu/coronavirus/valid-wildcat-pass-required-enforcement-begin-next-week|access-date=2021-04-26|website=University of New Hampshire|language=en}}</ref>

===Housing===

[[File:Durham NH 011.jpg|thumb|left|Babcock Hall]]
[[File:Stoke hall.jpg|thumb|left|Stoke Hall]]
As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2020 semester about 96% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Facts & Figures|url=https://www.unh.edu/main/facts-figures|date=2017-10-05|website=University of New Hampshire|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref>

The university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.

Undergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.

Several of the university's dormitories have specific themes, including a substance-free dormitory, an international dormitory, and several first year-only dormitories. In addition, many buildings have designated quiet floors for study.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-07|title=Housing Options|url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/housing-options|access-date=2021-05-28|website=Housing & Residential Life|language=en}}</ref>

For the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables ("North" and "South") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A & B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. In summer 2020 the Forest Park apartments were demolished in order to make way for more on-campus housing. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining nine buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.

Due to the over-enrollment of the 2006–2007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH "Dining Dollars" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.

Stoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses over 700 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing & Residential Life| access-date=November 12, 2015}}</ref>
