'''Protectionism''' is the [[economic policy]] of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as [[tariff]]s on imported goods, [[import quota]]s, and a variety of other government regulations. Proponents argue that protectionist policies shield the producers, businesses, and workers of the [[Import substitution industrialization|import-competing sector]] in the country from foreign competitors; however, they also reduce [[trade]] and adversely affect consumers in general (by raising the cost of imported goods), and harm the producers and workers in export sectors, both in the country implementing protectionist policies and in the countries protected against.

==Protectionist policies==
{{Main|Tariff}}[[File:Emblem of the Ligue Nationale pour la Défense du Franc.svg|thumb|Logo of Belgium's National League for the Franc's Defense, 1924]]
A variety of policies have been used to achieve protectionist goals. These include:

* [[Tariff]]s and [[import quota]]s are the most common types of protectionist policies.<ref name="Essentials">Paul Krugman, Robin Wells & Martha L. Olney, ''Essentials of Economics'' (Worth Publishers, 2007), p. 342-45.</ref> A tariff is an [[excise tax]] levied on imported goods. Originally imposed to raise government revenue, modern tariffs are now more often designed to protect domestic producers that compete with foreign importers. An import quota is a limit on the volume of a good that may be legally imported, usually established through an import licensing regime.<ref name="Essentials"/>
* Protection of technologies, patents, technical and scientific knowledge <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/world/asia/wide-china-push-is-seen-to-obtain-industry-secrets.html|title=China Seen in Push to Gain Technology Insights|first1=Edward|last1=Wong|first2=Didi Kirsten|last2=Tatlow|date=5 June 2013|access-date=16 October 2017|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/technology/artificial-intelligence-china-united-states.html|title=China's Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter|first1=John|last1=Markoff|first2=Matthew|last2=Rosenberg|date=3 February 2017|website=Nytimes.com|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2016/04/the-unpleasant-truth-about-chinese-espionage/|title=The Unpleasant Truth About Chinese Espionage|date=22 April 2016|website=Observer.com|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>
* Restrictions on [[foreign direct investment]],<ref>Ippei Yamazawa, "Restructuring the Japanese Economy: Policies and Performance" in ''Global Protectionism'' (eds. Robert C. Hine, Anthony P. O'Brien, David Greenaway & Robert J. Thornton: St. Martin's Press, 1991), pp. 55-56.</ref> such as restrictions on the acquisition of domestic firms by foreign investors.<ref>Crispin Weymouth, "Is 'Protectionism' a Useful Concept for Company Law and Foreign Investment Policy? An EU Perspective" in ''Company Law and Economic Protectionism: New Challenges to European Integration'' (eds. Ulf Bernitz & Wolf-Georg Ringe: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 44-476.</ref>
* Administrative barriers: Countries are sometimes accused of using their various administrative rules (e.g. regarding [[food safety]], environmental standards, electrical safety, etc.) as a way to introduce barriers to imports. 
* [[International commercial law#Anti-dumping measures|Anti-dumping legislation]]: "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|Dumping]]" is the practice of firms selling to export markets at lower prices than are charged in domestic markets.  Supporters of anti-dumping laws argue that they prevent the import of cheaper foreign goods that would cause local firms to close down. However, in practice, anti-dumping laws are usually used to impose trade tariffs on foreign exporters.
* Direct [[Subsidy|subsidies]]:  Government subsidies (in the form of lump-sum payments or cheap loans) are sometimes given to local firms that cannot compete well against imports. These subsidies are purported to "protect" local jobs and to help local firms adjust to the world markets.
* Export [[Subsidy|subsidies]]:  Export subsidies are often used by governments to increase exports. Export subsidies have the opposite effect of export tariffs because exporters get payment, which is a percentage or proportion of the value of exported. Export subsidies increase the amount of trade, and in a country with floating exchange rates, have effects similar to import subsidies.
* [[Exchange rate]] control: A government may [[currency intervention|intervene in the foreign exchange market]] to lower the value of its currency by selling its currency in the foreign exchange market. Doing so will raise the cost of imports and lower the cost of exports, leading to an improvement in its [[trade balance]]. However, such a policy is only effective in the short run, as it will lead to higher [[inflation]] in the country in the long run, which will, in turn, raise the real cost of exports, and reduce the relative price of imports.
* International [[patent]] systems: There is an argument for viewing national patent systems as a cloak for protectionist trade policies at a national level. Two strands of this argument exist: one when patents held by one country form part of a system of exploitable relative advantage in trade negotiations against another, and a second where adhering to a worldwide system of patents confers "good citizenship" status despite 'de facto protectionism'. [[Peter Drahos]] explains that "States realized that patent systems could be used to cloak protectionist strategies. There were also reputational advantages for states to be seen to be sticking to intellectual property systems. One could attend the various revisions of the Paris and [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne conventions]], participate in the cosmopolitan moral dialogue about the need to protect the fruits of authorial labor and inventive genius...knowing all the while that one's domestic intellectual property system was a handy protectionist weapon."<ref>{{cite book |title=Information Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy?|year=2002|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=9781853839177|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pkl7HNzhXgoC&q=%22States+realized+that%22&pg=PA36|author=Peter Drahos|author2=John Braithwaite}}</ref>
* Political campaigns advocating domestic consumption (e.g. the "Buy American" campaign in the United States, which could be seen as an extra-legal promotion of protectionism.)
* Preferential governmental spending, such as the [[Buy American Act]], federal legislation which called upon the United States government to prefer US-made products in its purchases.

In the modern trade arena, many other initiatives besides tariffs have been called protectionist.  For example, some commentators, such as [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], see developed countries' efforts in imposing their own labor or environmental standards as protectionism. Also, the imposition of restrictive certification procedures on imports is seen in this light.

Further, others point out that free trade agreements often have protectionist provisions such as intellectual property, [[copyright]], and patent restrictions that benefit large corporations.  These provisions restrict trade in music, movies, pharmaceuticals, software, and other manufactured items to high-cost producers with quotas from low-cost producers set to zero.<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/econ/2003/0714rta.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017061845/http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/econ/2003/0714rta.htm|date=17 October 2006}}</ref>

Historically, protectionism was associated with economic theories such as [[mercantilism]] (which focused on achieving positive [[trade balance]] and accumulating gold), and [[import substitution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the 18th century, [[Adam Smith]] famously warned against the "interested sophistry" of industry, seeking to gain an advantage at the cost of the consumers.<ref name="FreeToChoose">[[Free to Choose]], Milton Friedman</ref> [[Friedrich List]] saw Adam Smith's views on [[free trade]] as disingenuous, believing that Smith advocated for free trade so that British industry could lock out underdeveloped foreign competition.<ref>''The National System of Political Economy'', by Friedrich List, 1841, translated by Sampson S.

According to economic historians Douglas Irwin and Kevin O'Rourke, "shocks that emanate from brief financial crises tend to be transitory and have a little long-run effect on trade policy, whereas those that play out over longer periods (the early 1890s, early 1930s) may give rise to protectionism that is difficult to reverse. Regional wars also produce transitory shocks that have little impact on long-run trade policy, while global wars give rise to extensive government trade restrictions that can be difficult to reverse."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=C|first1=Feenstra, Robert|last2=M|first2=Taylor, Alan|date=23 December 2013|title=Globalization in an Age of Crisis: Multilateral Economic Cooperation in the Twenty-First Century|url=https://www.nber.org/books/feen11-1|journal=NBER}}</ref>

One paper notes that sudden shifts in comparative advantage for specific countries have led some countries to become protectionist: "The shift in comparative advantage associated with the opening up of New World frontiers, and the subsequent “grain invasion” of Europe, led to higher agricultural tariffs from the late 1870s onwards, which as we have seen reversed the move toward freer trade that had characterized mid-nineteenth-century Europe. In the decades after World War II, Japan's rapid rise led to trade friction with other countries. Japan's recovery was accompanied by a sharp increase in its exports of certain product categories: cotton textiles in the 1950s, steel in the 1960s, automobiles in the 1970s, and electronics in the 1980s. In each case, the rapid expansion in Japan's exports created difficulties for its trading partners and the use of protectionism as a shock absorber."<ref name=":0"/>

According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about US trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21731616-douglas-irwin-agrees-trade-policy-important-all-manner-powers-are-wrongly?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/ahistorianonthemythsofamericantradescapegoatingtrade|title=A historian on the myths of American trade|work=The Economist|access-date=26 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> A review by ''The Economist'' of Irwin's 2017 book ''Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy'' states:<ref name=":5"/>
<blockquote>Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. 'Mr. Irwin' also attempts to debunk the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.</blockquote>

According to Irwin, tariffs have serve three primary purposes in the United States: "to raise revenue for the government, to restrict imports and protect domestic producers from foreign competition, and to reach reciprocity agreements that reduce trade barriers."<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Douglas A.|date=2 August 2020|title=Trade Policy in American Economic History|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-070119-024409|journal=Annual Review of Economics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=23–44|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-070119-024409|issn=1941-1383}}</ref> From 1790 to 1860, average tariffs increased from 20 percent to 60 percent before declining again to 20 percent.<ref name=":02" /> From 1861 to 1933, which Irwin characterizes as the "restriction period", the average tariffs increased to 50 percent and remained at that level for several decades.

Economist [[Paul Bairoch]] documented that the United States imposed among the highest rates in the world from around the founding of the country until the World War II period, describing the United States as "the mother country and bastion of modern protectionism" since the end of the 18th century and until the post-World War II period.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32|author-link=Paul Bairoch}}</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], was of the view, as articulated most famously in his "[[Report on Manufactures]]", that developing an [[industrialized economy]] was impossible without protectionism because import duties are necessary to shelter domestic "[[Infant industry argument|infant industries]]" until they could achieve [[economies of scale]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|page=33}}</ref> The industrial takeoff of the United States occurred under protectionist policies 1816–1848 and under moderate protectionism 1846–1861, and continued under strict protectionist policies 1861–1945.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|page=34}}</ref> In the later 1800s, higher tariffs were introduced on the grounds that they were needed to protect American wages and to protect American farmers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|page=36}}</ref> Between 1824 and the 1940s, the U.S. imposed much higher average tariff rates on manufactured products than did Britain or any other European country, with the exception for a period of time of Spain and Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|pages=34, 40}}</ref> Up until the end of World War II, the United States had the most protectionist economy on Earth.<ref name="MehrotraGuichard2020">{{cite book|author1=Santosh Mehrotra|author2=Sylvie Guichard|title=Planning in the 20th Century and Beyond: India's Planning Commission and the NITI Aayog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xzhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA285|date=29 October 2020|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-49462-5|page=285|quote=Most importantly, the United States was the birthplace of the idea of infant industry protection, and indeed was the most heavily protected economy in the world for about a century, until the Second World War}}</ref>

Findlay and O'Rourke characterize 1860 [[Cobden–Chevalier Treaty|Cobden Chevalier treaty]] between France and the United Kingdom as "a decisive shift toward European free trade."<ref name=":1" /> This treaty was followed by numerous free trade agreements: "France and Belgium signed a treaty in 1861; a Franco-Prussian treaty was signed in 1862; Italy entered the “network of Cobden-Chevalier treaties” in 1863 (Bairoch 1989, 40); Switzerland in 1864; Sweden, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands, and the Hanseatic towns in 1865; and Austria in 1866.

Average duties on manufactured products had declined to 9–12% on the Continent, a far cry from the 50% British tariffs, and numerous prohibitions elsewhere, of the immediate post-Waterloo era (Bairoch, table 3, p.&nbsp;6, and table 5, p.&nbsp;42)."<ref name=":1" />

Some European powers did not liberalize during the 19th century, such as the Russian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire which remained highly protectionist. The [[Ottoman Empire]] also became increasingly protectionist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Daudin|first1=Guillaume|last2=O’Rourke|first2=Kevin H.|last3=Escosura|first3=Leandro Prados de la|date=2008|title=Trade and Empire, 1700–1870|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fce/doctra/0824.html}}</ref> In the Ottoman Empire's case, however, it previously had [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] [[free trade]] policies during the 18th to early 19th centuries, which [[British prime minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] cited as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been "some of the finest manufacturers of the world" in 1812.<ref name="auto"/>

The countries of Western Europe began to steadily liberalize their economies after World War II and the protectionism of the interwar period.<ref name=":3" />

===In Canada===
Since 1971 Canada has protected producers of eggs, milk, cheese, chicken, and turkey with a system of [[supply management (Canada)|supply management]]. Though prices for these foods in Canada exceed global prices, the farmers and processors have had the security of a stable market to finance their operations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Doubts about the safety of [[bovine growth hormone]], sometimes used to boost dairy production, led to hearings before the [[Senate of Canada]], resulting in a ban in Canada.

==Impact==

There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare, while [[free trade]] and the reduction of [[trade barrier]]s has a positive effect on economic growth.<ref name="See P 1994">See P. Krugman, "The Narrow and Broad Arguments for Free Trade", ''American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings'', 83(3), 1993 ; and P.

Protectionism is frequently criticized by economists as harming the people it is meant to help. Mainstream [[economist]]s instead support free trade.<ref name="FreeToChoose" /><ref name="Krugman">{{cite journal|last=Krugman|first=Paul R.|year=1987|title=Is Free Trade Passe?|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=1|issue=2|pages=131–44|doi=10.1257/jep.1.2.131|jstor=1942985|doi-access=free}}</ref> The principle of [[comparative advantage]] shows that the gains from free trade outweigh any losses as free trade creates more jobs than it destroys because it allows countries to specialize in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage.<ref>Krugman, Paul (24 January 1997). [http://www.slate.com/id/1916/ The Accidental Theorist]. ''Slate''.</ref> Protectionism results in [[deadweight loss]]; this loss to overall welfare gives no-one any benefit, unlike in a free market, where there is no such total loss. According to economist Stephen P. Magee, the benefits of free trade outweigh the losses by as much as 100 to 1.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Trade and Distortions In Factor Markets|last=Magee|first=Stephen P.|publisher=Marcel-Dekker|year=1976|location=New York}}</ref>

=== Living standards  ===
A 2016 study found that "trade typically favors the poor", as they spend a greater share of their earnings on goods, as free trade reduces the costs of goods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fajgelbaum|first1=Pablo D.|last2=Khandelwal|first2=Amit K.|date=1 August 2016|title=Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=131|issue=3|pages=1113–80|doi=10.1093/qje/qjw013|s2cid=9094432|issn=0033-5533|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w20331.pdf}}</ref> Other research found that China's entry to the WTO benefitted US consumers, as the price of Chinese goods were substantially reduced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/china-s-wto-entry-benefits-us-consumers|title=China's WTO entry benefits US consumers|last1=Amiti|first1=Mary|last2=Dai|first2=Mi|date=28 June 2017|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=28 June 2017|last3=Feenstra|first3=Robert|last4=Romalis|first4=John}}</ref> Harvard economist [[Dani Rodrik]] argues that while globalization and free trade does contribute to social problems, "a serious retreat into protectionism would hurt the many groups that benefit from trade and would result in the same kind of social conflicts that globalization itself generates.

=== Growth ===
According to economic historians Findlay and O'Rourke, there is a consensus in the economics literature that protectionist policies in the interwar period "hurt the world economy overall, although there is a debate about whether the effect was large or small."<ref name=":3" />

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] argued that economic protection was positively correlated with economic and industrial growth during the 19th century. For example, [[Gross national product|GNP]] growth during Europe's "liberal period" in the middle of the century (where tariffs were at their lowest), averaged 1.7% per year, while industrial growth averaged 1.8% per year. However, during the protectionist era of the 1870s and 1890s, GNP growth averaged 2.6% per year, while industrial output grew at 3.8% per year, roughly twice as fast as it had during the liberal era of low tariffs and free trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|last=Bairoch|first=Paul|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1993|location=Chicago|page=47}}</ref> One study found that tariffs imposed on manufactured goods increase economic growth in developing countries, and this growth impact remains even after the tariffs are repealed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeJong|first=David|year=2006|title=Tariffs and Growth: an empirical exploration of contingent relationships.|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=88|issue=4|pages=625–40|doi=10.1162/rest.88.4.625|s2cid=197260}}</ref>

According to Dartmouth economist [[Douglas Irwin]], "that there is a correlation between high tariffs and growth in the late nineteenth century cannot be denied. But correlation is not causation... there is no reason for necessarily thinking that import protection was a good policy just because the economic outcome was good: the outcome could have been driven by factors completely unrelated to the tariff, or perhaps could have been even better in the absence of protection."<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Douglas A.|date=1 January 2001|title=Tariffs and Growth in Late Nineteenth-Century America|journal=World Economy|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=15–30|doi=10.1111/1467-9701.00341|issn=1467-9701|citeseerx=10.1.1.200.5492|s2cid=153647738}}</ref> Irwin furthermore writes that "few observers have argued outright that the high tariffs caused such growth."<ref name=":2" />

According to Oxford economic historian Kevin O'Rourke, "It seems clear that protection was important for the growth of US manufacturing in the first half of the 19th century; but this does not necessarily imply that the tariff was beneficial for GDP growth. Protectionists have often pointed to German and American industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position, but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy, and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=H. O'Rourke|first=Kevin|date=1 November 2000|title=British trade policy in the 19th century: a review article|journal=European Journal of Political Economy|volume=16|issue=4|pages=829–42|doi=10.1016/S0176-2680(99)00043-9}}</ref>

A prominent 1999 study by Jeffrey A. Frankel and David H. Romer found, contrary to free trade skeptics' claims, while controlling for relevant factors, that trade does indeed have a positive impact on growth and incomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Jeffrey A|last2=Romer|first2=David|date=June 1999|title=Does Trade Cause Growth?|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=89|issue=3|pages=379–99|doi=10.1257/aer.89.3.379|issn=0002-8282|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Developing world ===
{{See also|Infant industry argument}}

There is broad consensus among economists that free trade helps workers in developing countries, even though they are not subject to the stringent health and labor standards of developed countries. This is because "the growth of manufacturing—and of the myriad other jobs that the new export sector creates—has a ripple effect throughout the economy" that creates competition among producers, lifting wages and living conditions.<ref>Krugman, Paul (21 March 1997). [http://www.slate.com/id/1918/ In Praise of Cheap Labor]. ''Slate''.</ref> The Nobel laureates, [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Paul Krugman]], have argued for free trade as a model for [[economic development]].<ref name="See P 1994" /> [[Alan Greenspan]], former chair of the American [[Federal Reserve]], has criticized protectionist proposals as leading "to an atrophy of our competitive ability. ... If the protectionist route is followed, newer, more efficient industries will have less scope to expand, and overall output and economic welfare will suffer."<ref>Sicilia, David B. & Cruikshank, Jeffrey L. (2000). ''The Greenspan Effect'', p. 131. New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-134919-7}}.</ref>

Protectionists postulate that new industries may require protection from entrenched foreign competition in order to develop. This was [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s argument in his "[[Report on Manufactures]]",{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} and the primary reason why George Washington signed the [[Tariff of 1789|Tariff Act]] of 1789.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Mainstream economists do concede that tariffs can in the short-term help domestic industries to develop, but are contingent on the short-term nature of the protective tariffs and the ability of the government to pick the winners.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-22/the-case-for-protecting-infant-industries|title=The Case for Protecting Infant Industries|date=22 December 2016|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=24 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Robert E.|date=1969|title=The Case against Infant-Industry Tariff Protection|jstor=1828905|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=77|issue=3|pages=295–305|doi=10.1086/259517|s2cid=154784307}}</ref> The problems are that protective tariffs will not be reduced after the infant industry reaches a foothold, and that governments will not pick industries that are likely to succeed.<ref name=":4" /> Economists have identified a number of cases across different countries and industries where attempts to shelter infant industries failed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=O|first1=Krueger, Anne|last2=Baran|first2=Tuncer|date=1982|title=An Empirical Test of the Infant Industry Argument|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeaaecrev/v_3a72_3ay_3a1982_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a1142-52.htm|journal=American Economic Review|volume=72|issue=5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Choudhri|first1=Ehsan U.|last2=Hakura|first2=Dalia S.|date=2000|title=International Trade and Productivity Growth: Exploring the Sectoral Effects for Developing Countries|jstor=3867624|journal=IMF Staff Papers|volume=47|issue=1|pages=30–53}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baldwin |first1=Richard E. |last2=Krugman |first2=Paul |date=June 1986 |title=Market Access and International Competition: A Simulation Study of 16K Random Access Memories |doi=10.3386/w1936 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 1936 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Luzio|first1=Eduardo|last2=Greenstein|first2=Shane|date=1995|title=Measuring the Performance of a Protected Infant Industry: The Case of Brazilian Microcomputers |journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=77|issue=4|pages=622–633|doi=10.2307/2109811|jstor=2109811|hdl=2142/29917|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/2142/29917/2/measuringperform93180luzi.pdf|hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/us-tire-tariffs-saving-few-jobs-high-cost|title=US Tire Tariffs: Saving Few Jobs at High Cost|date=2 March 2016|work=PIIE|access-date=24 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Economists such as Paul Krugman have speculated that those who support protectionism ostensibly to further the interests of workers in the least developed countries are in fact being disingenuous, seeking only to protect jobs in developed countries.<ref>Krugman, Paul (21 November 1997). [http://www.slate.com/id/1926/ A Raspberry for Free Trade]. ''Slate''.</ref> Additionally, workers in the least developed countries only accept jobs if they are the best on offer, as all mutually consensual exchanges must be of benefit to both sides, or else they wouldn't be entered into freely. That they accept low-paying jobs from companies in developed countries shows that their other employment prospects are worse. A letter reprinted in the May 2010 edition of Econ Journal Watch identifies a similar sentiment against protectionism from 16 British economists at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>"Convictions Opposed to Certain Popular Opinions: The 1903 Anti-Protectionism Letter Supported by 16 British Economists".'' Econ Journal Watch'' 7(2): 157–61, May 2010.

=== Conflict ===
Protectionism has also been accused of being one of the major causes of war. Proponents of this theory point to the constant warfare in the 17th and 18th centuries among European countries whose governments were predominantly [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] and protectionist, the [[American Revolution]], which came about ostensibly due to British tariffs and taxes, as well as the protective policies preceding both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. According to a slogan of [[Frédéric Bastiat]] (1801–1850), "When goods cannot cross borders, armies will."<ref>DiLorenzo, T. J., ''Frederic Bastiat (1801–1850): Between the French and Marginalist Revolutions''. accessed at [https://mises.org/page/1447/Biography-of-Frederic-Bastiat-18011850 &#91;Ludwig Von Mises Institute&#93; 2012-04-13]</ref>

Since the end of [[World War II]], it has been the stated policy of most [[First World]] countries to eliminate protectionism through free trade policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Certain policies of First World governments have been criticized as protectionist, however, such as the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/31/opinion/a-french-roadblock-to-free-trade.html | work=The New York Times | title=A French Roadblock to Free Trade | date=31 August 2003 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> in the European Union, longstanding [[Agricultural subsidy#United States|agricultural subsidies]] and proposed "Buy American" provisions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3988551,00.html|title=Brussels Warns US on Protectionism |date=30 January 2009|website=Dw-world.de|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> in economic recovery packages in the United States.

Heads of the [[G20]] meeting in London on 2 April 2009 pledged "We will not repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras". Adherence to this pledge is monitored by the Global Trade Alert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltradealert.org/|title=Global Trade Alert|website=Globaltradealert.org|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> providing up-to-date information and informed commentary to help ensure that the G20 pledge is met by maintaining confidence in the world trading system, deterring [[beggar-thy-neighbor]] acts and preserving the contribution that exports could play in the future recovery of the world economy.

Although they were reiterating what they had already committed to, last November in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 17 of these 20 countries were reported by the World Bank as having imposed trade restrictive measures since then. In its report, the World Bank says most of the world's major economies are resorting to protectionist measures as the global economic slowdown begins to bite. Economists who have examined the impact of new trade-restrictive measures using detailed bilaterally monthly trade statistics estimated that new measures taken through late 2009 were distorting global merchandise trade by 0.25% to 0.5% (about $50&nbsp;billion a year).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/spn1007.pdf|title= Trade and the Crisis: Protect or Recover|website=Imf.org|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

Since then, however, President [[Donald Trump]] announced in January 2017 the U.S. was abandoning the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) deal, saying, “We’re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it’s going to be reversed.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html|title=Trump Abandons Trans-Pacific Partnership, Obama's Signature Trade Deal|access-date=1 July 2018|language=en}}</ref>
