'''Karl Paul Polanyi''' ({{IPAc-en|p|oʊ|ˈ|l|æ|n|j|i}}; {{lang-hu|Polányi Károly}} {{IPA-hu|ˈpolaːɲi ˈkaːroj|}}; 25 October 1886 – 23 April 1964)<ref>''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. 2003) vol 9. p. 554</ref> was an Austro-Hungarian [[economic historian]], [[economic anthropologist]], [[economic sociology|economic sociologist]], [[political economist]], [[historical sociology|historical sociologist]] and [[social philosopher]].

He is best known for his book ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]],'' which argues against self-regulating markets''.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Karl Polanyi|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100333942|access-date=26 July 2021|website=Oxford Reference|language=en}}</ref> In the book, he advances the concept of the [[Double Movement]], which refers to the [[dialectical]] process of [[marketization]] and push for [[social protection]] against that marketization. In the book, he argues that market-based societies in modern Europe were not inevitable but historically contingent. Polanyi is remembered best as the originator of [[substantivism]], a cultural version of economics, which emphasizes the way economies are embedded in society and culture. This opinion is counter to [[mainstream economics]] but is popular in [[anthropology]], [[economic history]], [[economic sociology]] and [[political science]].

Polanyi's approach to the ancient economies has been applied to a variety of cases, such as [[Pre-Columbian America]] and ancient [[Mesopotamia]], although its utility to the study of ancient societies in general has been questioned.<ref>For example, Morris Silver, "Redistribution and Markets in the Economy of Ancient Mesopotamia: Updating Polanyi", [[Antiguo Oriente]] 5 (2007): 89–112.</ref> Polanyi's ''The Great Transformation'' became a model for [[historical sociology]]. His theories eventually became the foundation for the [[economic democracy]] movement. His daughter, Canadian economist [[Kari Polanyi Levitt]] (born 1923 in Vienna, Austria) was taught by [[Friedrich Hayek]] at the [[London School of Economics]] and is Emerita Professor of Economics at [[McGill University]], Montreal.

==Background==
Polanyi was born into [[Polányi|a Jewish family]]. His younger brother was [[Michael Polanyi]], a [[philosopher]], and his niece was [[Eva Zeisel]], a world-renowned [[ceramist]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.government-online.net/eva-zeisel-obituary/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031018/http://www.government-online.net/eva-zeisel-obituary/ |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was born in [[Vienna]], at the time the capital of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].<ref>Dale, Gareth. 2016. Karl Polanyi: A Life on the Left. New York, USA and Chichester, UK: Columbia University Press.</ref> His father, [[Mihály Polányi|Mihály Pollacsek]], was a railway entrepreneur. Mihály never changed the name Pollacsek and is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Budapest. Mihály died in January 1905, which was an emotional shock to Karl, and he commemorated the anniversary of Mihály's death throughout his life.<ref>Dale, Gareth. 2016. Karl Polanyi: A Life on the Left. New York, USA and Chichester, UK: Columbia University Press. P. 13.</ref> Karl and Michael Polanyi's mother was [[Cecília Wohl]]. The name change to Polanyi (not von Polanyi) was made by Karl and his siblings. Polanyi was well educated despite the ups and downs of his father's fortune, and he immersed himself in [[Budapest]]'s active intellectual and artistic scene.

Polanyi founded the radical and influential [[Galileo Circle]] while at the [[University of Budapest]], a club which would have far reaching effects on Hungarian intellectual thought. During this time, he was actively engaged with other notable thinkers, such as [[György Lukács]], [[Oszkár Jászi]], and [[Karl Mannheim]]. Polanyi graduated from Budapest University in 1912 with a doctorate in [[Law]]. In 1914, he helped found the Hungarian Radical Party and served as its secretary.

Polanyi was a [[cavalry]] officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in [[World War I]], in active service at the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian Front]] and hospitalized in Budapest. Polanyi supported the republican government of [[Mihály Károlyi]] and its [[Social Democratic Party (Hungary)|Social Democratic]] regime. The republic was short-lived, however, and when [[Béla Kun]] toppled the Karolyi government to create the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] Polanyi left for Vienna.

== In Vienna ==
From 1924 to 1933, he was employed as a senior editor of the prestigious ''[[Der Österreichische Volkswirt]]'' (''The Austrian Economist'') magazine. It was at this time that he first began criticizing the [[Austrian School]] of economists, who he felt created abstract models which lost sight of the organic, interrelated reality of economic processes. Polanyi himself was attracted to [[Fabianism]] and the works of [[G. D. H. Cole]]. It was also during this period that Polanyi grew interested in [[Christian socialism]].

He married the communist revolutionary [[Ilona Duczyńska]], of Polish-Hungarian background.

== In London ==
Polanyi was asked to resign from ''Der Oesterreichische Volkswirt'' because the liberal publisher of the journal could not keep on a prominent socialist after the accession of Hitler to office in January 1933 and the suspension of the Austrian parliament by the rising tide of clerical fascism in Austria. He left for London in 1933, where he earned a living as a journalist and tutor and obtained a position as a lecturer for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] in 1936. His lecture notes contained the research for what later became ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]''. However, he would not start writing this work until 1940, when he moved to [[Vermont]] to take up a position at [[Bennington College]]. The book was published in 1944, to great acclaim. In it, Polanyi described the [[enclosure]] process in [[England]] and the creation of the contemporary economic system at the beginning of the 19th century.

== United States and Canada ==
Polanyi joined the staff of [[Bennington College]] in 1940, teaching a series of five timely lectures on the "Present Age of Transformation.".<ref>{{cite document |title=Karl Polanyi: Five Lectures on The Present Age of Transformation-Lecture Series Listing of Topics |year=1940 |publisher=Bennington College |hdl=11209/8502 |last1=Polanyi |first1=Karl }}</ref><ref>{{cite document |title=Letter from President Robert Devore Leigh to Peter Drucker |date=25 September 1940 |publisher=Bennington College |hdl=11209/5449 |last1=Leigh |first1=Robert D. }}</ref> The lectures "The Passing of the 19th Century",<ref>{{cite document |title=The Passing of 19th Century Civilization (Lecture #1 of 5) |date=25 September 1940 |publisher=Bennington College |hdl=11209/5449 |last1=Leigh |first1=Robert D. }}</ref> "The Trend Towards an Integrated Society",<ref>{{cite document |title=The Trend Towards an Integrated Society (Lecture #2 of 5) |year=1940 |publisher=Bennington College |hdl=11209/8515 |last1=Polanyi |first1=Karl }}</ref> "The Breakdown of the International System",<ref>{{cite document |title=The Breakdown of the International System (Lecture #3 of 5) |year=1940 |publisher=Bennington College |hdl=11209/8516 |last1=Polanyi |first1=Karl }}</ref> "Is America an Exception"<ref>{{cite document |title=Is America an Exception?

After the war, Polanyi received a teaching position at [[Columbia University]] (1947–1953). However, his wife, [[Ilona Duczyńska]] (1897–1978), had a background as a former [[communism|communist]], which made gaining an entrance visa in the [[United States]] impossible. As a result, they moved to [[Canada]], and Polanyi commuted to New York City. In the early 1950s, Polanyi received a large grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to study the economic systems of ancient empires.

Having described the emergence of the modern economic system, Polanyi now sought to understand how "the economy" emerged as a distinct sphere in the distant past. His seminar at Columbia drew several famous scholars and influenced a generation of teachers, resulting in the 1957 volume ''Trade and Markets in the Early Empires''. Polanyi continued to write in his later years and established a new journal entitled ''Coexistence''. In [[Canada]] he lived in [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]], [[Ontario]], where he died in 1964.
