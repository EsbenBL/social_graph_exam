==Work==
Csikszentmihalyi was noted for his work in the study of [[happiness]] and [[creativity]], but is best known as the architect of the notion of ''[[flow (psychology)|flow]]'' and for his years of research and writing on the topic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forge.medium.com/why-flow-is-overrated-bd97291c8e24|title=The Pursuit of 'Flow' Is Overrated|publisher=Forge|date=4 October 2021}}</ref> [[Martin Seligman]], former president of the [[American Psychological Association]], described Csikszentmihalyi as the world's leading researcher on [[positive psychology]].<ref>[http://www.brainchannels.com/thinker/mihaly.html Thinker of the Year Award]</ref> Csikszentmihalyi once said: "Repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed and still kept within the bounds of reason."<ref name="focusdep">{{cite web|url=http://www.focusdep.com/quotes/topics/virtue/start/0/ |title=Virtue Quotes & Quotations |publisher=focusdep.com |access-date=19 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111201415/http://focusdep.com/quotes/topics/virtue/start/0/ |archive-date=11 November 2013}}</ref> His works are influential and are widely cited.<ref>Nigel King & Neil Anderson (2002).

=== Flow ===
{{main|Flow (psychology)}}
{{Mental state}}

In his seminal work, ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience'', Csíkszentmihályi outlined his theory that people are happiest when they are in a state of ''flow''—a state of [[attentional control|concentration]] or complete absorption with the activity at hand and the situation.<ref name="flowthepsychologyofoptimalexperience"/> It is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.<ref name="flowthepsychologyofoptimalexperience">Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. p. 15 {{ISBN|0-06-092043-2}}</ref> The idea of flow is identical to the feeling of being ''in the zone'' or ''in the groove''.<ref name=flow/> The flow state is an optimal state of ''[[intrinsic motivation]]'', where the person is fully immersed in what they are doing.<ref name=flow/> This is a feeling everyone has at times, characterized by a feeling of great absorption, engagement, fulfillment, and skill—and during which temporal concerns (time, food, ego-self, etc.) are typically ignored.<ref name=flow>{{cite book|last1=Csikszentmihalyi|first1=Mihaly|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|date=1990|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|page=27}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, Csíkszentmihályi described flow as "being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing [[jazz]]. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost."<ref>[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.09/czik_pr.html Geirland, John (1996). "Go With The Flow". ''Wired'', September, Issue 4.09.]</ref>

Csikszentmihályi characterized nine component states of achieving flow including "challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clarity of goals, immediate and unambiguous feedback, concentration on the task at hand, paradox of control, transformation of time, loss of self-consciousness, and [[wikt:autotelic|autotelic]] experience".<ref name="flowatwork">{{cite journal | last1 = Fullagar | first1 = Clive J. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E. Kevin | year = 2009 | title = Flow at work: an experience sampling approach | journal = Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 595–615 | doi=10.1348/096317908x357903}}</ref> To achieve a flow state, a balance must be struck between the challenge of the task and the skill of the performer.<ref name=BBF/> If the task is too easy or too difficult, flow cannot occur as both skill level and challenge level must be matched and high; if skill and challenge are low and matched, then apathy results.<ref name=BBF>{{cite web|url=https://www.bendbulletin.com/explore/the-elasticity-of-time-in-flow-state/article_dd142446-1be5-11ec-ae4a-33384e32b465.html|title=The elasticity of time in 'flow state'|date=24 September 2021|publisher=Bend Bulletin}}</ref>

One state that Csikszentmihalyi researched was that of the [[autotelic]] personality.<ref name="flowatwork"/> The autotelic personality is one in which a person performs acts because they are intrinsically rewarding, rather than to achieve external goals.<ref>Car, A. ''Positive psychology. The Science of happiness and human strengths''. Hove, 2004.</ref> Csikszentmihalyi described the autotelic personality as a trait possessed by individuals who can learn to enjoy situations that most other people would find miserable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scarymommy.com/complex-person/|title=What Does It Mean To Be A Complex Person? 7 Traits To Look For|date=3 October 2021|publisher=Scary Mommy|accessdate=21 October 2021}}</ref> Research has shown that aspects associated with the autotelic personality include curiosity, persistence, and humility.<ref>Csikszentmihalyi, M. & Nakamura, J. (2011). Positive psychology: Where did it come from, where is it going? In K. M. Sheldon, T. B. Kashdan, & M. F. Steger (Eds.), ''Designing positive psychology'' (pp. 2–9). New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>

===Motivation===
A majority of Csikszentmihalyi's final works focused the idea of [[motivation]] and the factors that contribute to motivation, challenge, and overall success in an individual.<ref name=mota/> One personality characteristic that Csikszentmihalyi researched in detail was that of [[intrinsic motivation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/202110/why-team-flow-is-unique-brain-state|title=Why Team Flow Is a Unique Brain State|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=21 October 2021}}</ref> Csikszentmihalyi and his colleagues found that intrinsically motivated people were more likely to be goal-directed and enjoy challenges that would lead to an increase in overall [[happiness]].<ref name=mota>{{cite journal|last=Abuhamdeh|first=Sami|author2=Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly|title=The importance of challenge for the enjoyment of intrinsically motivated, goal-directed activities.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2012|volume=38|issue=3|pmid=22067510|doi=10.1177/0146167211427147|pages=317–30|s2cid=11916899}}</ref>

Csikszentmihalyi identified intrinsic motivation as a powerful trait to possess to optimize and enhance positive experience, feelings, and overall [[well-being]] as a result of challenging experiences.<ref name=Worko/> The results indicated a new [[personality]] construct, a term Csikszentmihalyi called ''work orientation'', which is characterized by "achievement, endurance, cognitive structure, order, play, and low impulsivity".<ref name=Worko/> A high level of work orientation in students is said to be a better predictor of grades and fulfillment of long-term goals than any school or household environmental influence.<ref name=Worko>{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maria|author2=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|title=Motivation and academic achievement: The effects of personality traits and the quality of experience|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1991|volume=59|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1991.tb00259.x|pages=539–574|pmid=1960642}}</ref>
