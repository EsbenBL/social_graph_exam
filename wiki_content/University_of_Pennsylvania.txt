==History==
[[File:Benjamin_Franklin_by_Joseph_Duplessis_1778.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Franklin]] was the primary founder, benefactor, President of the Board of Trustees and a trustee of the [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia|Academy and College of Philadelphia]], which merged with the [[University of the State of Pennsylvania]] to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791 ([[Joseph Duplessis]], c. 1785).]]
The University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.{{refn|group=note| Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia (later Penn), [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey (later Princeton University)]] and [[Columbia University|King's College (later Columbia College, now Columbia University)]] all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century, including alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the "Intercollegiate Commission" at the invitation of [[John James McCook (lawyer)|John J. McCook]], a [[Union Army]] officer during the [[American Civil War]] and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the [[Academic regalia in the United States|Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume]]. This formalized protocol included a provision that henceforth [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's ''The Alumni Register'' magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the University's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, Penn's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank in academic processions as well as the informal bragging rights that come with the age-based hierarchy in academia generally. See "Building Penn's Brand" for more details on why Penn did this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html|title=Gazette: Building Penn's Brand (Sept/Oct 2002)|website=www.upenn.edu|access-date=January 25, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120020503/http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html|archive-date=November 20, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>  Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/history|title=History|website=Princeton University|access-date=May 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805225330/https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/history|archive-date=August 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> also considering itself to be the nation's fourth-oldest institution of higher learning.<ref>[https://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/american-revolution/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403053852/http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/american-revolution/ |date=April 3, 2016 }}</ref> To further complicate the comparison, a [[University of Edinburgh]]-educated [[Presbyterian]] minister from Scotland, named [[William Tennent]] and his son [[Gilbert Tennent]] operated a "[[Log College]]" in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with the "Log College", including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became President of Princeton.  All twelve members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the "[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]" or "[[Old and New Light|New Light]]" wing of the [[Presbyterian Church]] in the [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]] areas.<ref>[https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105013448/http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml |date=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify pushing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, earlier than Penn's 1740.

Even Penn's account of its early history agrees that the original secondary school (the Academy of Philadelphia) did not add an institution of higher learning (the College of Philadelphia) until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began as a colonial-era, early version of secondary schools such as [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] (founded as "King William's School" in 1696) and the [[University of Delaware]] (founded as "the Free Academy" in 1743) choose to march based upon the date they became institutions of higher learning.  Penn History Professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896-1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date.  According to Cheyney's later history of the event, the university did indeed consider its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Commissioner of Education]] written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the first educational trust that the University had taken upon itself. Cheyney states further that "it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature) resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a "School or College". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant.

In 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the traveling [[evangelism|evangelist]] [[George Whitefield]], who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons. The building was designed and built by [[Edmund Woolley]] and was the largest building in the city at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time in which it was preached.<ref name="MontgomeryHistory">{{cite book|title=A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.

Unlike the other [[colonial colleges]] that existed in 1749—[[Harvard]], [[College of William & Mary|William & Mary]], [[Yale]], and the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]]—Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy. He advocated an innovative concept of higher education, one which would teach both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and doing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|William Smith]] (1727–1803), who became the first [[provost (education)|provost]], and other [[Board of Trustees|trustees]] strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.<ref name="Penn's Heritage">{{cite web|title=Penn's Heritage |url=http://www.upenn.edu/about/history |website=University of Pennsylvania |access-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422090345/http://www.upenn.edu/about/history|archive-date=April 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>N.

Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of Philadelphia, the first such non-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of the board of trustees on November 13, 1749, the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House (later renamed and famously known since 1776 as "[[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]"), was offered without cost by [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], its owner, the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site.

[[File:PA-Philadelphia-Penn.jpg|thumb|left|Academy and College of Philadelphia (c. 1780), 4th and Arch Streets, Philadelphia, proposed and started to be built in 1740 as home of a charity school (including Dormitory built 1762, sketch circa 1770), whose debts and inactive trusts were assumed in 1750 by a school that became the University of Pennsylvania and used for that purpose from 1751 to 1801.<ref>Reproduction of a sketch by French artist Pierre Eugène Du Simitière courtesy of Wikipedia Commons</ref>]]
The original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the "Academy of Philadelphia", using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,<ref name="WoodHistory"/>{{rp|12}} by the intentions of the original "New Building" donors, although it lasted only a few years.

The institution of higher learning was known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then-provost the [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|Reverend William Smith]]'s [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|"Loyalist"]] tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a [[University of the State of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=Penn in the 18th Century, University of Pennsylvania Archives|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|access-date=April 29, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|archive-date=April 28, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia.

Although Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date; this is the year that appears on the first iteration of the university seal.

The Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church building at 4th and Arch Streets which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia. In 1801, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at 9th and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the temporary national capital.<ref name="WoodHistory">{{cite book|lccn=07007833|oclc=760190902|title=The History of the University of Pennsylvania, from Its Origin to the Year 1827|publisher= McCarty and Davis|author=Wood, George Bacon|author-link=George Bacon Wood|year=1834|title-link=:s:en:The History of the University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>

In the 1750s, roughly forty percent of Penn students needed lodging as they came from areas too far to commute including other colonies in the South or the [[West Indies]].<ref>https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/18th-century/student-life# accessed August 18, 2021</ref> Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with "guardians" in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses (such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 (who did not graduate) alumnus [[Alexander Graydon]]).<ref>University of Pennsylvania's ''The Alumni Register'', June of 1905, article by Isaac Anderson Pennypacker, (Penn College Class of '02) pages 408-412</ref><ref>https://archives.upenn.edu/digitized-resources/docs-pubs/graydon-memoir-1811 accessed August 18, 2021</ref>

Since Penn only had limited housing near campus and since students (especially the students at the medical school who) came from all over the country, the students elected to fend for themselves rather than live in housing owned by Penn trustees and good number chose housing by pledging and living in Penn's first fraternities ([[Delta Phi]], [[Zeta Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Sigma]], and [[Delta Psi]]).<ref>https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/fraternities/listing</ref> These first fraternities were located in walking distance of 9th and Chestnut (as campus was located from 1800 to 1872 on West side of 9th Street, from Market Street on the North to Chestnut Street on the South). For example, Zeta Psi Fraternity was located at Southeast corner of 10th Street and Chestnut Street,  Delta Phi was located on South side of 11th Street near Chestnut Street, and Delta Psi was located on North side of Chestnut Street, West of 10th Street.<ref>excerpted from the diary of [[George D.

From its founding until construction of the [[Quadrangle Dormitories (University of Pennsylvania)|Quadrangle Dormitories]], which started construction in 1895, the student body did not live in university-owned housing as, with minor exceptions, there was none.

Penn had increasing need for housing in the first decades of the twentieth century due to number of factors including its competition for students with peer institutions and active recruitment of foreign students. With respect to the latter, for example, Penn's first director of publicity translated a Penn recruiting brochure into Spanish and circulated approximately 10,000 copies throughout Latin America. The success of such efforts were evident in fall of 1910 when Vice Provost [[Edgar Fahs Smith]] (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as Penn's provost) formally welcomed to Penn students from 40 different nations at an annual party.<ref name=PennHistory>{{cite web|title=Penn Chemistry History|url=https://www.chem.upenn.edu/content/penn-chemistry-history|website=University of Pennsylvania|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=NIE>{{cite book|title=The New International Encyclopædia|date=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead & company|location=New York|chapter=Smith, Edgar Fahs |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Smith,_Edgar_Fahs|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Klickstein">{{cite journal|last=Klickstein|first=Herbert S.|title=Edgar Fahs Smith-His Contributions to the History of Chemistry |journal=Chymia |date=1959 |volume=5 |pages=11–30 |doi=10.2307/27757173 |jstor=27757173 |url=http://hsns.ucpress.edu/content/ucpchymia/5/11.full.pdf}}</ref><ref name="CHM">{{cite journal|last=Bohning |first=James J. |title=Women in chemistry at Penn 1894–1908, Edgar Fahs Smith as Mentor|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=10–11, 38–43}}</ref><ref name=Collier>{{cite book|chapter=Smith, Edgar Fahs|title=Collier's New Encyclopedia|date=1921|publisher=P.

Since it was difficult to house the international students due to the then socially acceptable and legally permissible racist housing regulations extant in Philadelphia and across the United States, in fall of 1911, The Christian Association at The University of Pennsylvania hired  as its first Foreign Mission Secretary, Reverend Alpheus Waldo Stevenson.<ref>Stevenson earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Penn in 1883. See https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-people/biography/alpheus-waldo-stevenson accessed March 15, 2021</ref> By 1912, Stevenson focused almost all his efforts on the foreign students at Penn who needed help finding housing resulting in the Christian Association, buying 3905 Spruce Street contiguous to Penn's campus.<ref>The Christian Association bought 3905 Spruce building from a member of the Potts family (who was a member of the Board of Trustees at the University of Pennsylvania).

The International Students' House provided " ... counseling and information services for a host of problems foreign students might encounter, including language, financial, health and diet, immigration and technical problems as well as maladjustment to living in the United States. It was also used for recreation and leisure, as lounges had radio, phonograph and television facilities and there were game and reception rooms. The International Students' House also provided for programs including forums, debates, lectures, panels and planned trips and outings as well as weekend activities such as dances, films and game nights. Also, for the next thirty-three years, the International Students' House would be sponsored by the Christian Association of the University of Pennsylvania."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/global-engagement/ish|title = Global Engagement: The International Students' House at Penn}}</ref>

The success of efforts to reach out to the international students'  were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that of the over 12,000 students at Penn (who came from all 50 states), 253 students came from at least 50 foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, " ... every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations".<ref name="A Timeline of Diversity at the Univ">{{cite web|url=https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/diversity-timeline |title=A Timeline of Diversity at the University of Pennsylvania |editor-last=Franklin |editor-first=Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723184234/https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/diversity-timeline |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

After World War II, Penn began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, especially student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the GI Bill, and the resultant increase in Penn's student population, highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Depression-era. Nonetheless, in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, Penn attracted international students and students from most of the 50 states as early as the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.upenn.edu/media/2017/04/integrated-development-plan-1962.pdf#page=13 |title=Integrated Development Plan |date=1962 |access-date=March 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302024635/https://archives.upenn.edu/media/2017/04/integrated-development-plan-1962.pdf#page=13 |archive-date=March 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Referring to the developments of this time period, Penn Trustee Paul Miller remarked about Penn's undergraduate housing situation: "[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one...."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.upenn.edu/digitized-resources/docs-pubs/institutional-planning/almanac-franklins-promise-1989|title="'Keeping Franklin's Promise' is the Billion-Dollar Goal," The Almanac, 1989|website=University Archives and Records Center, University of Pennsylvania|access-date=March 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218082006/https://archives.upenn.edu/digitized-resources/docs-pubs/institutional-planning/almanac-franklins-promise-1989|archive-date=February 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.upenn.edu/media/2017/04/integrated-development-plan-1962.pdf#page=67 |title=Integrated Development Plan |date=1962 |access-date=March 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302024635/https://archives.upenn.edu/media/2017/04/integrated-development-plan-1962.pdf#page=67 |archive-date=March 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Motto===
Penn's motto is based on a line from [[Horace]]'s [[s:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber III/Carmen XXIV#line33|III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), {{lang-la|quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?|lit=of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?|link=no|label=none|cat=no}}]]. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read ''{{lang|la|Sine Moribus Vanae}}''. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to {{lang-la|literae sine moribus vanae|lit=Letters without morals [are] useless|link=no|label=none}}. In 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto "mutilated" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, {{lang-la|Leges Sine Moribus Vanae|lit=Laws without morals [are] useless|link=no|label=none}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Samuel|year=2002|url=https://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html|title=Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University's seal has a curious history|journal=Pennsylvania Gazette|volume=100|issue=3|access-date=February 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113054610/http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html|archive-date=November 13, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>

The present core campus covers over {{convert|299|acre|ha}} in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the [[University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District]]. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. [[File:Huntsman Hall at the University of Pennsylvania.jpg|left|thumb| View towards Center City Philadelphia over the [[University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District]] with Huntsman Hall in the foreground]] The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders [[Drexel University]] and is a few blocks from the [[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]] and [[The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College]].

The renowned cancer research center [[Wistar Institute]] is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the Institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Dominique|title=Wistar strategic plan includes new building and research|url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2011/09/wistar_strategic_plan_includes_new_building_and_research|access-date=November 10, 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=September 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121203226/http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2011/09/wistar_strategic_plan_includes_new_building_and_research |archive-date=January 21, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>[[File:Wistar_Day_2016_Prefered.jpg|thumb|left| [[Wistar Institute]]'s 7-story steel and glass 2014 building located next to brick 1897 building, both on Penn's main historic campus on North side of Spruce Street between 36th and 37th streets]]

In 2010, in its first significant expansion across the [[Schuylkill River]], Penn purchased 23 acres at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of [[DuPont]] Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, Penn completed the design (with help from architects [[Matthias Hollwich]], [[Marc Kushner]], and [[KSS Architects]]) and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory it named ''Pennovation Works''. ''Pennovation Works'' houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a “pitch bleacher,” and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, which Penn is formally calling “South Bank” (of Schuylkill River), is a mixture of lightly-refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that "South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation.<ref>https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/news/tracking-evolution-industry-34th-and-grays-ferry accessed March 19, 2021</ref>

===Parks and arboreta===
In 2007, Penn acquired about {{convert|35|acre|ha}} between the campus and the Schuylkill River (the former site of the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]] and a nearby {{convert|24|acre|ha|adj=on}} site owned by the United States Postal Service). Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]], and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.

In September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets.

Penn maintains two arboreta.  The roughly {{convert|300|acre|sp=us|adj=on}} ''The Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania'' encompasses the entire University City campus.  The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks,<ref name="arbnet">http://www.arbnet.org/morton-register/penn-campus-arboretum-university-pennsylvania-0 accessed March 19, 2021</ref> which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborday.org/programs/tree-campus-higher-education/campuses.cfm|title=Tree Campus Higher Education Schools}}</ref> since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arbnet.org/morton-register/penn-campus-arboretum-university-pennsylvania-0|title = Arbnet &#124; Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees.<ref>http://www.facilities.upenn.edu accessed March 19, 2021</ref> [[File:Morris_Arboretum_-_DSC00525.JPG|thumb|[[Morris Arboretum]]]] Penn also owns and operates the {{convert|92|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Morris Arboretum]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]] in northwestern Philadelphia.

===Libraries===<!-- This section is linked from [[NeXT]] -->
[[File:FisherFineArtsLibrary.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fisher Fine Arts Library]], also referred to as the Furness Library or simply the Fine Arts Library]]

Penn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]]. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later. It has grown into a system of 15 libraries (13 are on the contiguous campus) with 400 [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48&nbsp;million. The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million [[microform]] items and 1.11 million e-books.<ref name="Penn: Penn Facts"/> It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/|title=Penn Library Data Farm|access-date=December 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title= Data Farm|url =http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317083950/http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/|archive-date=March 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with [[Saint Clement's Church (Philadelphia)|St. Clement's Church]] in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839–1907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.<ref>Joyce L.

In 2020, Penn installed ''Brick House'', a monumental work of art (a "critical fabulation" in language used by its creator, [[Simone Leigh]]) at the College Green gateway to Penn's campus (near corner of 34th Street and Woodland Walk).  This 5,900-pound bronze sculpture, which is 16 feet high and 9 feet in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head (crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids) atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house.<ref name="Brick House">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehighline.org/art/projects/simoneleigh/|title=Brick House|website=The High Line|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> At the installation,  Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that "Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty—along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience—to a central crossroad of Penn's campus."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/towering-bronze-sculpture-installed-entrance-penns-campus|title=Towering bronze sculpture installed at the entrance to Penn's campus}}</ref>

In addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has a number of more traditional statues including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, [[R. Tait McKenzie]].<ref>Joseph Hanaway and Richard L. Cruess, ''McGill Medicine – 1885 to 1936'' (McGill-Queen's University Press: Montreal, 1996), 56.</ref> Among the notable sculptures is that of ''Young Ben Franklin'', which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to [[Franklin Field]]. The sculpture is titled ''[[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1723'' and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War 1 era (1910–1914). Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost [[Edgar Fahs Smith]].

Penn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America at about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, and 12.9 tons (made of solid red granite). The sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, [[Flinders Petrie|Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie]], during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of [[Memphis, Egypt]], where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.<ref>Crimmins, Peter (June 12, 2019).

=== Admissions ===
Undergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by ''[[U.S. News & World Report|US News]]'' to be "most selective". Admissions officials consider a student's [[Grading in education|GPA]] to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=University of Pennsylvania|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-pennsylvania-3378/applying|access-date=Feb 3, 2021|website=[[US News & World Report]]: Education}}</ref> For the class of 2024, entering in the fall of 2020,<ref>{{cite web|last=Diebold |first=Gillian |title=Penn admits a record-low 7.44 percent of applicants to the Class of 2023 |url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/penn-acceptance-ivy-league-regular-decision-admissions-class-2023|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328223429/https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/penn-acceptance-ivy-league-regular-decision-admissions-class-2023|archive-date=March 28, 2019 |access-date=March 28, 2019 |website=www.thedp.com}}</ref> the university received 42,205 applications and admitted 8.07 percent of the applicants.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Singh|first=Pia|title=Penn admits 8.07% of applicants to the class of 2024, a slight uptick from last year|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-acceptance-ivy-league-regular-decision-admissions-class-2024|access-date=April 14, 2020 |website=www.thedp.com|language=en-us}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country.

===Coordinated dual-degree and interdisciplinary programs===
Penn offers specialized [[double degree|coordinated dual-degree]] (CDD) programs, which award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools. Undergraduate programs include:
* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology
* Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science
* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business
* Nursing and Health Care Management
* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management
* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences
* Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)
* Accelerated 7-year Bio-Dental Program
* Singh Program in Networked & Social Systems Engineering (NETS)<ref>{{cite web|title=NETS Homepage|url=http://www.nets.upenn.edu/|publisher=Penn Engineering|access-date=November 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024753/http://www.nets.upenn.edu/|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, "dual degree" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a B.A. and an M.S. in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.

For graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.

The [[University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice]], commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of [[social policy]] and [[social work]] that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/programs/index.html|title=SP2 Programs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/university-of-pennsylvania-school-of-social-policy-and-practice-program-in-social-work-000_10013879.aspx|title=Peterson's National Guide University of Pennsylvania SP2|publisher=Petersons}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/degree-programs/dual-degree-programs/overview/about-the-programs/|title=About the Programs {{!}} School of Social Policy & Practice |website=www.sp2.upenn.edu |access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref> Penn SP2's vision is: "The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and [[justice]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/about/index.html|title=About SP2|publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy & Practice}}</ref>

Penn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments. In 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called ''The American Law Register,'' now the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review|Penn Law Review]]'', one of the most cited law journals in the world).<ref>{{cite web|title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|publisher=Washington and Lee University School of Law|access-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121012415/http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lj/index.aspx|archive-date=November 21, 2011}}</ref> Under the deanship of [[William Draper Lewis]], the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.<ref>Owen Roberts, "William Draper Lewis", 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1949)</ref> The Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education.

Several major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]].<ref name="Moore Engineering">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/computers/intro.html|title=Important Milestones and Fascinating Innovations During the Last Fifty Years of Computing Research at the University of Pennsylvania|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009144750/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/computers/intro.html|archive-date=October 9, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular [[COBOL]] programming language.<ref name="Moore Engineering"/> Penn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine.

[[Conductive polymer]] was also developed at Penn by [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Hideki Shirakawa]], an invention that earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. On faculty since 1965, [[Ralph L. Brinster]] developed the scientific basis for [[in vitro fertilization]] and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 2010. The theory of [[BCS theory|superconductivity]] was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member [[John Robert Schrieffer]] (along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Leon Cooper]]). The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are [[conjoint analysis]], widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, [[Simon Kuznets]]'s method of measuring [[Gross National Product]],<ref name="125 Influential People and Ideas">{{cite web|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|title=125 Influential People and Ideas|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610064028/http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|archive-date=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the [[Penn effect]] (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the "Wharton Model"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/727461/Wharton-Model|title=Wharton Model (economics) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|access-date=March 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919212318/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/727461/Wharton-Model|archive-date=September 19, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> developed by Nobel-laureate [[Lawrence Klein]] to measure and forecast economic activity.

As detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910. Penn's first director of publicity, created a recruiting brochure, translated into Spanish, with approximately 10,000 copies circulated throughout Latin America. That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening "smoker", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the University by then-vice provost [[Edgar Fahs Smith]] (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)<ref name=PennHistory>{{cite web|title=Penn Chemistry History|url=https://www.chem.upenn.edu/content/penn-chemistry-history|website=University of Pennsylvania|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=NIE>{{cite book|title=The New International Encyclopædia|date=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead & company|location=New York|chapter=Smith, Edgar Fahs |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Smith,_Edgar_Fahs|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Klickstein">{{cite journal|last=Klickstein|first=Herbert S.|title=Edgar Fahs Smith-His Contributions to the History of Chemistry |journal=Chymia |date=1959 |volume=5 |pages=11–30 |doi=10.2307/27757173 |jstor=27757173 |url=http://hsns.ucpress.edu/content/ucpchymia/5/11.full.pdf}}</ref><ref name="CHM">{{cite journal|last=Bohning |first=James J. |title=Women in chemistry at Penn 1894–1908, Edgar Fahs Smith as Mentor|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=10–11, 38–43}}</ref><ref name=Collier>{{cite book|chapter=Smith, Edgar Fahs|title=Collier's New Encyclopedia|date=1921|publisher=P.

===Religious and spiritual organizations===

;Mainstream Protestantism
Dating back to 1857, The Christian Association (a.k.a. The CA) is the oldest religious organization at the university and is composed primarily of students from [[Mainline Protestant]] backgrounds.<ref>Cheyney, Edward Potts. "A History of the University of Pennsylvania, 1740-1940." Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press (1940): 433-434.</ref> When the University moved to its current campus in the 1880s the CA was based in Houston Hall. After moving around several times it relocated to building at 36th and Locust Streets, which it built and owned (now the ARCH Building), and occupied from 1928 until 2000. The CA ran several foreign missions including one of lasting import when in 1906 it financed [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] graduate, [[Josiah McCracken]], MD, trip to China to investigate the viability of operating the medical department of the [[Canton Christian College]] (now known as [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)]]). The following year, Dr. McCracken moved to China and renamed the department as "The University Medical School in Canton, China," and served as its president from the time of renaming through the date in 1913 when the CA ended its affiliation with the Canton Christian College.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/mccracken_jc.html | title=Josiah C.

==Athletics==
{{Main|Penn Quakers}}
Penn's [[college athletics|sports]] teams are nicknamed the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the teams are often also referred to as [[The Red and the Blue|The Red & Blue]]. The athletes participate in the [[Ivy League]] and [[Division I (NCAA)|Division&nbsp;I]] (Division&nbsp;I FCS for football) in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. In recent decades, they often have been [[sports league|league]] champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the [[cricket]] team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its "grounds", and then  only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against [[Haverford College]]).<ref name="web.archive.org">https://web.archive.org/web/20180723200322/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/cricket/1864.html accessed April 17, 2021</ref> The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against [[College of New Jersey (18th Century)|College of New Jersey]] (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of [[association football]] (i.e. soccer) and [[Rugby football|rugby]] rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).<ref name="SASH-Farnsworth">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ussoccerhistory.org/the-origins-of-soccer-in-philadelphia-part-5-local-college-based-football-after-the-1863-laws-of-the-game/ |title=The origins of soccer in Philadelphia, part 5: Local college-based football after the 1863 Laws of the Game – Society for American Soccer History |last=Farnsworth |first=Ed |date=April 16, 2020 |publisher=Society for American Soccer History}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kieran|first=John|title=Sports of the Times|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 8, 1932|page=22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/19th-century-athletics/timeline|title = Penn Athletics in the 19th Century: Timeline}}</ref>

From 1846 to 1860, there is little evidence of Penn playing cricket but just as Civil War began, Penn students resumed playing cricket matches between classes of Penn students.

On May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against [[Haverford College]]<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180723200322/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/cricket/1864.html and https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/10/penn-cricket-team-historical-feature both accessed April 17, 2021</ref> and then proceeded to play Haverford for three consecutive years   until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.

After Penn moved west of the [[Schuylkill River]] in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs ([[Belmont Cricket Club]], the closest to campus at 50th Street and Chester Avenue, [[Merion Cricket Club]], and [[Germantown Cricket Club]]), or at Haverford College.<ref>https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015062223006&view=1up&seq=10 (accessed March 4, 2021)</ref> Though there is evidence of an occasional game during period 1870 through 1875, none were played against other colleges and there were no yearbook pictures for the three years after 1872 when Penn moved from Center City to University City. Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that  included Haverford College and [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180723184343/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/cricket/histy.html accessed April 17, 2021</ref>

The Penn men's [[rugby football]] team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States.  Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid 1870s playing by rules much closer to the [[rugby union]] and [[Association Football]] code rules (relative to [[American football]] rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented<ref name="SASH-Farnsworth">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ussoccerhistory.org/the-origins-of-soccer-in-philadelphia-part-5-local-college-based-football-after-the-1863-laws-of-the-game/ |title=The origins of soccer in Philadelphia, part 5: Local college-based football after the 1863 Laws of the Game – Society for American Soccer History |last=Farnsworth |first=Ed |date=April 16, 2020 |publisher=Society for American Soccer History}}</ref>). Among its earliest games was a game against [[College of New Jersey (18th Century)|College of New Jersey]] (which in 1895 changed its name to [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876 with [[Harvard]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.<ref name="Fight song">[[Rottenberg, Dan]] (1985) "Fight On, Pennsylvania" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pp. 25, 28, 33, 34.</ref><ref name="SASH-Farnsworth" /> Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association Football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in [[English public schools]].<ref name=CompleterugbyUSA>Bath (1977) p77</ref>

Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game.

===Football===

[[File:ChuckBednarik1952Bowman.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|[[Chuck Bednarik]] (aka "Concrete Charlie") excelled as a center on offense and a linebacker on defense, was a three-time All-American, and was inducted to the [[College Football Hall of Fame|College]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Pro Halls of Fame]].]]
Penn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.<ref name="Fight song"/>

Penn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus [[George Washington Woodruff]] introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the [[forward pass]], as well as the [[Placekicker|place-kick]] from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.<ref name="Fight song" />  Among the key players on the teams from 1897 to 1900 was [[Truxton Hare]], Sr. who was selected as a charter member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1951. While primarily a [[Guard (American football)|guard]], he also ran, [[Punt (gridiron football)|punted]], kicked off, and drop-kicked [[conversion (gridiron football)|extra points]]. 

The achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and [[John Outland]], a [[Penn Med]] alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the [[Outland Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football [[Lineman (gridiron football)|interior lineman]] of the year.

Also, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. [[Chuck Bednarik]] (class of 1949) was a three-time [[All-America]]n [[Center (American football)|center]]/[[linebacker]] who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] [[George Savitsky]] and three-time All-American [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Skip Minisi]]. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], as was their coach, [[George Munger (American football)|George Munger]] (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969.

Penn's game against [[University of California]] at Berkeley on Sept. 29, 1951 (in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field), was first college football game to be broadcast in color.<ref>https://eyesofageneration.com/september-29-1951-two-college-football-television-firstsdid-you-know-cbs-an accessed August 4, 2021/</ref> <ref>https://www.thedp.com/article/2021/03/penn-football-first-televised-color-game-ncaa-history accessed August 4, 2021</ref>

Penn [[basketball]] is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) [[Final Four]] appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], along with [[La Salle University|La Salle]], [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]], [[Temple University|Temple]] and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]].

===Facilities===
[[Franklin Field]] is where the Quakers play football, [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[sprint football]] and track and field (and formerly baseball, soccer, and rugby). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, and was the site of 18 [[Army–Navy Game|Army–Navy]] games between 1899 and 1935.<ref>Didinger, Ray; Lyons, Robert S. (2005). ''The Eagles Encyclopedia''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p.&nbsp;205. {{ISBN|1-59213-449-1}}. Retrieved 2009-01-08</ref>

Today it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as [[intramural sports|intramural]] and club sports, including [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] and cricket. Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event "the [[Penn Relays]]."

Penn's home court, the [[Palestra]], is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, [[wrestling]] team and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, as well as high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility.Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing. Penn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium (for both women's and men's soccer, which includes elevated stands for 650 spectators, a 180-degree rotating scoreboard, and the Rapaport Family Suite), the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field (with special artificial turf), and Irving "Moon" Mondschein Throwing Complex (for [[javelin]], [[shot put]], [[discus]], and [[Hammer throw]]).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-12-20|title=River Fields|url=https://www.facilities.upenn.edu/maps/locations/river-fields|access-date=2021-07-26|website=University of Pennsylvania Facilities and Real Estate Services|language=en}}</ref> In addition, Penn baseball plays its home games at [[Meiklejohn Stadium]] at Murphy Field.

The [[1980 Olympic boycott|Olympic Boycott Games]] of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] following the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet incursion in Afghanistan]]. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.
