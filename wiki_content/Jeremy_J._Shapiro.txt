'''Jeremy J. Shapiro''' (born 1940), is an American academic, a professor at [[Fielding Graduate University]] who works in the area of [[critical theory|critical social theory]] with emphasis on the social and cultural effects of information technology and systems, social change, and the [[aesthetics]] of [[music]]. His main intellectual products/innovations include
*the concept of the universal semiotic of technological experience: a language of images, symbols, and technologies that integrates the conscious and unconscious, the public and the private, in advanced industrial civilization;
*[[zen]] [[socialism]], an approach to socialism that focuses on the need for simultaneous change at the personal, interpersonal and social levels, blends activism and non-attachment, and aims at the minimally, rather than maximally rational society;
*mindful inquiry in social research (developed together with [[Valerie Malhotra Bentz]]), which integrates [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[hermeneutics]], [[critical theory]], and [[Buddhism]] as a framework for research;
*metaphorical metadata, amplifying standard analytical and conceptual classification schemes through classification based on metaphors, symbols, and analogies;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iath.virginia.edu/ach-allc.99/proceedings/shapiro.html |title=The Personal Meaning Scheme as Principle of Information Ordering: Postmodernism, Transdisciplinarity, and the Ontology of Classification |first=Jeremy J.|last=Shapiro |authorlink= |author2=Hughes, Shelley K. |year=1999 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref>

*the notion that the philosopher/musicologist [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s model of how to listen to modern music based on his analysis of the individuated nature of a modern musical work is a model for how to be an individuated person in contemporary society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ojs.c3sl.ufpr.br/ojs2/index.php/musica/article/viewFile/21980/14342 |title=Adorno's Praxis of Individuation Through Music Listening |author=Jeremy J.

He received his [[Ph.D.]] from Brandeis in 1976.
