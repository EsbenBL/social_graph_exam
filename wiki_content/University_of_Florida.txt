The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the [[East Florida Seminary]], the oldest of the University of Florida's four predecessor institutions, was founded in [[Ocala, Florida]].

On January 6, 1853, Governor [[Thomas Brown (Florida politician)|Thomas Brown]] signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ufl.edu/history/1853.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901082230/http://www.ufl.edu/history/1853.html|url-status=dead|title=Governor Thomas Brown signs Higher Education bill|archive-date=September 1, 2006}}</ref> Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]], which operated until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861.

James Henry Roper, an educator from [[North Carolina]] and a [[Florida Senate|state senator]] from [[Alachua County]], had opened a school in Gainesville, the [[History of the University of Florida|Gainesville Academy]], in 1858. In 1866,<ref>[http://www.ufl.edu/history/1853.html/ "UF Early History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122142257/http://www.ufl.edu/history/1853.html |date=January 22, 2007 }}, University of Florida.</ref> Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the East Florida Seminary's relocation to Gainesville.{{NoteTag|The present university campus incorporates much of the former seminary and academy campuses. [[Epworth Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Epworth Hall]], one of the main building of the [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]], still stands in downtown Gainesville, but is not within the boundaries of the university's campus.}}

The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the '''Florida Agricultural College''', established at [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]] by Jordan Probst in 1884. Florida Agricultural College became the state's first [[land-grant college]] under the [[Morrill Act]]. In 1903, the Florida Legislature, looking to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins, changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the "University of Florida," a name the school would hold for only two years.<ref>University of Florida, [http://www.ufl.edu/150/htmltimeline/1853_1905.html/ UF Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210211910/http://www.ufl.edu/150/htmltimeline/1853_1905.html |date=February 10, 2007 }}.</ref>{{NoteTag|The name, the "University of Florida," has been held by three separate schools: the [[West Florida Seminary]] was renamed the "University of Florida" by the legislature, and held the name from 1883 to 1902; Florida Agricultural College was renamed in 1902 and held the name until 1905; and the name of the new University of the State of Florida was simplified to the University of Florida in 1909. The West Florida Seminary was a predecessor to the modern [[Florida State University]] in Tallahassee.}}

In 1905, the [[Florida Legislature]] passed the [[Henry Holland Buckman|Buckman Act]], which consolidated the state's publicly supported higher education institutions. The member of the legislature who wrote the act, [[Henry Holland Buckman]], later became the namesake of [[Buckman Hall]], one of the first buildings constructed on the new university's campus.<ref>University of Florida, Department of Housing, [http://www.housing.ufl.edu/housing/Facilities_TourPages/buckman.htm/  Buckman Hall Quick Facts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825052217/http://www.housing.ufl.edu/housing/Facilities_TourPages/buckman.htm |date=August 25, 2006 }}. Retrieved April 18, 2012.</ref> The Buckman Act organized the [[State University System of Florida]] and created the [[Florida Board of Control]] to govern the system. It also abolished the six pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education, and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new "[[History of the University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]]." The four predecessor institutions consolidated to form the new university included the '''University of Florida at Lake City''' (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]], the '''East Florida Seminary''' in Gainesville, the '''St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School''' in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], and the '''South Florida Military College''' in [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]].<ref>[http://www.capolicycenter.org/florida/florida5.html About the Buckman Act consolidation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826015404/http://www.capolicycenter.org/florida/florida5.html |date=August 26, 2006 }}</ref>

The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and gender—the University of the State of Florida for white men, the [[Florida State University|Florida Female College]] for white women, and the [[Florida A&M|State Normal School for Colored Students]] for African-American men and women.<ref name="State Library and Archives of Florida - The Florida Memory Project Timeline (see 1905)">{{cite web |url = http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline |title=State Library and Archives of Florida - The Florida Memory Project Timeline (see 1905) |access-date=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611171253/http://www.floridamemory.com/timeline/ |archive-date=June 11, 2008 }}</ref>

The City of Gainesville, led by its mayor [[William Reuben Thomas]], campaigned to be home to the new university.<ref>Hildreth, Charles and Merlin Cox, History of Gainesville, Florida 1854-1979, Alachua County Historical Society (Gainesville, 1981) at 102.</ref> On July 6, 1905, the Board of Control selected [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] for the new university campus. [[Andrew Sledd]], president of the pre-existing [[History of the University of Florida|University of Florida at Lake City]], was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida. The 1905–1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new University of the State of Florida was legally created, but operated on the campus of the old University of Florida in Lake City until the first buildings on the new campus in Gainesville were complete. Architect William A. Edwards designed the first official campus buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] style. Classes began on the new Gainesville campus on September 26, 1906, with 102 students enrolled.

In 1909, the school's name was simplified from the "University of the State of Florida" to the "University of Florida."

The [[alligator]] was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911, after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants imprinted with an alligator emblem since the animal is very common in freshwater habitats in the Gainesville area and throughout the state. The mascot was a popular choice, and the university's sports teams quickly adopted the nickname.

The school colors of orange and blue were also officially established in 1911, though the reasons for the choice are unclear. The most likely rational was that they are a combination of the colors of the university's two largest predecessor institutions, as the East Florida Seminary used orange and black while Florida Agricultural College used blue and white.<ref>University of Florida, History, [http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html University of Florida History 1906-1927] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231184043/http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html |date=December 31, 2010 }}.

In 1909, Albert Murphree was appointed the university's second president. He organized the university into several colleges, increased enrollment from under 200 to over 2,000, and was instrumental in the founding of the [[Florida Blue Key]] leadership society. Murphree is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on campus.

In 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated women of a "mature age" (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a "reputable educational institution" be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women. Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break.<ref>[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/aspring/All%20courses/UF%20courses/Women%20UF/Holbrook%20et%20al.doc University of Florida: College of Liberal Arts and Sciences-Notable Women at UF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528040000/http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/aspring/All%20courses/UF%20courses/Women%20UF/Holbrook%20et%20al.doc |date=May 28, 2008 }}</ref> [[Lassie Goodbread-Black]] from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231184043/http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html|url-status=dead|title=University of Florida website: History-1925 » First Woman Enrolls|archive-date=December 31, 2010}}</ref>

Beginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning [[World War II]] veterans who could attend college under the [[GI Bill of Rights]] (Servicemen's Readjustment Act). Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the '''Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida''' on the campus of Florida State College for Women in [[Tallahassee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html |title=About Florida State - History |publisher=Office of University Communications |date=September 23, 2009 |access-date=July 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061306/https://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 7, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By the end of the 1946–47 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch.

=== National and international prominence ===
In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to join the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), an organization of sixty-two academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada. Florida is one of the seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU. In 2009, President [[Bernie Machen]] and the [[University of Florida Board of Trustees]] announced a major policy transition for the university. The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090221/ARTICLES/902211015/1002/NEWS01?Title=UF-looks-to-transform-itself|title=UF looks to transform itself|website=Gainesville.com|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529223435/http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090221/ARTICLES/902211015/1002/NEWS01?Title=UF-looks-to-transform-itself|archive-date=May 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, the University of Florida became the first university in the state of Florida to crack the top ten best public universities according to U.S. News.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.ufl.edu/articles/2017/09/uf-first-in-florida-to-crack-us-news-list-of-top-10-best-public-universities.php |title = UF first in Florida to crack U.S. News list of top 10 best public universities |date = September 13, 2017 |website = news.ufl.edu |access-date = September 17, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170918021347/http://news.ufl.edu/articles/2017/09/uf-first-in-florida-to-crack-us-news-list-of-top-10-best-public-universities.php |archive-date = September 18, 2017 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The University of Florida was awarded $900.7 million in annual research expenditures in sponsored research for the 2020 fiscal year.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://news.ufl.edu/2020/08/record-research-awards/|title=University of Florida hits record $900 million in research awards|website=news.ufl.edu}}</ref> In 2017, university president Kent Fuchs announced a plan to hire 500 new faculty to break into the top five best public universities; the most new faculty members will be hired in STEM fields. 230 faculty have been hired with the remaining 270 faculty to be hired by fall of 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.alligator.org/news/more-than-new-faculty-hired-to-begin-in-fall-as/article_e94553c6-9b77-11e8-bbe1-b70f171cb65e.html |title = More than 200 new faculty hired to begin in Fall as part of UF initiative |last = Writer |first = Angela DiMichele, Alligator Staff |newspaper = [[The Independent Florida Alligator]] |access-date = 2018-08-30 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180830210226/https://www.alligator.org/news/more-than-new-faculty-hired-to-begin-in-fall-as/article_e94553c6-9b77-11e8-bbe1-b70f171cb65e.html |archive-date = August 30, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>

About 10 are stationed in Geneva. The group is the largest from any university in the U.S. to participate in the CMS experiment. The UF team designed and oversaw development of a major detector within the CMS. The detector, the Muon system, is intended to capture subatomic particles called muons, which are heavier cousins of electrons. Among other efforts, UF scientists analyzed about 100 of the 400 detector chambers placed within the Muon system to be sure they were functioning properly. Scientists from the University of Florida group played a central role in the discovery of the Higgs particle. The bulk of the UF research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2008/09/09/uf-collider/|title=09 » UF physicists to take part in world's most ambitious science experiment » University of Florida|author=University of Florida|website=News.ufl.edu|access-date=May 29, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616131157/http://news.ufl.edu/2008/09/09/uf-collider/|archive-date=June 16, 2012}}</ref>

One of their primary research tools is lightning initiation from overhead thunderclouds, using the triggered lightning rocket-and-wire technique. Small sounding rockets, connected to long copper wires, are fired into likely lightning storm [[cumulonimbus]] clouds. When the rocket—or its wire—is struck by lightning, the passing of the high-voltage lightning strike down the wire vaporizes it as the lightning travels to the ground. Undergraduate and graduate research in UF's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's Lightning Research Group is used to increase new fundamental knowledge about lightning-based phenomena.

==Student life==
=== PaCE ===
UF launched a new program in the fall of 2015 called PaCE, or Pathway to Campus Enrollment. PaCE was designed to provide an alternative way to enroll students who would have been accepted through regular admissions, but there is not enough space in dorms or classrooms. To be accepted into the PaCE program, you would have been accepted to UF initially. PaCE was randomly given to admitted students based on major. Through PaCE, students are admitted to UF, but are required to complete 60 credit hours and all of their prerequisite courses through UF online before transitioning to on-campus learning. The University of Florida admitted 2,420 students for PaCE for the class of 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.ufl.edu/learn/pace/faq|title=PaCE FAQ - University of Florida|website=Admissions.ufl.edu|access-date=December 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203191525/http://www.admissions.ufl.edu/learn/pace/faq|archive-date=December 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Innovation Academy ===
The Innovation Academy at UF is a program designed for students that want to focus on innovation, creativity, leadership, and entrepreneurship along with their intended major. Students that enroll in the Innovation Academy go to UF during the spring and summer semesters so that they can participate in internships and study abroad opportunities during the fall. IA offers 25+ different majors that all share a common minor of Innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://innovationacademy.ufl.edu|title=Innovation Academy - University of Florida|website=Innovationacademy.ufl.edu|access-date=December 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083538/http://innovationacademy.ufl.edu/|archive-date=November 15, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Fraternities and sororities===
Approximately 5,200 undergraduate students (or approximately 15%) are members of either a sorority or fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeks.ufl.edu/prospects/who.asp|title=Sorority and Fraternity Affairs - Who Are We|website=Greeks.ufl.edu|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529212819/http://www.greeks.ufl.edu/prospects/who.asp|archive-date=May 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Sorority]] and [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternity]] Affairs (formerly known as Greek Life) at the University of Florida is separated into four divisions: [[North American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] (IFC), [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC), [[National Multicultural Greek Council|Multicultural Greek Council]] (MGC), and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC). The [[Order of Omega]] has a chapter at the university.

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 25 fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of 17 sororities. Some of the fraternity chapters on campus are older than the university itself, with the first chapters being chartered in 1884 and founded on the campus of one of the university's predecessor institutions in Lake City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grove.ufl.edu/~ifc/chapters/sae.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920105428/http://grove.ufl.edu/~ifc/chapters/sae.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 20, 2004|title=Oldest fraternities at UF|website=Grove.ufl.edu|access-date=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

The Multicultural Greek Council consists of 12 cultural organizations ([[Latinos|Latino]], [[Asian people|Asian]], [[South Asians|South Asian]], etc.), seven fraternities and five sororities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council comprises nine historically black organizations, five fraternities and four sororities.

There are also three Greek service organizations for students, two sororities Delta Nu Zeta and [[Omega Phi Alpha]] and one fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Omega]].

There are now also four university recognized organizations for Christian students, [[Beta Upsilon Chi]] and Kappa Phi Epsilon fraternities as well as [[Sigma Phi Lambda]] and [[Christian sorority|Theta Alpha]] sororities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alligator.org/edit/news/issues/stories/041208kappa.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613132520/http://www.alligator.org/edit/news/issues/stories/041208kappa.html |archive-date=June 13, 2007  }}</ref><ref>[https://www.studentinvolvement.ufl.edu/StudentOrganizations/StudentOrganizationListing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104071224/https://www.studentinvolvement.ufl.edu/StudentOrganizations/StudentOrganizationListing|date=January 4, 2012}}
</ref>

In early 2015 the Panhellenic Council announced the arrival of two new sororities. Gamma Phi Beta was chartered in Fall 2015 and Alpha Phi will start recruitment in Fall 2018. Construction is underway on Sorority Row for Gamma Phi Beta's house.
