Several of York's programs have gained notable recognition both nationally and internationally.

==History==
[[File:YorkFaculty1961.jpg|thumb|right|York University Faculty Members, 1961]]
York University was established in 1959 as a non-denominational institution by the ''York University Act'',<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/documents/act1959.htm |title=York University Act, 1959 |publisher=Yorku.ca |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref> which received [[Royal Assent]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] on 26 March of that year.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite encyclopedia|author=P. Anisef, J. Lennards|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university|title=Universities in Canada|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref> Its first class was held in September 1960 in Falconer Hall on the [[University of Toronto]] campus with a total of 76 students.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/york-university|title=York University|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|date=March 4, 2015|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that [[higher education]] was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, [[Glendon College]], and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> York became independent in 1965, after an initial period of affiliation with the [[University of Toronto]] (U of T), under the ''York University Act'', 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/documents/act1965.htm |title=York University Act, 1965 |publisher=Yorku.ca |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref> Its main campus on the northern outskirts of Toronto opened in 1965.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Murray Ross, who continues to be honoured today at the university in several ways – including the [[Murray G. Ross Award]] – was still vice-president of U of T when he was approached to become York University's new president.<ref name="Pound2005">{{cite book |title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> At the time, York University was envisaged as a feeder campus to U of T, until Ross's powerful vision led it to become a completely separate institution.<ref>Ross, Murray. ''The Way Must be Tried: Memoirs of a University Man''. Toronto: Stoddart Publishing Company, 1992.</ref>

In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele Campus]], in [[North York]], in the Jane and Finch community.<ref name=":1" /> The [[Glendon College|Glendon]] campus became a [[bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] [[liberal arts college]] led by [[Escott Reid]], who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]], who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.library.yorku.ca/dspace/handle/123456789/701 |title=YorkSpace: Item 123456789/701 |publisher=Library.yorku.ca |date=1966-09-30 |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref>

The first Canadian undergraduate program in dance opened at York University in 1970.<ref name="Pound2005" /> In 1972, [[Canada Post]] featured the nascent institution on 8¢ stamps, entitled ''York University Campus, North York, Ont.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(University.TITP.)+Or+(University.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&r=16&f=G&Sect1=STMP |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904032908/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=%28University.TITP.%29+Or+%28University.TITI.+And+null.B742.%29&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2Farchivianet%2F02011702_e.html&r=16&f=G&Sect1=STMP |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-09-04 |title=Postage Stamp |publisher=Data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca |access-date=2014-01-06 }}</ref> The first Canadian PhD program in women's studies opened with five candidates in January 1992.<ref name="Pound2005" />

Its bilingual mandate and focus on the liberal arts continue to shape Glendon's special status within York University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ycom/profiles/past/aug00/current/features/article1.htm |title=Profiles Online – August 2000 – Features: GUIDING PRINCIPALS |publisher=Yorku.ca |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref> The new [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele Campus]] was regarded as somewhat isolated, in a generally industrialized part of the city. Petrol storage facilities are still across the street. Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the [[brutalism|brutalist]] designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate. In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a [[Beatrice Ice Gardens|hockey arena]]. The [[Aviva Centre]] tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the [[Canada Masters]] tennis tournament. As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA), and in particular, near the [[Jane and Finch]] neighbourhood. Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location. Students occupied the university's administration offices in March 1997, protesting escalating tuition hikes.<ref name="Pound2005" />

In June 2014, the university announced that a new campus would be constructed in [[Markham, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/4485061-update-markham-vaughan-richmond-hill-make-york-university-short-list/|title=UPDATE: Markham, Vaughan, Richmond Hill make York University short list}}</ref>  The campus will be built near Highway 407, between Kennedy Road and Warden Avenue in partnership with [[Seneca College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yestoyork.ca/|title=Yes to York|access-date=5 July 2015}}</ref>  The new campus would house approximately 4,200 students<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yorku.ca/2017/11/29/york-university-markham-centre-campus-will-feature-light-filled-flexible-space-students/|title=York University Markham Centre Campus will feature light-filled flexible space for students - York Media Relations|date=29 November 2017|access-date=8 August 2018}}</ref> and is anticipated to accommodate up to 10,000 students in future phases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://impact.yorku.ca/york-university-welcomes-127-3-million-ontario-government-funding-markham-centre-campus/|title=York University welcomes $127.3-million in Ontario government funding for Markham Centre Campus - IMPACT: THE CAMPAIGN FOR YORK UNIVERSITY|access-date=8 August 2018}}</ref> On May 20, 2015, the provincial government announced it will provide financial contribution to this new project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/05/20/new-york-u-seneca-campus-to-be-built-in-markham.html|title=York U-Seneca campus to be built in Markham|date=20 May 2015|work=thestar.com|access-date=5 July 2015}}</ref>

===Athletics===
[[File:YorkUvsUofGuelph.jpg|thumb|York University vs [[University of Guelph]]]]

The university is represented in [[U Sports]] by the [[York Lions]]. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the "[[Yeomen]]", after the [[Yeomen Warders]], the guardians of the fortress and palace at the [[Tower of London]], otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name "Yeowomen" was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a "Yeowoman" was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the university replaced both names with the "Lions", as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the "York Lionesses", even though the name "Lion" is intended to apply to both sexes.<ref>[http://www.universitysport.ca/e/story_detail.cfm?id=397 Canadian Interuniversity Sport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329132247/http://www.universitysport.ca/e/story_detail.cfm?id=397 |date=March 29, 2012 }}.

== Labour disruptions ==
{{Main|2008–09 York University strike|2018 York University strike}}
{{POV section|date=December 2020}}
York University has a history of faculty and [[teaching assistant]] strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by YUFA<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yufa.org/ |title=yufa.org |publisher=yufa.org |access-date=2014-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107123812/http://yufa.org/ |archive-date=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ripley|first=Louise|title=March 1997 YUFA On the Picket Lines|url=http://www.yufa.org/news/TenthAnniversaryStrike.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070704125903/http://www.yufa.org/news/TenthAnniversaryStrike.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 July 2007|publisher=YUFA|access-date=6 January 2014|date=20 March 2007}}</ref>

Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, teaching assistants and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/article/532380|work=The Star|location=Toronto|title=Strike brings York to standstill|first=Louise|last=Brown|date=November 7, 2008}}</ref> The central issue in the 2001 disruption was the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language.

;2008 CUPE 3903 Strike
{{Main|2008–09 York University strike}}
[[2008–09 York University strike|A strike beginning on November 6, 2008]]<ref>[http://www.3903strike.ca/ York University Strike CUPE 3903 TAs Contract Faculty GAs & RAs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716084713/http://www.3903strike.ca/ |date=2016-07-16 }}. 3903strike.ca. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.</ref> concerned a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario [[Premier of Ontario|premier]] [[Dalton McGuinty]] announced a rare Sunday recall of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|provincial legislature]] in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-to-legislate-end-to-york-university-strike-1.779389 "Ontario to legislate end to York University strike"], CBC News, January 24, 2009.</ref> On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario.

;2015 CUPE 3903 Strike
An additional strike by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and [[graduate assistants]] took place throughout March 2015. When the strike began, on March 2, the university cancelled nearly all classes because about 2/3 of York courses were taught by the striking contract faculty at the time. On March 10, the contract faculty ratified a new agreement, but the teaching assistants and graduate assistants rejected tentative agreements the bargaining team had reached with the university. The teaching assistants and graduate assistants, continued their strike until the end of the month. Contract faculty did not go back to work in support of the union and classes remained cancelled. The union reached a tentative agreement with the university on March 29, 2015, which was ratified on March 31, 2015, thus putting an immediate end to the 29-day strike.<ref>{{cite web|title=York University strike ends as CUPE 3903 votes yes to new contract|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/york-university-strike-ends-as-cupe-3903-votes-yes-to-new-contract-1.3017060}}</ref>

;2018 CUPE 3903 Strike
{{Main|2018 York University strike}}
Units 1, 2, and 3 of CUPE Local 3903, the union represented by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants, began striking on Monday, March 5, 2018; several months after their previous collective agreement expired on August 31, 2017. The union's aim was to, in their words, "secure a fair collective agreement that, among other things, protected quality education and creates a less precarious working environment in Ontario's university sector."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cupe.ca/york-university-strike-moves-week-3-cupe-3903s-call-resume-bargaining-met-deafening-shameful-silence|title=As York University strike moves into Week 3, CUPE 3903's call to resume bargaining met with 'deafening, shameful silence'|work=Canadian Union of Public Employees|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}</ref> The main issues of the strike revolved around job security and the path to permanent tenured employment for contract faculty. A forced ratification vote was held between April 6–9 and was rejected by an overwhelming majority by all three units.

Units 1 and 3 remained on strike until July 25, when the newly formed [[42nd Parliament of Ontario]] led by [[Doug Ford|Premier Doug Ford]] passed back-to-work legislation via the ''Urgent Priorities Act'', ending the strike after 143 days, making it the longest strike in the post-secondary sector in [[Canada|Canadian]] history.
