The name 'Iran' disappeared from official records of the Saffarids, Samanids, Buyids, Saljuqs and their successor. But one unofficially used the name Iran, Eranshahr, and similar national designations, particularly Mamalek-e Iran or 'Iranian lands', which exactly translated the old Avestan term Ariyanam Daihunam. On the other hand, when the Safavids (not Reza Shah, as is popularly assumed) revived a national state officially known as Iran, bureaucratic usage in the Ottoman empire and even Iran itself could still refer to it by other descriptive and traditional appellations.|isbn=978-1-84511-062-8 }}</ref>

The ''[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge Dictionary]]'' lists {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɑː|n}} as the British pronunciation and {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} as the American pronunciation. Similarly, Glasgow-based ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' provides both [[English language in England|English English]] and American English pronunciations. The pronunciation guide from [[Voice of America]] also provides {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɑː|n}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pronounce.voanews.com/phrasedetail.php?name=IRAN |title=How do you say Iran? |website=Voice of America |access-date=7 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080458/http://pronounce.voanews.com/phrasedetail.php?name=IRAN |archive-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

The American English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} {{respell|eye|RAN}} may be heard in U.S. media. Max Fisher in ''[[The Washington Post]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/22/a-guide-to-26-foreign-countries-and-names-that-americans-mispronounce/|title= A guide to 26 foreign countries and names that Americans mispronounce|website=The Washington Post|access-date=7 February 2017}}</ref> prescribed {{IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|r|ɑː|n}} for ''Iran'', while proscribing {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}}. ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', in the dictionary's 2014 Usage Ballot, addressed the topic of the pronunciations of Iran and Iraq.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ahdictionary.tumblr.com/post/108171346728/american-english-pronunciations-of-iran-and-iraq |title=American English Pronunciations of Iran and Iraq |website=The American Heritage Dictionary |access-date=7 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080112/http://ahdictionary.tumblr.com/post/108171346728/american-english-pronunciations-of-iran-and-iraq |archive-date=11 February 2017}}</ref> According to this survey, the pronunciations {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɑː|n}} and {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} were deemed almost equally acceptable, while {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɑː|n}} was preferred by most panelists participating in the ballot. With regard to the {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} pronunciation, more than 70% of the panelists deemed it unacceptable. Among the reasons given by those panelists were that {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} has "hawkish connotations" and sounds "angrier", "xenophobic", "ignorant", and "not{{nbsp}}... cosmopolitan". The {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} pronunciation remains standard and acceptable, reflected in the entry for ''Iran'' in the American Heritage Dictionary itself, as well as in each of the other major dictionaries of American English.

From the 34th to the 20th century BC, northwestern Iran was part of the [[Kura-Araxes culture]], which stretched into the neighboring [[Caucasus]] and [[Anatolia]]. Since the earliest second millennium BC, [[Assyria]]ns settled in swaths of western Iran and incorporated the region into their territories.

[[File:Pasargad Tomb Cyrus3.jpg|thumb|[[Tomb of Cyrus]] the Great, founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], in [[Pasargadae]]]]

In 550&nbsp;BC, [[Cyrus the Great]], the son of [[Mandane of Media|Mandane]] and [[Cambyses I]], took over the Median Empire, and founded the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by unifying other city-states. The conquest of Media was a result of what is called the ''[[Persian Revolt]]''. The [[brouhaha]] was initially triggered by the actions of the Median ruler [[Astyages]], and was quickly spread to other provinces, as they allied with the Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include [[Lydia]], [[Babylon]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], parts of the [[Balkans]] and [[Eastern Europe]] proper, as well as the lands to the west of the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] rivers.

539 BC was the year in which Persian forces defeated the Babylonian army at [[Opis]], and marked the end of around four centuries of Mesopotamian domination of the region by conquering the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Cyrus entered Babylon and presented himself as a traditional Mesopotamian monarch. Subsequent Achaemenid art and iconography reflect the influence of the new political reality in Mesopotamia.

Most of the era of the Sasanian Empire was overshadowed by the [[Roman–Persian Wars]], which raged on the western borders at Anatolia, the [[Western Caucasus]], Mesopotamia, and the [[Levant]], for over 700 years. These wars ultimately exhausted both the Romans and the Sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the Muslim invasion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Following the fracture of the Mongol Empire in 1256, [[Hulagu Khan]], grandson of Genghis Khan, established the [[Ilkhanate]] in Iran. In 1370, yet another conqueror, [[Timur]], followed the example of Hulagu, establishing the [[Timurid Empire]] which lasted for another 156 years. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete massacre of [[Isfahan]], reportedly killing 70,000 citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Irans-Hidden-Jewel.html?c=y&page=2 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909120150/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Irans-Hidden-Jewel.html?c=y&page=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Isfahan: Iran's Hidden Jewel |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |access-date=21 June 2013 }}</ref> The Ilkhans and the Timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the Iranians, surrounding themselves with a culture that was distinctively Iranian.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spuler|first=Bertold|title=The Muslim World.

The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian populations]] into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s, which was caused by internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the [[Hotak dynasty|Pashtun rebels]] who besieged Isfahan and defeated [[Sultan Husayn]] in 1722.

====Afsharids====

{{main||Afsharid dynasty}}
In 1729, [[Nader Shah]], a chieftain and military genius from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders. He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|were divided]] among the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sasanian Empire, reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the [[Caucasus]], as well as other major parts of the [[West Asia|west]] and [[central Asia]], and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.<ref name="books.google.nl"/>
[[File:Mooze Naderi.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Nader Shah]], the powerful [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler, at Naderi Museum]]

Nader Shah [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invaded India and sacked far off Delhi]] by the late 1730s. His territorial expansion, as well as his military successes, went into a decline following the final [[Nader's Dagestan campaign|campaigns in the Northern Caucasus]] against then revolting [[Lezgins]]. The assassination of Nader Shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] of the [[Zand dynasty]] came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.<ref name=Immortal/>

====Zands====

{{main|Zand dynasty}}
Compared to its preceding dynasties, the geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited. Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained ''de facto'' autonomy, and were locally ruled through various [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Caucasian khanates]]. However, despite the self-ruling, they all remained [[commoner|subjects]] and vassals to the Zand king.<ref>Encyclopedia of Soviet law By Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge, Gerard Pieter van den Berg, William B. Simons, Page 457</ref> Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779, out of which [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]] emerged, founding the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1794.

====Qajars====

{{main|Qajar Iran}}
In 1795, following the disobedience of the [[Georgians|Georgian]] subjects and their [[Treaty of Georgievsk|alliance with the Russians]], the Qajars captured [[Tbilisi]] by the [[Battle of Krtsanisi]], and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing the Iranian [[suzerainty]] over the region.

[[File:Gulistan-Treaty.jpg|thumb|left|A map showing the 19th-century northwestern borders of Iran, comprising modern-day eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Armenia]], and the [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]], before being ceded to the neighboring [[Russian Empire]] by the [[Russo-Persian Wars|Russo-Iranian wars]]]]

The Russo-Iranian wars of [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|1804–1813]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|1826–1828]] resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus, comprising all of [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Dagestan]], which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries,{{sfn|Fisher|Avery|Hambly|Melville|1991|pp=329–330}} and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire.

As a result of the 19th-century Russo-Iranian wars, the Russians took over the Caucasus, and Iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region (comprising modern-day Dagestan, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]]), which got confirmed per the treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]].<ref name="Timothy C.

[[File:Parliamenttehran1906.jpg|thumb|The [[Baharestan|first national Iranian Parliament]] was established in 1906.]]

Between 1872 and 1905, a series of protests took place in response to the sale of [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] to foreigners by Qajar monarchs [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser-ed-Din]] and [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar-ed-Din]], and led to the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] in 1905. The [[Persian Constitution of 1906|first Iranian constitution]] and the first national parliament of Iran were founded in 1906, through the ongoing revolution. The Constitution included the official recognition of Iran's three religious minorities, namely [[Christianity in Iran|Christians]], [[Persian Jews|Jews]], and [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians]],<ref name="Colin Brock p 99">Colin Brock, Lila Zia Levers.

The struggle related to the constitutional movement was followed by the [[Triumph of Tehran]] in 1909, when [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] was defeated and forced to abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come. But this did not put an end to the civil uprisings and was soon followed by [[Mirza Kuchik Khan]]'s [[Jungle Movement of Gilan|Jungle Movement]] against both the Qajar monarchy and foreign invaders.

Despite Iran's neutrality during [[World War I]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires occupied the territory of western Iran and fought the [[Persian campaign (World War I)|Persian Campaign]] before fully withdrawing their forces in 1921.

In the midst of [[World War II]], in June 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] broke the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the [[Soviet Union]], Iran's northern neighbor. The Soviets quickly allied themselves with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied countries]] and in July and August, 1941 the British demanded that the Iranian government expel all Germans from Iran.

Khomeini publicly denounced the government, and was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964, he refused to apologize, and was eventually sent into exile.

Due to the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 spike in oil prices]], the economy of Iran was flooded with foreign currency, which caused [[inflation]]. By 1974, the economy of Iran was experiencing double digit inflation, and despite the many large projects to modernize the country, corruption was rampant and caused [[Background and causes of the Iranian Revolution#1970–1975|large amounts of waste]]. By 1975 and 1976, an [[recession|economic recession]] led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of youths who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, many of these people opposed the Shah's regime and began to organize and join the protests against it.<ref name="Hurd2009">{{cite book|author-link1=Elizabeth Shakman Hurd|author=Elizabeth Shakman Hurd|title=The Politics of Secularism in International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=096dp4dthm0C&pg=PA75|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2801-2|page=75|access-date=17 August 2016}}</ref>

On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army [[Iran–Iraq War#1980: Iraqi invasion|invaded the western Iranian province of Khuzestan]], launching the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Although the forces of Saddam Hussein made several early advances, by mid 1982, the Iranian forces successfully managed to [[Iran–Iraq War#1982: Iraqi retreat, Iranian offensive|drive the Iraqi army back]] into Iraq. In July 1982, with Iraq thrown on the defensive, the regime of Iran took the decision to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war continued until 1988 when the Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border. Subsequently, Khomeini accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|a truce mediated by the United Nations]]. The total Iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 [[killed in action|KIA]], 60,711 [[missing in action|MIA]], and 11,000–16,000 [[Civilian casualties|civilians killed]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiro|first=Dilip|author-link=Dilip Hiro|title=The Longest War: The Iran-Iraq Military Conflict|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/longestwariranir00hiro/page/205 205]|isbn=978-0-415-90406-3|oclc=22347651|url=https://archive.org/details/longestwariranir00hiro/page/205}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|author-link=Ervand Abrahamian|title=A History of Modern Iran|url=https://archive.org/details/historymodernira00abra|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, UK; New York|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historymodernira00abra/page/n202 171]–175, 212|isbn=978-0-521-52891-7|oclc=171111098}}</ref>

Iran consists of the [[Iranian Plateau]], with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]. It is one of the world's most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged [[mountain range]]s that separate various [[drainage basin|basins]] or [[plateau]]x from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]], and [[Alborz]], the last containing [[Mount Damavand]], Iran's highest point at {{convert|5610|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which is also the highest mountain in Asia west of the [[Hindu Kush]].

The northern part of Iran is covered by the lush lowland [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]], located near the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. The eastern part consists mostly of [[desert]] basins, such as the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Kavir Desert]], which is the country's largest desert, and the [[Dasht-e Loot|Lut Desert]], as well as some [[salt lake]]s. Iran had a 2019 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 7.67/10, ranking it 34th globally out of 172 countries.<ref name="FLII-Supplementary">{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

In June 1925, [[Reza Shah]] introduced conscription law at [[National Consultative Majlis]]. At that time every male person who had reached 21 years old must serve for military for two years.

Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], and the unelected institutions under his control. Human rights abuses continued unabated in 2016, with the authorities carrying out Iran's largest mass execution in years and launching a renewed crackdown on women's rights activists. The regime maintained restrictions on freedom of expression, both offline and online, and made further arrests of journalists, bloggers, labor union activists, and dual nationals visiting the country, with some facing heavy prison sentences. Hard-liners in control of powerful institutions, including the judiciary and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were behind many of the year's abuses. There were no indications that President Hassan Rouhani, a self-proclaimed moderate seeking reelection in 2017, was willing or able to push back against repressive forces and deliver the greater social freedoms he had promised. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi remained under house arrest for a sixth year without being formally charged or put on trial.

Over the past decade, numbers of anti-government protests have broken out throughout Iran (such as the [[2019–20 Iranian protests]]), demanding reforms or the end to the Islamic Republic. However, the [[IRGC]] and police often suppressed mass protests by violent means, which resulted in thousands of protesters killed.

===Languages===

{{Main|Languages of Iran}}

The majority of the population speak [[Persian language|Persian]], which is also the [[official language]] of the country. Others include speakers of a number of other [[Iranian languages]] within the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, and languages belonging to some other ethnicities living in Iran.

In northern Iran, mostly confined to [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] and [[Mazandaran Province|Mazenderan]], the [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] and [[Mazanderani language|Mazenderani]] languages are widely spoken, both having affinities to the neighboring [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]]. In parts of Gilan, the [[Talysh language]] is also widely spoken, which stretches up to the neighboring [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]]. Varieties of [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] are widely spoken in the province of [[Kurdistan Province|Kurdistan]] and nearby areas. In [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Persian dialects in Khuzestan|several distinct varieties of Persian]] are spoken. [[Luri language|Luri]] and [[Achomi language|Lari]] are also spoken in southern Iran.

[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], which is by far the most spoken language in the country after Persian,<ref>Annika Rabo, Bo Utas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rWEbrv5oD8AC ''The Role of the State in West Asia''] Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul, 2005 {{ISBN|91-86884-13-1}}</ref> as well as a number of other [[Turkic languages]] and dialects, is spoken in various regions of Iran, especially in the region of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]].

Notable minority languages in Iran include [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Arabic]]. [[Khuzestani Arabic|Khuzi Arabic]] is spoken by the [[Ahwazi Arabs|Arabs in Khuzestan]], as well as the wider group of [[Iranian Arabs]]. [[Circassian languages|Circassian]] was also once widely spoken by the large Circassian minority, but, due to assimilation over the many years, no sizable number of Circassians speak the language anymore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141 ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East''] Facts On File, Incorporated {{ISBN|1-4381-2676-X}} p. 141</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-iv--2 |title=Georgia viii: Georgian communities in Persia |last1=Oberling |first1=Pierre |date=7 February 2012 |website=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |access-date=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html |title=Circassian |publisher=Official Circassian Association |access-date=9 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035542/http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |title=Persians: Kind, hospitable, tolerant flattering cheats? |first1=Sir John |last1=Chardin |author-link=Jean Chardin |date=June 1997 |journal=[[Iranian.com|The Iranian]] |access-date=9 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970620173929/http://www.iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |archive-date=20 June 1997 |url-status=live}} Excerpted from:

Percentages of spoken language continue to be a point of debate, as many opt that they are politically motivated; most notably regarding the largest and second largest ethnicities in Iran, the Persians and [[Azerbaijanis]]. Percentages given by the [[CIA]]'s [[World Factbook]] include 53% Persian, 16% [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], 10% [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], 7% [[Mazanderani language|Mazenderani]] and [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], 7% [[Luri language|Luri]], 2% [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], 2% [[Balochi language|Balochi]], 2% [[Arabic]], and 2% the remainder [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Circassian languages|Circassian]].<ref name="CIA" />

===Ethnic groups===

{{main|Ethnicities in Iran}}

[[File:Provinces of Iran by population density.svg|thumb|Iran's provinces by population density (2013)]]

As with the spoken languages, the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate, mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups, the Persians and Azerbaijanis, due to the lack of Iranian state censuses based on ethnicity. [[The World Factbook|The CIA's World Factbook]] has estimated that around 79% of the population of Iran are a diverse [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic group]] that comprise speakers of various [[Iranian languages]],<ref>J. Harmatta in "History of Civilizations of Central Asia", Chapter 14, ''The Emergence of Indo-Iranians: The Indo-Iranian Languages'', ed. by A. H. Dani & V.N. Masson, 1999, p. 357</ref> with [[Persian people|Persians]] (including [[Mazanderani people|Mazenderanis]] and [[Gilaks]]) constituting 61% of the population, [[Kurds]] 10%, [[Lurs]] 6%, and [[Baloch people|Balochs]] 2%. Peoples of other ethno-linguistic groups make up the remaining 21%, with [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijanis]] constituting 16%, [[Arabs]] 2%, [[Turkmens]] and other [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] 2%, and others (such as [[Iranian Armenians|Armenians]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]], [[Iranian Georgians|Georgians]], [[Circassians in Iran|Circassians]], [[Iranian Assyrians|Assyrians]]) 1%.<ref name="CIA"/>

The [[Library of Congress]] issued slightly different estimates: 65% Persians (including Mazenderanis, Gilaks, and the Talysh), 16% Azerbaijanis, 7% Kurds, 6% Lurs, 2% Baloch, 1% Turkic tribal groups (incl. [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] and [[Turkmens]]), and non-Iranian, non-Turkic groups (incl. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians, and Arabs) less than 3%. It determined that Persian is the first language of at least 65% of the country's population, and is the second language for most of the remaining 35%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf#27 |title=Country Profile: Iran |publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=May 2008 |page=xxvi|access-date=9 June 2014}}</ref>

Despite Iran's official census claims that 99.5% of the country is Muslim, independent research claims only 32% of Iranians identified as [[Shia Muslim]]. Meanwhile, another 30% of Iranians claimed no religion or [[Atheism]] and 8% as Zoroastrian which is perceived as a result of Persian nationalism for Iran's pre-Islamic history.<ref name="theconversation.com"/><ref name="wionews.com"/>

There are a large population of adherents of [[Yarsanism]], a [[Kurds in Iran|Kurdish]] indigenous religion, making it the largest (unrecognized) minority religion in Iran. Its followers are mainly [[Guran (Kurdish tribe)|Gorani Kurds]] and certain groups of [[Lurs]]. They are based in [[Kurdistan Province]], [[Kermanshah Province]] and [[Lorestan]] mainly.

Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Sunni branch of Islam are officially recognized by the government, and have reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament.<ref name="Colin Brock p 99"/> Historically, early [[Iranian religions]] such as the Proto-Iranic religion and the subsequent [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Manichaeism]] were the dominant religions in Iran, particularly during the Median, Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras. This changed after the fall of the Sasanian Empire by the centuries-long [[Islamization of Iran|Islamization]] that followed the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Conquest of Iran]]. Iran was predominantly Sunni until the conversion of the country (as well as the people of what is today the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan) to [[Shia]] Islam by the order of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century.<ref name="Abdullah2014"/>

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of Iran}}
The earliest attested cultures in Iran date back to the Lower Paleolithic. Owing to its geopolitical position, Iran has influenced cultures as far as Greece and Italy to the west, Russia to the north, the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the south, and [[South Asia|south]] and [[east Asia]] to the east.

Iran's oldest [[literature|literary tradition]] is that of [[Avestan]], the [[Old Iranian]] [[sacred language]] of the [[Avesta]], which consists of the legendary and religious texts of [[Zoroastrianism]] and the [[ancient Iranian religion]], with its earliest records dating back to the pre-Achaemenid times.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Indo-Iranian Journal |title=A Glossary of Terms for Weapons and Armor in Old Iranian|first=W.W. |last=Malandra |volume=15 |issue=4|pages=264–289|year=1973 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Brill |jstor=24651454|doi=10.1007/BF00161055|s2cid=162194727}}</ref>

{{Main|Ancient philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Iranian philosophy}}
[[File:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zoroaster]], the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], depicted on [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]

Iranian philosophy originates from [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] roots, with [[Zoroaster]]'s reforms having major influences.

According to ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through Judaism, and therefore on [[Middle Platonism]]."

While there are [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|ancient relations]] between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences, especially in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view of man's role in the universe.

The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], which is known as "the first charter of [[human rights]]", is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by Zoroaster, and developed in Zoroastrian schools of the Achaemenid era.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Kreyenbroek, Philip G. |title=Morals and Society in Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy |encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy |first1=Brian |last1=Carr |first2=Indira |last2=Mahalingam |publisher=Routledge |year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Boyce, Mary |title=The Origins of Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy |encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy |first1=Brian |last1=Carr |first2=Indira |last2=Mahalingam |publisher=Routledge |year=2009}}</ref> The earliest tenets of Zoroastrian schools are part of the extant scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion in [[Avestan]]. Among them are treatises such as the Zatspram, [[Shikand-gumanig Vizar|Shkand-gumanik Vizar]], and [[Denkard]], as well as older passages of the Avesta and the [[Gathas]].<ref>{{cite book |title=An Anthology of Philosophy in Persia |volume=From Zoroaster to Omar Khayyam |first1=S.H. |last1=Nasr |first2=M. |last2=Aminrazavi |publisher=I.B. Tauris |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84511-541-8}}.</ref>

The current trends in Iranian philosophy have grown limited in scope because of Islamic frames of thought <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ayatollahy|first=Hamidreza|title=Philosophy in Contemporary Iran|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40419494|journal=Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia|year=2006|volume=62|issue=2/4|pages=811–816|jstor=40419494}}</ref> although the liberal ways of thought remain open to be generated in Iranian publications by Iranian intellectuals, especially outside Iran, where the Iranian regime has less power to restrict Iranian thought and philosophy.

===Mythology===

{{Main|Persian mythology|Iranian folklore}}
[[File:Arash statue in Sa'dābād palace.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Arash|Arash the Archer]] at the [[Sa'dabad Complex]] in Tehran]]

[[Persian mythology|Iranian mythology]] consists of ancient [[Iranian folklore]] and stories, all involving extraordinary beings, reflecting attitudes towards the confrontation of [[good and evil]], actions of the gods, and the exploits of heroes and fabulous creatures.

Myths play a crucial part in Iranian culture, and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the context of actual events in Iranian history. The geography of Greater Iran, a vast area covering present-day Iran, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Central Asia, with its high mountain ranges, plays the main role in much of Iranian mythology.

Tenth-century Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]]'s long [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Shahnameh|Šāhnāme]]'' ("Book of Kings"), which is for the most part based on ''Xwadāynāmag'', a [[Middle Persian]] compilation of the history of Iranian kings and heroes from mythical times down to the reign of [[Khosrow II|Chosroes II]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdowsi#ref69128 |title=Ferdowsī |author=Boyle, John Andrew |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=18 July 2017}}</ref> is considered the [[national epic]] of Iran. It draws heavily on the stories and characters of the Zoroastrian tradition, from the texts of the [[Avesta]], the [[Denkard]], and the [[Bundahishn]].

===Music===

{{Main|Music of Iran}}

Iran is the apparent birthplace of the earliest complex instruments, dating back to the third millennium BC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/music-history-i-pre-islamic-iran |title=Music History |trans-title=i. Third Millennium B.C.E. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica}}</ref> The use of both vertical and horizontal angular [[harp]]s have been documented at the sites Madaktu and [[Kul-e Farah]], with the largest collection of [[Elam]]ite instruments documented at Kul-e Farah. Multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC.
[[File:Karna-Persian-Instrument-Persepolis-Museum.JPG|thumb|[[Zurna|Karna]], an ancient Iranian musical instrument from the 6th century BC, kept at the Persepolis Museum]]
[[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' mentions a great number of singing women at the court of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. [[Athenaeus]] of [[Naucratis]], in his ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', points out to the capture of Achaemenid singing girls at the court of the last Achaemenid king [[Darius III]] (336–330 BC) by [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] general [[Parmenion]]. Under the [[Parthian Empire]], the ''[[Gusans|gōsān]]'' ([[Parthian language|Parthian]] for "minstrel") had a prominent role in the society.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gosan |title=GŌSĀN |volume=Xi |pages=167–170 |access-date=15 July 2017}}</ref> According to [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Crassus'' (32.3), they praised their national heroes and ridiculed their Roman rivals. Likewise, [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' reports that the Parthian youth were taught songs about "the deeds both of the gods and of the noblest men".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMtfAAAAMAAJ |title=Geography |volume=7 |author=Strabo |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1983 |location=London |page=179|isbn=978-0-674-99266-5 |author-link=Strabo }}</ref>

The history of [[Sasanian music]] is better documented than the earlier periods, and is especially more evident in Avestan texts.<ref name=EI-mhphi>{{harv|Lawergren|2009}} iv. First millennium C.E. (1) Sasanian music, 224–651.</ref> By the time of [[Khosrow II|Chosroes II]], the Sasanian royal court hosted a number of prominent musicians, namely Azad, [[Bamshad]], [[Barbad]], [[Nagisa (harpist)|Nagisa]], Ramtin, and [[Sarkash]].

Iranian traditional musical instruments include string instruments such as [[chang (instrument)|chang]] ([[harp]]), [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]], [[santur]], [[rud]] ([[oud]], [[barbat (lute)|barbat]]), [[tar (string instrument)|tar]], [[dutar|dotar]], [[setar]], [[tanbur]], and [[kamancheh|kamanche]], wind instruments such as [[sorna]] ([[zurna]], [[karnay|karna]]) and [[ney]], and percussion instruments such as [[tonbak|tompak]], [[kus]], [[daf]] ([[dayereh|dayere]]), and [[naqareh|naqare]].

Iran's first symphony orchestra, the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], was founded by Qolam-Hoseyn Minbashian in 1933. It was reformed by [[Parviz Mahmoud]] in 1946, and is currently Iran's oldest and largest symphony orchestra. Later, by the late 1940s, [[Ruhollah Khaleqi]] founded the country's first national music society, and established the School of National Music in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2006/11/061113_pm-mk-khaleghi.shtml|title=BBCPersian.com|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref>

===Theater===

{{Main|Persian theater|Persian dance}}
[[File:RudakiHall.jpg|thumb|The [[Roudaki Hall]], constructed between 1957 and 1967 in [[Tehran]]]]

The earliest recorded representations of dancing figures within Iran were found in prehistoric sites such as Tepe Sialk and Tepe Mūsīān.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dance-raqs |title=Dance |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref> The oldest Iranian initiation of theater and the phenomena of acting can be traced in the ancient epic ceremonial theaters such as ''Sug-e Siāvuš'' ("mourning of [[Siyâvash|Siāvaš]]"), as well as dances and theater narrations of Iranian mythological tales reported by [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]].

Iran's traditional theatrical genres include Baqqāl-bāzi ("grocer play", a form of slapstick comedy), Ruhowzi (or ''Taxt-howzi'', comedy performed over a courtyard pool covered with boards), Siāh-bāzi (in which the central comedian appears in blackface), Sāye-bāzi ([[shadow play]]), Xeyme-šab-bāzi ([[marionette]]), and Arusak-bāzi ([[puppetry]]), and [[Ta'zieh|Ta'zie]] (religious tragedy plays).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/drama |title=DRAMA |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|access-date=20 July 2017 |volume=VII |pages=529–535}}</ref>

Before the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become a famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes,<ref>{{cite book |author=Kiann, Nima |date=2015 |title=The History of Ballet in Iran |location=Wiesbaden |publisher=Reichert Publishing}}</ref> with the [[Roudaki Hall]] of Tehran constructed to function as the national stage for [[opera]] and [[ballet]]. Opened on 26 October 1967, the hall is home to the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]], and was officially renamed ''Vahdat Hall'' after the 1979 Revolution.

[[Loris Tjeknavorian]]'s ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]'', based on the tragedy of ''[[Rostam and Sohrab]]'' from [[Ferdowsi]]'s epic poem ''[[Shahnameh|Šāhnāme]]'', is an example of opera with Persian [[libretto]]. Tjeknavorian, a celebrated [[Iranian Armenians|Iranian Armenian]] composer and conductor, composed it in 25 years, and it was finally performed for the first time at Tehran's Roudaki Hall, with [[Darya Dadvar]] in the role of [[Tahmina]].

By the early 20th century, the five-year-old industry of cinema came to Iran. The first Iranian filmmaker was probably [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi|Mirza Ebrahim (Akkas Bashi)]], the court photographer of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar-ed-Din Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]]. Mirza Ebrahim obtained a camera and filmed the Qajar ruler's visit to Europe. Later in 1904, [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi|Mirza Ebrahim (Sahhaf Bashi)]], a businessman, opened the first public movie theater in Tehran.<ref name="massoudmehrabi1">{{cite web|url=http://www.massoudmehrabi.com/articles.asp?id=1414606616|title=Massoud Mehrabi – Articles|work=massoudmehrabi.com|access-date=26 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623113213/http://www.massoudmehrabi.com/articles.asp?id=1414606616|archive-date=23 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> After him, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were around 15 cinema theaters in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.<ref name="horschamp1"/> The first Iranian feature film, ''[[Abi and Rabi]]'', was a silent comedy directed by [[Ovanes Ohanian]] in 1930. The first sounded one, ''[[Lor Girl]]'', was produced by [[Ardeshir Irani]] and [[Abdolhossein Sepanta|Abd-ol-Hosein Sepanta]] in 1932.

Due to its variety of ethnic groups and the influences from the neighboring cultures, the cuisine of Iran is diverse. Herbs are frequently used, along with fruits such as plums, pomegranate, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavorings such as saffron, dried lime, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onion and garlic are commonly used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form.

Iranian cuisine includes a wide range of main dishes, including various types of [[kebab]], [[pilaf]], [[stew]] ([[khoresh]]), [[soup]] and [[āsh]], and [[omelette]].

=== Fashion and clothing ===
{{Main|Fashion in Iran}}
[[Fashion in Iran]] is divided into several historical periods. The exact date of the emergence of [[weaving]] in Iran is not yet known, but it is likely to coincide with the emergence of [[civilization]]. Clothing in Iran is mentioned in [[Persian mythology]]. [[Ferdowsi]] and many historians have considered [[Keyumars]] to be the inventor of the use of [[Animal skin|animals' skin]] and hair as clothing. Some historians have also mentioned [[Hushang]] as the first inventor of the use of living skins as clothing.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=پوشاک در ایران باستان، فریدون پوربهمن/ت: هاجر ضیاء سیکارودی، امیرکبیر|year=2007|pages=24, 25, 57}}</ref> Ferdowsi considers [[Tahmuras]] to be a kind of [[textile]] initiator in Iran. There are historical discoveries in northern Iran from about 6,000 BC that refer to [[wool]] weaving at the time. Other discoveries in central Iran dating back to 4200 BC have shown that the animals' skin has not been the only clothing worn on the [[Iranian Plateau]] since those years. The clothing of ancient Iran took an advanced form, and the fabric and color of clothing became very important at that time. Depending on the social status, eminence, climate of the region and the season, [[Persian clothing]] during the Achaemenian period took various forms. The philosophy used in this clothing, in addition to being functional, also had an aesthetic role.<ref name=":02" />

[[Beauty pageant]] festivals inside Iran were not held after the [[1979 revolution]], and the last selection ceremony of the "beauty queen of Iran" was held in 1978 in this country. Since then, a high number of Iranian girls participated in the Beauty pageant and Miss Universe outside of Iran. [[Sahar Biniaz]] ([[Miss Universe Canada 2012]]) and [[Shermine Shahrivar|Shermineh Shahrivar]] ([[Miss Germany]] and [[Miss Europe]]) are examples of Iranian models outside Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|title=مسابقه ملکه زیبایی ایران در کانادا|url=https://www.radiofarda.com/a/f12-iranian-beauty-contest-hel-in-canda/25388427.html|access-date=2020-06-19|website=رادیو فردا|language=fa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|title=ملکه زیبایی ایرانی‌تبار در شو تلویزیونی "آلمان می‌رقصد" {{!}} DW {{!}} 08.11.2016|url=https://www.dw.com/fa-ir/%D9%85%D9%84%DA%A9%D9%87-%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A8%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D9%88-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B2%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%AF/g-36311497|access-date=2020-06-19|website=DW.COM|language=fa-IR}}</ref> [[Girls of Enghelab Street]] was a series of protests in 2017–2019 against a [[Hijab by country#Iran|compulsory hijab]] in Iran.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iran hijab protester freed from jail: lawyer |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190528-iran-hijab-protester-freed-jail-lawyer |work=France 24 |date=28 May 2019}}</ref>
