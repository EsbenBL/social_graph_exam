{{Arab–Israeli conflict (topics)}}

The '''Arab–Israeli conflict''' involves political tension, military conflicts, and other disputes between [[Arab League|Arab countries]] and [[Israel]], which escalated during the 20th century, but had mostly faded out by the early 21st century. The roots of the Arab–Israeli conflict have been attributed to the support by [[Arab League]] member countries for the [[Palestinians]], a fellow League member, in the ongoing [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], which in turn has been attributed to the simultaneous rise of [[Zionism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] towards the end of the 19th century, though the two national movements had not clashed until the 1920s.

Part of the Palestine–Israel conflict arose from the conflicting claims by these movements to the land that formed the British [[Mandatory Palestine]], which was regarded by the [[Jewish people]] as their [[Homeland for the Jewish people|ancestral homeland]], while at the same time it was regarded by the [[Pan-Arab]] movement as historically and currently belonging to the [[Arab]] [[Palestinians]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/The+Palestinian+National+Charter.htm |title=The Palestinian National Charter – Article 6 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref> and in the [[Pan-Islamic]] context, as [[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|Muslim lands]]. The [[Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|sectarian conflict]] within the British Mandate territory between Palestinian Jews and Arabs escalated into a full-scale [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|Palestinian civil war in 1947]]. Taking the side of the Palestinian Arabs, especially following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]], the neighbouring Arab countries invaded the by-then former Mandate territory in May 1948, commencing the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|First Arab–Israeli War]]. Large-scale hostilities mostly ended with ceasefire agreements after the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Peace agreements]] were signed between Israel and Egypt in 1979, resulting in Israeli withdrawal [[Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula|from the Sinai Peninsula]] and the abolition of the [[Israeli Military Governorate|military governance system]] in the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], in favor of [[Israeli Civil Administration]] and consequent unilateral annexation of the [[Golan Heights]] and East Jerusalem.

The nature of the conflict has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which peaked during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] when Israel intervened in the Lebanese Civil War to oust the Palestinian Liberation Organization from Lebanon. By 1983, Israel reached [[17 May Agreement|normalization]] with Christian-dominated Lebanese government, but the agreement was annulled the next year with [[6 February Intifada|Muslim and Druze militias' takeover of Beirut]]. With the decline of the 1987–1993 [[First Palestinian Intifada]], the interim [[Oslo Accords]] led to the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in 1994, within the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. The same year, Israel and [[Jordan]] reached a peace accord. In 2002, the Arab League offered recognition of Israel by Arab countries as part of the resolution of the Palestine–Israel conflict in the [[Arab Peace Initiative]].<ref name=Time>{{Cite web|url=http://mideast.blogs.time.com/2009/01/08/time-to-test-the-arab-peace-offer/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117001303/http://mideast.blogs.time.com/2009/01/08/time-to-test-the-arab-peace-offer/|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 January 2009|title= Time to Test the Arab Peace Offer|author=Scott MacLeod|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=8 January 2009}}</ref> The initiative, which has been reconfirmed since, calls for normalizing relations between the [[Arab League]] and Israel, in exchange for a full withdrawal by Israel from the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] (including [[East Jerusalem]]) and a "just settlement" of the [[Palestinian refugee]] problem based on [[UN Resolution 194]]. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a cease-fire had been largely maintained between Israel and [[Baathist]] [[Syria]], as well as with [[Lebanon]]. Despite the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, the interim peace accords with the Palestinian Authority and the generally existing cease-fire, until the mid-2010s the Arab League and Israel had remained at odds with each other over many issues. Among Arab belligerents in the conflict, [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] are the only states who have reached no formal peace accord or treaty with Israel, both however turning to support [[Iran]].

Developments in the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]] reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the Syrian Arab Republic, [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Syrian opposition]] at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel, upon the emerging warfare with [[Iran]]. The conflict between Israel and [[Hamas]]-ruled Gaza, is also attributed to the [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict]] in the region. By 2017, Israel and several Arab [[Sunni]] states led by [[Saudi Arabia]] formed a [[Israeli–Sunni Coalition|semi-official coalition]] to confront Iran. This move and the [[Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement|Israeli normalization with Gulf States]] was marked by some as the fading of the Arab–Israeli conflict.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/09/19/the-arab-israeli-conflict-is-fading|title = The Arab-Israeli conflict is fading|newspaper = The Economist|date = 19 September 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
===Religious aspects of the conflict===
The Arab–Israeli conflict has a religious aspect. The beliefs of the various sides and their ideas and views of the [[chosen people]] in their policies with regard to the "[[Promised Land]]" and the "Chosen City" of [[Jerusalem]].<ref>Avi Beker, The Chosen: The History of an Idea and the Anatomy of an Obsession, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008</ref>

The Land of [[Canaan]] or ''Eretz Yisrael'' ([[Land of Israel]]) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, [[Promised Land|promised]] by God to the [[Children of Israel]]. This is also mentioned in the Qur'an.<ref>Sura 17, "The Night Journey", verse 104</ref> In his 1896 manifesto, ''The Jewish State'', [[Theodor Herzl]] repeatedly refers to the Biblical [[Promised Land]] concept.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/6640/zion/judenstaadt.html The State of the Jews], Theodor Hertzl, 1896, Translated from the German by Sylvie D'Avigdor, published in 1946 by the American Zionist Emergency Council. The original German title, "Der Judenstaat", literally means "The Jews' State". {{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/6640/zion/judenstaadt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 May 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224031940/http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/6640/zion/judenstaadt.html |archive-date=24 December 2007 }} 25 October 2009.</ref> [[Likud]] is currently the most prominent Israeli political party to include the Biblical claim to the [[Land of Israel]] in its platform.<ref>{{cite web| title=Likud – Platform| publisher=Knesset.gov.il| url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm| access-date =4 September 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006145128/https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm| archive-date=6 October 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>

Muslims also claim rights to that land in accordance with the [[Quran]].<ref name=JQ>'Jerusalem in the Qur'an', Masjid Dar al-Qur'an, Long Island, New York. 2002</ref> Contrary to the Jewish claim that this land was promised only to the descendants of [[Abraham]]'s grandson [[Jacob]] (''Yisrael''),<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews]] [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Vol II : Esau's Campaign Against Jacob]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</ref> they argue that the Land of Canaan was promised to what they consider the elder son of Abraham, [[Ishmael]], from whom [[Arabs]] claim descent.<ref name=JQ/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224002549/http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/jubilee.htm|title=The Book of Jubilees|date=24 February 2009|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Additionally, Muslims also revere many sites also holy for Biblical Israelites, such as the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] and the [[Temple Mount]]. In the past 1,400 years, Muslims have constructed Islamic landmarks on these ancient Israelite sites, such as the [[Dome of the Rock]] and the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on the [[Temple Mount]], the holiest site in Judaism. This has brought the two groups into conflict over the rightful possession of [[Jerusalem]]. Muslim teaching is that [[Muhammad]] passed through Jerusalem on his first journey to heaven. [[Hamas]], which governs the [[Gaza Strip]], claims that all of the land of Palestine (the current Israeli and Palestinian territories) is an Islamic ''[[waqf]]'' that must be governed by Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Hamas Covenant 1988 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date=18 August 1988 |access-date=4 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] often support the State of Israel because of the ancestral right of the Jews to the Holy Land, as suggested, for instance, by [[Paul the Apostle|the apostle Paul]] in his letter to the [[:wikisource:Bible (World English)/Romans#Chapter 11|Romans, chapter 11]], in the [[Bible]]. Christian Zionism teaches that the return of Jews to Israel is a prerequisite for the [[Second Coming of Christ]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gracethrufaith.com/ikvot-hamashiach/seven-major-prophetic-signs-of-the-second-coming |title=Seven Major Prophetic Signs Of The Second Coming |publisher=Gracethrufaith.com |date=31 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jcpa.org/article/sarah-schmidt-on-on-the-road-to-armageddon-how-evangelicals-became-israel’s-best-friend/|title=Sarah Schmidt on On the Road to Armageddon: How Evangelicals Became Israel’s Best Friend|website=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs}}</ref>

===National movements===
The roots of the modern Arab–Israeli conflict lie in the rise of [[Zionism]] and the reactionary [[Arab nationalism]] that arose in response to [[Zionism]] towards the end of the 19th century. Territory regarded by the [[Jewish people]] as their [[Homeland for the Jewish people|historical homeland]] is also regarded by the [[Pan-Arab]] movement as historically and presently belonging to the [[Palestinians|Palestinian Arabs]]. Before World War I, the Middle East, including Palestine (later [[Mandatory Palestine]]), had been under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for nearly 400 years. During the closing years of their empire, the Ottomans began to espouse their Turkish ethnic identity, asserting the primacy of Turks within the empire, leading to discrimination against the Arabs.<ref>Fraser, T.G. ''The Middle East: 1914–1979''. St. Martin's Press, New York. (1980) Pg. 2</ref> The promise of liberation from the Ottomans led many Jews and Arabs to support the allied powers during World War I, leading to the emergence of widespread Arab nationalism. Both Arab nationalism and Zionism had their formulative beginning in Europe. The Zionist Congress was established in Basel in 1897, while the "Arab Club" was established in Paris in 1906.

In the late 19th century European and Middle Eastern Jewish communities began to increasingly immigrate to Palestine and purchase land from the local Ottoman landlords. The population of the late 19th century in Palestine reached 600,000 – mostly Muslim Arabs, but also significant minorities of Jews, Christians, Druze and some [[Samaritans]] and [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼís]]. At that time, Jerusalem did not extend beyond the walled area and had a population of only a few tens of thousands. Collective farms, known as [[kibbutz]]im, were established, as was the first entirely Jewish city in modern times, [[Tel Aviv]].

During 1915–16, as World War I was underway, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, secretly corresponded with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husayn ibn 'Ali]], the patriarch of the Hashemite family and Ottoman governor of Mecca and Medina. McMahon convinced Husayn to lead an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, which was aligned with Germany against Britain and France in the war. McMahon promised that if the Arabs supported Britain in the war, the British government would support the establishment of an independent Arab state under Hashemite rule in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine. The Arab revolt, led by [[T. E. Lawrence]] ("Lawrence of Arabia") and Husayn's son Faysal, was successful in defeating the Ottomans, and Britain took control over much of this area.

===Sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine===
{{main|Sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine}}

====First mandate years and the Franco-Syrian war====
In 1917, Palestine was conquered by the British forces (including the [[Jewish Legion]]). The British government issued the [[Balfour Declaration]], which stated that the government viewed favorably "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people" but "that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine". The Declaration was issued as a result of the belief of key members of the government, including Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], that Jewish support was essential to winning the war; however, the declaration caused great disquiet in the Arab world.<ref>Segev, Tom (2000): ''One Palestine, Complete'', pp. 48–49, Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-11286-X}}.</ref> After the war, the area came under British rule as the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. The area mandated to the British in 1923 included what is today Israel, the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. Transjordan eventually was carved into a separate British protectorate – the Emirate of Transjordan, which gained an autonomous status in 1928 and achieved complete independence in 1946 with the approval by the United Nations of the end of the British Mandate.

A major crisis among the Arab nationalists took place with the failed establishment of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920. With the disastrous outcome of the Franco-Syrian War, the self-proclaimed Hashemite kingdom with its capital in Damascus was defeated and the Hashemite ruler took refuge in Mandatory Iraq. The crisis saw the first confrontation of nationalist Arab and Jewish forces, taking place in the [[Battle of Tel Hai]] in March 1920, but more importantly the collapse of the pan-Arabist kingdom led to the establishment of the local Palestinian version of Arab nationalism, with the return of [[Amin al-Husseini]] from Damascus to Jerusalem in late 1920.

At this point in time [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] to Mandatory Palestine continued, while to some opinions a similar, but less documented, immigration also took place in the Arab sector, bringing workers from Syria and other neighbouring areas. Palestinian Arabs saw this rapid influx of Jewish immigrants as a threat to their homeland and their identity as a people. Moreover, Jewish policies of purchasing land and prohibiting the employment of Arabs in Jewish-owned industries and farms greatly angered the Palestinian Arab communities.<ref>Lesch, Ann M. and Tschirgi, Dan. ''Origins and Development of the Arab-Israeli Conflict''. Greenwood Press: West Port, Connecticut. (1998). Pg.47,51</ref>{{verify source|date=August 2012}} Demonstrations were held as early as 1920, protesting what the Arabs felt were unfair preferences for the Jewish immigrants set forth by the British mandate that governed Palestine at the time. This resentment led to outbreaks of violence later that year, as the al-Husseini incited [[1920 Palestine riots|riots]] broke out in Jerusalem. [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Churchill White Paper|1922 White Paper]] tried to reassure the Arab population, denying that the creation of a Jewish state was the intention of the Balfour Declaration.

====1929 events====
[[1929 Palestine riots|In 1929]], after a demonstration by [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]]'s political group [[Betar]] at the [[Western Wall]], riots started in Jerusalem and expanded throughout Mandatory Palestine; Arabs murdered 67 Jews in the city of [[Hebron]], in what became known as the [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron massacre]]. During the week of the 1929 riots, at least 116 Arabs and 133 Jews<ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', 9 August 2005, "A Time of Change; Israelis, Palestinians and the Disengagement"</ref> were killed and 339 wounded.<ref>NA 59/8/353/84/867n, 404 Wailing Wall/279 and 280, Archdale Diary and Palestinian Police records.</ref>

====1930s and 1940s====

By 1931, 17 percent of the population of Mandatory Palestine were Jews, an increase of six percent since 1922.<ref>Lesch, Ann M. and Tschirgi, Dan. ''Origins and Development of the Arab-Israeli Conflict''. Greenwood Press: West Port, Connecticut. (1998).

In the mid-1930s [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] arrived from Syria and established the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. He recruited and arranged military training for peasants, and by 1935 he had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to kill Jewish settlers in the area, as well as engaging in a campaign of vandalism of Jewish settler plantations.<ref name=segev>{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=1999 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onepalestinecomp00sege/page/360 360–362] |url=https://archive.org/details/onepalestinecomp00sege/page/360 }}</ref> By 1936, escalating tensions led to the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].<ref>Lesch, Ann M. and Tschirgi, Dan.

These restrictions remained in place until the end of the mandate, a period which coincided with the Nazi [[Holocaust]] and the flight of [[Jewish refugees]] from Europe. As a consequence, most Jewish entrants to Mandatory Palestine were considered illegal (see [[Aliyah Bet]]), causing further tensions in the region. Following several failed attempts to solve the problem diplomatically, the British asked the newly formed United Nations for help.

In the weeks prior to the end of the mandate the [[Haganah]] launched a number of [[List of battles and operations in the 1948 Palestine war|offensives]] in which they gained control over all the territory allocated by the UN to the Jewish State, creating a large number of refugees and capturing the towns of [[Tiberias]], [[Haifa]], [[Safad]], [[Beisan]] and, in effect, [[Jaffa]].

Early in 1948 the United Kingdom announced its firm intention to terminate its mandate in Palestine on 14 May.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Stefan Brooks |editor=Spencer C.

===1948 Arab–Israeli War===
{{Main|1948 Arab–Israeli War}}
On 14 May 1948, the day on which the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the [[Jewish People's Council]] gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum and approved a proclamation that declared [[Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|the establishment]] of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]], to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. The declaration was made by [[David Ben-Gurion]], the Executive Head of the [[World Zionist Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm |title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: 14 May 1948 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |access-date=19 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116103234/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%2BProcess/Guide%2Bto%2Bthe%2BPeace%2BProcess/Declaration%2Bof%2BEstablishment%2Bof%2BState%2Bof%2BIsrael.htm |archive-date=16 January 2013 }}</ref>

There were no mention of the borders of the new state other than that it was in Eretz Israel. An official [[:s:Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations|cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States]] to the UN Secretary-General on 15 May 1948 stated publicly that Arab Governments found "themselves compelled to intervene for the sole purpose of restoring peace and security and establishing law and order in Palestine" (Clause 10(e)). Further in Clause 10(e): "The Governments of the Arab States hereby confirm at this stage the view that had been repeatedly declared by them on previous occasions, such as the London Conference and before the United Nations mainly, the only fair and just solution to the problem of Palestine is the creation of United State of Palestine based upon the democratic principles ..."

That day, the armies of [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], Lebanon, [[Syrian Republic (1946–63)|Syria]], Jordan and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] invaded what had just ceased to be the British Mandate, marking the beginning of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The nascent [[Israeli Defense Force]] repulsed the Arab nations from part of the occupied territories, thus extending its borders beyond the original UNSCOP partition.<ref>Smith, Charles D. ''Palestine and the Arab Israeli Conflict: A History With Documents''. Bedford/St. Martin's: Boston. (2004). Pg. 198</ref> By December 1948, Israel controlled most of the portion of Mandate Palestine west of the [[Jordan River]].

The status of Jewish citizens in Arab states worsened during the 1948 Israeli-Arab war. Anti-Jewish riots erupted throughout the Arab World in December 1947, and Jewish communities were hit particularly hard in [[1947 Aleppo pogrom|Aleppo]] and British-controlled [[1947 Aden riots|Aden]], with hundreds of dead and injured.

As a result of Israel's victory in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], any Arabs caught on the wrong side of the ceasefire line were unable to return to their homes in what became Israel.

In 1956, Egypt closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], in contravention of the [[Convention of Constantinople|Constantinople Convention of 1888]].

[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|right|thumb|Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David]]
Following the [[Camp David Accords]] of the late 1970s, Israel and Egypt signed a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] in March 1979. Under its terms, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] returned to Egyptian hands, and the Gaza Strip remained under Israeli control, to be included in a future [[Palestinian state]]. The agreement also provided for the free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal and recognition of the [[Straits of Tiran]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] as international waterways.

====Jordan====
{{Further|Israel–Jordan relations}}
In October 1994, Israel and Jordan signed a [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|peace agreement]], which stipulated mutual cooperation, an end of hostilities, the fixing of the Israel-Jordan border, and a resolution of other issues. The conflict between them had cost roughly 18.3 billion dollars. Its signing is also closely linked with the efforts to create peace between Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) representing the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA). It was signed at the southern border crossing of Arabah on 26 October 1994 and made Jordan only the second Arab country (after Egypt) to sign a peace accord with Israel.

====Iraq====
{{Further|Iraq–Israel relations}}
Israel and Iraq have been implacable foes since 1948. Iraq sent its troops to participate in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and later backed Egypt and Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

In June 1981, Israel attacked and destroyed newly built Iraqi nuclear facilities in [[Operation Opera]].

During the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Iraq fired 39 [[Scud]] missiles into Israel, in the hopes of uniting the Arab world against the coalition which sought to liberate [[Kuwait]]. At the behest of the United States, Israel did not respond to this attack in order to prevent a greater outbreak of war.

''Lion of Jordan; The life of King Hussein in War in Peace'', 2007, pg. 301.</ref> The violence resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, the vast majority Palestinians.<ref>Massad, Joseph Andoni. "Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan", pg. 342.</ref> Armed conflict lasted until July 1971 with the expulsion of the PLO and thousands of Palestinian fighters to Lebanon.

The PLO resettled in Lebanon, where it began to extend a de facto autonomous rule and from which it staged raids into Israel. PLO was one of the major factors for sectarian destabilization of Lebanon and the eruption of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975. In 1978, Israel launched [[Operation Litani]], in which it together with the [[Free Lebanon Army]] forced the PLO to retreat north of the Litani river. In 1981 another conflict between Israel and the PLO broke out, which ended with a ceasefire agreement that did not solve the core of the conflict. In June 1982, [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] in alliance with Christian factions of the Lebanese government. Within two months the PLO agreed to withdraw thence.

In March 1983, Israel and Lebanon signed a [[17 May Agreement|normalization agreement]]. However, Syria pressured President [[Amine Gemayel]] into nullifying the truce in March 1984, following . By 1985, Israeli forces withdrew to a 15&nbsp;km wide southern strip of Lebanon, following which the conflict continued on a lower scale, with relatively low casualties on both sides. In 1993 and 1996, Israel launched major operations against the Shiite militia of [[Hezbollah]], which had become an emergent threat. In May 2000, the newly elected government of [[Ehud Barak]] authorized a withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, fulfilling an election promise to do so well ahead of a declared deadline. The hasty withdrawal lead to the immediate collapse of the [[South Lebanon Army]], and many members either got arrested or fled to Israel.

====Palestinians====
{{Further|Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
The 1970s were marked by a large number of major, international terrorist attacks, including the [[Lod Airport massacre]] and the [[Munich massacre|Munich Olympics Massacre]] in 1972, and the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe Hostage Taking]] in 1976, with over 100 Jewish hostages of different nationalities kidnapped and held in Uganda.

In December 1987, the [[First Intifada]] began. The First Intifada was a mass Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the [[Palestinian territories]].<ref>"Uprising by Palestinians against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip territories", Intifada, Microsoft Encarta.</ref> The rebellion began in the Jabalia refugee camp and quickly spread throughout Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinian actions ranged from civil disobedience to violence. In addition to general strikes, boycotts on Israeli products, graffiti and barricades, Palestinian demonstrations that included stone-throwing by youths against the Israel Defense Forces brought the Intifada international attention. The Israeli army's heavy handed response to the demonstrations, with live ammunition, beatings and mass arrests, brought international condemnation. The PLO, which until then had never been recognised as the leaders of the Palestinian people by Israel, was invited to peace negotiations the following year, after it recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.

[[File:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|thumb|[[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Yasser Arafat]] at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony on 13 September 1993]]

In mid-1993, Israeli and Palestinian representatives engaged in peace talks in Oslo, Norway. As a result, in September 1993, Israel and the PLO signed the [[Oslo Accords]], known as the ''Declaration of Principles'' or Oslo I. In [[Israel–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|side letters]], Israel recognized the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, while the PLO recognized the right of the state of Israel to exist and renounced terrorism, violence and its desire for the destruction of Israel.

The Oslo II agreement was signed in 1995 and detailed the division of the West Bank into [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Areas A, B, and C]]. Area A was land under full Palestinian civilian control, and Palestinians were also responsible for internal security. The Oslo agreements remain important documents in Israeli-Palestinian relations.

===2000–2005===
The [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] forced Israel to rethink its relationship and policies towards the Palestinians. Following a [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|series of suicide bombings]] and attacks, the Israeli army launched [[Operation Defensive Shield]] in March 2002. It was the largest military operation conducted by Israel since the Six-Day War.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Yedioth Aharonoth Books and Chemed Books and it had a very big conflict|isbn =978-965-511-767-7|last=Harel|first=Amos|author2=Avi Isacharoff|title=The Seventh War|pages=274–275|location=Tel Aviv|year=2004}}</ref>

As violence between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants intensified, Israel expanded its security apparatus around the West Bank by re-taking many parts of land in Area A. Israel established a complicated system of roadblocks and [[Border checkpoint|checkpoints]] around major Palestinian areas to deter violence and protect Israeli settlements. However, since 2008, the IDF has slowly transferred authority to Palestinian security forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=172860 |title=PA security forces seize 17 bombs, transfer them to IDF |work=The Jerusalem Post }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=178633 |title=UN: Israel has dismantled 20 percent of West Bank checkpoint |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Yaakov |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=170599 |title=Israel sets up trial program to expedite PA export process |work=The Jerusalem Post }}</ref>

Israel's then prime minister [[Ariel Sharon]] began a policy of [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|disengagement]] from the [[Gaza Strip]] in 2003. This policy was fully implemented in August 2005.<ref name="Special Update: Disengagement – August 2005">"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern+History/Historic+Events/Disengagement+-+August+2005.htm Special Update: Disengagement – August 2005]", Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</ref> Sharon's announcement to disengage from Gaza came as a tremendous shock to his critics both on the left and on the right. A year previously, he had commented that the fate of the most far-flung settlements in Gaza, Netzararem and Kfar Darom, was regarded in the same light as that of Tel Aviv.<ref>Ma'ariv II December 2002</ref> The formal announcements to evacuate seventeen Gaza settlements and another four in the West Bank in February 2004 represented the first reversal for the settler movement since 1968, dividing Sharon's party. It was strongly supported by Trade and Industry Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] and [[Tzipi Livni]], the Minister for Immigration and Absorption, but Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Finance Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] strongly condemned it. It was also uncertain at the time whether this was simply the beginning of further evacuation.<ref>Shindler, Colin.

====Conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah====
In June 2006, [[Hamas]] militants infiltrated an army post near the Israeli side of the Gaza Strip and abducted Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]]. Two IDF soldiers were killed in the attack, while Shalit was wounded after his tank was hit with an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]].

====During Syrian Civil War====

Israel's military role in the [[Syrian Civil War]] has been limited to missile strikes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-official-confirms-attack-in-syria-first-strike-on-live-iranian-targets/|title=IDF official said to confirm attack in Syria: ‘First strike on Iranian targets’|first=T.

While the Israeli [[#Official standpoint|official position]] is neutrality in the conflict, Israel is opposed to Iran's presence in Syria. Israel has [[#Israeli humanitarian aid to Syrians|provided humanitarian aid]] to Syrian war victims, an effort that was drastically geared up since June 2016 when the ''[[Operation Good Neighbour]]'' was launched by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]]. There are many different national interests playing a role in the war. One of them is Iran, which Israel is concerned could gain too much regional influence. Iranian proxies such as [[Hezbollah]] are suspected of [[Iran–Israel relations#Iranian funding of Hamas and Hezbollah|carrying out attacks]] against Israeli positions on the borders to Syria and [[Lebanon]], and Israel is suspected of [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict|carrying out air strikes]] against convoys transporting weapons to such organisations.

On 9 December 2017, US president [[Donald Trump]] announced the [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel|United States recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], prompting [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel#International response|condemnation by other world leaders]] as well as the [[2018 Gaza border protests]].

==Cost of conflict==
{{See also|Arab League boycott of Israel}}
A report by the [[Strategic Foresight Group]] estimated the [[opportunity cost]] of conflict for the Middle East from 1991 to 2010 at $12 [[trillion]]. The report's opportunity cost calculates the peace [[GDP]] of countries in the Middle East by comparing the current GDP to the potential GDP in times of peace. Israel's share is almost $1 trillion, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia having approximately $2.2 and $4.5 trillion, respectively. For example, had there been peace and cooperation between Israel and Arab League nations since 1991, the average Israeli citizen would be earning over $44,000 instead of $23,000 in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf |title=''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East'', Strategic Foresight Group |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201053723/http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf |archive-date=1 February 2009 }}</ref>

In terms of the human cost, it is estimated that the conflict has taken 92,000 lives (74,000 military and 18,000 civilian from 1945 to 1995).<ref name="buzan">{{cite book| author=[[Barry Buzan]] | title=Regions and powers|title-link=Regions and Powers: The Structure of International Security | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2003 | isbn=978-0-521-89111-0}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2020}}
