{{short description|American psychologist}}
'''Eleanor M. Saffran''' (May 16, 1938 – November 23, 2002), an American neuroscientist, was a researcher in the field of [[Cognitive neuropsychology|Cognitive Neuropsychology]]. Her interest in [[Neuropsychology]] began at the Baltimore City hospitals of [[Johns Hopkins University]], where her research unit focused on neurological patients with language or [[cognitive impairment]]s. In papers published between 1976 and 1982, Dr. Saffran spelled out the methodological tenets of “cognitive neuropsychology” exemplified in her studies of [[aphasia]],<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410865_print Aphasia and the Relationship of Language and Brain, by Eleanor M. Saffran</ref> [[alexia (acquired dyslexia)]], [[auditory verbal agnosia]], and [[short-term memory]] impairment.

==Career==
In 1980, Saffran joined the Neurology Department of [[Temple University]] and established the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Here she built an interdisciplinary research group composed of [[neurologist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, and [[speech-language pathologist]]s. Under her leadership, this group extended the cognitive neuropsychological approach to the analysis of neurological disorders of [[perception]], visual attention, and [[semantics]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

These years also marked the continuation of her longstanding collaboration with Myrna Schwartz of [[MossRehab]] (part of the [[Einstein Healthcare Network]]) which began in Baltimore in 1975. An innovative aspect of their research was its emphasis on application of language theory{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} to diagnosis and treatment of [[language disorder]]s. This model was embraced by other researchers of language and remains a standard approach in aphasia research today{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. As the field of cognitive neuropsychology matured, Saffran became recognized as one of its most influential practitioners. In 1989, her grant on the [[psycholinguistic]] analysis of language disorders was awarded the Claude Pepper Award of Excellence by the [http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/ National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders].

In 1991, Saffran was appointed as professor in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080821152620/http://www.temple.edu/chp/departments/commsci/index.html Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders] at Temple University. She continued teaching her courses even after progression of a degenerative condition had weakened her speaking voice and use of her hands. Her contributions to research were recognized posthumously when she was awarded the Temple University Faculty Research Award for excellence in research in 2003.<ref>http://www.temple.edu/temple_times_archives/2003/4-10-03/saffran.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604150609/http://www.temple.edu/temple_times_archives/2003/4-10-03/saffran.html |date=2011-06-04 }} Eleanor Saffran Receives Posthumous Research Award</ref>

==Legacy==
Longtime colleague [[Nadine Martin]], associate professor of communication sciences and disorders at Temple University, started working with Saffran in 1982 and then completed her Ph.D. in [[Cognitive Psychology]] at Temple University in 1987. Today{{When|date=January 2016}} she continues Saffran's tradition of scholarship and mentorship as Director of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081207085327/http://www.temple.edu/chp/departments/commsci/documents/EMSInformationalBrochure_Final.pdf Eleanor M. Saffran Center for Cognitive Neuroscience].

Her daughter [[Jenny Saffran]] has also pursued a career in research in [[cognitive science]]. She leads the [http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/infantlearning/index.html Infant Learning Laboratory] at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].
