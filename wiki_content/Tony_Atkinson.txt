A student of [[James Meade]], Atkinson virtually single-handedly established the modern British field of [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and poverty studies. He worked on inequality and poverty for over four decades.<ref name="The_Economist_2015">{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21653596-anthony-atkinson-godfather-inequality-research-growing-problem-mind-gap?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/st/mindthegap |title=Mind the Gap: Anthony Atkinson, the godfather of inequality research, on a growing problem|date=6 June 2015|access-date=7 June 2015|journal=[[The Economist]]}}</ref><ref name="Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung obituary">{{cite news|last1=Armbruster|first1=Alexander|last2=Berger|first2=Gerald Brown|title=Der große Ungleichheitsforscher ist tot|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftswissen/tony-atkinson-der-grosse-ungleichheitsforscher-ist-tot-14601067.html|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref>

==Education and career==
Atkinson was born in [[Caerleon]], a town in southern Wales near the border with England. Atkinson grew up in north Kent and attended [[Cranbrook School, Kent#Notable alumni|Cranbrook School]].<ref name=Cranbrook>{{cite web|title=Cranbrook School – Alumni|url=http://www.oldcranbrookians.co.uk/?q=content/notable-alumni|publisher=Cranbrook School|access-date=13 April 2014}}</ref> 

After leaving school at the age of 17 he worked for [[IBM]]. After one year he left and moved to [[Hamburg]] to volunteer in a hospital in a deprived part of town.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Memoirs_17-11-Atkinson.pdf|title=Anthony Barnes Atkinson: 4 September 1944–1 January 2017|last=Brandolini, Jenkins, Micklewright}}</ref> He cited his interest in inequality as beginning from this period as a volunteering in a German hospital and from studying the work of [[Peter Townsend (sociologist)|Peter Townsend]].<ref name="FT Obituary" />

After studying mathematics for one year he changed to economics and graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1966 with a first-class degree. Subsequently, he spent time at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name="Der Spiegel obituary">{{cite news|title=Britischer Ökonom Atkinson ist tot|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/anthony-atkinson-ist-tot-a-1128249.html|newspaper=Spiegel Online|access-date=2 January 2017|date=2017-01-02}}</ref> At MIT he attended Robert Solow's seminal growth theory course and worked as a research assistant of Solow. After returning from MIT he considered writing a PhD thesis on [[development economics]], but eventually never did a PhD.<ref name=":0" />

From 1967 to 1971 he was a fellow at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], Cambridge. There he taught public economics together with [[Joseph Stiglitz]]. These lectures were later turned into the famous textbook “Lectures on Public Economics”.

In 1971, at the age of 27, he became full professor of economics at the [[University of Essex]]. In 1976 he became professor of political economy at [[University College London|University College]], London. 

During the 1980s he was Tooke Professor of Economic Science and Statistics in the Economics Department at the [[London School of Economics]]. At the LSE he co-directed for 12 years the research programme ‘Taxation, incentives and the distribution of income’. His co-directors were [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nick Stern]] and [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]].

He stayed there until 1992 when he returned to the [[University of Cambridge]] for two more years.

In the 1990s he was advisor to the French Prime Minister [[Lionel Jospin]].<ref name=":0" />

He served as Warden of [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], from 1994 to 2005.<ref name="whoswho">[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U5939 ATKINSON, Sir Anthony Barnes, (Sir Tony)], ''Who's Who 2015'', A & C Black, 2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> In 1971 he founded the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]''.<ref name="VoxEU author page">{{cite web|title=VoxEU author page|url=http://voxeu.org/users/tonyatkinson0|website=CEPR|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> He co-edited it for the next quarter century.

== Principles ==
Several authors have emphasized that some core principles motivate Atkinson's work.

Atkinson became first interested in economics because of his experiences in Hamburg of the 1960s, but also credited the book 'The Poor and the Poorest', by [[Brian Abel-Smith]] and [[Peter Townsend (sociologist)|Peter Townsend]], as having a large influence on his career goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/sir-anthony-atkinson-and-the-curious-optimism-of-the-godfather-of-inequality-10286080.html|title=Sir Anthony Atkinson and the curious optimism of the godfather of|date=2015-05-29|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> He was impressed by this account of poverty. At the same time he 'felt that it did not address what to do about the problem'.<ref name=":0" /> This motivated him to provide this missing piece and he published his answer in 'Poverty in Britain and the Reform of Social Security' in 1969.<ref name=":0" />

The same was true for the study of inequality. He mentored [[Thomas Piketty]] and collaborated with him repeatedly. But he felt that his analysis in [[Capital in the Twenty-First Century|Capital]] was a description of the problem, what was missing was the solution. This again motivated Atkinson 'to go further and show how inequality could actually be reduced in practice' and to write 'Inequality – what can be done?'.<ref name=":0" />

Several have remarked on Atkinson's optimism that progress is possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/sir-anthony-atkinson-and-the-curious-optimism-of-the-godfather-of-inequality-10286080.html|title=Sir Anthony Atkinson and the curious optimism of the godfather of|date=2015-05-29|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> 

Atkinson's colleague [[Max Roser]] wrote that 'one of [Atkinson's] convictions – apparent in all his writing – was that high levels of economic inequality are not inevitable. Even when the public discourse suggested that nothing could be done to counter the rise of inequality, Tony not only stood by his conviction, but wrote an entire book entitled ''Inequality – What can be done?'.''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roser|first=Max|title=Inequality is a choice|url=https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/media/3134/nuffield-magazine-18-web.pdf|journal=Nuffield College Magazine|volume=Issue 18. An edition in the memory of Tony Atkinson.}}</ref>

In turn, Atkinson also emphasized the optimism of his teacher [[James Meade]] writing, 'Above all, James had a positive vision for the future. He was, in his own words, ‘an inveterate explorer of improvements in economic arrangements’... he wrote that ‘I implore any of my fellow countrymen who read this book not to object: “It can’t be done.” He was ultimately concerned with what could be done to make our world a better place.'<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CStrOxiXL9sC&q=Above+all,+James+had+a+positive+vision+for+the+future.+He+was,+in+his+own+words,+%E2%80%98an+inveterate+explorer+of+improvements+in+economic+arrangements%E2%80%99%E2%80%A6+he+wrote+that+%E2%80%98I+implore+any+of+my+fellow+countrymen+who+read+this+book+not+to+object:+%E2%80%9CIt+can%E2%80%99t+be+done.%E2%80%9D+He+was+ultimately+concerned+with+what+could+be+done+to+make+our+world+a+better+place.&pg=PA499|title=1999 Lectures and Memoirs|last=Academy|first=British|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780197262306|language=en}}</ref> 

==Work==
Atkinson's work was predominantly on [[income distribution]]s. But he also worked on a wide field of other economic and social questions including [[Tax|taxation]], [[Distribution of wealth|wealth distribution]], the economics of the [[welfare state]], [[health economics]], and [[poverty]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tony-atkinson.com/selected-articles-by-topic/|title=Selected Articles by Topic – Tony Atkinson|website=www.tony-atkinson.com|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> In his long career he published over 350 research papers and authored 24 books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tony-atkinson.com/|title=Tony Atkinson – Personal Website of Sir Anthony B. Atkinson|website=www.tony-atkinson.com|access-date=2019-08-24}}</ref> Characteristic for much of his work is a combination of theoretical and applied perspectives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beatricecherrier.wordpress.com/2017/01/02/remembering-tony-atkinson-as-the-architect-of-modern-public-economics/|title=Remembering Tony Atkinson as the architect of modern public economics|last=Beatrice|date=2017-01-02|website=The Undercover Historian|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>
=== Inequality ===
His 1970 paper 'On the measurement of inequality'<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Anthony B|date=1970-09-01|title=On the measurement of inequality|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=2|issue=3|pages=244–263|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(70)90039-6|issn=0022-0531}}</ref> radically changed the way that economists think about the measurement of inequality. One contribution of this paper is that it introduced a new family of inequality measures that makes different views about distributional justice explicit through a parameter capturing the ‘inequality aversion’ of the measurer. This inequality measure–called the [[Atkinson index]]–is named after him.<ref>Atkinson, AB (1970) On the measurement of inequality. ''Journal of Economic Theory'', 2 (3), pp.&nbsp;244–263, {{doi|10.1016/0022-0531(70)90039-6}}</ref> 

Atkinson examined how the wealthy disproportionately influence public policy and influence governments to implement policies that protect wealth.<ref name="The_Economist_2015" /> He presented a set of policies regarding technology, employment, social security, the sharing of capital, and taxation that could shift the inequality in income distribution in developed countries.<ref name="HUP_2015">{{citation|title=Review of ''Inequality: What Can Be Done?''|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674504769|work=Harvard University Press|year=2015|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> He also advocated the introduction of a [[basic income]].<ref>Atkinson, Anthony B. (2011) [http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/atkinson/Basic_Income%20Luxembourg%20April%202011.pdf „Basic Income: Ethics, Statistics and Economics”], nuff.ox.ac.uk; accessed 13 May 2017.</ref>

He was one of the authors of the [[Chartbook of Economic Inequality]], a resource widely employed to study the history of inequality.

=== Global poverty ===
He had a long-standing interest in the measurement of poverty. One of his most cited research papers is ‘On the measurement of poverty' from 1987.

From 2013 to 2016 he chaired the World Bank's Commission on Global Poverty. The commission included [[Amartya Sen]], [[Ana Revenga]], [[François Bourguignon]], [[Stefan Dercon]] and [[Nora Lustig]] and had the objective to advise the international institutions on how to measure and monitor global poverty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/commission-on-global-poverty|title=Commission on Global Poverty|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> The commission is usually referred to as the Atkinson Commission.

Before his death he was working on a book on global poverty. Atkinson died before he was able to complete the book, but at his request it was edited for publication by two of his colleagues, [[John Micklewright]] and [[Andrea Brandolini]]. This book–'Measuring Poverty around the World'–was published posthumously in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tony-atkinson.com/book-measuring-poverty-around-the-world/|title=Book: 'Measuring Poverty around the World' – Tony Atkinson|website=www.tony-atkinson.com|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>

=== Public economics ===
Since the 1960s he was one of the leading scholars to develop the discipline of public economics.

In a joint article with [[Joseph Stiglitz]], he laid one of the cornerstones for the theory of [[Optimal tax|optimal taxation]].<ref>Atkinson, A. B., and J. E. Stiglitz (1976), The design of tax structure: Direct versus indirect taxation, Journal of Public Economics, 6 (1-2): 55-75, {{doi|10.1016/0047-2727(76)90041-4}}</ref>

Also jointly with Joseph Stiglitz he authored the seminal textbook “Lectures on Public Economics”. The book was reissued by Princeton University Press in 2015.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691166414/lectures-on-public-economics|title=Lectures on Public Economics|date=2015-05-26|isbn=9780691166414|language=en|last1=Atkinson|first1=Anthony B.|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph E.}}</ref> 

In his 2015 publication ''Inequality: What Can Be Done?'', he "called for robust taxation of the rich whom he reckons have got off easily over the last generation."<ref name="The_Economist_2015"/><ref name="Atkinson_Inequality_2015">{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=Anthony B.|title=Inequality: What Can Be Done?|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780674504769}}</ref><ref name="The 15 Proposals from Tony Atkinson’s ‘Inequality – What can be done?’">{{cite web|last1=Atkinson|first1=Tony|title=The 15 Proposals from Tony Atkinson's 'Inequality – What can be done?'|url=http://www.tony-atkinson.com/the-15-proposals-from-tony-atkinsons-inequality-what-can-be-done|website=Tony Atkinson (personal website)|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref>

He recommended government intervention in markets such as employment guarantees and wage controls to influence the redistribution of economic rewards.<ref name="The_Economist_2015"/> He traced the history of inequality, coining the phrase the "inequality turn" to describe the period when household inequality began to rise around 1980. From the 1980s onwards, men and women "tended to marry those who earned like themselves", with rich women marrying rich men. As more women joined the workforce inequality increased.<ref name="The_Economist_2015"/>
==Influences==
Atkinson, who worked on inequality and poverty for more than four decades, was a mentor to [[Thomas Piketty]] (author of ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]''); they worked together on building an historical database on top incomes.<ref name="The_Economist_2015"/> Piketty described him as "the godfather of historical studies of income and wealth."<ref name="Sir Anthony Atkinson and the curious optimism of the godfather of inequality">{{cite web|last1=Chu|first1=Ben|title=Sir Anthony Atkinson and the curious optimism of the godfather of inequality|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/sir-anthony-atkinson-and-the-curious-optimism-of-the-godfather-of-inequality-10286080.html|website=[[The Independent]]|access-date=2 January 2017|date=2015-05-29}}</ref>

Nobel laureate [[Angus Deaton]] recalled the first economics seminar he ever attended: "the first seminar I ever heard in economics, in Cambridge in 1969, was Tony presenting his famous paper on the measurement of inequality. It made me think that economics was a pretty cool subject, I thought all economics talks were like this, and it ruined me for a lifetime of seminars."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.res.org.uk/resources-page/october-2017-newsletter-letter-from-america-counting-our-losses.html|title=October 2017 newsletter - Letter from America - Counting our losses|website=www.res.org.uk|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>

He had a large influence on the next generation of researchers. Atkinson advised at least sixty PhD students and 'in addition there are many other younger scholars whom he influenced directly through his collaboration on joint research project'.<ref name=":0" />

==Membership and honours==
He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1984, a Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1974, Honorary Member of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1985 and Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1994.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=27 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, Atkinson received the [[Dan David Prize]] for 'combatting poverty'.<ref name=DDP>{{cite web|title=Professor Sir Tony Atkinson wins prestigious award for work on poverty|url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-Atkinson|publisher=[[Oxford Martin School]]|access-date=4 January 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life and death==
Atkinson was married to Judith Mandeville, whom he met at Cambridge as an undergrad. The couple had three children and eight grandchildren. 

He was a passionate sailor and walker.<ref name=":0" /> 

Atkinson died on 1 January 2017 from [[multiple myeloma]] in [[Oxford]], England, aged 72.<ref name="FT Obituary">{{cite web|last1=Giles|first1=Chris|last2=O'Connor|first2=Sarah|title=Sir Tony Atkinson, economist and campaigner, 1944-2017|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cbda844a-d0ea-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51|website=[[Financial Times]]|publisher=Nomura|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wort.lu/en/panorama/anthony-atkinson-the-economist-who-battled-against-inequality-has-died-586a518453590682caf17284|title=Anthony Atkinson: The economist who battled against inequality has died|date=2 January 2017|newspaper=Wort.lu|access-date=13 May 2017}}</ref>
