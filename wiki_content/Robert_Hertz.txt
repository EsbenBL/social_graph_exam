'''Robert Hertz''' (22 June 1881, [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]] – 13 April 1915, [[Marchéville]], [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]) was a French sociologist who was killed in active service during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Douglas J.|date=2000|title=CLASSICS REVISITED Robert Hertz: The social triumph over death|journal=Mortality|volume=5|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1080/713685991|s2cid=144023544|issn=1357-6275}}</ref>

Hertz was a student at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], from which he [[agrégation|aggregated]] in [[philosophy]] in 1904, finishing first in his class. After a brief period of study in [[England]] at the [[British Museum]] he returned to France, where he began doctoral work with [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]]. An important member of the [[Annee Sociologique]] team, his specialty was the [[sociology of religion]].

Hertz is most known for his early papers ''A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death'' (1907) and ''The Pre-Eminence of the Right Hand: a Study in Religious Polarity'' (1909);<ref name="HERTZ 2013 pp. 335–357">{{cite journal | last=HERTZ | first=Robert | title=The pre-eminence of the right hand | journal=HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory | publisher=University of Chicago Press | volume=3 | issue=2 | year=2013 | issn=2575-1433 | doi=10.14318/hau3.2.024 | pages=335–357}}</ref> both later translated into English ''as Death and the Right Hand'' by [[Rodney Needham|Rodney and Claudia Needham]] (in 1960).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The modern anthropology of South-East Asia : an introduction|last=King, Victor T.|date=2003|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=0415297516|pages=126|oclc=50252070}}</ref> Hertz's work influenced [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and many consider it to be a precursor to [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structuralism]]. The following quote from ''[[Death and the Right Hand]]'' often appears in anthropological articles even today, such as [[Richard Robbins (sociologist)|Richard Robbins]]'s ''[[The Cultural Construction of Social Hierarchy]]'' (1997):

<blockquote>Every social hierarchy claims to be founded on the nature of things. It thus accords itself eternity; it escapes change and the attacks of innovators. Aristotle justified slavery by the ethnic superiority of the Greeks over the barbarians; and today the man who is annoyed by feminist claims alleges that woman is ''naturally'' inferior</blockquote>Hertz's uncompleted doctoral dissertation was entitled ''Sin and Expiation in Primitive Societies''. Sections of it, along with his articles for the ''L'Année'' and his correspondence with his wife Alice (née Bauer), have been published. He also published an article (1913) on the festival of [[Saint Bessus|Saint Besse]], which some consider to be the first anthropological contribution to the study of [[Alps|the Alps]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Upland communities : environment, population and social structure in the Alps since the sixteenth century|last=Viazzo, Pier Paolo (1950- ).

Hertz was killed by German forces whilst leading his section against German forces at [[Marchéville-en-Woëvre|Marcheville]]. He was posthumously awarded the [[Legion of Honour|Croix de Chevalier (Légion d'honneur)]] for his part in the action.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The dark side of humanity : the work of Robert Hertz and its legacy|last=Parkin, Robert.|date=1996|publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers|isbn=3718658615|pages=13|oclc=35282735}}</ref>{{Authority control}}
