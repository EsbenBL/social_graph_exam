From 1972 to 1989, he was Lecturer, then Reader, at the Science Studies Unit, [[Edinburgh University]], and, from 1989 to 2003, Professor of Sociology at the University of California, San Diego, before taking up an appointment at the Department of the History of Science at [[Harvard]].

He has written broadly on the history and [[sociology of science]].

He is credited with restructuring the field's approach to “big issues” in science such as truth, trust, scientific identity, and moral authority.<ref name="Reuell"/>

{{quote|"The practice of science, both conceptually and instrumentally, is seen to be full of social assumptions. Crucial to their work is the idea that science is based on the public's faith in it. This is why it is important to keep explaining how sound knowledge is generated, how the process works, who takes part in the process and how."<ref name="Erasmianum"/>}}
