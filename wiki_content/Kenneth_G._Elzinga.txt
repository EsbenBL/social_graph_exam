'''Kenneth G. Elzinga''' is the Robert C. Taylor Professor of Economics at the [[University of Virginia]]. He is an [[antitrust]] expert and co-authored a highly successful quartet of murder mystery novels in which the sleuth, dubbed Henry Spearman, solves the murder using principles of economics. 

Elzinga's antitrust expertise led the U.S. Supreme Court to its 5-4 decision on June 28, 2007, in ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.]]'' that minimum retail pricing schemes, formerly treated automatically as illegal under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], may offer benefits to [[consumer]]s.

His novels are written under the [[pseudonym]] [[Marshall Jevons]], a mixture of economics pathfinders [[Alfred Marshall]] and [[William Stanley Jevons]] in collaboration with now-deceased [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] professor [[William L. Breit]] (1933-2011). The books are now assigned reading in many introductory college economics classes.

His scholarly work has appeared in the leading journals of economics, with the Florida State's Gus A.
