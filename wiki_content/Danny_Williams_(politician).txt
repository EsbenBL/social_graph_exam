After becoming Leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 2001, he was elected to the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] in a by-election for the [[Electoral district (Canada)|district]] of [[Humber West]] in [[Corner Brook]].<ref name="by-election">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.gov.nl.ca/elections/ElectionReports/PDF/By.Elections/01.humber.west.port.de.grave.june.19.pdf|title=Humber West by-election|publisher=Elections Newfoundland and Labrador|access-date=February 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227002455/http://www.elections.gov.nl.ca/elections/ElectionReports/PDF/By.Elections/01.humber.west.port.de.grave.june.19.pdf|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Williams' premiership was considered controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Early life and education==
Daniel E. Williams was born in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada, the eldest of four children to Thomas Williams and Teresita (Galway).<ref name="bio">{{Cite news |title=A biography of premier-designate Danny Williams |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/CTVNewsAt11/20031021/nfld_elxn_danny_williams_bio_031021/ |work=CTV News |date=October 21, 2003 |access-date=January 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203025913/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/CTVNewsAt11/20031021/nfld_elxn_danny_williams_bio_031021 |archive-date=December 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He received his early education from [[Saint Bonaventure's College]] and then [[Gonzaga High School]].

Williams went on to study at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], where he received a degree in [[political science]] and economics.<ref name="Williams' Bio"/> In 1969, he was awarded the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and went to [[Keble College, Oxford]], United Kingdom<ref name="bio"/> to read Arts in Law.

==Professional and business career==
''All currency is in [[Canadian dollar]]s.''

While still in law school, Williams led a consortium of businesspeople that was granted one of Newfoundland's first cable television licences and started the company "Avalon Cablevision".<ref name="Leader of Party">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/nlvotes2003/parties/williams.html|title=Danny Williams, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=January 12, 2011}}</ref> Through major acquisitions and the very early adoption of the Internet ISP business (via theZone dial-up and later RoadRunner high-speed cable Internet services), he built [[Cable Atlantic]] into one of the largest communications companies in [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name="Leader of Party"/> As the principal owner, he sold the telecommunications portion of the business for $76&nbsp;million in April 2000, to GT Group Telecom Inc. The cable TV portion of Cable Atlantic was sold to Rogers Cable Inc. for $152&nbsp;million in November 2000.<ref name="Leader of Party"/> This sale plus the success of his extensive law practice gave him the nickname of "Danny Millions" during the early 2000s.<ref name="Leader of Party"/>

Williams has been practising law since 1972, becoming a financially successful lawyer, and was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1984.<ref name="Williams' Bio"/> His firm represented many of the abused altar boys and orphans who sued the Roman Catholic Church, the Christian Brothers and the province of Newfoundland following the [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]] scandal.<ref name="bio"/>

Williams served as president of OIS Fisher, an oil and natural gas company (later renamed Spectrol Group), and has invested in golf courses and resorts throughout the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/premiers/p/dannywilliams.htm/ |title=Canada online biography |publisher=Canadaonline.about.com |date=August 4, 1950 |access-date=June 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606113444/http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/premiers/p/dannywilliams.htm |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> He has also served as the Chairman of the [[CPAC (TV channel)|Canadian Parliamentary Channel]] (CPAC), the Newfoundland and Labrador Film Development Corporation as well as the Provincial Government Offshore Oil Impact Advisory Council.<ref name="bio"/>

While he was the owner of [[Cable Atlantic]] Williams purchased the naming rights to a sports complex in St. John's for $600,000 from [[Molson]].<ref name="Venue"/> Before the centre opened, however, Williams had sold Cable Atlantic to [[Rogers Communications]] to pursue his political career, but retained the naming rights. Ultimately he chose to name the centre [[Mile One Centre]], based on the venue's location at the beginning of the [[Trans Canada Highway]].<ref name="Venue">Don Muret, [http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4568492-1.html Venue's Name Game Takes New Twist], ''Amusement Business'', April 9, 2001.

== Political career ==

=== Leader of the Opposition ===
In 2000, after years of speculation Williams announced his candidacy for the leadership of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]] (PC), and was returned uncontested on April 7, 2001.<ref name="bio"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYBzTnNEjKI|title=Danny Williams Interviewed at 1989 PC leadership Election by Deanne Fleet|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=March 8, 2011}}</ref> On June 19, 2001, he won a by-election in the [[Corner Brook]] district of [[Humber West]].<ref name="by-election"/>

Support for the PC party saw a big bounce when Williams became leader. Four by-elections were held during the two years he was the Opposition Leader and each seat was won by a PC candidate. In September 2001, Liberal Assemblyman (MHA) [[Ross Wiseman]] crossed the floor of the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] to join the Progressive Conservative caucus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/nlvotes2007/riding/047/|title=District Profile Trinity North|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=January 30, 2011}}</ref> During his time as Opposition Leader, Williams donated his legislative salary to charity.<ref name="Leader of Party"/>

===2003 election===
{{Main|2003 Newfoundland and Labrador general election}}
[[File:Nl2003.PNG|thumbnail|150px|Map showing the partisan support and margins within electoral districts]]

Since succeeding [[Beaton Tulk]] as [[premier of Newfoundland and Labrador|Premier of Newfoundland]] in February 2001, Premier [[Roger Grimes]] had been under opposition pressure to legitimize his mandate at the polls after winning the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador|Liberal Party]] (Liberals). On September 29, 2003, Grimes called an election for October 21, 2003.<ref name="three years">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/nlvotes2003/features/feature1.html|title= Election three years in the making|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=January 12, 2011}}</ref>

Polls leading up to and during the election showed that the Progressive Conservatives under Williams had a substantial lead over their main competitor the Liberals, as well as the [[Newfoundland and Labrador New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP).<ref name="Leader of Party"/> Williams campaigned for change and promised to control spending, streamline the public service and create jobs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/newfoundland-and-labrador-goes-blue|title= Newfoundland and Labrador goes blue|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Archives|date= November 21, 2003|access-date=June 13, 2015}}</ref>

The Progressive Conservatives captured nearly 59% of the vote and won 34 of the 48 seats in the [[2003 Newfoundland and Labrador general election|2003 general election]]. This win marked only the third change of government in the 54 years since the province joined Canada, and ended nearly 15 years of Liberal Party rule.<ref name="Tories sweep">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tories-sweep-to-power-in-newfoundland-and-labrador-1.392308 |title=Tories sweep to power in Newfoundland and Labrador |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=October 22, 2003 |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref> As party leader, Williams became the province's ninth Premier.<ref name="Tories sweep"/>

===First term as premier===
Soon after being elected, Williams announced the province's debts were so burdensome that he had no choice but to cut spending and freeze wages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/premier-vows-public-service-wage-freeze-1.478635 |title=Premier vows public service wage freeze |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=January 5, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref> Based on the projected $840&nbsp;million budget deficit for 2004,<ref name="Budget 2004"/> the government announced sweeping cuts. A number of projects would be cut, and others delayed. Cuts included three health care facilities and a school; delayed projects included, most notably, the opening of [[The Rooms]], the province's cultural facility that was under construction. Spurred by the administration's announcement of pay-freeze and plan to eliminate 4,000 public sector jobs, a strike was declared among the 20,000 public sector employees two days following the announcement, at midnight April 1, 2004.<ref name="Budget 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.gov.nl.ca/budget2004/highlights.htm |title=Budget 2004 |publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=June 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nfld-budget-cuts-projects-4-000-jobs-1.497616 |title=Nfld. budget cuts projects, 4,000 jobs |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=March 30, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/20-000-public-workers-go-on-strike-1.498757 |title=20,000 public workers go on strike |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=April 1, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref> The strike ended nearly a month later when Williams reneged on a campaign promise and legislated the employees back to work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nlbargaining.cupe.ca/www/cupe_nape_send_strikers_b |title=CUPE, NAPE send strikers back to work – pre-empting legislation |publisher=CUPE |date=April 24, 2004 |access-date=June 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116082320/http://www.nlbargaining.cupe.ca/www/cupe_nape_send_strikers_b |archive-date=January 16, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later that year the Williams government compressed health and education boards in an attempt for a more efficient delivery of services, a move that still receives criticism in the province.<ref name="2007 bio"/>

An opinion poll conducted in June 2004 showed that support for the Premier and the Progressive Conservatives had plunged.<ref name="plunges"/> From its nearly 60 percent share of the vote in the general election seven months earlier, support had shrunk to 41 percent, almost tied with the Liberals at 39 percent.

During the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 Canadian Federal election]], Williams hit out at incumbent Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and the federal administration for reneging on a 2006 election pledge to exclude non-renewable energy sources from the equalization formula.

Williams has been outspoken about the Québec Government and their crown corporation [[Hydro-Québec]]. On September 3, 2009, Williams accused Hydro-Québec of trying to block the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project to protect its own dominance in the marketplace by making a deal with New Brunswick Premier [[Shawn Graham]] to buy [[NB Power]]'s nuclear and hydro generating stations, the transmission system and other assets in a massive deal. On October 29, 2009, the premiers of [[Premier of New Brunswick|New Brunswick]] and [[Premier of Québec|Québec]] signed a memorandum of understanding to transfer most assets of NB Power to Hydro-Québec.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/williams-accuses-hydro-qu%C3%A9bec-of-protectionism-1.801528 |title=Williams accuses Hydro-Québec of protectionism |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=September 3, 2009 |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref> In the end the deal between New Brunswick and Québec fell apart, Williams dissatisfaction with the deal is thought to have played a role.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.financialpost.com/Quebec+power+deal+went+sour/2722281/story.html|title=Why the Quebec, New Brunswick power deal went sour|publisher=Financial Post|date=March 24, 2010}}</ref> In a speech given on June 9, 2010, Williams strongly denounced "Québec's self interest is harming the provinces, the nation and our country's international reputation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianclubottawa.ca/en/events/archives/speeches/09/Danny_Williams.pdf |title=Canadian Club of Ottawa |publisher=canadianclubottawa.ca |date=June 9, 2010 |access-date=July 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706170412/http://www.canadianclubottawa.ca/en/events/archives/speeches/09/Danny_Williams.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

On February 2, 2010, it was reported that Williams would travel to the United States to have [[heart surgery]]. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada's health care system. According to Deputy Premier [[Kathy Dunderdale]], "It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province."  Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Kenyon |date=February 2, 2010 |title=N.L.

===Popularity===
Williams' popularity is said to be unmatched in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for his first year in office, his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range for the majority of the time he was in office.<ref name="popularity unmatched"/> According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.<ref name=201005CRA/>

During his first year in office Williams and his government suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams and his government dramatically improved in 2005. A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/> The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William's premiership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cra.ca/voter-support-for-williams-government-continues-to-trend-higher/|title=Voter Support for Williams Government Continues to Trend Higher|publisher=Corporate Research Associates|date=March 7, 2006|access-date=March 10, 2011}}</ref> Polling conducted throughout 2007, showed that support for Williams and his government remained high. In August 2007, the CRA found that 86 percent were satisfied with the government's performance; 77 percent supported Williams as premier, and 76 percent endorsed the PC party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cra.ca/site-cra/media/CRA/07-3%20NL%20WEB%20Tables.pdf|title=CRA Atlantic Quarterly – Summer 2007|publisher=Corporate Research Associates|date=September 5, 2007|access-date=March 10, 2011}}</ref>

A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 showed that 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams' Progressive Conservatives. His popularity had been in the seventies according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cra.ca/en/home/Newsroom/SupportforConservativesinNLisUnchangedandRemainsHi.aspx/ |title=CRA Poll |publisher=Cra.ca |date=May 30, 2009 |access-date=June 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223194303/http://www.cra.ca/en/home/Newsroom/SupportforConservativesinNLisUnchangedandRemainsHi.aspx |archive-date=December 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, the first of which was by [[Global News]] and [[Ipsos]] and the second was by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found that Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams' performance, the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier [[Brad Wall]] with 58 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalnational.com/video/index.html?releasePID=1fILcrtjlMghLT4woZ6ZBoUkO_JBoHd_ |title=Videos &#124; Global News |publisher=Globalnational.com |access-date=June 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/williams_is_most_popular_canadian_premier/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718130920/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/williams_is_most_popular_canadian_premier/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2012 |title=Williams is Most Popular Canadian Premier |publisher=Angus-reid.com |access-date=June 5, 2010 }}</ref>

===Resignation===
On November 25, 2010, Williams announced that he would step down as premier on December 3, 2010, and that Deputy Premier [[Kathy Dunderdale]] would serve as the premier of the province until a new party leader was elected in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/danny-williams-retires-as-n-l-premier-1.868431|title=Danny Williams retires as N.L. premier|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 25, 2010|access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref> On December 3, 2010, Williams tendered his resignation as Premier and Dunderdale was sworn in as the tenth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, becoming the first woman to hold the office.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dunderdale becomes 1st woman to lead N.L.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/dunderdale-becomes-1st-woman-to-lead-n-l-1.959039|access-date=29 April 2018|newspaper=Canadian Broadcaster Corporation|date=3 December 2010}}</ref>

Danny Williams also caused controversy when it was learned that during his time as premier he had elected to conduct an affair with his Communications Aid- Elizabeth Matthews, an affair which resulted in a child and a divorce. Affairs not unusual in politics however this one was also notable for Elizabeth's alleged prior relationship with Premier Williams son named Danny Williams Jr. After leaving office Danny Sr. and Elizabeth Matthews face the only truly published controversy on their affair which was over the appointment of Elizabeth to a board for offshore oil which many criticized she was unqualified for. 

The week following Williams' departure from politics, CRA released a poll conducted during November showing that 90 percent of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were either completely or mostly satisfied with the performance of the PC government. 75 percent of the respondents supported the Progressive Conservatives, while 76 percent thought Williams was the best choice to be premier.<ref name="popularity unmatched">{{cite web

===Legacy===
The high amounts of spending done by Williams's government while he was in power have been blamed for the financial situation that Newfoundland and Labrador has been in since 2015. Premier Dwight Ball claimed that the Williams spending era would be paid down by oil prices of $148/barrel USD <ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/premier-dwight-ball-paints-dire-picture-of-newfoundlands-economic-future/article32671914/ Premier Dwight Ball paints dire picture of Newfoundland’s economic future]</ref> The [[Lower Churchill Project]] has doubled in price while oil prices (which make up a significant amount of the province's GDP) have fallen. In June 2016, a poster of Williams's face was put up by anonymous protesters near the Confederation Building alongside posters of [[Dwight Ball]] and [[Cathy Bennett]]. The poster with William's face on it had the slogan "The Running Mouth".<ref>[http://vocm.com/news/danny-williams-posters-join-ball-on-parkway/ Danny Williams Posters Join Ball On Parkway]</ref>
