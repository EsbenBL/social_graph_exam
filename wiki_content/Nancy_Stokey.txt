She is a Fellow of the Econometric Society, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. She previously served as a co editor of ''[[Econometrica]]'' and was a member of the Expert Panel of the Copenhagen Consensus. She received her Honorary Doctor of Laws (L.L.D) in 2012 from the University of Western Ontario.<ref name="economics.uchicago.edu"/> Much of her work has been done by digesting economic dynamics, which most of this work is done as an expositor.<ref name="American Economic Association">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/distinguished-fellows/nancy-stokey|title=American Economic Association|website=www.aeaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref> She spent a great deal of time recently researching growth theory, economic dynamics, as well as fiscal and monetary policy.<ref name="American Economic Association"/>

==Author==
Stokey has published significant research in the areas of economic growth and development, as well as papers on economic history ("A Quantitative Model of the British [[Industrial Revolution]]: 1780–1850," 2001)<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0167-2231(01)80003-8| title = A quantitative model of the British industrial revolution, 1780–1850| journal = Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy| volume = 55| page = 55| year = 2001| last1 = Stokey | first1 = N. L. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.32.3641}}</ref> and [[optimal control]] ("Dynamic Programming with Homogeneous Functions," 1998, co-authored with [[Fernando Alvarez (economist)|Fernando Alvarez]]). She is the co-developer, with [[Paul Milgrom]], of the [[no-trade theorem]], a counter-intuitive development of the premises of [[financial economics]]. She co-authored with [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] and [[Edward Prescott]] a book on ''Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics'' that is widely used by research economists and graduate students. Stokey worked with [[Paul Milgrom]] to publish "Information, Trade, and Common Knowledge" (1982), which established that information-based trade is not possible for rational agents with common knowledge. This work contributed to be one of the pillars of modern finance.

Stokey has also written articles that explain the "wait and see model", which describes investment decisions that firms who face a one-time tax policy will endure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Stokey |first1= Nancy|date= July 2016 |journal= Review of Economic Dynamics |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109420251500037X|title= Wait-and-see: Investment options under policy uncertainty |volume= 21|pages= 246–265|doi= 10.1016/j.red.2015.06.001|s2cid= 17885232|access-date=2020-11-29}}</ref> As well as the author of ''The Economics of Inaction'' (2009) which treats models that involve fixed costs of adjustment.

Stokey has written critically about how the United Nations allocates funds for international economic development and humanitarian aid.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/20/we-must-focus-on-the-un-goals-that-are-the-best-value-for-money|title=We must focus on the UN goals that are the best value for money|last1=Lomborg|first1=Bjorn|date=2016-07-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-15|last2=Kydland|first2=Finn|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Stokey|first3=Nancy}}</ref>

Stokey coauthored "Optimal Monetary and Fiscal Policy" which was one of the first papers to examine the time consistency of macroeconomic policy and to demonstrate the importance of central banks following rules.<ref name="American Economic Association"/>

Her recent research is on growth theory, economic dynamics, and fiscal and monetary policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economics.uchicago.edu/directory/nancy-l-stokey|title=Nancy L.
