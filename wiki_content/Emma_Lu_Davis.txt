=== Career ===
After leaving school, Davis spent three years as a freelancer working on a variety of commissions. In 1933 she spent six months studying modern techniques and design under [[Buckminster Fuller]] at the Dymaxion factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut.<ref name="goode" /> At the factory, she wrote later, she learned "the principles of good workmanship. I think there are a great many 'artists' but awfully few real craftsmen. Use of tools and neat, fast, strong construction are not taught much in art schools." It was there that she learned how to work with wood, and began experimenting with abstract forms.<ref name="americans1942" /> Her figurative sculptures from the 1930s reflect her interest in the naive art of various folk cultures;<ref name="fort">{{cite book |last1=Fort |first1=Ilene Susan|display-authors=etal|title=The Figure in American Sculpture: A Question of Modernity |publisher=University of Washington Press |date=1995 |isbn=9780295974378 |page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAhQAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> for example, "Grotesque Bull" (shown), a terra cotta sculpture which was included in Dorothy Miller's "Americans 1942" exhibition at MoMA.<ref name="americans1942" />

In spring 1935 Davis traveled to Russia to learn how Russian artists were organized and how socialized patronage affected their work. She concluded that Soviet artists failed to innovate because "the cheap academic traditions have been continued under the name of 'socialist realism'&mdash;that is, all the facts and none of the meaning of the subject."<ref name="americans1942" />

From 1938 to 1941 Davis was the artist in residence at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. She described this period as "the most profitable and enjoyable three years of my life."<ref name="americans1942" /> In 1939 she was commissioned by the federal [[Treasury Section of Fine Arts]] to paint a mural, ''Missouri Livestock'', for the post office in [[La Plata, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web |website=The Living New Deal |title=Post Office Mural - La Plata, MO |url=https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/post-office-mural-la-plata-mo/}}</ref> Two years later she collaborated with Henry Kreis on a series of low-relief granite sculptures depicting the benefits of social security for the overdoor panels of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] building in Washington, D.C.<ref name="scott">{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Pamela |display-authors=etal |title=Buildings of the District of Columbia |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1993 |isbn=9780195061468 |page=[https://archive.org/details/buildingsofdistr0000scot/page/235 235] |url=https://archive.org/details/buildingsofdistr0000scot/page/235 }}</ref>

After practicing as a commercial artist for thirty years, Davis decided to retrain as an archaeologist. She completed her Ph.D. at UCLA in 1965, writing a dissertation titled ''Anasazi Mobility and Mesa Verde Migrations'' (1964). She worked Science Direction at the [[San Diego Museum of Man]], while continuing her desert studies, focusing on the southern California region of [[China Lake]]. Prior to her retirement, she established the Great Basin Foundation, which conducted paleo-environmental research. According to Joseph L. Chartkoff, Davis was "one of the most important figures in bringing scientific rigor and credibility to Paleoindian archaeology in California."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chartkoff |first1=Joseph L. |editor-last1=Gibbon |editor-first1=Guy |editor-last2=Ames |editor-first2=Kenneth M. |title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Taylor & Francis |date=1998 |isbn=9780815307259 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/198 198–199] |chapter=Davis, Emma Lou (1905-1988) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0u2y_SVnmoC&pg=PA198 |url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/198 }}</ref>
