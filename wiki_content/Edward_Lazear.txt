==Early life and education==
Lazear was born on August 17, 1948, in [[New York City]]. He grew up in [[Brooklyn]], New York, before moving to [[Los Altos, California]]. His father was a shipyard worker during [[World War II]], and had also been a janitor at a hospital, while his mother was a salesperson at a jewelry shop.<ref name=":0" />  As a high school student, he worked at a hospital mailroom and was also a member of the school cross-country running team.<ref name=":0" />

Lazear graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], with AB and AM degrees in 1971. His wife said he struggled at first, until he took an economics course and did well. He went on to major in Economics.<ref name=":0" /> He received his doctorate in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1974.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Porter|first=Eduardo|date=November 25, 2020|title=Edward P.

=== Labor and personnel economics ===
Lazear was considered one of the pioneers of [[Labour economics|labor economics]], and [[personnel economics]], branches of economics that studies market dynamics between wages and labor.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Borjas, George J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889577338|title=Labor economics|isbn=978-0-07-802188-6|edition=Seventh|location=New York, NY|oclc=889577338|access-date=November 27, 2020|archive-date=November 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128145954/https://www.worldcat.org/title/labor-economics/oclc/889577338|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Oyer|first=Paul|last2=Shaw|first2=Kathryn|date=2021-01-09|title=Edward Lazear: Personnel, policy, and productivity|url=https://voxeu.org/article/edward-lazear-personnel-policy-and-productivity?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter|access-date=2021-01-09|website=VoxEU.org}}</ref> His 1995 book, ''Personnel Economics'', was a seminal work that in addition to introducing the topic, encouraged a wave of subsequent research into labor and management relations.<ref name=":0" /> <!-- Note: Add a list of economists who have subsequently picked this topic up. E..g Michael Gibbs (BS UC), Paul Oyer (GSB SU). Others? -->

In a transformative paper in the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', in 2000, he studied the relationship between incentive-based pay and productivity and concluded that a shift towards incentive-based attracted more efficient workers and contributed to an increased worker output.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=December 2000|title=Performance Pay and Productivity|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.5.1346|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1346–1361|doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1346|issn=0002-8282|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=November 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127020337/https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faer.90.5.1346|url-status=live}}</ref> In a case study that examined management and workers at ''Safelight Glass Company,'' he noted that when the company moved towards a variable and incentive based pay from the earlier hourly pay, the company saw an increase in worker output and productivity by about 44%. He argued that this increase in productivity and output was not driven  by workers just working harder, but, it also included substitution of the labor force, with the company attracting and holding on to more efficient workers.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

In a paper earlier in his career in 1979 in the ''Journal of Political Economy'', titled, ''Why is there Mandatory Retirement?,'' he had explored the driving motivations behind mandatory retirement.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 24, 2015|title=Edward Lazear - Mandatory Retirement|url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/lazear_mandatory_retirement.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090528/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/lazear_mandatory_retirement.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|access-date=November 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=1979|title=Why Is There Mandatory Retirement?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1833332|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=87|issue=6|pages=1261–1284|doi=10.1086/260835|jstor=1833332|s2cid=153817995|issn=0022-3808|access-date=November 27, 2020|archive-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131201055/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833332|url-status=live}}</ref> In this paper he argued that companies should adjust the payout structures to pay less during workers' younger days when their productivity is presumably higher and they are worth more to businesses, and pay more to workers in their older days. He goes on to say that while this would mean that employees would hold on to their jobs, [[mandatory retirement]] would help solve this problem.<ref name=":4" /> The Congress outlawed this practice in 1986.<ref name=":1" />

Lazear built on the lifetime payout thinking, and working with Professor [[Sherwin Rosen]] from the University of Chicago, introduced [[Tournament theory]] as a way to allocate wages and compensation where wage differences are based not on [[marginal productivity]] but instead upon relative differences between the individuals.<ref name="LazearRosen">Edward P. Lazear and Sherwin Rosen, 1981.

They go on to show that in certain conditions compensation based on rank can result in efficient allocation of resources and also serve as an incentive for workers as they look to advancing through the ranks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lazear|first1=Edward P.|last2=Rosen|first2=Sherwin|date=1981|title=Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830810|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=89|issue=5|pages=841–864|doi=10.1086/261010|jstor=1830810|s2cid=42331944|issn=0022-3808|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222191235/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1830810|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lazear|first1=Edward P.|last2=Rosen|first2=Sherwin|date=November 1, 1979|title=Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w0401|language=en|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=November 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125020127/https://www.nber.org/papers/w0401|url-status=live}}</ref>

He was a proponent of market dynamics and efficiency and argued in favor of market driven actions rather than wage guarantees like minimum wages and other governmental interventions. At the same time, he also argued that European state policies toward job stability amongst workers did not necessarily mean higher unemployment and lower productivity levels in the European labor markets.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=August 1, 1990|title=Job Security Provisions and Employment|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/105/3/699/1864591|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=105|issue=3|pages=699–726|doi=10.2307/2937895|jstor=2937895|issn=0033-5533|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=November 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128145938/https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/105/3/699/1864591?redirectedFrom=fulltext|url-status=live}}</ref> He further went on to make the case that [[Free market|free markets]] contribute to increased well-being of the poor.

In a commentary on the job growth in 2018, when the jobless growth rate was below 4%, he had said that the [[Federal Reserve]] did not need to intervene on fears of the economy overheating, and had suggested that economists didn't need to worry if the job growth could continue much further. The job growth went on for an additional year and a half before the [[coronavirus disease 2019]] pandemic hit the world.<ref name=":0" />

===Role during the financial crisis ===

Professor Lazear served as the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors during the Financial Crisis and through the Great Recession of 2007–2009. As the chief economic advisor to President Bush, he joined the White House economic team that orchestrated the policy response to the financial crisis and that restructured the financial system. Lazear's team developed the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]] which provided the first rounds of economic stimuli intended to boost the United States economy in the face of unprecedented shocks to the financial and housing sectors. The bill was implemented rapidly: passing the U.S House of Representatives on January 29, 2008, and then the U.S Senate on February 7, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|title=House Follows Senate in Approving Economic Stimulus Plan|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/02/07/house-follows-senate-in-approving-economic-stimulus-plan.html|newspaper=Fox News t|date=February 7, 2008|access-date=March 9, 2016|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305082412/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/02/07/house-follows-senate-in-approving-economic-stimulus-plan.html|url-status=live}}</ref> to be signed into law on February 13, 2008 by President Bush with bi-partisan support.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pelosi|first=Nancy|date=February 13, 2008|title=H.R.5140 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Economic Stimulus Act of 2008|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/5140|access-date=November 27, 2020|website=www.congress.gov|archive-date=November 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118092423/https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/5140|url-status=live}}</ref> During this period it is mentioned that he was a regular at [[Camp David]], and accompanied [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] on bike rides in the country retreat, and had been nicknamed as 'stork' by the President.<ref name=":0" /> 

Prior to serving as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Lazear was a member of President Bush's [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]], established in 2005. He had  worked with nine other members on reforms to the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to provide policy options without impacting the revenue collections.<ref>{{Cite web|title=President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform - Final Report - November 1, 2005|url=https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/taxreformpanel/final-report/index.html|access-date=November 27, 2020|website=govinfo.library.unt.edu|archive-date=November 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115033225/https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/taxreformpanel/final-report/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Other research ===

==== Educational production ====
In a paper in 2001, in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'', Lazear introduced the idea of an ''education production function'' in a classroom. He stated that an optimal classroom size is larger for well behaved students, with the argument that classrooms had a [[Public good (economics)|public good]] element to them and when one student disrupts the class, learning is reduced for all students. He introduces an educational production function that maps student discipline to class size and says that this may explain why [[Catholic school]]s despite their larger sizes might outperform public schools.<ref name="Lazear"/><ref name="Lazear 2001 777–803"/>

Lazear also studied high-stakes testing, and educator fears that high-stakes testing will incentivize students to focus on learning to the tests at the cost of not learning aspects that are less likely to be included in the tests. In a paper in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' in 2006, he compares this to deterrents that deter drivers from speeding, and emphasizes the costs of learning and of monitoring. When police locations are mentioned to drivers on a freeway, speeding occurrences are reduced. So, when the fines from speeding tickets are higher relative to benefits from speeding and there are sufficient police personnel, it is better to keep the locations a secret, resulting in higher compliance levels across all locations. Similarly, with the introduction of costs of learning and costs of monitoring, he goes on to say that high cost learners will learn more when they are told of the contents of the exam. He further goes on to make a case that tests should be well defined for younger students and more amorphous for advanced students.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=August 1, 2006|title=Speeding, Terrorism, and Teaching to the Test|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/121/3/1029/1917851|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=121|issue=3|pages=1029–1061|doi=10.1162/qjec.121.3.1029|issn=0033-5533|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=November 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128165900/https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/121/3/1029/1917851?redirectedFrom=fulltext|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=November 22, 2004|title=Speeding, Tax Fraud, and Teaching to the Test|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w10932|language=en|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=August 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825025637/https://www.nber.org/papers/w10932|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Culture and language ====
Lazear also attempted to study the rise of [[multiculturalism]] and linked it to the importance of the linkages between culture and language to the overall population. In a paper in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', he considers culture and language as means to facilitate trade between people and goes on to state that minority populations have incentives to be better assimilated to the larger society and learn the majority language and cultural elements so as to have a larger pool of potential trading partners. Assimilation is less likely when the incoming population's culture and language is broadly represented in the larger society. He goes on to say that in a pluralistic society, governmental actions that encourage diverse cultural-immigration over concentrated immigration can increase societal welfare.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=1999|title=Culture and Language|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/250105|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=107|issue=S6|pages=S95–S126|doi=10.1086/250105|jstor=10.1086/250105|s2cid=153720804|issn=0022-3808|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=March 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321184610/http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/250105|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=September 1, 1995|title=Culture and Language|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w5249|language=en|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=August 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814213346/https://www.nber.org/papers/w5249|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Entrepreneurship and skill acquisition ====
Attempting to identify attributes that enable entrepreneurship, Lazear drew a correlation between successful entrepreneurs and skill acquisition. In a paper in the ''[[Journal of Labor Economics]]'' in 2005, he states that successful entrepreneurs would need to be broad based in their skills or 'jacks-of-all-trades,' rather than excelling in any one specific skill. With data from [[Stanford alumni]], he draws a correlation between students who have had a diverse work and educational backgrounds being more likely to be successful entrepreneurs than those who have focused on one role or on one subject.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Entrepreneurship|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24099956|access-date=November 28, 2020|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-date=November 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128145953/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24099956_Entrepreneurship|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazear|first=Edward P.|date=October 1, 2005|title=Entrepreneurship|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/491605|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|volume=23|issue=4|pages=649–680|doi=10.1086/491605|issn=0734-306X|access-date=November 28, 2020|archive-date=April 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405213804/https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/491605|url-status=live}}</ref>
