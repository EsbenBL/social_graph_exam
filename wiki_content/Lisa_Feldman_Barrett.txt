==Biography==
Barrett was born in 1963 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to a [[working poor|working-poor]] family and was the first member of her extended family to attend university.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Scarantino|first=Andrea|date=November 2014|title=Lisa Feldman Barrett: Why Emotions Are Situated Conceptualizations|url=http://emotionresearcher.com/lisa-feldman-barrett-why-emotions-are-situated-conceptualizations/|website=Emotion Researcher}}</ref> After graduating from the University of Toronto with honors, she pursued a Ph.D. in [[clinical psychology]] at the University of Waterloo with the goal of becoming a therapist,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Shannon|date=June 25, 2013|title=About Face: Emotions and Facial Expressions May Not Be Related|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2013/06/25/emotions-facial-expressions-not-related/|journal=Boston Magazine|pages=68–73}}</ref> until a frustrating puzzle sidetracked her from a clinical career. As a graduate student, she failed eight times to replicate a simple experiment, finally realizing that her seeming failed attempts were, in fact, successfully replicating a previously undiscovered phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barrett|first=Lisa Feldman|title=How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2017|isbn=0544133315|location=New York}}</ref> The resulting research direction became her life's work: understanding the nature of emotion in the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vander Woude|first=Megan|date=May 28, 2019|title=Mind Boggling|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/impact-stories/mind-boggling|website=University of Waterloo}}</ref> Following a clinical internship at the [[University of Manitoba]] Medical School, she held professorships in psychology at Penn State University, Boston College, and Northeastern University. Over two decades, she transitioned from clinical psychology into [[social psychology]], psychophysiology, [[cognitive science]], and cognitive neuroscience.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2019|title=Lisa Feldman Barrett|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/lisa-feldman-barrett/|website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation}}</ref>

Barrett is most inspired by [[William James]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sutton|first=Jon|date=April 2017|title=Many fairy tales about the brain still propagate through our field|work=The Psychologist|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/april-2017/many-fairy-tales-about-brain-still-propagate-through-our-field}}</ref> In 2019–2020, she served as president of the [[Association for Psychological Science]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Nicodemo|first=Allie|date=May 11, 2018|title=Northeastern Professor Named President-Elect for the Association of Psychological Science|work=News@Northeastern|url=https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/05/11/northeastern-professor-named-president-elect-for-the-association-of-psychological-science/}}</ref> From 2018–2020, she was ranked in the top one percent of the most-cited scientists in the world over a ten-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Six Northeastern Professors Named to 2019 List of ‘Highly Cited Researchers’ Around the Globe|url=https://cos.northeastern.edu/news/six-northeastern-professors-named-to-2019-list-of-highly-cited-researchers-around-the-globe/|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Northeastern University College of Science|language=en-US}}</ref>

In addition to academic work, Barrett has written two science books for the public, ''How Emotions are Made'' (2017) and ''Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain'' (2020), and her [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk was among the 25 most popular worldwide in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018|title=The most popular TED Talks of 2018|url=https://www.ted.com/playlists/682/the_most_popular_ted_talks_of_2018|website=TED}}</ref>

==Professional history==

===Study of human emotions===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2021}}
At the beginning of her career, Barrett's research focused on the structure of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], having developed experience-sampling methods<ref>
{{cite book   | last = Hektner  | first = Joel M.  |author2=Jennifer A. Schmidt |author3=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi   | title = ''Experience Sampling Method: Measuring the Quality of Everyday Life.''  | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]]  |date=September 2006  | isbn = 1-4129-4923-8  | page = 37 et al }}
</ref> and open-source software to study emotional experience. Barrett and members at the Interdisciplinary Affective Science Laboratory study the nature of emotion broadly from social-psychological, [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]], [[cognitive science]], and neuroscience perspectives, and take inspiration from anthropology, philosophy, and linguistics. They also explore the role of emotion in vision and other psychological phenomena.

In 1996, she joined the Psychology Faculty at Boston College. Before that she was an [[assistant professor]] of clinical psychology at the Pennsylvania State University.

Her research has focused on the main issues in the science of emotions such as: 
*

*What are the basic building blocks of emotional life<s>?</s>
*Building blocks of emotional life
*Why is it that people quickly and effortlessly perceive anger, sadness, fear in themselves and others, yet scientists have been unable to specify a set of clear criteria for empirically identifying these emotional events?
*What roles do language and conceptual knowledge play in emotion perception
*Are there really differences between the emotional lives of men and women (see {{Section link|Sex differences in psychology|Emotion}})

===Theory of constructed emotion===
{{Main|Theory of constructed emotion}}
Barrett developed her current theory of constructed emotion originally during her graduate training. 

According to Barrett, emotions are "not universal, but vary from culture to culture" (see [[Emotions and culture]]). She says that emotions "are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment."<ref>How Emotions Are Made, 2017, Introduction</ref>

The theory denies "essentialism" of affect, such as the seven [[primary affective systems]] proposed by the affective neuroscientist [[Jaak Panksepp]]. Panksepp summarized the theory of constructed emotion as an "attributional–dimensional constructivist view of human emotions [which] postulates that positive and negative core affects are the basic feelings—the primary processes—from which emotional concepts are cognitively and [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panksepp|first=Jaak|date=2007|title=Neurologizing the Psychology of Affects: How Appraisal-Based Constructivism and Basic Emotion Theory Can Coexist|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40212207|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=2|issue=3|pages=281–296|issn=1745-6916}}</ref>
