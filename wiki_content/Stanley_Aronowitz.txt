'''Stanley Aronowitz''' (1933–2021) was a professor of [[sociology]], cultural studies, and urban education at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. He was also a veteran political activist and cultural critic, an advocate for [[organized labor]] and a member of the interim consultative committee of the International Organization for a Participatory Society.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Organization for a Participatory Society: Consultative Committee|publisher=International Organization for a Participatory Society|url=http://www.iopsociety.org/interim-committee|access-date=April 23, 2012}}</ref> In 2012, Aronowitz was awarded the Center for Study of Working Class Life's Lifetime Achievement Award at [[Stony Brook University]].<ref name=BrookRail/>

==Biography==
Born on January 6, 1933, and raised in [[New York City]], Aronowitz attended public primary school in [[The Bronx]] before enrolling in [[The High School of Music & Art]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref name="nyt">{{cite web|title=Stanley Aronowitz, Labor Scholar and Activist, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/us/stanley-aronowitz-dead.html|work=The New York Times|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=August 21, 2021|accessdate=August 23, 2021}}</ref><ref name=LCBio>{{cite web|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81010406.html|title=Stanley Aronowitz: LC Authority Name File|author=Staff|website=Library of Congress|access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> He then attended [[Brooklyn College]] until being suspended by its administration for engaging in a demonstration. Instead of returning to school the next year, Aronowitz moved to [[New Jersey]], where he worked at several [[metalworking]] factories.

Aronowitz became involved in the American [[Labor unions in the United States|labor movement]] in New Jersey, and in 1959, while laid off from his job as a metalworker, he found work with the New Jersey Industrial Union Council. Collaborating with the council's president, Aronowitz cowrote New Jersey's unemployment compensation law, subsequently enacted by the state legislature in 1961.

His work with the Industrial Union Council led to Aronowitz's appointment as director of the organizing and boycott department of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]. Aronowitz spent four years traveling throughout the United States to develop the union's campaigns.

In the 1960s, while employed with the Clothing Workers, Aronowitz began participating in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. He engaged in lunch counter [[sit-in]]s and gave speeches on the labor movement's behalf to the [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] on the confluence of African-American civil rights and economic issues.

Through his work in civil rights, Aronowitz secured the role of labor coordinator, appointed by [[Bayard Rustin]], on the planning committee of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1962–3. Aronowitz was tasked with soliciting the support of American labor unions for the march, and while encountering resistance from the majority of trade unions, most notably the [[AFL–CIO]], he secured the endorsement of the [[United Auto Workers]], [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]], as well as rubber and clothing workers' unions.<ref name=AronowitzBio/>

Aronowitz died on August 16, 2021, from complications of a stroke, in [[Manhattan]].<ref name="nyt" /><ref name=Death>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/stanley-aronowitz-longtime-labor-and-civil-rights-activist-dies-at-88|title=Stanley Aronowitz, longtime labor and civil rights activist, dies at 88|website=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]}}</ref> 

==Writings==
Aronowitz was the author of numerous books on [[social class|class]], [[culture]], [[sociology of science]], and [[politics]]. With [[Fredric Jameson]] and [[John Brenkman]], he was a founding editor of [[Duke University]]'s ''[[Social Text]]'', a journal that is subtitled "Theory, Culture, Ideology". He defended the journal from criticism after it published a hoax article in its summer 1996 issue (see [[Sokal Affair]]).<ref>Aronowitz, S. (1997) Alan Sokal's "Transgression". ''Dissent'', Winter 1997.</ref>

In that article, he stated that with this publication, "Our objective was to interrogate Marxists' habitual separation of political economy and culture and to make a contribution to their articulation, even reunification." Aronowitz, however, was not a working editor at the time of the Sokal scandal and had not seen the paper before publication. In an interview in the [[Brooklyn Rail]] after the publication of ''Taking it Big: C. Wright Mills and the Making of Political Intellectuals'', he cited Mills's influence on his beliefs when he states, "My own insights, as a result of my own experience as a worker, as a trade unionist, and as an activist, were stimulated and, to some extent, guided by Mills’s example. His three major books on American social structure—''The New Men of Power'', ''White Collar'', and ''The Power Elite''—together constitute a compelling intellectual program for our own times."<ref name=BrookRail/>

==Green politics==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2017}}
In 2002, Aronowitz led efforts to maintain the official ballot status of the [[Green Party (US)|Green Party]] in [[New York Green Party|New York]] and [[New York gubernatorial election, 2002|ran for governor]] on that ticket the same year. He ran a grass roots campaign based on a radical democratic program that combined opposition to corporate power and plutocratic government with commitment to sustainability, racial equality, feminism, gay liberation and individual freedom.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

His campaign finished in 5th place, receiving 41,797 votes (.89%). He was also an active [[trade union]]ist and a member of the executive council of his university's union, the [[Professional Staff Congress]]. Aronowitz was a proponent of a reduced work week, among other strategies for improving everyday life, and worked actively with the [[Basic Income Earth Network]] toward the furtherance of such goals.

==Other activities==
In 1965 Aronowitz was one of the lecturers at the [[Free University of New York]] shortly after it was founded.<ref>{{Citation|last=Berke|author-link=Joseph Berke|first=Joseph|title=The Free University of New York|journal=Peace News|date=October 29, 1965|pages=6–7}} as reproduced in {{Citation|last=Jakobsen|first=Jakob|title=Anti-University of Londin–Antihistory Tabloid|publisher=MayDay Rooms|location=London, UK|year=2012|pages=6–7|url=http://maydayrooms.org/room-3-research/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012141942/http://maydayrooms.org/room-3-research/|archive-date=2012-10-12}}</ref>

In 1976, Aronowitz (then living in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and teaching at [[UC-Irvine]], joined the [[New American Movement]]. In 2010, he would write a lengthy essay titled, "The New American Movement and Why It Failed" for the journal ''Work and Days''.<ref>[http://www.worksanddays.net/2010/File03.Aronowitz.pdf Aronowitz, Stanley. "The New American Movement and Why It Failed." ''Work and Day'' Issue 55/56; Vol. 28, 2010; pp. 21-34]</ref>

In 2005 Aronowitz co-founded the journal ''Situations: Project of the Radical Imagination''. He has also published articles in numerous publications and with a core group of intellectuals—faculty and students—at the Graduate Center, he spearheaded the effort to create the Center for Cultural Studies (now the Center for the Study of Culture, Technology and Work) in the spirit of fostering intellectual debate, multidisciplinarity, and the toppling of high cultural privilege in academia. In 1969, Aronowitz, [[Jeremy Brecher]], [[Paul Mattick Jr.]], and [[Peter Rachleff]], began sporadically publishing a magazine and pamphlet series called ''Root & Branch''<ref>{{cite web|title=Root & Branch: A Liberatarian Socialist Journal|date=1973|url=https://libcom.org/library/root-branch-libertarian-socialist-journal|access-date=April 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Root & Branch: The Rise of the Workers' Movements|date=1975|publisher=Fawcett|location=Greenwich, CT}}</ref> drawing on the tradition of workers councils and adapting them to contemporary America.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Family==
Aronowitz lived in [[New York City]]. He was first married to Jane O'Connell until divorcing in 1962 and was then married to [[Ellen Willis]] from 1998 until her death in November 2006.<ref name="nyt" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/arts/10willis.html|title = Ellen Willis, 64, Journalist and Feminist, Dies|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 10 November 2006|last1 = Fox|first1 = Margalit}}</ref> He had five children, including [[Nona Willis-Aronowitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01296|title=Willis, Ellen.
