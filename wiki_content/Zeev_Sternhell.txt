'''Zeev Sternhell''' ({{lang-he|זאב שטרנהל}}, 10 April 1935 – 21 June 2020) was a [[Poles|Polish]]-born [[Israel]]i historian, political scientist, commentator on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and writer. He was one of the world's leading theorists of the phenomenon of [[fascism]].<ref name="Griffin" /> Sternhell headed the Department of Political Science at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and wrote for ''[[Haaretz]]'' newspaper.

==Biography==
Zeev Sternhell was born in [[Przemyśl]] in south-eastern [[Polish Second Republic|Poland]] on 10 April 1935 to an affluent secular Jewish family with [[Zionism|Zionist]] tendencies. His grandfather and father were textile merchants.<ref name=Shavit>{{cite news |author=Ari Shavit |author-link=Ari Shavit |date=6 March 2008 |title=Amazing grace |url=http://www.haaretz.com/amazing-grace-1.240739 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref> At 5, this highly protected world around him suddenly collapsed.<ref name="Shavit" />  After the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, in which his father fought with the Polish army and died shortly after returning home when Poland was defeated, the family home was partially requisitioned by [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet forces]].<ref name="Shavit" /><ref name="APNYT" >[[Associated Press]],[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/21/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-obit-zeev-sternhall.html 'Zeev Sternhell, Dovish Israeli Expert on Fascism, Dies at 85,'] [[New York Times]] 21 June 2020.</ref> After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German declaration of war on the Soviet Union]], the family were sent to a [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Poland|ghetto]].<ref name=Shavit /> His mother and older sister, Ada, were killed by the Nazis when he was about seven years old.<ref name="Lerner" >[[Gad Lerner]],'Da soldato a studioso del fasci-nazismo,' in [[Il Fatto Quotidiano]], 21 June 2020.:'non aveva ancora 7 anni quando la madre e la sorella furono uccise dai nazisti'.</ref> An uncle who had a permit to work outside the ghetto smuggled him to [[Lviv|Lwów]].<ref name=Traubmann>{{cite news |author=Tamara Traubmann |date=8 February 2008 |title=Haaretz's Ze'ev Sternhell wins Israel Prize in political science |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/haaretz-s-ze-ev-sternhell-wins-israel-prize-in-political-science-1.238934 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref> The uncle found a Polish officer and a working-class family, rare examples in his experience of Poland at that time of people not only not anti-Semitic but ready to provide assistance to Jews, who were willing to help them.<ref name="Shavit" /> Supplied with false Aryan papers, Sternhell lived with his aunt, uncle and cousin as a Polish Catholic. After the war, he was baptized, taking the Polish name Zbigniew Orolski.<ref name=Shavit /> He became an [[altar boy]] in the [[Wawel Cathedral|Cathedral of Kraków]]. In 1946, at the age of 11, Sternhell was taken to [[French Fourth Republic|France]] on a [[Red Cross]] children's train, where he lived with an aunt. He learned [[French language|French]] and was accepted to a school in [[Avignon]] despite stiff competition.<ref name=Shavit />

In the winter of 1951, at the age of 16, Sternhell [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Israel]] under the auspices of [[Youth Aliyah]], and was sent to [[Magdiel (school)|Magdiel boarding school]].<ref name=Traubmann /><ref>Ari Shavit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zbPudMBp5yYC&pg=PA151  ''My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel,''] [[Random House]] 2013 {{isbn|978-0-812-98464-4}} pp. 151–152.</ref> In the 1950s, he served as a [[platoon]] commander in the [[Golani Brigade|Golani infantry brigade]], including the [[Suez Crisis|Sinai War]]. He fought as a reservist in the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Yom Kippur War]] and the [[1982 Lebanon War]].<ref name=Shavit/> and defined himself in 2008 as still a 'super-Zionist'.<ref name="Shavit" />

In 1957–1960, he studied history and [[political science]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], graduating with a BA ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]''. In 1969, he was awarded a Ph.D. from the [[Sciences Po|Institut d'études politiques de Paris]] for his thesis on "The Social and Political Ideas of [[Maurice Barrès]]".<ref>Francoise S.

Sternhell lived in [[Jerusalem]] with his wife Ziva, an art historian, with whom he had two daughters. He died on 21 June 2020, due to complications from a [[Surgery|medical surgery]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Aderet|first=Ofer|title=Zeev Sternhell, leading voice of Israeli left and renowned political scientist, dies at 85|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-zeev-sternhell-leading-voice-of-israeli-left-and-political-scientist-dies-at-85-1.8922259|work=Haaretz|date=21 June 2020|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref>

==Academic career==
In 1976, Sternhell became co-editor of ''The Jerusalem Quarterly'', remaining an active contributor until 1990. He started teaching political science at the Hebrew University in 1966, becoming a full professor in 1982. In 1989, he was elected to the [[Léon Blum]] Chair of Political Science at the Hebrew University and became a member of the editorial board of ''History and Memory''. In 1991, the French government awarded him the title of "Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres" for his outstanding contribution to French culture.<ref>[https://fr.timesofisrael.com/lisraelien-zeev-sternhell-officier-de-lordre-des-arts-et-des-lettres/ 'Zeev Sternhell, Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres,']  [[The Times of Israel]] 11 December 2014</ref> In 1996, he was a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Journal of Political Ideologies]]''.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2008, Sternhell was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for [[Political Science]].<ref name=Traubmann />  Although the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] was petitioned to have him denied the award  (see "Controversies" below), the court determined not to intervene in a matter beyond its jurisdiction.<ref>Daniel Friedmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vMUwDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA166 ''The Purse and the Sword: The Trials of Israel's Legal Revolution,'']  [[Oxford University Press]] 2016  {{isbn|978-0-190-27850-2}} p. 166.</ref>

==Research==
Zeev Sternhell considered [[fascism]], in its ideological form, to be a synthesis of anti-materialist socialism and nationalism.<ref name="Griffin" >Roger Griffin,[https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFUAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 ''The Nature of Fascism,''] [[Routledge]] 2013 {{isbn|978-1-136-14588-9}} p.  6.</ref> He traced its roots to ideas that emerged in the [[Counter-Enlightenment]] in reaction to the historical turning point of 1789, when the [[French Revolution]] destroyed the  [[Ancien Régime]].<ref name="Lerner" /> He identified various strains in this reactionary movement, linking them to the three traditional right-wing families cited by [[René Rémond]] – [[legitimists|legitimism]], [[Orléanist|Orleanism]], and [[Bonapartism]] together with anarchic/leftist labour movements. The main cultural  influences, according to Sternhell were:
*The [[Populism|populist]] reaction to ''Boulangisme'', a  movement led by [[Georges Boulanger]] who almost succeeded in his attempt at a coup d'état in 1889;<ref>Peter Davies, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5dyAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA63  ''The Extreme Right in France, 1789 to the Present: From de Maistre to Le Pen,''] [[Routledge]] 20002 {{isbn|978-1-134-55297-9}} pp. 63–64</ref>
* [[George Sorel]]'s variety of [[Revolutionary syndicalism]], which had a notable impact on currents among Italian anarcho-syndicalists.
* The synthesis of ideas crystallised by the publications of the [[Cercle Proudhon]] around the years 1910–1912.<ref name="ZSA" >Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Naia Asheri, ''Naissance de l'idéologie fasciste', [[Fayard]] 1989 p. 46</ref>

The First World War provided the key circumstances that would prove favourable for transforming these French ideological trends - fascist ideology essentially had been incubated in France, he argued, in the milieu of the 1880s - into a political force in Italy in the aftermath of war.<ref name=rw83>Robert Wohl 1991 p. 83.</ref><ref name="ZSA" /> Historians challenge his view that the key ingredients of fascism were formed in that early period, in France. The essential synthesis was a consequence of World War I, and not specifically French.<ref name=rw83/>

His research has sparked criticism, in particular from French scholars who argue that the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] (1940–1944) was of a more traditional [[conservatism|conservative]] persuasion, although belonging to the far-right, than it was [[counter-revolutionary]], counter-revolutionary ideas being a main characteristic of fascism. [[René Rémond]] has questioned Sternhell's attribution of [[Boulangism]] to the revolutionary right-wing movements. Some scholars say that Sternhell's thesis may shed important light on intellectual influences of fascism, but fascism in itself was not born of a sole [[ideology]] and its sociological make-up and popularity among the working classes must also be taken into account.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wohl |first1=Robert |title=French Fascism, Both Right and Left: Reflections on the Sternhell Controversy |journal=The Journal of Modern History |date=1991 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=91–98 |doi=10.1086/244261 |jstor=2938528|s2cid=143789500 }}</ref>

[[Stanley G. Payne]], for example, remarks in ''A History of Fascism'' that "Zeev Sternhell has conclusively demonstrated that nearly all the ideas found in fascism first appeared in France," though it first developed as a political movement in Italy.<ref>{{cite book |author=Stanley G. Payne |author-link=Stanley G. Payne |title=A History of Fascism |year=1995 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0299148744 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780299148744/page/291 291] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780299148744/page/291 }}</ref>

Sternhell's identification of [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] with fascism has also given rise to debate, in particular his claim that [[Emmanuel Mounier]]'s [[personalism]] movement "shared ideas and political reflexes with Fascism". Sternhell has argued that Mounier's "revolt against individualism and materialism" would have led him to share the ideology of fascism.<ref>See Zeev Sternhell, "Sur le fascisme et sa variante française", in ''[[Le Débat]]'', November 1984, "Emmanuel Mounier et la contestation de la démocratie libérale dans la France des années 30", in ''Revue française de science politique'', December 1984; also John Hellman's  ''Emmanuel Mounier and the New Catholic Left, 1930–1950'', [[University of Toronto Press]], {{isbn|978-0-802-02399-5}}1981. Sternhell was unfamiliar with Hellman's work at the time he wrote his book ''Neither Right nor Left''. See Zeev Sternhell, Preface to the paperback edition, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ccgIu6oYkREC&pg=PA305 ''Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France,''] [[Princeton University Press]], 1996   {{isbn|978-0-691-00629-1}} p.305, n.12</ref>

==Political views==
Sternhell is widely viewed as assuming the mantle worn by predecessors such as [[Jacob Talmon]], [[Yehoshua Arieli]] and [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] as an academic 'keeper at the gate' always prepared to tell the establishment what they are unwilling to see.<ref name="Shavit" /> Sternhell was a long-time supporter of the [[Israeli peace camp]] and had written critically in the Israeli press about the Israeli policy toward the [[Palestinians]].<ref name="Shavit" />

He described himself as [[Liberalism|liberal]].<ref>Daniel Williams, [http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-07-08/news/mn-1354_1_liberal-values NEWS ANALYSIS : Liberalism on Defensive in Once-Receptive Israel], Los Angeles Times, 8 July 1991</ref> Regarding Zionism, Sternhell said in an interview with ''Haaretz'':<blockquote>I am not only a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains the right of the Jews to control their fate and their future. I consider the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.<ref name=Shavit/>
</blockquote>

In ''[[The Founding Myths of Israel]]'' (published in Hebrew in 1995), Sternhell said the main moral justification the Zionists gave for the founding of Israel in 1948 was the Jews' historical right to the land. In the epilogue, he writes:<blockquote>In fact, from the beginning, a sense of urgency gave the first Zionists the profound conviction that the task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was merely a matter of politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews at the beginning of the century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.<ref>{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/338 338]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/338}}</ref></blockquote>

Sternhell argued that after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the threat to the Jews had disappeared, which changed the moral basis for retaining conquests:
<blockquote>No leader was capable of saying that the conquest of the West Bank lacked the moral basis of the first half of the twentieth century, namely the circumstances of distress on which Israel was founded. A much-persecuted people needed and deserved not only a shelter, but also a state of its own. [...] Whereas the conquests of 1949 were an essential condition for the founding of Israel, the attempt to retain the conquests of 1967 had a strong flavor of imperial expansion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/336 336]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/336}}</ref></blockquote>

Sternhell saw Jewish settlement on the West Bank as a wish of religious Zionism and part of labour Zionism, that the more moderate part of labour Zionism was unable to withstand because this wish was in line with deep Zionist convictions. He saw settlements on the West Bank as a danger to "Israel's ability to develop as a free and open society", because they put nationalistic aims over social and liberal aims.<ref  name=foundingmyths345 />

He said something fundamental changed with the [[Oslo Accords|Oslo agreements]]: "In the history of Zionism the Oslo agreements constitute a turning point, a true revolution. For the first time in its history, the Jewish national movement recognized the equal rights of the Palestinian people to freedom and independence."<ref>{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/339 339]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/339}}</ref> He ends the epilogue with: "The only uncertain factor today is the moral and political price Israeli society will have to pay to overcome the resistance that the hard core of the settlers is bound to show to any just and reasonable solution."<ref  name=foundingmyths345>{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/345 345]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780691016948/page/345}}</ref>

In a 2014 interview, Sternhell claimed indicators of fascism exist in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Signs of Fascism in Israel Reached New Peak During Gaza Op, Says Renowned Scholar|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.610368|website=Ha'aretz|access-date=16 May 2018}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Defamation trial===
Sternhell was taken to court by [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]], in 1983, after Sternhell in his work ''Ni droite, ni gauche'' (''Neither Right nor Left''), described him as having been a fascist in the 1930s.  Jouvenel—on whose behalf [[Raymond Aron]] testified, the only intellectual on the anti-totalitarian left to defend his past<ref>Iain Stewart,[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYK0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241 ''Raymond Aron and Liberal Thought in the Age of Extremes,''] [[Cambridge University Press]] 2019 {{isbn|978-1-108-48444-2}} p.241.</ref><ref>Dennis Hale, Marc Landy (eds.,) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TY2f4uOmMZUC&pg=PA33 ''Bertrand De Jouvenel:The Nature of Politics, Selected Essays,''] [[Transaction Publishers]], 1992  {{ISBN|978-1-412-83794-1}} p.33.
</ref>—sued him on nine counts of [[defamation]].  The judge, finding Sternhell liable on two counts, made him make amends with a fine that was more symbolic than punitve, and took care to allow Sternhell to retain the offending passages in future editions of his book, which Robert Wohl states was a 'major defeat' for the plaintiff.<ref>Robert Wohl, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938528  'French Fascism, Both Right and Left: Reflections on the Sternhell Controversy,']. [[The Journal of Modern History]], Vol. 63, No. 1, (1991), pp.91–98, p.91.</ref>

===Settler movement===
Sternhell  was threatened on several occasions for his [[Israeli settlements|anti-settlement views]], including an attempted bombing foiled by police.<ref name="Haaretz back to days">{{cite news|author=Shahar Ilan|author2=Roni Singer-Heruti|date=25 September 2008|title=Dichter: Prof attack takes us back to days of Rabin assassination|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/dichter-prof-attack-takes-us-back-to-days-of-rabin-assassination-1.254609|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref> Haaretz correspondent Nadav Shragai wrote that Sternhell angered Israel's right-wing extremists because some of his statements "justified the murder of settlers by terrorists and tried to foment civil war." For instance, in a 2001 Hebrew op-ed piece, Sternhell wrote: "Many in Israel, perhaps even the majority of the voters, do not doubt the legitimacy of the armed resistance in the territories themselves. The Palestinians would be wise to concentrate their struggle against the settlements, avoid harming women and children and strictly refrain from firing on [[Gilo]], [[Nahal Oz]] or [[Sderot]]; it would also be smart to stop planting bombs to the west of the Green Line. By adopting such an approach, the Palestinians would be sketching the profile of a solution that is the only inevitable one: The amended Green Line will be an international border and territory will be handed over to compensate the Palestinians for land that has already been or will be annexed to Israel."<ref>{{cite news|author=Zeev Sternhell|date=11 May 2001|script-title=he:מול ממשלה סהרורית|language=he|trans-title=Against the Government Sleepwalker|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.700439|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=Shragai>{{cite news|author=Nadav Shragai|author-link=Nadav Shragai|date=26 September 2008|title=Red flag for the right|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/red-flag-for-the-right-1.254658|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref> He similarly wrote in ''Davar'' in 1988 that "Only those who are prepared to take Ofra with tanks can stop the fascist erosion threatening to drown Israel's democracy."<ref name=Shragai/>

==Pipe bomb attack==
On 25 September 2008, Sternhell was the victim of a [[pipe bomb]] attack at his home, and was injured in the leg and hospitalized.<ref name="says_3rd_paragraph_long-time_supporter_of_Peace_Now">{{Cite news|title=Israeli peace advocate attacked|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=3 October 2008|author=Rory McCarthy|date=26 September 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast1 }}</ref> Jerusalem police, who found fliers offering more than 1 million [[shekel]]s (approximately $300,000) to anyone who kills members of [[Peace Now]] at the scene, suspected that he was attacked by right-wing settler extremists for his views. From his hospital bed, Sternhell said that "the very occurrence of the incident goes to illustrate the fragility of Israeli democracy, and the urgent need to defend it with determination and resolve."<ref>[[Philip Weiss]], [https://mondoweiss.net/2008/09/leftwing-israeli-injured-by-pipe-bomb-warns-of-disintegration-of-democracy/?amp 'Wake [Up!

"On the personal level", he continued, "if the intent was to terrorize, it has to be very clear that I am not easily intimidated; but the perpetrators tried to hurt not only me, but each and every one of my family members who could have opened the door, and for that there is no absolution and no forgiveness."<ref name="Haaretz back to days"/> After his release from the hospital, he said he would continue to voice his opinions. [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Bernard Kouchner]] condemned the attack, saying "The assault on Professor Sternhell is an assault on values of peace and brotherhood that served as an inspiration to Israel's founding fathers."<ref name="glickman">{{Cite news|last=Glickman|first=Aviad|title=Prof. Sternhell: I'll continue to voice my views|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|access-date=16 May 2018|date=26 September 2008|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3602507,00.html}}</ref> When the investigation was launched, right wing settler groups made claims that the bombing had been carried out by ''agents provocateurs''.<ref>{{cite news|date=3 October 2008|title=News in Brief|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/news-in-brief-1.254900|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=11 September 2014|quote=The Campaign for Saving the People and the Country claims that the bombing, generally believed to have been carried out by right-wing extremists in response to Sternhell's left-wing political activism, was a provocation aimed at turning public opinion against the settlers to make future evacuations easier.

In October 2009, Israel police arrested [[Yaakov Teitel|Jack Teitel]], a Florida-born Jewish extremist, for the attack on Sternhell. Israel police revealed that Teitel, who apparently acted alone, also admitted to a string of other terrorist attacks and attempted attacks, including murdering a Palestinian taxi driver and a West Bank shepherd in 1997 and an attack on the home of a [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jew]] in the city of [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|date=2 November 2009|title=Israeli Police Arrest West Bank Settler over Palestinian Killings|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/israeli-police-arrest-west-bank-settler-over-palestinian-killings-1.764683|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=11 September 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= Amos Harel|author2=Chaim Levinson|date=2 November 2008|title=U.S.-born Jewish terrorist suspected of series of attacks over past 12 years|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/u-s-born-jewish-terrorist-suspected-of-series-of-attacks-over-past-12-years-1.4973|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref>
