Rice served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States#Secretaries of State|66th]] [[United States Secretary of State|United States secretary of state]] from 2005 to 2009 and as the 20th [[United States National Security Advisor|national security advisor]] from 2001 to 2005. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Rice was the [[List of African-American United States Cabinet Secretaries|first female African-American secretary of state]] and the first woman to serve as National Security Advisor. Until the election of [[Barack Obama]] as president in 2008, Rice and her predecessor, [[Colin Powell]], were the highest-ranking African Americans in the history of the federal executive branch (by virtue of the secretary of state standing fourth in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]). Additionally, Rice was the highest-ranking African American woman in the history of the United States until the inauguration of [[Kamala Harris]] as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] in 2021.

Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up while the South was racially segregated. She obtained her bachelor's degree from the [[University of Denver]] and her master's degree in political science from the [[University of Notre Dame]]. In 1981, she received a PhD from the School of International Studies at the University of Denver.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/condoleezza-rice|title=Condoleezza Rice|work=[[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]|via=stanford.edu|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823022931/https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/condoleezza-rice|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=slate2000>{{cite news |last=Plotz |first=David |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2000/05/condoleezza-rice.html |title=Condoleezza Rice: George W.

W. Bush]] during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[German reunification]] from 1989 to 1991. Rice later pursued an academic fellowship at [[Stanford University]], where she later served as [[Provost (education)|provost]] from 1993 to 1999. On December 17, 2000, she joined the [[George W.

In Bush's second term, she succeeded [[Colin Powell]] as Secretary of State. She was the [[List of female United States Cabinet Secretaries|second female secretary of state]], after [[Madeleine Albright]].

Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of [[Transformational Diplomacy]] directed toward expanding the number of responsible democratic governments in the world and especially in the [[Greater Middle East]]. That policy faced challenges as [[Hamas]] captured a popular majority in [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems (with U.S. backing).

Rice enrolled at the [[University of Denver]], where her father was then serving as an assistant dean.

Rice initially majored in music, and after her sophomore year, she went to the [[Aspen Music Festival and School]]. There, she later said, she met students of greater talent than herself, and she doubted her career prospects as a pianist.

==Academic career==
[[File:condi rice.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Condoleezza Rice during a 2005 interview on ITV in London]]
Rice was hired by [[Stanford University]] as an [[assistant professor]] of [[political science]] (1981–1987). She was promoted to [[associate professor]] in 1987, a post she held until 1993. She was a specialist on the [[Soviet Union]] and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] professor [[George W. Breslauer]] in the mid-1980s.

At a 1985 meeting of arms control experts at Stanford, Rice's performance drew the attention of [[Brent Scowcroft]], who had served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] under [[Gerald Ford]].<ref name="Baker, 20080403">{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Russell|date=April 3, 2008|title=Condi and the Boys|journal=[[New York Review of Books]]|volume=55|issue=5|pages=9–11|issn=0028-7504|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/04/03/condi-and-the-boys/|access-date=March 19, 2008|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823022946/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/04/03/condi-and-the-boys/|url-status=live}}</ref> With the election of [[George H. W. Bush]], Scowcroft returned to the White House as National Security Adviser in 1989, and he asked Rice to become his Soviet expert on the [[United States National Security Council]]. According to [[R. Nicholas Burns]], President Bush was "captivated" by Rice, and relied heavily on her advice in his dealings with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name = "Baker, 20080403"/>

Because she would have been ineligible for tenure at Stanford if she had been absent for more than two years, she returned there in 1991. She was taken under the wing of [[George P. Shultz]] ([[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] from 1982 to 1989), who was a fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]]. Shultz included Rice in a "luncheon club" of intellectuals who met every few weeks to discuss foreign affairs.<ref name = "Baker, 20080403"/> In 1992, Shultz, who was a board member of [[Chevron Corporation]], recommended Rice for a spot on the Chevron board. Chevron was pursuing a $10 billion development project in [[Kazakhstan]] and, as a Soviet specialist, Rice knew the [[president of Kazakhstan]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. She traveled to Kazakhstan on Chevron's behalf and, in honor of her work, in 1993, Chevron named a 129,000-ton supertanker SS ''Condoleezza Rice''.<ref name = "Baker, 20080403"/> During this period, Rice was also appointed to the boards of [[Transamerica Corporation]] (1991) and [[Hewlett-Packard]] (1992).

At Stanford, in 1992, Rice volunteered to serve on the search committee to replace outgoing president [[Donald Kennedy]]. The committee ultimately recommended [[Gerhard Casper]], the provost of the University of Chicago. Casper met Rice during this search, and was so impressed that in 1993, he appointed her as Stanford's [[Provost (education)|provost]], the chief budget and academic officer of the university in 1993<ref name = "Baker, 20080403"/> and she also was granted [[tenure]] and became full [[professor]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Condoleezza Rice |url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/10/15/crice.html |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=October 18, 2001 |access-date=October 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007071435/http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/15/crice.html |archive-date=October 7, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Rice was the first female, first African-American, and youngest provost in Stanford's history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stanford’s New Provost Is First Woman, Black to Hold Position|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-05-20-mn-37447-story.html|work=LA Times|date=May 20, 1993|access-date=November 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=John Hennessy, dean of the School of Engineering, named next provost|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/1999/april14/hennessy-414.html|work=Stanford News|date=April 14, 1999|access-date=November 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice: U.S. national security adviser |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020223173824/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html|archive-date=February 23, 2002|work=CNN|date=February 2002 |access-date=October 27, 2008}}</ref> She was also named a [[senior fellow]] of the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies|Institute for International Studies]], and a senior fellow (by courtesy) of the [[Hoover Institution]].

===Provost promotion===
Former Stanford president Gerhard Casper said the university was "most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations to take on this task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost."<ref>{{cite press release |title=Casper selects Condoleezza Rice to be next Stanford provost |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=May 19, 1993 |url=https://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/930519Arc3267.html |access-date=October 27, 2008 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823022945/https://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/930519Arc3267.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Acknowledging Rice's unique character, Casper told ''The New Yorker'' in 2002 that it "would be disingenuous for me to say that the fact that she was a woman, the fact that she was black and the fact that she was young weren't in my mind."<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Lemann |date=October 14, 2002 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |title=Without a Doubt |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/10/14/without-a-doubt-2 |url-access=subscription |page=181 |access-date=August 17, 2018 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823022946/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/10/14/without-a-doubt-2 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=diplomatic>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/16/local/me-rice16/2 |title=Not Always Diplomatic in Her First Major Post |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 16, 2005 |first=Mark Z. |last=Barabak |access-date=August 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410111510/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/16/local/me-rice16/2 |archive-date=April 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Balancing school budget===
As Stanford's provost, Rice was responsible for managing the university's multibillion-dollar budget. The school at that time was running a deficit of $20 million. When Rice took office, she promised that the budget would be balanced within "two years." Coit Blacker, Stanford's deputy director of the Institute for International Studies, said there "was a sort of conventional wisdom that said it couldn't be done ... that [the deficit] was structural, that we just had to live with it." Two years later, Rice announced that the deficit had been eliminated and the university was holding a record surplus of over $14.5 million.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=James |date=June 9, 1999 |title=Velvet-glove forcefulness: Seven years of provostial challenges and achievements |journal=Stanford Report |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/1999/june9/rice-69.html |access-date=October 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231012218/http://news.stanford.edu/news/1999/june9/rice-69.html |archive-date=December 31, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Special interest issues===
Rice drew protests when, as the provost, she departed from the practice of applying affirmative action to tenure decisions and unsuccessfully sought to consolidate the university's ethnic community centers.<ref name=diplomatic />

===Return to Stanford===
During a farewell interview in early December 2008, Rice indicated she would return to Stanford and the [[Hoover Institution]], "back west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] where I belong," but beyond writing and teaching did not specify what her role would be.<ref>{{cite news |first=George |last=Stephanopoulos |author-link=George Stephanopoulos |date=December 7, 2008 |work=[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]] |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/12/112873.htm |title=Interview on ABC's This Week With George Stephanopoulos |via=state.gov |publisher=[[ABC News]] |access-date=August 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117023437/https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/12/112873.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Rice's plans for a return to campus were elaborated in an interview with the Stanford Report in January 2009.<ref name='stanford_report_2009-01-28'>{{cite web |url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january28/condiweb-012809.html |title=Condoleezza Rice on returning to campus |work=Stanford Report |date=January 28, 2009 |last=Gorlick |first=Adam |access-date=August 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916043908/https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january28/condiweb-012809.html |archive-date=September 16, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> She returned to Stanford as a political science professor and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on March 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Krieger|first=Lisa M.|title=Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice returns to Stanford University|work=[[The Mercury News]]|date=March 1, 2009|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/03/01/former-secretary-of-state-condoleezza-rice-returns-to-stanford-university/|access-date=March 2, 2009|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823022945/https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/03/01/former-secretary-of-state-condoleezza-rice-returns-to-stanford-university/|url-status=live}}</ref> Condoleezza Rice is currently the Denning Professor in Global Business and the Economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business; the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution; and a professor of political science at Stanford University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/condoleezza-rice/|title=Condolezza Rice|last=Rice|first=Condolezza|access-date=5 August 2020|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728201321/https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/condoleezza-rice|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Role in nuclear strategy==
In 1986, Rice was appointed special assistant to the director of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] to work on nuclear strategic planning as part of a [[Council on Foreign Relations]] fellowship. In 2005, Rice assumed office as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Rice played an important role in trying to stop the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran.<ref name="American Life" />

===North Korea===
North Korea signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1985, but in 2002 revealed they were operating a secret nuclear weapons program that violated the 1994 agreement. The 1994 agreement between the United States and North Korea included North Korea agreeing to freeze and eventually dismantle its graphite moderated nuclear reactors, in exchange for international aid which would help them to build two new light-water nuclear reactors. In 2003, North Korea officially withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Rice played a key role in the idea of "[[six-party talks]]" that brought China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea into discussion with North Korea and the United States.<ref name="Twice as good">{{cite book|last1=Mabry |first1=Marcus|title=Twice as good: Condoleezza Rice and her path to power|date=2007|publisher=Rodale|location=Emmaus, Pa.|isbn=978-1-59486-362-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/twiceasgoodcondo0000mabr}}</ref> During these discussions, Rice gave strong talks to urge North Korea to dismantle their nuclear power program. In 2005, North Korea agreed to give up its entire nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and economic benefits to ensure its survival.<ref name="American Life" /> Despite the agreement in 2005, in 2006, North Korea test fired long range missiles. The [[UN Security Council]] demanded North Korea suspend the program. In 2007, Rice was involved in another nuclear agreement with North Korea ([[Pyongyang]]). Rice, other negotiators for the United States and four other nations (six-party talks) reached a deal with North Korea. In this deal North Korea agreed to close its main nuclear reactor in exchange for $400 million in fuel and aid.<ref name="American Life">{{cite book|last1=Bumiller|first1=Elisabeth |title=Condoleezza Rice: An American Life|date=December 11, 2007|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6590-5|edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/condoleezzaricea00bumi_1}}</ref>

===India===
In 2008, Indian prime minister [[Manmohan Singh]] announced the Agreement for Cooperation between the United States and India involving peaceful uses of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. As Secretary of State, Rice was involved in the negotiation of this agreement.<ref name="American Life" />

==Early political career==
In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Rice served as special assistant to the director of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].

From 1989 through March 1991 (the period of the fall of [[Berlin Wall]] and the final days of the [[Soviet Union]]), she served in President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s administration as director, and then senior director, of Soviet and East European affairs in the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and a special assistant to the president for national security affairs. In this position, Rice wrote what would become known as the "[[Chicken Kiev speech]]" in which Bush advised the [[Verkhovna Rada]], Ukraine's parliament, against [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|independence]]. She also helped develop Bush's and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]]'s policies in favor of [[German reunification]]. She impressed Bush, who later introduced her to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], as the one who "tells me everything I know about the Soviet Union."<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Kettmann |author-link=Steve Kettmann |title=Bush's secret weapon |url=https://www.salon.com/2000/03/20/rice_3/ |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=May 20, 2000 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823022953/https://www.salon.com/2000/03/20/rice_3/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1991, Rice returned to her teaching position at Stanford, although she continued to serve as a consultant on the former Soviet Bloc for numerous clients in both the public and private sectors. Late that year, [[California Governor|California governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] appointed her to a bipartisan committee that had been formed to draw new state legislative and congressional districts in the state.

In 1997, she sat on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training in the Military.

During George W. Bush's [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] campaign, Rice took a one-year leave of absence from [[Stanford University]] to serve as his foreign policy advisor. The group of advisors she led called itself [[the Vulcans]] in honor of the monumental [[Vulcan statue]], which sits on a hill overlooking her hometown of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. Rice would later go on to give a [[s:Remarks by Condoleezza Rice at the 2000 Republican National Convention|noteworthy speech]] at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]]. The speech asserted that "... &nbsp;America's armed forces are not a global police force.

On January 18, 2003, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Rice was involved in crafting Bush's position on race-based preferences. Rice has stated that "while race-neutral means are preferable", race can be taken into account as "one factor among others" in university admissions policies.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rice says race can be 'one factor' in considering admissions |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/17/rice.action/ |work=CNN|date=January 18, 2003 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210195456/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/17/rice.action/ |archive-date=December 10, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Terrorism===
During the summer of 2001, Rice met with [[CIA]] director [[George Tenet]] to discuss the possibilities and prevention of terrorist attacks on American targets. On July 10, 2001, Rice met with Tenet in what he referred to as an "emergency meeting"<ref name = "NYTimes-20061002 Tenet">{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Shenon |author2=Mark Mazzetti |title=Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice on Al Qaeda Threat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 2006 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027033848/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html |archive-date=October 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> held at the White House at Tenet's request to brief Rice and the NSC staff about the potential threat of an impending [[al Qaeda]] attack.

Rice characterized the August 6, 2001, [[President's Daily Brief]] ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]'' as historical information. Rice indicated "It was information based on old reporting."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/testimony.htm |date=April 8, 2004 |title=Excerpts from April 8, 2004 Testimony of Dr. Condoleezza Rice Before the 9/11 Commission Pertaining to The President's Daily Brief of August 6, 2001 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |work=[[9/11 Commission]] |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825001321/http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/testimony.htm |archive-date=August 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sean Wilentz of [[Salon magazine|''Salon'' magazine]] suggested that the PDB contained current information based on continuing investigations, including that Bin Laden wanted to "bring the fighting to America."<ref>{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Wilentz |author-link=Sean Wilentz |title=Don't know much about history |url=https://www.salon.com/2004/04/14/rice_12/ |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=April 13, 2004 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527111824/https://www.salon.com/2004/04/14/rice_12/ |archive-date=May 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> On September 11, 2001, Rice was scheduled to outline a new national security policy that included missile defense as a cornerstone and played down the threat of stateless terrorism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Top Focus Before 9/11 Wasn't on Terrorism |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/04/01/top-focus-before-911-wasnt-on-terrorism/a8def448-9549-4fde-913d-b69a2dd2bf25/ |date=April 1, 2004 |work=The Washington Post |first=Robin |last=Wright |access-date=August 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921170408/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/04/01/top-focus-before-911-wasnt-on-terrorism/a8def448-9549-4fde-913d-b69a2dd2bf25/ |archive-date=September 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When asked in 2006 about the July 2001 meeting, Rice asserted she did not recall the specific meeting, commenting that she had met ''repeatedly'' with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats. Moreover, she stated that it was "incomprehensible" to her that she had ignored terrorist threats two months before the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name = "NYTimes-20061002 Tenet"/>

In 2003, Rice received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.multiplyinggood.org/what-we-do/jefferson-awards/past-award-recipients |title=Past Winners |website=Jefferson Awards Foundation |access-date=May 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416061843/https://www.multiplyinggood.org/what-we-do/jefferson-awards/past-award-recipients |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Subpoenas===
In March 2004, Rice declined to testify before the [[9/11 Commission|National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] (the [[9/11 Commission]]). The [[White House]] claimed [[executive privilege]] under constitutional [[separation of powers]] and cited past tradition. Under pressure, Bush agreed to allow her to testify so long as it did not create a precedent of presidential staff being required to appear before [[United States Congress]] when so requested.<ref>{{cite news |title=Transcript of Rice's 9/11 commission statement |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/ |work=CNN|date=May 19, 2004 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418082544/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/ |archive-date=April 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rice was a proponent of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. After [[Iraq]] delivered its declaration of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to the [[United Nations]] on December 8, 2002, Rice wrote an [[editorial]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' entitled "Why We Know Iraq Is Lying".<ref>{{cite news |first=Condoleezza |last=Rice |title=Why We Know Iraq Is Lying |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/opinion/why-we-know-iraq-is-lying.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 23, 2003 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823023012/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/opinion/why-we-know-iraq-is-lying.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In a January 10, 2003, interview with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], Rice made headlines by stating regarding Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's nuclear capabilities: "The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons.

Leading up to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for an incumbent president. She stated that while: "Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the actual attacks on America, Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a part of the Middle East that was festering and unstable, [and] was part of the circumstances that created the problem on September 11."<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Rice defends decision to go to war in Iraq |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ |work=CNN|date=October 22, 2004 |access-date=November 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117054631/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ |archive-date=November 17, 2004}}</ref>

===Speculation on political future===
As early as 2003, there were reports that Rice was considering a run for [[governor of California]], while ruling out running for the Senate in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Security-adviser-Rice-weighs-run-for-governor-2631745.php |last=Marinucci |first=Carla |title=Security adviser Rice weighs run for governor |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 27, 2003 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823023107/https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Security-adviser-Rice-weighs-run-for-governor-2631745.php |url-status=live }}</ref> There was also speculation that Rice would run for the Republican nomination in the 2008 primaries, which she ruled out on ''[[Meet the Press]]''. On February 22, 2008, Rice played down any suggestion that she may be on the Republican vice presidential ticket: "I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office in the United States."<ref>{{cite news |title=Rice says has no plan to run for vice president |date=February 22, 2008 |work=Reuters |access-date=March 28, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2262518020080222?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews&rpc=22&sp=true |quote=I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122032607/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2262518020080222?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews&rpc=22&sp=true |archive-date=January 22, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> During an interview with the editorial board of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' on March 27, 2008, Rice said she was "not interested" in running for vice president.<ref>{{cite news |title=Transcript of Secretary Condoleezza Rice's Interview with the Washington Times Editorial Board |work=The Washington Times |publisher=United States Department of State |date=March 28, 2008 |access-date=March 28, 2008 |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/03/102757.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205075814/http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/03/102757.htm |archive-date=February 5, 2009 |url-status=live }}Question: "And would you consider vice president?"

Republican strategist [[Dan Senor]] said on ABC's ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on April 6, 2008, that "Condi Rice has been actively, actually in recent weeks, campaigning for" the vice presidential nomination.

In August 2008, the speculation about a potential McCain–Rice ticket finally ended when then-Governor [[Sarah Palin]] of Alaska was selected as McCain's running-mate.

In early December 2008, Rice praised President-elect [[Barack Obama]]'s selection of New York [[United States Senate|senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]] to succeed her as Secretary of State, saying "she's terrific". Rice, who spoke to Clinton after her selection, said Clinton "is someone of intelligence and she'll do a great job".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2008/12/rice-on-hillary.html|title=Rice on Hillary: 'She's Terrific'|work=[[ABC News]]|first=George|last=Stephanopoulos |author-link=George Stephanopoulos|date=December 7, 2008|access-date=December 7, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208212642/http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2008/12/rice-on-hillary.html|archive-date=December 8, 2008}}</ref>

Rumors arose once again during the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential race]] that presumptive nominee [[Mitt Romney]] was looking into vetting Rice for the vice presidency. Rice once again denied any such intentions or desires to become the vice president, reiterating in numerous interviews that she "is a policy maker, not a politician."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Condoleezza Rice's thoughts on a vice presidency - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6r4mqNmjXo|access-date=2021-01-13|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Speculation ended in August 2012 when Romney announced that Representative [[Paul Ryan]] was chosen as his running-mate.

According to [[Bob Woodward]]'s 2018 book ''[[Fear: Trump in the White House]]'', then-[[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Reince Priebus]] told then Republican nominee Donald Trump, that he should drop out of the race for the good of the party following the release of the [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape|''Access Hollywood'' tapes]].

===Terrorist activity===
Rice's policy as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] viewed [[counter-terrorism]] as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive. In an interview on December 18, 2005, Rice stated: "We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we're not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest them and you question them. If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks."<ref>{{cite web |work=U.S. State Department |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58232.htm |title=Interview on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace |date=December 18, 2005 |access-date=September 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117024327/https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58232.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rice has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism. In a speech given on July 29, 2005, Rice asserted that "[s]ecuring America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement. We must also confront the ideology of hatred in foreign societies by supporting the universal hope of liberty and the inherent appeal of democracy."<ref>{{cite web |work=U.S. State Department |url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/50375.htm |title=Remarks With Senator Richard Lugar on the U.S. Department of State and the Challenges of the 21st century |date=July 29, 2005 |access-date=June 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232931/http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/50375.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Former Secretary Rice Chats With a Member of the Saudi Royal Family.jpg|thumb|Rice chats with a member of the [[House of Saud|Saudi Royal Family]] after welcoming the new king [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]], January 27, 2015]]

In January 2005, during Bush's [[Inauguration Day|second inaugural ceremonies]], Rice first used the term "[[outposts of tyranny]]" to refer to countries Rice thought to threaten world peace and human rights. This term has been called a descendant of Bush's phrase, "[[Axis of Evil]]", used to describe [[Iraq]], Iran and [[North Korea]]. She identified six such "outposts" in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: Cuba, [[Zimbabwe]], Burma and [[Belarus]], as well as Iran and North Korea.

===Abortion===
Rice said "If you go back to 2000 when I helped the president in the campaign. I said that I was, in effect, kind of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] on this issue. And meaning by that, that I have been concerned about a government role in this issue. I am a strong proponent of parental choice—of parental notification. I am a strong proponent of a ban on late-term abortion. These are all things that I think unite people and I think that that's where we should be.

Rice said she believes President Bush "has been in exactly the right place" on abortion, "which is we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible". However, she added that she has been "concerned about a government role" but has "tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because I believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund" the procedure.<ref name = "4Condi2005"/>

===Female empowerment advocacy===
In March 2014, Rice joined and appeared in video spots for the [[Ban Bossy]] campaign, a television and social media campaign designed to ban the word "bossy" from general use because of its harmful effect on young girls.

=== Same-sex marriage and LGBT issues ===
While Rice does not support same-sex marriage, she does support [[civil union]]s. In 2010, Rice stated that she believed "marriage is between a man and a woman&nbsp;... But perhaps we will decide that there needs to be some way for people to express their desire to live together through civil union."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/07/rices-stance-on-controversial-issues-078489 |first=William |last=Bergstrom |date=July 13, 2012 |title=Rice's stance on controversial issues |newspaper=POLITICO |access-date=January 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411045729/https://www.politico.com/story/2012/07/rices-stance-on-controversial-issues-078489 |archive-date=April 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> When asked to select a view on a survey, Rice selected a response that said "Same-sex couples should be allowed to form civil unions, but not marry in the traditional sense."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Condoleezza_Rice_Civil_Rights.htm|title=Condoleezza Rice on Civil Rights|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=January 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201114418/http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Condoleezza_Rice_Civil_Rights.htm|archive-date=February 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Racial discrimination==
Rice experienced firsthand the injustices of Birmingham's discriminatory laws and attitudes. She was instructed to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of "colored" facilities in town. As Rice recalls of her parents and their peers, "they refused to allow the limits and injustices of their time to limit our horizons."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110605897675528846 |title=Condoleezza Rice's Opening Statement |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 18, 2005 |access-date=September 12, 2018 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823023109/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110605897675528846 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Bush signs Rosa Parks statue bill.jpg|thumb|President Bush signing bill for [[Rosa Parks]] statue at [[Statuary Hall]], Washington, D.C.]]
However, Rice recalls various times in which she suffered discrimination on account of her race, which included being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants.<ref name=ice>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/rice/timeline.html|title=CNN Programs: People in the News|access-date=June 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528193901/http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/rice/timeline.html|archive-date=May 28, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Also, while Rice was mostly kept by her parents from areas where she might face discrimination, she was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of [[Jim Crow laws]] in Birmingham. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith, described how "[Condi] used to call me and say things like, 'Did you see what [[Bull Connor]] did today?' She was just a little girl and she did that all the time. I would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because I wouldn't know what she was going to talk about."<ref name=ice /> Rice herself said of the segregation era: "Those terrible events burned into my consciousness. I missed many days at my segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats."<ref name=ice />

During the violent days of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside. Reverend Rice instilled in his daughter and students that black people would have to prove themselves worthy of advancement, and would simply have to be "twice as good" to overcome injustices built into the system.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1561791.stm |title=Profile: Condoleezza Rice |work=[[BBC News]] |date=September 25, 2001 |access-date=August 2, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628131220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1561791.stm |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> Rice said "My parents were very strategic, I was going to be so well prepared, and I was going to do all of these things that were revered in white society so well, that I would be armored somehow from racism.

Rice was eight when her schoolmate Denise McNair, aged 11, was murdered in the bombing of the primarily black [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Sixteenth Street Baptist Church]] by [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] on September 15, 1963.<ref name=slate2000 /> Rice has commented upon that moment in her life:

{{blockquote|I remember the bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen, and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father's church. It is a sound that I will never forget, that will forever reverberate in my ears.

Rice has appeared four times on the [[Time 100]], [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]]'s list of the world's 100 most influential people. Rice is one of only nine people in the world whose influence has been considered enduring enough to have made the list—first compiled in 1999 as a retrospective of the 20th century and made an annual feature in 2004—so frequently. However, the list contains people who have the influence to change for better or for worse, and ''Time'' has also accused her of squandering her influence, stating on February 1, 2007, that her "accomplishments as Secretary of State have been modest, and even those have begun to fade" and that she "has been slow to recognize the extent to which the U.S.'s prestige has declined."<ref>{{cite news |first1=Elaine |last1=Shannon |first2=Romesh |last2=Ratnesar |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1584810,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204074544/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1584810,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2007 |title=Rice's Toughest Mission: How Condoleezza Rice hopes to bring peace to the Middle East - and salvage the Administration's foreign policy |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 1, 2007 |access-date=September 12, 2018 }}</ref> In its March 19, 2007 issue it followed up stating that Rice was "executing an unmistakable course correction in U.S. foreign policy."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1597226,00.html |title=Cheney In Twilight |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 19, 2007 |access-date=August 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406151439/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1597226,00.html |archive-date=April 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Criticism from Senator Barbara Boxer===
[[California]] Democratic senator [[Barbara Boxer]] has also criticized Rice in relation to the [[war in Iraq]]. During Rice's confirmation hearing for U.S. secretary of state in January 2005, Boxer stated, "I personally believe—this is my personal view—that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27818-2005Jan21.html |title=Why the Crass Remarks About Rice? |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 22, 2005 |first=Colbert I. |last=King |author-link=Colbert I.

On January 11, 2007, Boxer, during a debate over the [[war in Iraq]], said, "Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2007/01/12/barbara-boxer-hits-condi-below-the-belt/ |title=Barbara Boxer hits Condi below the belt |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=January 12, 2007 |access-date=September 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921115658/https://foreignpolicy.com/2007/01/12/barbara-boxer-hits-condi-below-the-belt/ |archive-date=September 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The ''[[New York Post]]'' and [[White House Press Secretary|White House press secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] called Boxer's statement an attack on Rice's status as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer's comments as "a great leap backward for feminism."<ref name="nochildren">{{cite news |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/white-house-spokesman-blasts-sen-boxers-exchange-with-secretary-rice |title=White House Spokesman Blasts Sen.

Boxer responded to the controversy by saying "They're getting this off on a non-existent thing that I didn't say. I'm saying, she's like me, we do not have families who are in the military."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/washington/12cnd-rice.html |title=Exchange Turns Into Political Flashpoint |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 2007 |first1=Helene |last1=Cooper |first2=Thom |last2=Shanker |access-date=August 20, 2018 |archive-date=August 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823023131/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/washington/12cnd-rice.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Conservative criticism===

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in late July 2008, former undersecretary of state and U.N. ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] was referring to Rice and her allies in the Bush Administration whom he believes have abandoned earlier hard-line principles when he said: "Once the collapse begins, adversaries have a real opportunity to gain advantage. In terms of the Bush presidency, this many reversals this close to the end destroys credibility ... It appears there is no depth to which this administration will not sink in its last days."<ref name = "Eggen, WashingtonPost2008">{{cite news |first = Dan |last = Eggen |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/19/AR2008071901597.html |title = U.S. Talks With Iran Exemplify Bush's New Approaches |website = The Washington Post |page = A4 |date = July 20, 2008 |access-date = July 21, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013055423/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/19/AR2008071901597.html |archive-date = October 13, 2008 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Former [[Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] repeatedly criticized Rice after their terms in office ended. In his book ''[[Known and Unknown: A Memoir]]'', he portrayed her as a young, inexperienced academic who did not know her place.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/rummys-still-swinging/|title=Rumsfeld lashes out at John McCain, Condoleezza Rice, and others.

In his book ''In My Time'', [[Dick Cheney]] suggested that Rice had misled the president about nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, saying that she was naïve. He called her advice on the issue "utterly misleading." He also chided Rice for clashing with White House advisers on the tone of the president's speeches on Iraq and said that she, as the secretary of state, ruefully conceded to him that the Bush administration should not have apologized for a claim the president made in his 2003 State of the Union address, on Saddam's supposed search for yellowcake uranium. She "came into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk, and tearfully admitted I had been right," Cheney wrote. Rice responded: "It certainly doesn't sound like me, now, does it?", saying that she viewed the book as an "attack on my integrity."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0901/Condi-Rice-fires-back-at-Dick-Cheney |date=September 1, 2011 |title=Condi Rice fires back at Dick Cheney |first=Husna |last=Haq |website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |access-date=May 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321071828/http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0901/Condi-Rice-fires-back-at-Dick-Cheney |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Views within the Black American community===
[[File:RiceRatings.png|thumb|right|Rice's [[approval rating]]s from January 2005 to September 2006]]

Rice's ratings decreased following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005. Rice's rise within the [[George W.
