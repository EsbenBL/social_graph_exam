'''Victor Witter Turner''' (28 May 1920 – 18 December 1983) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[cultural anthropologist]] best known for his work on [[symbol]]s, [[ritual]]s, and [[rite of passage|rites of passage]]. His work, along with that of [[Clifford Geertz]] and others, is often referred to as [[symbolic anthropology|symbolic and interpretive anthropology]].

==Early life==
Victor Turner was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], son to Norman and Violet Turner. His father was an electrical engineer and his mother a repertory actress, who founded the [[Scottish National Players]]. Turner initially studied poetry and classics at [[University College London]].

In 1941, Turner was drafted into [[World War II]], and served as a noncombatant until 1944. During his three years of service he met and married [[Edith Turner (anthropologist)|Edith Brocklesby Davis]], who was serving during the war as a "land girl". Their five children include scientist [[Robert Turner (scientist)|Robert Turner]], poet [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]], and Rory Turner, an anthropology professor at Goucher College.

Turner returned to University College in 1946 with a new focus on anthropology. He later pursued graduate studies in anthropology at [[Manchester University]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner |first=Edith |year=1990 |chapter=The Literary Roots of Victor Turner's Anthropology |title=Victor Turner and the Construction of Cultural Criticism |url=https://archive.org/details/victorturnercon00ashl |url-access=registration |editor=Kathleen M.

==Career==
Turner worked in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) as research officer for the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]]. It was through the position that Turner started his lifelong study of the [[Lunda people|Ndembu people]] of [[Zambia]]. He completed his [[PhD]] at University of Manchester in 1955. Like many of the Manchester anthropologists of his time, he also became concerned with conflict. He developed the new concept of social drama in order to account for the symbolism of conflict and crisis resolution among Ndembu villagers.

Turner spent his career exploring rituals. As a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] in the late 1950s, Turner began to apply his study of rituals and rites of passage to world religions and the lives of religious heroes. He and his wife converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1958.<ref name="Larsen2014">{{cite book|author=Timothy Larsen|title=The Slain God: Anthropologists and the Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQwbBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA182|date=28 August 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-163205-1|pages=182–198}}</ref><ref name="Thomassen2016">{{cite book|author=Bjørn Thomassen|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDYfDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78|date=6 May 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-10504-6|pages=78–80}}</ref>

Turner explored [[Arnold van Gennep]]'s threefold structure of rites of passage and expanding theories on the [[liminal phase]]. Van Gennep's structure consisted of a pre-liminal phase (separation), a liminal phase (transition), and a post-liminal phase (reincorporation). Turner noted that in [[liminality]], the transitional state between two phases, individuals were "betwixt and between": they did not belong to the society that they previously were a part of and they were not yet reincorporated into that society. Liminality is a limbo, an ambiguous period characterized by humility, seclusion, tests, sexual ambiguity, and [[communitas]].<ref name="vc"/>

Turner was also a committed [[ethnography|ethnographer]] and produced work on ritual. He and his wife Edith L. B. Turner co-authored ''Image and Pilgrimage in Christian Culture'' (1978).

==Death==
Turner died on 18 December 1983 in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]]. After his death, his widow [[Edith Turner (anthropologist)|Edith Turner]] embarked on her own career as an anthropologist. She developed upon Victor's "anthropology of experience" with a publication on communitas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Communitas: The Anthropology of Collective Joy|last = Turner|first = Edith|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan.|date = December 2011|location = New York}}</ref>

==Influence==
Author [[Chuck Palahniuk]] was quoted in ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'' as saying, "So often what I’m doing is dramatizing the writings of Victor Turner, who wrote a lot about liminal and liminoid events."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/201405/?read=interview_palahniuk_spanbauer|title = Issues}}</ref> Turner's work on liminality and performance has strongly influenced developments in the field of [[Performance studies|Performance Studies]],<ref>{{Citation|last=Companion Websites|title=Performance Studies: An Introduction - Victor Turner's Social Drama|date=2012-12-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnsw5xFuXHE|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref> particularly due to his friendship and professional collaboration with [[Richard Schechner]] with whom he explored the relationship between ritual and theater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated/media/methods/performance.html|title=Performance and performativity - a method to study the media and how the abolition of slavery has been commemorated|last=York|first=Institute of Historical Research (IHR), University of London and Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past, University of|website=www.history.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref>
