== Life and education ==
After studying French classical literature, Christian completed his studies in [[anthropology]].  In 1990 he received his doctorate from the [[University of Aix-en-Provence]], France, with a briefing on [[Gilan]] and at the same time he became the chairman of the Association for the Adaptation of Antarctic [[Anthropology]] in the [[Mediterranean]] (affiliated with the CNRS National Center for Scientific Research).  His studies were both in the core French anthropology - [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] [[Structuralism]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]] [[Cultural Studies]]. Therefore, his works are mainly an innovative combination of both [[anthropology]] studies. Since the 1970s, he has been working on a regular basis in [[Iran]], [[Italy]], and southern part of France. He was selected by several universities outside [[France]] as a visiting professor and also has been elected as a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France since 1995.
