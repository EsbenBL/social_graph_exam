'''Jordan Bernt Peterson''' (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian professor of [[psychology]], [[clinical psychologist]], [[YouTube personality]], and author. He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views on cultural and political issues, often described as [[Conservatism|conservative]]. He is considered to be a member of the [[intellectual dark web]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jordan-peterson-and-conservatisms-rebirth-1529101961|title=Jordan Peterson and Conservatism's Rebirth: The psychologist and YouTube star has brought the concepts of order and tradition back to our intellectual discourse|last=Hazony|first=Yoram|date=15 June 2018|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=1 September 2019|archive-date=1 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901043442/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jordan-peterson-and-conservatisms-rebirth-1529101961|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/technology/patreon-hate-speech-bans.html|title=Patreon Bars Anti-Feminist for Racist Speech, Inciting Revolt|last=Bowles|first=Nellie|date=24 December 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=30 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=24 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224213124/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/technology/patreon-hate-speech-bans.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zack |title=Jordan Peterson, the obscure Canadian psychologist turned right-wing celebrity, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life |access-date=3 March 2021 |work=Vox |date=26 March 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Born and raised in [[Alberta]], Peterson obtained [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[political science]] and psychology from the [[University of Alberta]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in clinical psychology from [[McGill University]]. After teaching and research at [[Harvard University]], he returned to Canada in 1998 to permanently join the faculty of psychology at the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1999, he published his first book, ''[[Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief]]'', which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, [[myth]]ology, [[religion]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], and [[neuroscience]] to analyze systems of [[belief]] and [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]].

In 2016, Peterson released a series of [[YouTube]] videos criticizing the ''[[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code]]'' (Bill C-16), passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] to introduce "[[gender identity]] and [[gender expression|expression]]" as a prohibited grounds of [[discrimination]].{{efn-la|name="discrimination"}} He argued that the bill would make the use of certain [[Preferred gender pronoun|gender pronouns]] into [[compelled speech]], and related this argument to a general critique of [[political correctness]] and [[identity politics]]. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.

Afterwards, Peterson's lectures and conversations—propagated especially through [[podcast]]s and YouTube—gathered millions of views. He put his clinical practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his second book, ''[[12 Rules for Life|12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos]]''. Promoted with a world tour, it became a [[bestseller]] in several countries. Throughout 2019 and 2020, Peterson's work was obstructed by health problems in the aftermath of a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. In 2021, he published his third book, ''[[Beyond Order|Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life]]'', and returned to active podcasting.

In 2013, Peterson registered a [[YouTube]] channel named JordanPetersonVideos,<ref name="ytdescription">{{cite web |title=JordanPetersonVideos About page |url=https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanPetersonVideos/about |website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref> and immediately began uploading recordings of lectures and interviews.  The earliest dated recordings are from Harvard lectures in 1996.  By the end of 2013, content on the channel included the lectures from Harvard, some interviews, and additional special lectures on two defining topics: "Tragedy vs Evil" and "Psychology as a career".

From 2014, uploads include recordings from two of his classes at [[University of Toronto]] ("Personality and Its Transformations" and "Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief"),<ref>Psychology Students' Association.

From early 2017, funding for projects dramatically increased through his use of [[Patreon]].  Peterson hired a production team to film his 2017 psychology lectures at the University of Toronto.

A series of live Q&A events, appearing approximately monthly, were released beginning April 2017, through January 2018, then shifting to an irregular schedule through 2019.

=== Self-Authoring Suite ===

In 2005, Peterson, with colleagues Daniel M. Higgins and [[Robert O. Pihl]], established a website and company to deliver an evolving [[writing therapy]] system called The ''Self-Authoring Suite.''<ref>{{cite web |title=Self Authoring Business record |url=https://craft.co/self-authoring |work=Craft.co |access-date=8 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142017/https://craft.co/self-authoring |url-status=live }}</ref> It consists of a series of online writing programs: the Past Authoring Program (a guided [[autobiography]]); two Present Authoring Programs, which aids analysis of personality faults and virtues; and the Future Authoring Program, which aids in developing a vision and planning desired futures.

To understand the statistical benefits of the suite academic trials have been conducted, and several studies published. Peterson states that more than 10,000 students have used the program, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and [[GPA]]s rising by 20%.<ref name="torontolife"/>

The Future Authoring program has been used with [[McGill University]] undergraduates on [[academic probation]] to improve grades, and since 2011 by the [[Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University]].<ref name="selfauth_kamenetz">{{cite news|last1=Kamenetz|first1=Anya|title=Can a Writing Assignment Make You Happier, Healthier and Less Stressed?|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/self-authoring-health-benefits-of-writing|date=December 2013|work=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]|access-date=13 November 2017|archive-date=13 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113165528/http://www.oprah.com/spirit/self-authoring-health-benefits-of-writing|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news|last1=Kamenetz|first1=Anya|title=The Writing Assignment That Changes Lives|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives|date=10 July 2015|work=[[NPR]]|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-date=30 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430171635/https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Academia and political correctness ===
<!--'PC-egalitarianism' and 'PC-authoritarianism' redirect here-->
Peterson suggests that universities are largely responsible for a wave of [[political correctness]] that has appeared in North America and Europe,<ref name="free-speech-crowdfunding" /> saying that he had watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Exposing Jordan Peterson's Barrage of Revisionist Falsehoods About Hitler, the Holocaust and Nazism|language=en|work=Haaretz|url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT-jordan-peterson-s-barrage-of-revisionist-falsehoods-on-hitler-and-nazism-1.8955174|access-date=2021-09-20}}</ref> Peterson believes the [[humanities]] have become corrupt and less reliant on science, in particular sociology. He contends that "proper culture" has been undermined by "post-modernism and neo-Marxism."<ref name="SpecatorLott2017" />

Peterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as [[postmodernism]], [[postmodern feminism]], [[white privilege]], [[cultural appropriation]], and [[environmentalism]].<ref name="AreoZiai" /> His social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote that "few University of Toronto professors in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s have enjoyed the global [[name recognition]] Prof. Peterson has won."<ref name="free-speech-crowdfunding" /> Writing in the ''[[National Post]]'', Chris Selley said that Peterson's opponents had "underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like [[white privilege]] and [[cultural appropriation]], and by the [[marginalization]], shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's [[institution]]s",<ref>{{cite news|last=Selley|first=Chris|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/chris-selley-jordan-peterson-hero-of-the-anti-pc-crowd-just-keeps-winning/wcm/41eae965-36ba-4b9e-a6af-b49d03f7b9b1|title=Chris Selley: Jordan Peterson, hero of the anti-PC crowd, just keeps winning|date=3 June 2017|work=[[National Post]]|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-date=23 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923051748/https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/chris-selley-jordan-peterson-hero-of-the-anti-pc-crowd-just-keeps-winning/wcm/41eae965-36ba-4b9e-a6af-b49d03f7b9b1|url-status=live}}</ref> while [[Tim Lott]] stated, in ''[[The Spectator]]'', that Peterson became "an outspoken critic of mainstream academia".<ref name="SpecatorLott2017" />

According to his study—conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy—of the relationship between political belief and personality, [[political correctness]] exists in two types: "PC-[[egalitarianism]]" and "PC-[[authoritarianism]]", which is a manifestation of "offense sensitivity".<ref name="KaufmanBrophy">{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Scott Barry|author-link=Scott Barry Kaufman|title=The Personality of Political Correctness|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-personality-of-political-correctness/|date=20 November 2016|work=[[Scientific American]]|access-date=13 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927222216/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-personality-of-political-correctness/|archive-date=27 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Jason McBride claims that Peterson places [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] in the former, and so-called [[social justice warrior]]s, who he says "weaponize compassion", in the latter.<ref name="torontolife"/><ref name="C2C16"/> The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and [[Right-wing authoritarianism|right-wing authoritarians]].<ref name="KaufmanBrophy"/>

Peterson holds the view that the concept of cosmic "order" is masculine, while "chaos" is characterised as feminine. He believes that these traits exist inherently and beyond any temporal constraints, not as results of societal or cultural structures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} To Peterson, "culture" is "symbolically, archetypally, mythically male," while "chaos—the unknown—is symbolically associated with the feminine." He has expressed that while it may be considered "unfortunate" that this is the case, any attempt to change or subvert these traits would result in a loss of humanity, saying, "You know you can say, 'Well isn't it unfortunate that chaos is represented by the feminine'—well, it might be unfortunate, but it doesn't matter because that is how it's represented. [...] And there are reasons for it. You can't change it. It's not possible. This is underneath everything. If you change those basic categories, people wouldn't be human anymore. [...] We wouldn't be able to talk to these new creatures."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html |title=Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 May 2018|last1=Bowles|first1=Nellie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/19/jordan-peterson-and-fascist-mysticism/ |title=Jordan Peterson & Fascist Mysticism}}</ref>
==Religious views==
In a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a [[Christians|Christian]]; he responded, "I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIB05YeMiW8 |title=Am I Christian? – Timothy Lott and Jordan B Peterson |work=Jordan B Peterson clips |publisher=YouTube |quote=Interviewer: Quick question, are you a Christian?

Lott also said that Peterson has respect for [[Taoism]], as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits life would be meaningless without this duality.<ref name="SpecatorLott2017" />

Writing in ''Psychoanalysis, Politics and the Postmodern University'', Daniel Burston argues that Peterson's views on religion reflect a preoccupation with what Tillich calls the vertical or transcendent dimension of religious experience but demonstrate little or no familiarity with (or sympathy for) what Tillich termed the horizontal dimension of faith, which demands social justice in the tradition of the Biblical Prophets.<ref>Burston, D. 2020. Psychoanalysis, Politics and the Postmodern University, Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave MacMillan, pp. 152-153.</ref>

In his video posted in October 2020, Peterson mentioned, "...with God's grace and mercy I'll be able to start generating original material once again and pick up where I left off."<ref>{{cite web  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_6zwVNn88o&list=WL&index=5|title='Return Home', Jordan B Peterson Official Channel (7:38)|publisher=YouTube|date=Oct 19, 2020 |access-date=April 3, 2021}}</ref>
