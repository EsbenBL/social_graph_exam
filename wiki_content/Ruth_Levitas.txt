Her book, ''The Concept of Utopia'' (1990), addresses the notion of the ideal society throughout European history. Her follow-on book, ''Utopia as Method: The Imaginary Reconstitution of Society'' (2013), makes the case that 'utopia should be understood as a method rather than a goal.'<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230231962|doi = 10.1057/9781137314253|title = Utopia as Method|year = 2013|last1 = Levitas|first1 = Ruth|isbn = 978-0-230-23197-9}}</ref> She has formulated a program of sociology which is fundamentally utopian-focused in conventional sociological discourse.<ref>Ruth Levitas, Where there is no vision, the people perish: A utopian ethic for a transformed future, CUSP essay series on the Ethics of Sustainable Prosperity | No 5,https://www.cusp.ac.uk/themes/m/m1-5/#1475182667098-0328ae0f-4bcbf2c7-159e13d8-96cc</ref>
