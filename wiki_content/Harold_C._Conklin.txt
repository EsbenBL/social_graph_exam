'''Harold Colyer Conklin''' (April 27, 1926 – February 18, 2016) was an American [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] who conducted extensive [[ethnoecology|ethnoecological]] and [[Linguistics|linguistic]] field research in [[Southeast Asia]] (particularly the [[Philippines]]) and was a pioneer of [[ethnoscience]], documenting indigenous ways of understanding and knowing the world.<ref name="Yale01">{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/seas/Conklin.htm |title=Harold C.

== Early life and education ==

Conklin was born in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] in 1926<ref name=USinAsia>{{cite book |last=Shavit |first=David |title=The United States in Asia: A Historical Dictionary |year=1990 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=108|isbn=978-0-313-26788-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWdZTaJdc6UC&pg=PA108}}</ref> but moved before the age of one to his father's hometown of [[Patchogue, New York]]. Interested in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture from an early age, he was adopted by the [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation|St. Regis Mohawk tribe]] of the [[Akwesasne]] (Mohawk) Nation in 1939, when he was in eighth grade. While in high school, he pursued his interest in anthropology by serving as a volunteer at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] under anthropology curator [[Clark Wissler]].<ref name=AnnRev>{{cite journal |last=Conklin |first=Harold C. |title=Language, Culture, and Environment: My Early Years |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=27 |year=1998 |pages=xiii-xxx |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.27.1.0|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Conklin entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as an undergraduate in 1943, studying with anthropologists [[Robert Lowie]], [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], and [[Edward W. Gifford]], as well as geographer [[Carl O. Sauer]]. He attended Berkeley for one year before being inducted into the [[United States Army]] in July 1944. After serving briefly in [[New Guinea]] and [[Leyte]], he served with the [[158th Infantry Regiment (United States)|158th Infantry Regiment]] on the island of [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=AnnRev />

When [[World War II]] came to an end, Conklin continued serving with the Army in the Philippines until his discharge in August 1946. With the support of the Berkeley anthropology department he remained in the Philippines to conduct fieldwork for a year and a half. In 1947, he traveled to [[Mindoro]] and [[Palawan]] for a linguistic and cultural survey, spending time with the [[Hanunó'o language|Hanunóo]], an upland tribe in Mindoro.  In  [[Manila]], he met with the tropical botanist [[Harley Harris Bartlett]], who instructed him in botanical research and provided him with funds to create an ethnobotanical collection from Palawan.<ref name=AnnRev />

Conklin returned to Berkeley in 1948 and finished his undergraduate work in 1950. He then started graduate school in anthropology at [[Yale University]]. At Yale he studied with [[Floyd Lounsbury]] (who became his dissertation advisor), [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]], and [[Isidore Dyen]], among others. His fellow graduate students included [[William C. Sturtevant]] and [[Charles Frake]], who shared his interest in language, culture, and cognition. He conducted fieldwork among the Hanunóo in Mindoro from 1952 to 1954, completing his dissertation in 1955.<ref name=AnnRev />

== Career overview ==

In 1955, Conklin accepted a teaching position in anthropology at [[Columbia University]]. There he pursued his research interests in language, culture, cognition, kinship, and folk classification. He continued publishing his analysis of the Hanunóo until 1961, when he moved his research to [[Ifugao]] in northern Luzon, where he would make a series of fieldwork trips for the next two decades.<ref name=Folklife>{{cite web |first=Judy |last=Ng |year=2010 |title=Harold C.

Conklin joined the faculty of the Department of Anthropology at [[Yale University]] in 1962. At Yale his research areas included the ethnology and ecology of tropical forested areas of the Pacific Basin.<ref name=Folklife /> Based on his extensive research, Conklin built one of the largest ethnographic collections from the Philippines at Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], where he was Curator of Anthropology from 1974 until his retirement in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/conklin_harold.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603185614/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/conklin_harold.html |archive-date=June 3, 2010 |title=Harold C.
