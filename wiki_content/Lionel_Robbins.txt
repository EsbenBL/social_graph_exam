'''Lionel Charles Robbins, Baron Robbins''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|CB|FBA}} (22 November 1898 – 15 May 1984) was a British [[economist]], and prominent member of the economics department at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He is known for his leadership at LSE, his proposed definition of economics, and for his instrumental efforts in shifting [[Anglo-Saxon economies|Anglo-Saxon economics]] from its [[Alfred Marshall|Marshallian]] direction. He is famous for the quote, "Humans want what they can't have."

==Early life==
Robbins was born in [[Sipson]], west of London, the son of [[Rowland Richard Robbins]] (1872–1960), known as Dick, and his wife Rosa Marion Harris;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA11 |language=en}}</ref> his father was a farmer, a member of [[Middlesex County Council]] involved also in the [[National Farmers' Union of England and Wales|National Farmers' Union]], and the family was [[Strict Baptist]].<ref name="ODNB">{{cite ODNB|id=31612|first=Susan|last=Howson|title=Robbins, Lionel Charles, Baron Robbins}}</ref> His sister [[Caroline Robbins|Caroline]] became a noted Professor of History at [[Bryn Mawr College]].<ref name=caroline>{{cite ODNB|id=72015|first=J. R.|last=Pole|title=Robbins , Caroline (1903–1999)}}</ref>

Robbins was educated at home, at Hounslow College (a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]), and the nearby grammar school, [[Southall County School]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA19 |language=en}}</ref>  He went to [[University College London]] in October 1915, beginning an Arts degree and attending lectures by [[W. P. Ker]], the medievalist [[Francis Charles Montague]], and [[A. F. Pollard]]. Wishing to serve in [[World War I]], he began training in early 1916 at [[Topsham, Devon]].  He was in the [[Royal Field Artillery]] as an officer from August 1916 to 1918, when he was wounded by a sniper on 12 April in the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] and returned home.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |pages=27–48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA27 |language=en}}</ref> 

During the war Robbins became interested in [[guild socialism]], reading in [[G. D. H. Cole]] and by personal contact with Reginald Lawson, a connection from the Harris side of the family.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA41 |language=en}}</ref> Through Clive Gardiner, an artist commissioned by Dick Robbins in 1917 to paint his son's portrait, Robbins met first [[Alfred George Gardiner]], Clive's father, and then his ally the activist [[James Joseph Mallon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |pages=37, 55, 58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA37 |language=en}}</ref> After his convalescence and 1919 demobilisation from the army, Robbins was employed for about a year by the Labour Campaign for the Nationalization of the Drink Trade, a position found with Mallon's help. The campaign was an offshoot of the [[State Management Scheme]] set up during the war, and Robbins worked in [[Mecklenburgh Square]], London for Mallon and [[Arthur Greenwood]].<ref name="ODNB" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |pages=59–60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA59 |language=en}}</ref>

Robbins resumed his studies in 1920 at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). There he was taught by [[Harold Laski]], [[Edwin Cannan]] and [[Hugh Dalton]]. He graduated B.Sc.(Econ) in 1923 with first class honours.<ref name="ODNB"/> Dalton's biographer [[Ben Pimlott]] wrote that Robbins was the "most promising student of his generation at the L.S.E."<ref name="Pimlott">{{cite book |last1=Pimlott |first1=Ben |title=Hugh Dalton |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-41251-0 |page=160 |date=1985 |language=en}}</ref>

==Academic==
After graduation, Robbins found a six-month position as a researcher for [[William Beveridge]], via Dalton.<ref name="Pimlott"/> He had applied successfully to [[New College, Oxford]] for a fellowship in economics, with references from Alfred George Gardiner (shortly to be his father-in-law), [[Theodore Gregory]] and [[Graham Wallas]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=104 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA104 |language=en}}</ref> It was a one-year lecturing position, and he returned to LSE in 1925, again with Dalton's backing, as assistant lecturer, shortly becoming lecturer.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Pimlott"/>

In 1927, Robbins was back at New College, as a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]], but continued to teach at LSE, lecturing on a weekly basis. After the death in 1929 of [[Allyn Abbott Young]], Professor of Economics at LSE, Robbins replaced him in the chair, and moved with his wife to [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. During the 1930s he built up the economics department, hiring [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[John Hicks]] and [[Nicholas Kaldor]].<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Contra Keynes==
Robbins clashed with [[John Maynard Keynes]] in early October 1930, on the Committee of Economists of the [[Second MacDonald ministry]]. It was a small working group chaired by Keynes, apart from the Economic Advisory Council, to consider economic policy in the [[Great Depression]] conditions, comprising also [[Hubert Henderson]] and [[Josiah Stamp]] from the Council, with [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]] and Robbins representing academia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA179 |language=en}}</ref>

Robbins refused to sign a draft by Keynes of proposals including [[tariff]]s, and wanted the chance to submit a [[dissenting opinion|minority report]]. Keynes as chair would not grant the request, given that Robbins was in a minority of one. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA188 |language=en}}</ref> Robbins, who had compared the protectionist views to those of [[Lord Rothermere]] and [[Lord Beaverbrook]], walked out of a meeting, and briefed [[Philip Snowden]] against the report that contained a version of his criticism, considered himself poorly treated. Bad feeling persisted for years between LSE and Cambridge economists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Skidelsky |first1=Robert |title=John Maynard Keynes: The economist as saviour, 1920-1937 |date=1994 |publisher=Papermac |isbn=978-0-333-58499-6 |pages=375–377 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFRAnwEACAAJ&pg=PA375 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pimlott |first1=Ben |title=Hugh Dalton |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-41251-0 |page=162 |date=1985 |language=en}}</ref>

Initially, Robbins was opposed to Keynes's 1936 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]''. His own 1934 treatise on the Great Depression is an analysis belonging to that period of his thought. Later, he accepted the need for [[government intervention]].

==World War II period==
Robbins joined the British government's Central Economic Information Service in summer 1940, from Cambridge to where the LSE had moved. The Service was split into the [[Central Statistical Office (United Kingdom)|Central Statistical Office]] and the Economic Section, which Robbins headed as Director from September 1941.<ref name="Diaries">{{cite book |last1=Robbins |first1=Lionel |last2=Meade |first2=James |title=The Wartime Diaries of Lionel Robbins and James Meade, 1943–45 |date=1990 |publisher=Springer |location=1 |isbn=978-1-349-10840-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5uwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 |language=en}}</ref> The points system devised in 1941 for rationing of clothing, footwear and household goods, by Robbins with Peggy Joseph and [[James Meade]], is considered a successful policy.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=371 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA371 |language=en}}</ref>

From 1942 Robbins worked largely on planning for post-war reconstruction, with Meade.<ref name="Diaries"/> When [[John Boyd Orr]] and [[Frank Lidgett McDougall]] successfully lobbied to put [[food security]] on the agenda of the [[United Nations]], Robbins attended the resulting 1943 conference at [[Hot Springs, Virginia]].<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=441 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA441 |language=en}}</ref> He represented the United Kingdom also at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944, and took part in the negotiation of the 1946 [[Anglo-American loan]]. Over this period he became fully reconciled with John Maynard Keynes.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Post-war, Robbins wrote:

<blockquote>I grew up in a tradition in which, while recognition was indeed given to the problems created by the ups and downs of the trade cycle and the fluctuations of aggregate demand, there was a tendency to ignore certain deep-seated possibilities of disharmony, in a way which, I now think, led sometimes to superficiality and sometimes to positive error. I owe much to Cambridge economists, particularly to Lord Keynes and [[Dennis Robertson (economist)|Professor Robertson]], for having awakened me from dogmatic slumbers in this very important respect.<ref>''The Economic Problem in Peace and War – Some Reflections on Objectives and Mechanisms'', Read Books, 2007 (1st ed. 1947), pp. 68.</ref></blockquote>

==Later life==
The [[Robbins Report]] of 1963 advocated substantial expansion of [[higher education]] in the United Kingdom, taking the line, often called now the "Robbins principle", that [[demand]] from those suitably qualified should drive its development. There was background at the LSE for the view taken, in work of [[Richard Layard]] and [[Claus Moser]], and it drew also on recent ideas of [[Jean Floud]] and [[A. H. Halsey]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandler |first1=Peter |title=The Crisis of the Meritocracy: Britain's Transition to Mass Education Since the Second World War |date=2020 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-884014-5 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyX3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/7 7]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/7|url-access= registration}}</ref> Robbins became the first Chancellor of the new [[University of Stirling]] in 1968. He also advocated major government support for the arts, as well as universities.<ref name="'70s"/>

In later life, Robbins turned to the [[history of economic thought]], publishing studies on English doctrinal history. His LSE lectures, as he gave them in 1980, were later published.

==Views==
Robbins is noted as a [[free market]] economist, and for his [[definition of economics]].

===Influences===
As an undergraduate, Robbins felt he had gained much from [[Philip Wicksteed]]'s ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA98 |language=en}}</ref> Within the earlier British tradition, he admired [[William Stanley Jevons]]'s mastery of [[statistical evidence]], and for theory which he thought had abiding relevance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA288 |language=en}}</ref> Skidelsky takes Robbins to be a possible but in any case rare example of a British continuator of [[John Neville Keynes]] and his ''Scope and Method of Political Economy'' (1891).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Skidelsky |first1=Robert |title=John Maynard Keynes|volume=1, Hopes Betrayed, 1883-1920 |date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan |page=64 note |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6-4zQEACAAJ&pg=PA64 |language=en}}</ref> He corresponded with the American [[Frank Knight]] from 1931 until Knight's death in 1972.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA172 |language=en}}</ref>

===''An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science'' (1932)===
{{details|An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science}}
The definition appears in the ''Essay'' by Robbins as:

:"Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses."<ref>Robbins, ''An Essay on the nature and significance of Economic Science'', p. 15</ref>

After contention in the 1930s, this definition reached some general acceptance among economists. The book has six chapters, and the second half remains controversial.<ref name="Howson214">{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA214 |language=en}}</ref>

The ''Essay'' was influenced by [[Nathan Isaacs]], a close friend from the army, and a paper he had given to the [[Aristotelian Society]] in June 1931.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |pages=35 and 202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA202 |language=en}}</ref> The same month, Robbins sent Isaacs a copy of his inaugural lecture, commenting (in relation to [[business cycle]]s) that its content was out of date through not taking account of work of the Austrians [[Friedrich Hayek]]  and [[Ludwig von Mises]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA176 |language=en}}</ref> Hayek's cycle theory, and [[Jacob Viner]]'s work on the [[balance of payments]] for [[Canada]], both developments of the 1920s, were used as contrasting examples, respectively of new theorisation and the checking of existing theories. Part of the intellectual framework was the insistence of Isaacs on the importance of [[inductive reasoning]], where Robbins relied more naturally on deductions.<ref name="Howson214"/>

===Collectivism===
Robbins came to dislike [[collectivism]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=660 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA660 |language=en}}</ref> His early interest in [[Samuel George Hobson]] and [[G. D. H. Cole]] as proponents of guild socialism led him to join the [[National Guilds League]], but did not last beyond 1920, though he continued longer with socialist views.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |pages=54–55, 74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA54 |language=en}}</ref> He became involved in the [[socialist calculation debate]], taking the side of the [[Austrian School]].

==Honours and awards==
Robbins was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the [[1944 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36544 |date=8 June 1944 |page=2568 |supp=y}}</ref> On 16 June 1959 he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Robbins''', of [[Clare Market]] in the [[City of Westminster]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41740 |date=16 June 1959 |page=3912}}</ref> In the [[1968 New Year Honours]] he was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] (CH).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44484 |date=1 January 1968 |page=25 |supp=y}}</ref>

Robbins received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref> The [[British Library of Political and Economic Science|Lionel Robbins Building]] at the [[London School of Economics]] is named after him. Since 2009 that building has had on the exterior of it an installation art work, ''Blue Rain'', by the American artist [[Michael Brown (artist)|Michael Brown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/exhibitions/a-landmark-library|title=LSE: A Landmark Library|access-date=7 December 2020}}</ref> There is also a Lionel Robbins Building at [[Nottingham Trent University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntu.ac.uk/course/social-sciences/ug/bsc-hons-ug-paramedic-sciencehttps://www.ntu.ac.uk/course/social-sciences/ug/bsc-hons-ug-paramedic-science|title=NTU: Paramedic Science|access-date=7 December 2020}}</ref>

==Works==
The early paper ''The Representative Firm'' (1928) has been considered Robbins's most celebrated article. In its origins a talk to the London Economic Club, it attacked a major concept of [[Alfred Marshall]]. [[Ralph George Hawtrey]] of the Club defended Marshall's ideas in a letter to Robbins, who within weeks submitted a version to Keynes as editor of the ''Economic Journal''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howson |first1=Susan |title=Lionel Robbins |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-50109-5 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZc97n5iL30C&pg=PA155 |language=en}}</ref>

Robbins' 1966 Chichele lecture on the accumulation of capital (published in 1968) and later work on [[Adam Smith|Smithian]] economics, ''The Theory of Economic Policy in English Classical Political Economy,'' have been described as imprecise.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Grampp | first = William D. | title = Robbins on the History of Development Theory | journal = [[Economic Development and Cultural Change]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 539–553 | date = April 1972 | issn = 0013-0079 | doi = 10.1086/450573| s2cid = 154513281 }}</ref>
