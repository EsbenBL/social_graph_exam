"Carolyn Robertson Payton. Newsletter of the Society for the Psychology of Women, Division 35 of the American Psychological Association, Volume 28, Number 3, Summer, 2001.]</ref> Payton's father enrolled her at [[Bennett College]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], in 1941 majoring in home economics and graduated in 1945.<ref name=PCOLWebster>[http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/2016727.html Webster University. "CAROLYN ROBERTSON PAYTON" (1925 - 2001).]</ref> Payton said that Bennett, a small historically Black women’s college, shaped her aspirations, attitudes, and expectations and gave her a sense of her capabilities as a woman.<ref name=PCOLFeminist /> She remained close to Bennett College during her entire life and established a scholarship fund there in the late 1990s.<ref name=PCOLFeminist />

Payton transferred to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] for her M.S. degree in clinical psychology in 1948.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> Under the "separate-but-equal" doctrine, the state of Virginia covered her expenses at the out-of-state school because she pursued a graduate degree in a discipline available to White students at a White state schools, but unavailable to Blacks at a Black state school.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> Payton conducted her masters thesis on the then newly developed [[David Wechsler|Wechsler]]-[[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue]] Test of Intelligence and concluded that the test provided an inaccurate measure of the true ability of Blacks.<ref name=PCOLFeminist />

While at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Payton married Raymond Rudolph Payton, a police detective, but the marriage lasted less than four years and the two divorced in 1951.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> Payton began taking summer courses at Columbia University's teachers college in 1952 and received her Ed.D. in counseling and student administration in 1962.<ref name=PCOLWebster />

==Academic career==
Payton began her first job as an instructor in psychology at [[Livingstone College]] in Salisbury, North Carolina in 1948 and worked there for five years.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> In 1953 she became Dean of Women and a psychology instructor at Elizabeth City State Teachers College (now [[Elizabeth City State University]]) in North Carolina.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> In 1956, Payton became an associate professor of psychology at [[Virginia State College]] in Petersburg, Virginia. Payton was appointed an assistant professor in psychology at [[Howard University]] in 1959.<ref name=PCOLWebster />

After leaving the Peace Corps in 1978, Payton returned to Howard University where she was appointed Dean of Counseling and Career Development and later Director of University Counseling Services.<ref name=PCOLWebster />  As Dean she helped develop an internship-training center. Payton retired from Howard in 1995.<ref name=PCOLWebster />

==Peace Corps==

===Staff member===
Payton started at the Peace Corps as a field assignment officer in 1964<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3812/is_200107/ai_n8980998 The New Crisis. "Carolyn Payton" July/August/2001]</ref> helping prepare trainees to serve in West Africa. Payton traveled extensively for the Peace Corps performing psychological tests, interviews, clinical observations and peer reviews to help determine the conditions that would lead to the most satisfying experience for Peace Corps volunteers.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> In 1966 she was appointed Deputy Country Director for the Caribbean and in 1967 was appointed as Country Director for the Caribbean region supervising 130 volunteers involved in education projects on eight islands in the eastern Caribbean.<ref>[http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/4210.html Washington Post. "Peace Corps' former director Carolyn Payton dies at age 75." April 12, 201.]</ref> At the time she was one of two women who were country directors.<ref name=PCOLWebster />

===Director===
Payton was appointed Director of the Peace Corps by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.<ref name=PCOLWebster /> As Peace Corps Director Payton clashed with [[Sam Brown (activist)|Sam Brown]],  Director of ACTION, which had been created in 1971 by President [[Richard Nixon]] to administer the Peace Corps, [[Volunteers in Service to America]] and other service programs. Brown wanted to "send volunteers for short periods to developing countries and then bring back the skills they had learned to fight poverty in the United States".<ref name=PCOLWebster /> According to Payton, Brown's policy went against the original goals of the Peace Corps and said that Brown was "trying to turn the corps into an arrogant, elitist political organization intended to meddle in the affairs of foreign governments."<ref name=PCOLWebster /> According to Senate testimony<ref name=PCOLSenate>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/~rpc/rva/1032/1032131.htm |title=103d Congress. "BROWN NOMINATION/CSCE Ambassador" May 24, 1994. |accessdate=2007-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970816005931/http://www.senate.gov/~rpc/rva/1032/1032131.htm |archivedate=August 16, 1997 }}</ref> Payton's differences with Brown ended in an argument during a trip to Morocco, when Brown openly berated Dr. Payton before Action Corps officials and later went to her hotel room and pounded on her door for fifteen minutes, demanding to be let in to continue his harassment.<ref name=PCOLSenate />

Payton resigned in 1978 after thirteen months as Director citing, in part, policy differences between ACTION and the Peace Corps saying "as Director, I could not, because of the peculiar administrative structure under which the Peace Corps operates, do anything about this situation. As an ex-director, I am free to sound the alarm."<ref name=PCOLWebster /> After Payton's resignation, President Carter issued an executive order taking the Peace Corps out from under ACTION and making it a fully autonomous agency.<ref>[http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/2203330.html New York Times. "Peace Corps autonomy in Sight, Marking 20th Anniversary." June 20, 1981]</ref>

===Continued connection===
Payton retained her connection to the Peace Corps. In 1981, she spoke about the contribution that volunteers had made around the world, "I think the whole idea of Peace Corps was brought home to me most recently last summer, when there was a terribly damaging hurricane in the Caribbean. Some of the Volunteers who had served with me there were collecting food, clothes and money to send back to the Islanders. Those Volunteers had left the Islands in 1967, but they still had a concern and care about those Islanders. That's what I think is at the heart of the Peace Corps, and that's why the Peace Corps is relevant today."<ref>[http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=resources.media.press.view&news_id=549 United States Peace Corps.
