==Education==
Andersen earned his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago.<ref>[https://www.sais-jhu.edu/walter-andersen Walter Andersen, Senior Adjunct Professor of South Asia Studies], Johns Hopkins University SAIS (2019)</ref> As a part of his field work, he lived in India for four years from late 1960s through early 1970s. There he came in contact with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP, the student wing of RSS). That association led to an introduction to M. S. Golwalker – the head of RSS. His scholarship has focussed on the RSS and Indian politics. He considers Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph as his mentors, states an article in ''[[The Indian Express]]''.<ref name=ie082018>[https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/a-battle-between-hindutva-and-hinduism-is-coming-walter-andersen-rss-5301109/ A battle between Hindutva and Hinduism is coming], Indian Express, Ashutosh Varshney (August 11, 2018)</ref>

== Scholarship of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ==
Andersen, with Sridhar D. Damle, co-authored the 1987 book ''The Brotherhood in Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Hindu Revivalism''.<ref name="AndersenDamle1987">{{cite book|author1=Walter K Andersen|author2=Shridhar D Damle|title=The Brotherhood In Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh And Hindu Revivalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-i1AAAAIAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Avalon Publishing|isbn=978-0-8133-7358-4}}</ref> The book has been called an authoritative, detailed examination of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), including its early growth in the pre-independence period, its organization, the function of its various officers and the evolution of its ideology. "The founders of the RSS concluded that the Hindu social body was weak and disorganized because ''dharma'' was neither clearly understood nor correctly observed."  It was the task of the Sangh's members to create a stable Hindu society and culture.<ref name="Jones">{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Kenneth W. |title=The Brotherhood in Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Hindu Revivalism by Walter K.

The authors avoid categorizing the RSS as having an ideologically loaded framework and treat it with "understanding and objectivity."<ref name="Malik">{{cite journal |last=Malik |first=Yogendra K. |title=The Brotherhood in Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Hindu Revivalism by Walter K.

In 2018, Andersen and Damle co-authored ''The RSS: A View to the Inside''.<ref name="AndersenDamle2018">{{cite book|author1=Walter Andersen|author2=Shridhar Damle|title=The RSS: A View to the Inside|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoxmDwAAQBAJ|year=2018|publisher=Penguin Random House |isbn=978-93-5305-159-4}}</ref> After the book's publication, the Political Science scholar [[Ashutosh Varshney]] remarked that "Andersen is the only scholar who has observed or studied the RSS for nearly five decades".<ref name=ie082018/> According to Andrew Nathan, Andersen and Damle "take an exceptionally well-informed look at the RSS, including its relations with affiliate organizations", and discuss how the "core concept of [[Hindutva]], or “Hinduness,” is now glossed as loyalty to a vaguely defined Indian civilization rather than adherence to specific religious practices, a revision made easier by the unsystematic character of Hindu beliefs" while still "espousing aggressive anti-Muslim and socially conservative positions".<ref>[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2019-02-12/rss-view-inside The RSS: A View to the Inside by Walter K. Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle], Reviewed by Andrew J. Nathan, Foreign Affairs (March/April 2019)</ref> Andersen calls the book as a sequel to ''The Brotherhood in Saffron'' book published in 1987, and one that presents the significant changes in India and the RSS since 1987. According to Andersen, the RSS has formed and grown over a hundred affiliated organizations to help penetrate nearly every part of India. These affiliates now play an active role in lobbying the policy processes.<ref>[https://casi.sas.upenn.edu/iit/walterandersen The RSS: A View to the Inside] Walter Andersen, India in Transition, Center for the Advanced Study of India, University of Pennsylvania (May 20, 2019); The article also appeared in [https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/is-rss-still-a-cultural-organisation/article27198964.ece The Hindu newspaper on May 21 2019]</ref>
