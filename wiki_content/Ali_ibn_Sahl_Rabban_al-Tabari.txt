His famous student [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] has darkened his fame. He wrote the first encyclopedic work on medicine. He lived for over 70 years and interacted with important figures of the time, such as Muslim caliphs, governors, and eminent scholars. Because of his family's religious history, as well as his religious work, al-Tabarī was one of the most controversial scholars.

The [[Abbassid]] caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] (833–842) took him into the service of the court, which he continued under [[al-Mutawakkil]] (847–861). Ali ibn Sahl was fluent in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], the two sources for the medical tradition of [[ancient history|antiquity]], and versed in fine calligraphy.

== His works ==
Although few of them are still found today, Al-Tabarī left 12 books to mankind. Most of them were about medicine. In addition to medicine, he was known as a scholar of philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.<ref>Reddy, D. V. Subba, "Indian Medicine in Firdausu'l-hikmat of Ali Raban-al-Tabarī," Bulletin of the Departmen of History of Medicine, I (1963), pp. 26-49.</ref>
# His ''Firdous al-Hikmah'' (''"Paradise of Wisdom"''), which he wrote in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] called also ''Al-Kunnash'' was a system of medicine in seven parts. He also translated it into Syriac, to give it wider usefulness. The information in ''Firdous al-Hikmah'' has never entered common circulation in the West because it was not edited until the 20th century, when Mohammed Zubair Siddiqui assembled an edition using the five surviving partial manuscripts. There is still no English translation.  A German translation by Alfred Siggel of the chapters on Indian medicine was published in 1951.<ref name=siggel>{{cite book|last1=Siggel|first1=Alfred|title=Die indischen Bücher aus dem Paradies der Weisheit über die Medizin des' Alī ibn Sahl Rabban al-Ṭabarī.
