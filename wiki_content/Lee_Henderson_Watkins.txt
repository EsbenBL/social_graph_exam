'''Lee Henderson Watkins''' (1908–1972) was born in 1908. He was an amateur [[apiculture|apiculturist]] and [[anthropology|anthropologist]], member of the AAA, president of the [[Alameda County Beekeepers' Association]] (ACBA) from 1949–1951,<ref name="Manuscript Collection"/> and eventually emeritus apiarist of the [[University of California, Davis]].<ref name="Beekeeping In California"/>

==Biography==
Growing up in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] in California, he attended the common schools of [[Selma, California]], in [[Fresno County]]. His father was a [[beekeeper]] who taught the craft to his sons which became an inspiration for Watkin's great interest in agriculture and apiculture.  Lee was also an avid enthusiast of running (especially sprinting) and enjoyed participating and watching track throughout his life.<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/>

Watkins spent a short but meaningful time in the [[Protestant Church]] where he over indulged in proselytization before abruptly ending his relationship with organized religion, indicated by his personalized moniker for the organization as 'Two-seed-in-the-spirit-predestinarian-Baptists.'<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/>

Watkins studied at both [[Fresno State College]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], though never received a degree from either but remained a lifelong academic.  His anthropological mentors were [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Paul Radin]], and [[Frederick Teggart]].  He was well respected within his field for his research, writing, and lectures. He informally remained at U.C. Berkeley studying anthropology and apiculture under his mentors. He was employed as an apiary assistant in the Department of [[Entomology]] at the University of California, Davis and studied the history of science, the history of technology, and the history of agriculture and [[ethnohistory]].<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/> Watkins is known for perpetually refuting that the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] had kept bees before [[Christopher Columbus]]. After his retirement from the Department of Entomology, he traveled the nation gathering notes, publications, and interviews, developing a wide breadth of knowledge on pioneer beekeepers.<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/>

==Personal life and death==
He had two children, Sanine and Phillip with his wife, Millicent Saylor, a librarian and school teacher.<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/> He and his wife were active participants in the women's rights movement. He served a term as the Chairman of the [[Yolo County]] [[Grand Jury]] and was one of the people instrumental in founding the Sacramento-Davis branch of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ALCU) and felt a strong sense of duty to the plight of migrant farm workers and prisoner.<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/>

Lee H. Watkins died on April 6, 1972.<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/>

==Legacy==
"His work in the field of agricultural, which is neglected by most anthropologists, can be seen in specialized journals and is greatly valued. Watkins retained the anthropological approach in everything he did, having a vast impact on women's rights, civil liberties, and agricultural history."<ref name="American Anthropologist Obituary"/>
