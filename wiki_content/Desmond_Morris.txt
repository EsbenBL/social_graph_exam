'''Desmond John Morris''' [[Linnean Society of London|FLS ''hon. caus.'']] (born 24 January 1928) is an English [[Zoology|zoologist]], [[Ethology|ethologist]] and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painter, as well as a popular author in human [[sociobiology]]. He is known for his 1967 book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'', and for his television programmes such as ''Zoo Time''.

==Early life==
Morris was born in [[Purton]], [[Wiltshire]], to Marjorie (née Hunt) and children's fiction author Harry Morris. In 1933, the Morrises moved to [[Swindon]] where Desmond developed an interest in [[natural history]] and writing. He was educated at [[Dauntsey's School]], a boarding school in Wiltshire.<ref name="dmbiography">{{cite web| author=Williams, D.| title=Desmond Morris Biography| url=http://www.desmond-morris.com/biography.php| publisher=Desmond-morris.com| access-date=28 November 2012| archive-date=29 February 2012| archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65pFcIDzI?url=http://www.desmond-morris.com/biography.php| url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1946, he joined the [[British Army]] for two years of [[national service]], becoming a lecturer in [[fine arts]] at the [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Army College]] in [[Wiltshire]]. After being demobilised in 1948, he held his first one-man show of his own paintings at the [[Swindon Arts Centre]], and studied [[zoology]] at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1950 he held a surrealist art exhibition with [[Joan Miró]] at the London Gallery. He held many other exhibitions in later years.<ref name="dmbiography"/> Also in 1950, Desmond Morris wrote and directed two surrealist films, ''Time Flower'' and ''The Butterfly and the Pin''. In 1951 he began a doctorate at the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford]] in [[animal behaviour]].<ref name="dmbiography"/> In 1954, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] for his work on the reproductive behaviour of the [[ten-spined stickleback]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/24/the-naked-ape-at-50-desmond-morris-four-experts-assess-impact|title=The Naked Ape at 50|last=Dunbar|first=Robin|date=24 September 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=19 July 2019|archive-date=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102084748/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/24/the-naked-ape-at-50-desmond-morris-four-experts-assess-impact|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
Morris stayed at Oxford, researching the reproductive behaviour of birds. In 1956 he moved to London as Head of the [[Granada TV]] and Film Unit for the [[Zoological Society of London]], and studied the picture-making abilities of apes.<ref name="dmbiography"/> The work included creating programmes for film and television on animal behaviour and other zoology topics. He hosted Granada TV's weekly ''Zoo Time'' programme until 1959, scripting and hosting 500 programmes, and 100 episodes of the show ''Life in the Animal World'' for [[BBC Two|BBC2]].<ref name="dmbiography"/> In 1957 he organised an exhibition at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London, showing paintings and drawings composed by [[common chimpanzee]]s. In 1958 he co-organised an exhibition, ''The Lost Image'', which compared pictures by infants, human adults, and apes, at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London. In 1959 he left ''Zoo Time'' to become the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]'s Curator of Mammals.<ref name="dmbiography"/> In 1964, he delivered the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''Animal Behaviour''. In 1967 he spent a year as executive director of the London [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]].<ref name="dmbiography"/>

Morris's books include ''[[The Naked Ape|The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal]]'',{{sfn|Morris|1967|p=}} published in 1967. The book sold well enough for Morris to move to [[Malta]] in 1968 to write a sequel and other books. In 1973 he returned to Oxford to work for the ethologist [[Niko Tinbergen]].<ref>[[Horace Romano Harré|Harré, R.]] (2006). "Chapter 5: The Biopsychologists".

==Personal life==
Morris's father suffered lung damage in [[World War I]], and died when Morris was 14. His mother would not let him attend the funeral and he was sent off to friends in the countryside. He later said, "It was the beginning of a lifelong hatred of the establishment. The church, the government and the military were all on my hate list and have remained there ever since."<ref>{{cite news | title=My family values: Desmond Morris interview | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/01/desmond-morris-family-values | access-date=28 November 2012 | first=Alice | last=Douglas | date=1 November 2008 | archive-date=12 December 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212094442/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/01/desmond-morris-family-values | url-status=live }}</ref> His grandfather William Morris, an enthusiastic [[Victorian era|Victorian]] naturalist and founder of the Swindon local newspaper,<ref name="dmbiography"/> greatly influenced him during his time living in Swindon.

== Criticism ==
Some of Morris's theories have been criticized as untestable. For instance, geneticist Adam Rutherford writes that Morris commits "the scientific sin of the 'just-so' story – speculation that sounds appealing but cannot be tested or is devoid of evidence".{{sfn|Rutherford|2019|p=71}} However, this is also a [[The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm|criticism of adaptationism in evolutionary biology]], not just of Morris.

Morris is also criticised for stating that [[gender role]]s have a deep evolutionary rather than cultural background.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Stephen |title='We'd be better off if women ran everything' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/18/scienceandnature.science |work=The Guardian |date=18 December 2007 |access-date=1 December 2016 |archive-date=2 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202102907/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/18/scienceandnature.science |url-status=live }}</ref>
