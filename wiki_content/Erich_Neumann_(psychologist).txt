'''Erich Neumann''' ({{lang-he|אריך נוימן}}; 23 January 1905 – 5 November 1960),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.erelshalit.com/2014/07/gershom-scholem-obituary-for-erich.html|title=Erel Shalit: Gershom Scholem: Obituary for Erich Neumann|website=www.erelshalit.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref> was a [[psychologist]], philosopher, writer, and student of [[Carl Jung]].

==Career==

Neumann was born in [[Berlin]] to a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family.<ref name="Paglia">{{cite web| title = Erich Neumann: Theorist of the Great Mother| url = http://www.bu.edu/arion/files/2010/03/Paglia-Great-Mother1.pdf| access-date = December 30, 2018| date = 2006| author = Camille Paglia| author-link = Camille Paglia}}</ref>
He received his PhD in Philosophy from the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] in 1927 and then continued to study medicine at the [[University of Berlin]], where he acquired his first degree in medicine in 1933. In 1934 Neumann and his wife Julie, who had been [[Zionism|Zionists]] since they were teenagers, spurred on by fear of persecution of Jews by the [[Nazi government]], moved to [[Tel Aviv]].<ref name="Paglia" /> For many years, he regularly returned to [[Zürich]], Switzerland to give lectures at the [[C. G. Jung Institute]].  He also lectured frequently in England, France and the Netherlands, and was a member of the [[International Association for Analytical Psychology]] and president of the Israel Association of Analytical Psychologists. He practiced [[analytical psychology]] in [[Tel Aviv]] from 1934 until his death from [[kidney cancer]] in 1960.<ref name="Paglia" />

==Contributions==

Neumann contributed to the field of [[developmental psychology]] and the psychology of [[consciousness]] and [[creativity]].  He had a theoretical and philosophical approach to analysis, contrasting with the more clinical concern in England and the United States. His most valuable contribution to psychology was the empirical concept of "centroversion", a synthesis of [[Extraversion and introversion|extra- and introversion]]. However, he is best known for his theory of [[Femininity|feminine]] development, a theory formulated in numerous publications, most notably ''[[The Great Mother]]''. His works also elucidate the way [[mythology]] throughout history reveals aspects of the development of consciousness that are parallel in both the individual and society as a whole.

==Works==

His most enduring contributions to Jungian thought are ''[[The Origins and History of Consciousness]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Great Mother]]'' (1955).<ref name="Hopcke">{{cite book |author=Hopcke, Robert H. |title=Jung, Jungians and Homosexuality |url=https://archive.org/details/jungjungianshomo00hopcrich |url-access=registration |publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc |location=Boston |year=1989 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jungjungianshomo00hopcrich/page/70 70] |isbn=0-87773-585-9}}</ref> Another work, ''Depth Psychology and a New Ethic'', reflects on human destructiveness and the way the human mind relates to its own shadow.

Neumann further developed his studies in feminine archetypes in his ''Art and the Creative Unconscious'', ''The Fear of the Feminine'', and ''Amor and Psyche''.

Neumann also wrote poetry, a novel called ''The Beginning'' (''Der Anfang''), and in 1932 conducted a critical study of [[Franz Kafka]]'s works at a time when Kafka was still a minor figure in the literary world.<ref name="Paglia" />
