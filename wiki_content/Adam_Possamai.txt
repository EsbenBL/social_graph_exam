==Contributions to Academia==
A large portion of Possamai's published work is premised on a [[Max Weber|neo-Weberian]] approach to the sociology of religion and popular culture. His contributions to the study of religion and popular culture are being acclaimed as significant works.<ref>Review: Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament by [[Gary Bouma]] http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ARSR/article/viewArticle/4643</ref> In exploring the manner in which the internet has become a source of religious inspiration (as well as a forum for religious expression), Possamai has discussed the emergence of what he dubs "hyper-real religions". This is an entirely new theoretical framework for conceptualising [[consumerism]] in [[religion]] in the context of [[globalization]].<ref>God.com: Preaching the Word in a consumer-driven world {{cite web|url=http://pubapps.uws.edu.au/news/index.phtml?act%3Dview%26story_id%3D1342 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706120736/http://pubapps.uws.edu.au/news/index.phtml?act=view&story_id=1342 |archivedate=6 July 2011}}</ref> He detects a synergy between various stories and icons of popular culture and the role of the individual to create a new religious message. Possamai explores the intersection between [[late modernity]] and [[spirituality]], noting the emphasis on the authority of the self replacing external forms of conventional [[religious authority]] (such as authority vested in [[imams]], [[priests]] and [[rabbis]], or in communally interpreted [[sacred texts]]). Hyper-real religions constitute new forms of [[spirituality]] where [[traditional]] and [[Modern history|modern]] religious ideas are [[Consumption (sociology)|consumed]] and projected into completely [[wikt:reconstruction|reconstructed]] forms. Examples cited by Possamai include the [[Church of All Worlds]], [[the Church of Satan]], and Jedi religion ([[Jediism]], see also [[Jedi census phenomenon]]). Carole Cusack in her book ''Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith'' stated that "Adam Possamai,... to date is the only sociologist of religion (indeed the only scholar) to examine it [Jediism] in any detail prior to this study" (p 124).<ref>Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith - Carol Cusack (2010) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289968682_Invented_religions_imagination_fiction_and_faith</ref> His work also considers the complex interplay between [[fundamentalist]] [[Christians|Christian]] groups that resist the [[synergy]] between popular culture and religion (as in the phenomenon of [[Harry Potter]], [[fantasy]]-[[role playing games]]), and yet [[reappropriate]] aspects of pop culture to promote fundamentalism.<ref>Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament {{cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=14609&concordeid=29272 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715065820/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=14609&concordeid=29272 |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}</ref>

The second area of scholarly innovation is found in Possamai's work on New Age spirituality. On the basis of both field research in alternative spirituality festivals and new theoretical approaches, Possamai has contested the scholarly ''status quo'' in the interpretation and classification of New Age spirituality. His field research demonstrates that very few practitioners of what scholars call [[New Age]], actually accept the term. He argues that the term New Age is imprecise and the previous scholarly conceptualisations of New Age are either limited or misleading. In his new schema, New Age spirituality is but one facet of a much wider cultural phenomenon that he has dubbed a perennist spirituality. It follows that by culturally consuming selected practices, myths, and teachings from pre-modern times, and then reframing them for the contemporary scene, seekers aspire to personal transformation and perhaps resolving global woes.

At the heart of this conceptualisation of reality lies a commitment to what Possamai has dubbed "perennism", the notion that a [[holistic]] understanding of truth is accessible in [[esoteric]] wisdom or [[gnosis]] that is unfettered by the [[dogmas]] of the world's religions. According to Possamai, the key features of perennism are that in this [[syncretic]] spirituality the cosmos is interpreted as a [[monistic]] reality, which partakes of a single unifying being, or principle, and all parts of the cosmos are inter-related to this ultimate reality. Those who participate in this spirituality are engaged in [[self-development]] to attain their [[potential]], and they pursue spiritual knowledge of both self and ultimate reality.<ref>In Search of New Age Spiritualities https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315252490</ref>
