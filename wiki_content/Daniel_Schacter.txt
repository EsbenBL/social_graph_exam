'''Daniel Lawrence Schacter''' (born June 17, 1952) is an American [[Psychology|psychologist]]. He is a [[Professor]] of Psychology at [[Harvard University]].  His research has focused on psychological and biological aspects of human [[memory]] and [[amnesia]], with a particular emphasis on the distinction between conscious and nonconscious forms of memory and, more recently, on brain mechanisms of memory and brain distortion, and memory and future simulation.

==Early life==
Schacter received his B.A. from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1974, M.A. and Ph.D. from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1977 and 1981 respectively. His Ph.D. thesis was supervised by [[Endel Tulving]]. In 1978, he was a visiting researcher at the [[University of Oxford]]'s Department of Experimental Psychology. He has also studied the effects of aging on memory.

==Research==
Professor Schacter's research uses both cognitive testing and brain imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. Schacter has written three books, edited seven volumes, and published over 200 scientific articles and chapters.  His books include: ''Searching for Memory: The Brain, the Mind, and the Past'' (1996); ''Forgotten ideas, neglected pioneers: [[Richard Semon]] and the story of memory.'' (2001);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/article/152111 |title=How Memory Works: Interview with Psychologist Daniel L. Schacter |publisher=[[History News Network]] |author=Robin Lindley |archive-date=September 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907073517/http://hnn.us/article/152111 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers'' (2001).

In ''[[The Seven Sins of Memory]]: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers'', Schacter identifies seven ways ("sins") that memory can fail us.  The seven sins are: Transience, Absent-Mindedness, Blocking, Misattribution, Suggestibility, Persistence, and Bias.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins.html|title=The seven sins of memory|website=apa.org}}</ref>

In addition to his books, Schacter publishes regularly in scientific journals. Among the topics that Schacter has investigated are: [[Alzheimer's disease]], the [[neuroscience]] of memory, age-related memory effects, issues related to [[false memory]], and memory and simulation. He is widely known for his integrative reviews, including his seminal review of [[implicit memory]] in 1987.

In 2012 he said in an interview to the [[American Psychologist]] journal that our brain is like a [[Time travel|time machine]], or to be precise, it works as a [[Simulated reality|virtual reality simulator]]. He also said that our brain can imagine the [[future]] but it has difficulty in retracting the past.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/making-sense-of-memory/ |title=Making sense of memory |author=Taylor Beck |publisher=[[Harvard Gazette]] |date=August 16, 2012 |access-date=June 13, 2014 |archive-date=September 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923021500/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/making-sense-of-memory/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
