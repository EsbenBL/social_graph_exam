Kohr was planning to return to his hometown of Oberndorf to live when he died in 1994.  His ashes were buried in Oberndorf.<ref name="LKA-bio"/> Salzburg journalist Gerald Lehner completed a biography of Kohr, based in part on long audiotaped interviews, in 1994.<ref name="Lehner"/>

Kohr has been described as a charming conversationalist and a witty, elegant debunker of popular assumptions.<ref name="Illich"/>  Author [[Ivan Illich]] describes him as "a funny bird—meek, fey, droll, and incisive", as well as "unassuming" and even "radically humble."<ref name="Illich">[http://www.schumachersociety.org/publications/illich_94.html The Wisdom of Leopold Kohr], Ivan Illich, Fourteenth Annual E.

==Philosophy==

Kohr described himself as a "[[philosophical anarchist]]." Kohr protested against the "cult of bigness" and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life. He argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation. His vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control.<ref name="rightlivelihood"/>

In his first published essay "Disunion Now: A Plea for a Society based upon Small Autonomous Units", published in [[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]] in 1941, Kohr wrote about a Europe at war: "We have ridiculed the many little states, now we are terrorized by their few successors." He called for the breakup of Europe into hundreds of city states.<ref name="Sale-foreward"/>  Kohr developed his ideas in a series of books, including ''The Breakdown of Nations'' (1957), ''Development without Aid'' (1973) and ''The Overdeveloped Nations'' (1977).<ref name="rightlivelihood"/>

From Leopold Kohr's most popular work ''The Breakdown of Nations'':

<blockquote>... there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery: bigness. Oversimplified as this may seem, we shall find the idea more easily acceptable if we consider that bigness, or oversize, is really much more than just a social problem. It appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation. Whenever something is wrong, something is too big.  ... And if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression, brutality, collectivism, or massive idiocy, it is not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement. It is because human beings, so charming as individuals or in small aggregations, have been welded into overconcentrated social units.</blockquote>

Kohr was an important inspiration to the [[Green movement|Green]], [[Bioregionalism|bioregional]], [[Fourth World]], [[Decentralization|decentralist]], and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movements, Kohr contributed often to [[John Papworth]]'s `Journal for the Fourth World', [[Resurgence & Ecologist|Resurgence]]. One of Kohr's students was economist [[E. F. Schumacher]], another prominent influence on these movements, whose [[bestseller|best selling]] book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' took its title from one of Kohr's core principles.<ref name="NYT-Obit"/> Similarly, his ideas inspired [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]'s books ''Human Scale'' (1980) and ''Dwellers in the Land: The Bioregional Vision'' (1985). Sale arranged the first American publication of ''The Breakdown of Nations'' in 1978 and wrote the foreword.<ref name="Sale-foreward"/>
