'''George Jerome Waldo Goodman''' (August 10, 1930 – January 3, 2014) was an American author and economics broadcast commentator, best known by his pseudonym '''Adam Smith''' (which was assigned by Clay Felker at ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in order to keep his published articles about Wall Street anonymous). He also wrote fiction under the name "George Goodman".

==Background, education, and career==
Goodman was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the son of Alexander Mark Goodman and Viona Cremer Goodman. He attended [[Harvard College]], graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]'', and served as an editor of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. Goodman won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he read for the B. Litt. His first novel, ''The Bubble Makers'', published simultaneously in the UK and the United States, was written during this period.

In 1954, before the Special Forces became the Green Berets, he joined the [[US Army Special Forces]] in the Intelligence group known as [[Psywar]] (psychological warfare).  In 1961, Goodman married American actress [[Sally Brophy]].  They eventually had two children before her death in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=845675&ocid=rr-tv-news |title=George Goodman, aka TV's "Adam Smith," dies at 83 |access-date=January 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104210934/http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=845675&ocid=rr-tv-news |archive-date=January 4, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

His personal style of presenting economic facts and data has been described as that of "a witty, urbane dinner guest, a droll observer of human affairs", rather than a stodgy economics.<ref>{{cite web

In 1984, Goodman came to television as the creator, [[News presenter|anchor]] and editor-in-chief of ''[[Adam Smith's Money World]]''. Running on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] in the US, it became the most honored program in its field, winning eight [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations and five Emmy Awards, as well as the [[Overseas Press Club]] Award. The documentary specials won gold medals at the [[Houston International Film Festival]] and the Flagstaff Film Festival. The show used cartoon characters and reports from the field to explain and simplify complex financial subjects to its audience. Airing in over forty countries, it was also the first American business news show broadcast in the [[Soviet Union]], airing weekly with a Russian soundtrack.

==Recent work==
Beginning in 1998 Goodman traveled the globe each year doing specials on countries and regions with fast-growing or [[emerging economies]] such as China, Russia, the [[Pacific Rim]], Latin America, India, and Israel. Goodman has also conducted interviews with leaders in both the fields of business and politics—ranging from [[Warren Buffett]] to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

Beginning March 10, 2008, Goodman appeared along with two other [[Personal finance|personal finance advisers]] in the "Dollars and Sense" television advertising campaign for the [[Hyundai Motor Company]].<ref>{{cite web
