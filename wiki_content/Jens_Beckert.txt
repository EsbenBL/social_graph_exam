== Research ==

===Economies as social orders within societies===
Jens Beckert’s current work at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies reflects a research program he has developed with his codirector [http://www.mpg.de/404373/gesellschaftsforschung_wissM1 Wolfgang Streeck] which “proposes to invest in a ''theory of social action'' as the most promising approach to a deeper understanding and an improved theorization of the economy as a socially and politically constituted system of action.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Program of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies |url=http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/forschprogramm_en.asp |access-date=24 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124002713/http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/forschprogramm_en.asp |archive-date=24 January 2015 }}</ref>

“Any economy is socially and politically constructed. The way it is socially embedded reflects both prevailing systems of meaning and the results of political ‘market struggles’ over social regulation. Investigating institutional regulation of the economy requires studying how economies are constituted as social orders within societies.”<ref>{{cite web|title=J. Beckert and W. Streeck: Economic Sociology and Political Economy: A Programmatic Perspective |url=http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp08-4.pdf |access-date=24 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723125654/http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp08-4.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2013 }}</ref>

===Markets from a sociological perspective===
In his research cluster on the “Sociology of Markets,” Beckert focuses on “markets as the core institution of capitalist economies,” seeking “to understand the functioning of markets from a distinctively sociological perspective.” Analyzing markets “from a Weberian viewpoint as arenas of social struggle in which actors confront each other under conditions of competition,” he explores the “social, cultural, and political underpinnings for the development of the order of markets.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to "Sociology of Markets." Research Projects at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies |url=http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/projdetails_en.asp?ProjekteID=113 |access-date=24 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212141138/http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/projdetails_en.asp?ProjekteID=113 |archive-date=12 December 2007 }}</ref>

===Embeddedness of economic action===
“The problem of uncertainty market actors face when making decisions” is a key issue in Beckert’s research, which examines “the coordination problems market participants must cope with” – the problems of value, competition, and cooperation. “Uncertainty also provides a theoretical opening to explain the embeddedness of economic action.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to "Sociology of Markets." Research Projects at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies |url=http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/projdetails_en.asp?ProjekteID=113 |access-date=24 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212141138/http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/projdetails_en.asp?ProjekteID=113 |archive-date=12 December 2007 }}</ref>
