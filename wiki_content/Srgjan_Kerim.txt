==United Nations Secretary-General selection==
{{Main article|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 2016}}
Srgjan Kerim was nominated on 17 September 2015 by the Government of North Macedonia<ref>http://srgjankerim.com/candidacy.nspx</ref> and was the first candidate to officially put forward his name to be the next UN Secretary-General.  He has thus far proposed the following priorities for the UN:

'''• Priority 1: Democratic Governance and Reform of the UN'''

Democracy is the foundation of political stability. It is the main condition for national expression, justice and equality. And as such, it must be preserved as the sanctity of good governance. Opening new horizons means reforming the UN. It is a complex issue and therefore deserves our full attention, especially in the sphere of management reform.

In terms of UN accountability for the [[2010 Haiti cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak in Haiti]], Kerim emphasized the importance of the UN maintaining its authority and reputation by providing full reparations to cholera victims. He skirted UN responsibility for the outbreak by citing lack of organization and issues on the ground in places where the UN provides Peacekeeping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipinst.org/2016/06/unsg-candidate-srgjan-kerim|title=UN Secretary-General Candidate Srgjan Kerim Speaks at IPI|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref> 

On the topic of [[Child sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers|sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers]], the United States raised a question during UN Secretary General Candidate informal dialogues. Kerim responded to the question on ensuring transparency and accountability by saying that the future SG needs to be "stubborn and not let things go...If there is misunderstanding here and lack of trust here, you must be a trust-builder."<ref>http://webtv.un.org/search/srgjan-kerim-former-yugoslav-republic-of-macedonia-informal-dialogue-for-the-position-of-the-next-un-secretary-general/4846438948001?term=kerim</ref>

37 human rights organizations recently endorsed a UN Secretary General accountability pledge. This pledge asks the candidates to take action on two human rights violations that have tarnished the United Nations' image: failing to provide remedies for victims of cholera in Haiti, and sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers. <ref>http://www.codebluecampaign.com/press-releases/2016/7/27</ref> Kerim sent a message, responding to Aids Free World and the [[Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti]], in which he expressed his "full support for [their] initiative in promoting greater transparency and accountability within the UN system".<ref>http://www.codebluecampaign.com/press-releases/2016/8/1</ref> While he declined to sign onto the pledge, he did pledge to "continue striving for a stronger, more transparent, just, and accountable UN system."<ref>http://www.codebluecampaign.com/press-releases/2016/8/1</ref>

'''• Priority 2: Security'''

Security whether local, regional, or global is simply non-negotiable. It is essential for political equality, prosperity and peace. The significance of diplomatic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in achieving a safe world and preventing terrorism is unparalleled and as such it must be guarded ardently. Security ensures effective democratic processes and economic stability.

'''• Priority 3: Sustainable Development and Climate Change'''

Climate change is far more than just another environmental issue. It cuts across all sectors – energy, agriculture, security and trade. Climate change threatens markets, economies and developmental goals. It can deplete food and water supplies, provoke conflict and migration, destabilize fragile societies, and even topple governments. Is this mere exaggeration? Not to the hungry residents of northern Kenya or the increasingly careworn farmers of California. Not to the citizens of the Maldives, already wondering whether their homeland will be diminished by the ocean, or the millions of people living in the metropolitan areas. Not to the hundreds of millions of the world’s poorest who have little defense mechanism against the storms, floods and droughts that each year keep on intensifying in scope.

Addressing Climate Change and enhancement of Financing for Development (FfD) should always be among our top priorities. The nexus between these core issues is fundamental to implementing the post 2015 sustainable development agenda as an imperative for global cooperation and partnership.

'''• Priority 4: Gender Equality, Education and Citizen Participation'''

Instead of simply discussing gender equality, we need to take action in achieving gender consciousness and reaching a proportional equilibrium between men and women not only in the UN, but in all spheres of political, social, economic and cultural governance. Furthermore, the strive for achieving gender consciousness is intractably connected to education. If humanity can be overcome by an insatiable desire for knowledge we will have not only an informed and educated citizenry but conscious constituents ready for inclusion and participation in all social processes. As policy makers we must place health and education high on the political agenda and provide the necessary conditions that every individual contributes positively to society.

'''• Priority 5: Migration'''

In the contemporary world, the social phenomenon of mobility and relocation is referred to as migration. Nevertheless, misunderstandings and mutual disrespect between people who have planted roots in different nooks and crannies on this Earth stem from our ignorance of the fact that the entire history of mankind is one extensive and constant moving act, all in search of a better habitat.
