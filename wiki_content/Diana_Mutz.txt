According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Mutz explained that "evidence of voters politicizing personal economic hardship has been exceedingly rare," over many decades of studying the issue. She argued that contrary to the commonly held belief that economic hardship drive many people to vote for Donald Trump in 2016, Trump won the election because of the fear that "traditionally high-status Americans" such as whites, Christians and men, feel threatened that they will lose their privileged status to minorities if they are given a chance to succeed in American society.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Waldow|first=Julia|date=2018-04-27|title=What journalists got wrong about voters in the 2016 election|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/27/media/status-threat-diana-mutz-reliable-sources/index.html|access-date=2021-07-06|website=CNNMoney}}</ref>
